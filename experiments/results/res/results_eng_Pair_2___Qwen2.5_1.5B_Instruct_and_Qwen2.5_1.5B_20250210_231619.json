      "In September 2012, the European Commission published its long-awaited guidance on how to ensure that the EU's digital single market works, and more importantly, how to ensure that its citizens' rights and expectations under the EU's fundamental rights are safeguarded and preserved.\n\nDigital Single Market Strategy:\n\nThe guiding strategy for the adoption of the Digital Single Market Strategy (DSM) was adopted in October of that year. In that strategy, the European Commission set out three specific objectives:\n\nTo build a digital single market without barriers or discrimination. To deepen the convergence between the various sectors and to increase competition as much as possible. To improve digital access and use of the Union's citizens.\n\nAs an outcome of this strategy, the EU adopted the Telecoms Package which was approved by the European Parliament and Council in December 2014.\n\nThe first set of rules to regulate these matters was the Telecoms Package 2014, which came into force in October 2013. The second set of rules, the Digital Single Markets Package 2016, entered into force on 1 January 2017.\n\nThe rules adopted by both pieces of legislation are designed to create a single market where people and devices can connect as easily and cheaply as possible.\n\nThis digital single market will be underpinned by a digital single market act (SSLA), which applies to all EU countries, and other specific laws on online data protection, privacy and security.\n\nA key feature of the SSLA is that it establishes the principles that should be applied to the management of personal data by online businesses.\n\nThe SSLA defines what data that a business can process, collect and store. It also specifies the information that can be used, shared, provided or processed on its behalf.\n\nBy applying these principles, the SSLA has the potential to strengthen citizens' security and privacy online - particularly on mobile devices and online.\n\nDigital Single Market Strategy:\n\nThe digital single market strategy is built upon two underlying principles:\n\n1. A level playing field for online business and consumers\n\n2. Strong protections for the rights and integrity of European Union citizens\n\nTogether, these principles will give Europeans access to free and fair online services that are safe, secure, fair and easy to use.\n\nIn addition, the EU is pushing ahead to create new consumer protection rules to protect citizens from abusive, unfair and misleading commercial practices - and to ensure that any businesses wishing to engage in such activities must be fully transparent and justify their actions and benefits for new or existing customers.\n\nThe Digital Single Market Strategy:\n\nTo strengthen Europeans' online security and privacy\n\nThe EU has launched an ambitious plan to protect European citizens' data online by developing EU-wide data protection rules, creating an EU-wide approach to data protection for online businesses, and increasing transparency for consumers.\n\nThe Digital Single Market Strategy:",

      "By Robert Reich | (Informed Comment) | – –\n\nFor all the talk about the populist upsurge in Europe that culminated last weekend with elections in Austria, the Netherlands and Germany, the French election offers a reminder that Europe isn't going anywhere, is still in economic crisis and remains highly unstable.\n\nThe populist upsurge in Europe that culminated last weekend with elections in Austria, the Netherlands and Germany, the French election offers a reminder that Europe isn't going anywhere, is still in economic crisis and remains highly unstable.\n\nFrench and German voters have a lot in common politically — they're overwhelmingly pro-business, they're angry about immigration, they feel they're being left out and outnumbered at the table and they blame their governments for it. The leaders of these countries are also similar politically — each wants to re-negotiate the European treaties (as France did once, unsuccessfully, on the Greek crisis), and each has a long history of corruption that has dogged them in office.\n\nAll this, of course, has a dark side. Most French and German voters aren't happy with their governments. On the other hand, these voters are mostly well-educated, wealthy and urban, with a lot of patience, and they're not going to turn out en masse every single day until their grievances have been resolved. So all three leaders (France's François Hollande, Germany's Angela Merkel and, especially, German Chancellor Angela Merkel's) will want to find a way to keep the French and German people satisfied while taking stock of the country's problems and making changes that are possible.\n\nSo the new leaders in these governments — in the case of France, Hollande just got re-elected — will face a lot of hard choices. How should they deal with the unemployment and the joblessness among the young and the working poor? How do they reform the public debt and debt service that is crushing the middle class? How do they keep their countries growing at an above-average rate? There are obvious answers that everyone is comfortable with — cut costs to increase competitiveness and reform the labor market to get more people working more hours.\n\nThe fact is that the old way of thinking about the economy is outdated, and economic development is shifting ever more toward high-end manufacturing and services. This shift needs strong institutions to implement.\n\nAt the moment, there's no institution in Europe — and no institution in the United States — focused on the issues Europe faces, but that's beginning to change. There is an institution, a think tank founded by a Danish company and now under the banner of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), to support high-level discussions in Europe on economic and financial aspects. It's called the \"European Dialogue on Economic Systems,\" or EDES. As a think tank, EDES is not beholden to any political parties, or to the governments of any of the countries it works with.\n\nOn Monday, the German government will hold a second conference called the \"Euromodern Dialogue\" at the request of the British government to discuss the future of euro zone integration, and the future of the European Union itself. The British government has made clear its determination to get the United Kingdom out of the EU by any means possible. The German government can respond to Cameron's call for a referendum by offering one of its own.\n\nThe European Parliament is also looking into ways Europe is doing to create a better environment for companies doing business in Europe. It was already doing a lot more than anyone thought it would, including making it easier for German companies to sell their goods in the United Kingdom.\n\nThe European Commission, meanwhile, is in the process of developing a proposal to modernize the governance arrangements for the euro zone, to get it closer to the German model of federalism where every branch of government carries out its legislative function independently from the other branches. The Commission itself is also looking at proposals for a European savings directive and what an EU-like economic governance organization looking after the single market looks like, including who has authority to make decisions in each area and to hold people accountable for their actions.\n\nWhat they can't do is to simply wait for a situation to get so bad that people demand referendums. A lot of what ails Europe is structural, that countries haven't yet created a mechanism for collective action and the kind of self-government that would have been useful to a lot of Europe's economic development.\n\nThat's happening, and it's hard to see much of a road ahead. So it may come as a shock to some Europeans to learn that the European election is just an election, or at least only the beginning of one. Even so, the elections in these three countries offer a glimpse into where we could end up if we don't change the way the people of Europe understand what is actually going on in their government.",

      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption The UK's trade deficit with the rest of the EU reached more than £1bn in March, the third month-on-month rise in a row. Here's a look at the latest figures\n\nEurostat has revised up its estimate of the UK economy's current account deficit to £56bn for the first three months of the year.\n\nExports and imports of goods and services have both declined, while the UK's current account deficit as a proportion of GDP widened to 8.6%, from 7.7% a month earlier.\n\nLast month, the UK's current account deficit was £6bn.\n\nSeparate figures showed the UK's industrial output fell by 0.5% in March, a fall blamed on a shortage of raw materials.\n\nAccording to the ONS, the weaker output was in the manufacturing industry and the chemical and plastics sectors.\n\nMeanwhile, the UK's services sector expanded by 0.2% in March, while business conditions rose at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 2.5%.\n\nThe UK's economic performance is expected to be among the weakest in the G7 group of industrialised countries in 2015, with the country's current account deficit expected to surpass the Eurozone's 1.4% of GDP target.\n\n\"The weakness in the third quarter of the year was due, in part, to the weaker underlying labour markets in the UK,\" said Chris Williamson, chief economist at Markit.\n\n\"Growth in the UK economy will rebound in coming months as more household consumption and more business investment returns, in line with the government's pledge to create a million new jobs by the end of the decade.\"\n\nAnalysis\n\nImage copyright Getty Images\n\nBy Robert Peston, Economics Editor\n\nThis may be the best news the chancellor will hear from the official economic forecasters today: they are predicting growth of 2%, or 2% plus one.\n\nThis represents a big step up on the economy's growth forecast in the Budget, though it's more than offset by the fact that it's the first economic prediction made of the post-election period by anyone other than the Bank.\n\nThe big question is why are we doing this. Will there be any growth? Will there be any jobs? Or, as the chancellor himself has been warning for six months now, will this prove a \"once-in-five-years\" period when it will be all downhill from here?\n\nIf he succeeds in getting the deficit below the target by 2017, though, the first two years will mark something of a turning point for public finances. And any further deterioration would mean a long and painful period of cutbacks in government spending.\n\nSo, it must be said, as Mr Osborne begins to turn up the heat on his colleagues, there is a certain desperation to his approach.\n\nIt's what he's done in the past to force through tax cuts, to use the threat of recession to push through a second budget, and now this. If he fails to get it down to the new fiscal target of 2% in the second half of this parliament, then there would be serious consequences for Mr Osborne's credibility with voters and other political opponents.",
      "I have been reading through some of the comments on this article, and they have provided two very different perspectives on the subject. In one corner, people are being \"censored\" by the lack of the word 'Jew.' In the other corner, people have somehow \"winn[ed] the debate\" with their \"open discourse.\"\n\nWhat I want to emphasize is that you need both perspectives in order to properly understand why the use of the term 'Jew' is so controversial for some. So let's get back to that important distinction:\n\nWhen you consider something with respect to itself, i.e. \"Jews are good\" vs \"Jews are bad,\" you are making a moral judgment based on your personal opinion. When you consider an entire group of people with regard to themselves, i.e. \"Jews are good,\" or \"Jews are bad,\" you are making a societal judgment based on society as a whole. When you consider a society that engages in discriminatory behavior, i.e. \"the Jews, Jews, Jews\" vs. \"The rest of the people,\" you are making a moral judgment based on a moral judgment, i.e. the \"rules of engagement\" of the society in question.\n\nAnd, of course, when you consider the issue in terms of both perspectives at the same time, \"the Jewish community\" becomes very significant.\n\nThe problem is, \"The Jewish community\" is not well defined. Is it the large umbrella term that includes those who are Jewish-oriented, or is it a smaller group that includes those who practice, educate, and/or work within the Jewish community?\n\nWhen we consider society as a whole, \"The people who practice, educate, and work in the Jewish community\" are the ones most strongly affected by the behavior of those who are not Jewish-oriented, and if the behavior of the remaining portion of the Jewish population is not deemed \"good,\" they will find themselves in a very precarious position.\n\nThe fact that the people who are not Jewish-oriented are not aware of this reality is one of the worst things that can happen to them as a people.\n\nI think we all have seen the stories of what happens when someone is not Jewish-oriented and it happens to them. When someone is not Jewish-oriented, they don't realize that what is happening to them is happening to them too; they also don't realize that they, as an individual, aren't the only one in the world who is being impacted in that manner.\n\nIn their heart of hearts, most people recognize that they are impacted in a similar manner as the people who are not Jewish-oriented, and that is not too much to ask.\n\nHowever, because the Jewish community is an important part of our lives as Jews, we want to help those who aren't Jewish-oriented as much as possible. To a certain extent, this is understandable – if the people who are not Jewish-oriented feel that they are invisible and are left out, it feels like they have nothing to lose – they will have less incentive to complain, if the reason they are being left out is because they are not Jewish-oriented. But that is not a very constructive outcome.\n\nIn reality, when the people who aren't Jewish-oriented find that they are not being left out at all, all the other Jews in the world feel like shit, because they can't do anything but blame the people who aren't Jewish-oriented for everything that goes wrong under their watch.\n\nSo, rather than a constructive outcome, \"The Jewish community\" becomes the thing that contributes to the feeling of injustice in the first place.\n\nBy definition, Jewish-oriented means \"not Jewish-oriented\" since it is the only designation the vast majority of Jews would apply to themselves. If most people only saw themselves as Jewish-oriented, there would be no need for the term Jewish community in the first place, just as there would be no need for \"LGBT\" if everyone only saw themselves as straight – no one would feel bad for not being gay, they could simply pretend that they were straight.\n\nOn a more practical level, the use of the term 'Jewish community' can also lead to a sense of superiority on the part of all Jews to the people who are not Jewish-oriented. I've seen several discussions on the Internet, in which some Jewish women have asked when they are going to get married and be the \"first\" and most \"Jewish\" to ever get married.\n\nOn a practical level, we have the problem of defining Jewish-orientedness in ways which are palatable to the Jews who are not Jewish-oriented. The term \"Jewish community,\" therefore, is a label that can be applied to a small number of individuals in a particular geographical area who have decided to make it their primary calling, which they believe will be beneficial to the people under their care.\n\nFor this reason, I think it important for us, as a",
      "(Adds latest comments)\n\nBEIJING, July 20 (Reuters) - Chinese President Xi Jinping called on the United States to stop its \"blackmail\" against China and its companies, including those in the energy and cyber sectors, China's Xinhua news agency said on Sunday.\n\n\"China believes that a country that has shown a total lack of respect for the other should stop engaging in 'blackmail',\" Xinhua quoted Xi as saying. It quoted him as saying, \"We urge the United States to put an end to its behaviour\".\n\nChina's energy, military and telecommunications sectors have been targeted by U.S. officials and a series of U.S. economic sanctions since Xi assumed office after assuming the presidency in March, although the Trump administration has since suspended some of these measures.\n\nThe United States has been under pressure from some politicians in Washington and from business groups to apply more diplomatic pressure on Beijing, but Xi was clear in his remarks that economic pressure against Beijing and its companies came first as a diplomatic tool should be used in conjunction.\n\n\"China does not intend to be bullied by anyone, and China has made clear that it resolutely opposes all forms of coercion on our side. China's energy sector is an important source of our economic growth,\" Xinhua said, citing the president.\n\nThe Chinese leader said the West had become too easily influenced by political interests, and China was determined not to be a victim of what it said were \"tactical manoeuvres aimed at making China a victim of geopolitical rivals\"\n\nXi said he hoped the United States and the EU would work together to ensure global prosperity and global security.",
      "In a new ad released by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), Rep. Tim Ryan, D-Ohio, makes the case that Democrats should keep the House majority in 2016. However, his efforts are undercut by his association that is heavily favored to be a 2016 congressional candidate (if not the Senate seat, which is more likely due to incumbent Republican John Thune's retirement).\n\nWith a poll in the works showing the two candidates in a dead heat and Ryan's re-election campaign already having raised roughly $2 million, it is not surprising to see DCCC continue to back Rep. Ryan. However, the ad is a clear signal that they are looking at two House races they may do well in, both of which are considered outside of reach for Democrats.\n\nSpecifically, the DCCC wants to see Ryan in his northern Ohio's 9th District and Rep. Pat Meehan's 11th District in southwestern Pennsylvania. The seat the DCCC wants Ryan to win is represented by Rep. Marcy Kaptur, a Democrat who has been targeted by Republican groups. She was re-elected by a wide margin, and has been a vocal critic of House Republicans' approach to Obamacare which resulted in a major setback for the party in 2014.\n\nAnother key seat the DCCC wants to be competitive in is that of Rep. John Delaney, D-Maryland. Delaney has a solid, progressive voting record, which includes work on immigration and gun control. However, he also has some deep pockets and has been heavily backed by national Democratic groups to get ahead of Rep. Joe Wilson, R-North Carolina, who famously disrupted President Obama's State of the Union speech by yelling \"You lie!\" The Republican primary is currently slated to take place in just 15 days and is expected to be a huge test on Delaney's strength.\n\nThe DCCC is also trying to make inroads in the seat of Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick, who was narrowly elected to the seat in 2014 and is running again. Both women will face primary challenges from Republicans, but Kirkpatrick is likely to have more money in a district with a higher population, while the DCCC will have the more formidable candidate in its sights.",

      "HUNTSVILLE, Alabama -- The city and county of Huntsville have agreed to pay more than $300,000 in fines for a series of traffic tickets issued to dozens of motorists who were illegally driving without proper insurance, authorities report.\n\nIn late May, the state Department of Public Safety (DPS) warned local police to stop issuing tickets to uninsured drivers, although they hadn't been aware of the fines. When the city and county police stopped issuing the tickets, DPS asked them to hand over the fines, but the city and county refused to turn over the money, officials said.\n\nAs of June 30, Huntsville police had issued 6,000 tickets for violation of the Alabama uninsured drivers law. The city and County of Huntsville will pay $280 each to each person who received a ticket from May 1 to June 30, according to state records.\n\nThe city and County of Huntsville will pay $250 each to each person who received a ticket from May 1 to May 31, which means they will be paying $1.5 million for the fine.\n\nThe city and County of Huntsville also will pay $500 each for tickets that were issued between June 1 to June 30, the records show. The city will turn over $250 and the County of Huntsville will pay $500.\n\nThe DPS has a policy of not enforcing civil insurance violations unless the violator commits another civil wrong, officials said. \"This case involves a violation of state law\" that does not comply with the policy's requirement that other laws be violated first, according to the release issued Monday.\n\n\"We are pleased that these cases have been dismissed and that we have not had to pay these fines and that we have resolved the matter amicably as well,\" City Attorney James Womack said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nOn Wednesday, DPS said Huntsville did not violate its own civil insurance law because the city does not deny driver's licenses to people whose coverage lapses.\n\n\"It's no longer a question for the DPS, they've reached their limit with this one policy,\" DPS spokesman Bill Gwyn said.\n\nThe case also stems from a state law passed in 2008 that prevents cities and counties from charging for the \"collateral\" of insurance, such as traffic violations or speeding tickets. The law has been in effect since June 2008.\n\nHuntsville, a town of about 62,000, is one of only nine cities with such a charge. The others are Fairfield (a Montgomery County town of about 7,000 where drivers pay a ticket for $50, and the suburb of Birmingham with 1.7 million), Huntsville (a city of about 64,000 with a separate civil liability ordinance), Bessemer (population 9,000), Decatur (a Birmingham suburb of about 1.3 million with a separate traffic ordinance), Huntsville (an Auburn-area city of about 64,000), Phenix City (a Birmingham suburb of about 3.8 million with a separate law requiring motorists to use insurance), and Tuscaloosa (a city of about 95,000 with a separate civil liability ordinance).\n\nThe Alabama Highway Safety Office (AHSO) was also not notified of the city's policy.\n\n\"We don't have information on any violations of state laws that this individual was allegedly caught breaking,\" AHSO Chief Deputy Director Scott Waco said Tuesday. \"We don't know of any violations that he was caught breaking until we received their response letter a couple weeks ago.\"\n\nThe city notified AHSO of an uninsured drivers violation on May 22, shortly after it received a letter from the insurer, Insurance Service Agency Inc., warning them about the violation.\n\n\"At that time, we learned that the vehicle had failed its inspection,\" Waco said. \"There was a violation on the car.\"\n\nAfter learning that the city issued thousands of its own citations, Huntsville issued a letter to the city saying it would no longer give out civil citations.\n\n\"We wrote off about 300 of the tickets at that time,\" he said. \"But the rest of the tickets were still going out on our street.\"\n\nThe issue with the tickets was that motorists who do not have coverage on their vehicle when they are pulled over must carry a valid insurance card. \"It appears you've got a policy that's out of date,\" another Huntsville officer said to a driver in June.\n\nThe policy had lapsed between 2008 and 2013, so the tickets were invalid, officials said. Under a civil procedure, drivers who received the tickets could have fought the citations in municipal court or filed a notice of lien against the vehicle, but neither option was available at this point, Womack said.",

We'll have live coverage, including a live blog.\n\n2) Trump will have the last opportunity of the election with a prime-time speech at the Hilton Midtown, 11:35 p.m. EST, which will be the last opportunity for Trump to speak directly to the American public on his last day of campaigning before Election Day.\n\n3) Clinton will give a prime-time speech at the New Yorker Hotel at 6 p.m. EST. It should feature an opening statement from her about the reasons why voters sent her to the White House, campaign finance reform, the importance of women's rights and other campaign-trail notes. It should also include an acceptance speech featuring a speech in which she acknowledges the results of the election and calls on the country to go forward.\n\n4) Afterward, she will leave for her first post-election event, a victory party with President Obama in Washington, D.C. She will not hold any press conference afterward.\n\n5) Vice President-elect Mike Pence will hold two campaign events in Philadelphia on Saturday, Dec. 16, at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. Each will feature two presidential contenders, the first to leave is Republican Sen. John McCain, who has announced that he's endorsing Pence, and Pence will introduce him.\n\n6) Clinton will campaign in Greensboro, North Carolina, on Sunday, Dec. 17, to benefit the Children's Defense Fund, which is helping families in need. It's a last-minute swing in from Raleigh, the state's biggest city. Clinton will also visit the state for a 7:30 p.m. address in Winston-Salem, where she said she was \"proud\" of the work she's done to advance rights for women and minorities.\n\n7) The Clinton campaign will continue to take on Trump through the holidays with campaign rallies in Nevada, North Carolina and Florida. At a rally in Reno on Saturday, Nov. 27, campaign chair John Podesta said Clinton \"is grateful to our extraordinary volunteers\" and \"will be out there campaigning as long as it takes to win this election for our country.\"\n\n8) Trump will hold two rallies in the state of New Hampshire on Monday, Dec. 18. On Tuesday, Dec. 19, he will hold a rally in Concord, NH at 7:30 p.m. PT and a rally at the University of New Hampshire, at 7:15 p.m. in Durham, NH.\n\n9) Vice President-elect Mike Pence, who's been in touch regularly with the Clinton transition team, will return to New York for a Tuesday night rally in Brooklyn, followed by a Wednesday morning rally at the Trump Tower.\n\n10) There will be a news conference on Wednesday night for all the presidential candidates at the Long Island Fairplex in Hempstead, NY, where they'll hold their second round of debates with the moderators of each of the five debates. Those debates are in Boulder, CO; Manchester, NH; Cleveland, OH; St. Louis, MO and Las Vegas on Oct. 9, Oct. 19, Oct. 26 and Oct. 30.

      "[A version of this story appears in the Oct 3, 2016, issue of Sports Illustrated.]\n\nI'm a little surprised to see the Dodgers on the top of this list—they've had so many injuries to starters and bullpen arms recently—but it really comes down to numbers when you compare all 30 of the teams that will play in 2016 to last year's top 10. The Dodgers are a far more improved team. They finished 12th in ERA, second in strikeouts and fourth in batting average (.272). They led the NL in all the major categories except home field, when they were second behind the Giants. They also topped all 30 teams in wins, wins above replacement and wins percentage, as measured by baseball-reference.com.\n\nBut it's not just numbers that make this group special; it's the way they got there. The Cubs are a good reminder that the Dodgers shouldn't be written off in 2016. They didn't improve at all from 2015 by any significant measure while winning 90+ games—and they still had Clayton Kershaw at the start of the year. They don't have the Dodgers' pitching staff, but while Jake Marisnick and Chris Taylor both missed parts of last season with injuries, they made an impact after returning to the lineup, Marisnick hitting .288 with 11 homers, seven doubles and 34 RBI in the second half.\n\n\"We weren't healthy all the way through last year, but the guys that are healthy, the guys that played the whole year, played great,\" manager Dave Roberts said. \"That gives you the opportunity to try to bring those guys back next year. The guys that haven't really given us a chance all spring have to come into camp ready to play, and everybody got to feel a little bit of confidence.\"\n\nThe Dodgers will have to do that to repeat as champions. The pitching staff—which includes Zack Greinke, Kenta Maeda, Alex Wood and Hyun-Jin Ryu—is one reason for their big improvement, but they still won a little less than half the games they had in 2015 and ranked 17th in team ERA. They don't have the depth or the pitching depth to compensate for that, and for all the reasons above, they likely won't repeat as champions. But they have the chance to be a great team—and a great team is worth celebrating.\n\nFor more baseball news, rumors and analysis, follow @EyeOnBaseball on Twitter, subscribe to the RSS feed and \"like\" us on Facebook.",
      "Kenny Hill is one of the greatest runners, and perhaps the greatest running coach, to ever coach. He was an athlete himself before he ever heard the word \"intervention.\" Hill is a master motivator and a man who has been a mentor for hundreds of athletes, working to bring them the best training and nutrition. But that's just the beginning. His \"unsung heroes\" series offers a different type of approach, based on the concept of true believers in a single purpose.\n\nHis first book, \"The Road to True Self-Confidence,\" outlines the five areas of one's life that make up who we are. These areas are:\n\nThe Self (The one at the top)\n\nFamily (The second tier)\n\nFriends (The other two tiers)\n\nWork (The lower tier)\n\nSociety (Top tier)\n\nIn the book, he explains his thinking behind the concept of each layer, and provides examples of how certain choices in each layer create problems in the other five. A strong self is essential to having a successful career -- but it's also crucial to being happy in your life.\n\n\"I see that people who focus only on the negative end of life, their lives, their careers and relationships, and on how bad they are, can never learn to love themselves. They don't know how to love themselves without being focused on what's negative in their lives,\" Hill says. \"The solution is not to stop worrying -- it's to make the most of all the positive opportunities you have for living.\"\n\nHere are five of his examples to follow:",
      "We may be about to go back to the dark ages once again.\n\nThe Trump administration is moving forward with plans to slash the United States Environmental Protection Agency's budget by 31 percent, according to an internal memo obtained by The Associated Press. Under Trump's plan, the EPA would suffer a nearly $8 billion cut.\n\nThe EPA currently employs about 25,000 employees and has been subject of intense criticism from environmentalists since it was created under the Obama administration in 1970. Trump vowed to shrink the federal government, but his administration has repeatedly delayed some of the EPA's regulations.\n\nThe EPA said Wednesday that this proposed budget will not come to fruition and that it would only seek a 5.8 percent cut. But agency officials told the AP that some programs would be shifted to other agencies and that the administration is considering ending a \"greatest hits\" program that has helped clean up historic sites.\n\nEPA chief Scott Pruitt will unveil the budget request to his staff Wednesday afternoon. The AP's Andrew Taylor says the proposed EPA budget includes a number of other cuts and it would be the largest cut to the agency under Trump's tenure, if approved.\n\nThe budget will be submitted at the same time as Trump's second budget proposal — or a preliminary one — which will include a number of proposals. Those plans are expected to be released at either their end of year or later for this year.\n\n\"We're very much going to follow through on the President's promise to reduce the size of government,\" Pruitt said in a statement. \"We will be slashing government regulations and we will be asking our most effective and courageous officials to lead the way, not retreat behind outdated structures and procedures.\"\n\nTrump and his advisers have made eliminating regulations a priority.\n\n\"There are many people that feel like the EPA's gone too far and in many ways it has,\" President Donald Trump said in a speech on Tuesday. \"We'll be trimming down on red tape, and many people are saying that's terrible, and you're killing jobs, and frankly that's a very unfair accusation to make about any agency.\"\n\n\"Many of the rules and regulations were put in place with little regard for environmental effects. We're the only big country that's not protecting the environment in exactly the way that we should be,\" he added.\n\n\"The Environmental Protection Agency has become a special interest group that spends very little time on policymaking,\" Trump said. \"Instead it devotes enormous time and money pursuing a radical political agenda that ignores the will of the American people — instead of protecting the environment for future generations.\"\n\nTrump said some of the EPA's budget cuts will come by slashing research and development into alternative energy technologies and cutting the department's funding for climate change research. The budget would increase the Justice Department's budget by 14 percent as it would increase funding for border security and immigration enforcement.\n\n\"We're going to end the war on coal,\" Trump said Monday. \"The war on coal is not a war at all. In fact, it's a scam done by the Obama administration and the Democrats and by industry to mislead the people. When we're able to put all these people to work, we are going to have so many beautiful, beautiful mines.\"\n\nThe AP described the proposed cuts to the EPA as \"unprecedented: It would slash the agency's workforce by more than two-thirds; scrap or reduce programs targeted at environmental regulations; and eliminate or reduce several of the government's main tools to combat climate change.\"\n\nThere are many ways the EPA falls short of its mandates and goals.\n\nThere are more than 4,500 EPA scientists and staffers working full time to investigate air and water pollution, protect drinking water systems, and monitor air quality.\n\nSome of the EPA's recent initiatives, like a 2016 rule requiring power plants to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, had been highly controversial, despite the fact the Obama administration had signed the regulations into law in 2015.\n\nIn early April the EPA announced an interim rule on ozone pollution from power plants. The rule, which was designed to help the nation's power plants comply with air quality standards that were tightened under President Obama, would only take effect from 2018.\n\nThe EPA proposed in January a final rule on fracking, which many Democrats and activists believe causes drinking water contamination along with air pollution.\n\nFollow Michael on Facebook and Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "The FBI has an entire program based in Austin, that can track just about anyone. In fact, nearly anyone can be a subject of a FBI investigation, no matter what his or her profession is. And it's only going to get easier from here.\n\nIn the past month, the nation has learned about an apparent case of domestic terrorism in Oregon. We have learned the FBI is using Stingray phones and drones to monitor \"lone wolf\" terrorists.\n\nWe have learned that the FBI has been monitoring the phone calls, text messages, and Internet usage of thousands of people in the US since at least 2008.\n\nBut most disturbing are the revelations that the FBI has a database of 2.3 billion records of telephone calls and two billion records of Internet users, a database that can be searched in realtime and is constantly being updated, according to USA Today.\n\nAll of that has been done by a few dozen people in the Bureau's counterterrorism division located in a nondescript building in suburban Austin, a building that once housed the Counterintelligence Division, which investigated organized crime and foreign intelligence.\n\nThe FBI's own website claims, \"Tremendously difficult\" terrorist activity is being prevented by the program and that it has already led to more than 10,000 arrests across the world.\n\nYet there are serious constitutional questions raised by its existence and what it means to the American people.\n\nWho owns this database? What is the government doing with it? And, most chilling and least understood, what does it mean for Americans to think that they are being watched?\n\nThis is the kind of surveillance that the Founding Fathers had in mind.\n\nThis surveillance was originally considered a private matter. But now that terrorists have been able to buy and buy military-grade gear and tactics, the government has expanded its interest in our data and how we conduct our lives.\n\nThe FBI has been pushing hard for the creation of a so-called \"Terrorism Information Awareness\" database in the wake of the 9/11 attacks. The Bureau wants to collect everything — online and offline — about us so that it can predict, prevent, and prosecute terrorists before they plot an attack on America.\n\nIt wants to collect our movements, conversations, text messages, and Internet web browsing history so that it has information about the places we will visit, the books we will read, and the political, religious, and scientific views we may hold.\n\nTo implement this, the Bureau has teamed up with AT&T to develop a system that allows the government to tap into our cellphones, including cellphones connected to service providers like Verizon and Sprint. The program is called Hemisphere.\n\nAccording to an official announcement from the U.S. Department of Justice, \"Hemisphere allows law enforcement access to cell-site location information and digital communications through its use of a court order.\"\n\nThis is no mere fishing expedition. The FBI's Hemisphere program is now being used by local, state, and federal law enforcement agencies to gather the data and information about ordinary people who are not suspected of wrongdoing. This includes ordinary Americans who do not carry a criminal record or are not suspected of doing something criminal. They might not even be suspected of a crime.\n\nAs an example, an Ohio woman was charged with \"aiding the enemy.\" But according to the criminal complaint, no evidence was ever presented to show that the woman had been communicating with Osama bin Laden. It was the FBI's Hemisphere database that revealed who called whom, when, and for how long.\n\nWhat the government is doing with this data is unprecedented.\n\nIn 2009, the Supreme Court ruled that the police can't use GPS devices to track a vehicle without a warrant except in certain very narrow circumstances. Even without this ruling, it's troubling that many police departments still have their own cellphone tracking devices. In 2013, an Oklahoma man was detained for 20 hours when the police found a police-controlled GPS tracking device in his car.\n\nAccording to the ACLU, police have seized hundreds of thousands of people's cellphones and tracked locations of them using mobile devices, without a warrant.\n\nAt the Center for Constitutional Rights, Brendan Schulman tells AlterNet, \"For the government, a cellphone is a treasure trove of information.\" He noted that in 2011, the government had to apologize for spying on tens of thousands of U.S. cellphones it claimed were linked to terrorism.\n\nSchulman explained, \"This is the same government that just four years ago had to apologize for spying on people. This same government is now spying on everyday people, searching their personal content without a warrant.\"\n\nWhy is it so important to keep the government off of our phones? Because it can easily be used against us in court. And it is.\n\nThe ACLU's Schulman points out that the FBI has a secret database it uses to search for \"lone wolf\" terrorists — people who have not shown any connection to any known",
      "There is no better example of this than the game.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, the World Health Organization released their publication, Preventative Medications for Children with Autism.\n\nI've linked many times to that article, but just in case you haven't heard of it: that's the world's leading organization for what they call \"preventive medications\". They provide an invaluable resource to the medical community in deciding what to do with children. It's a valuable document, as they were able to determine a substantial amount of information on what can actually be done to help children who are having symptoms of autism spectrum disorder, including how to intervene.\n\nHere's their report, as quoted directly:\n\nIn the mid-1990s , The World Health Organization, a branch of the World Health Organization ( WHO ), produced guidelines that identified specific behavioral markers. This work was undertaken to identify children likely to develop early-onset autism and/or autism spectrum disorder (ASD). In its early stages, the WHO reports were based on clinical case reports. However, over the years, research studies conducted worldwide have confirmed the importance of early-onset, but also \"overlapping\" diagnostic patterns among autistic children and have demonstrated a substantial overlap of many of the diagnostic characteristics between children who develop autism and have ASDs. In the current report, the researchers use a combination of clinical cases and scientific method to identify diagnostic markers; using this approach, they have highlighted 10 potential behavioral markers, based on the following:\n\nAs you can probably gather, that \"WHO\" report and the research it represents are a treasure trove of information, including what can actually be done to help people who are exhibiting symptoms of autism.\n\nSo much so, that the article has been referenced by Autism Speaks, The American Academy of Pediatrics, and more.\n\nYet, in the last 20 years, a lot of that information, most notably the WHO report, and a lot of the information presented through the work of researchers have been discarded in favor of the autism narrative. That is, to say that autism is an innate and unavoidable characteristic, which can be diagnosed through a series of diagnostic markers, which then guide our behavior and actions, which lead to the development of autism.\n\nIt's a great story, and that's what people need to be making a point of noting now. You can watch a video about it here:\n\nBut in order to tell it the way it needs to be told, it needs to be told in a proper scientific context, and that context has been lost over time, and we need to see it that way.\n\nThe Autism Media Channel is in a position to do just that, and they've done a remarkable job of presenting it in a way that respects both the data and the story behind it.\n\nThe \"disease mongers\" have their story, and that narrative needs to be told.",
      "It's that time again, dear readers! And, no, I'm not referring to the season 2 trailer or anything of that sort. I'm talking about The Best Damn Barbecue on the Planet , a cookbook-y project by James D'Amato and Michael Ruhlman that will be available for purchase later this month, and it's going to be really freaking fantastic.I am the first to admit that I have no idea what barbecue is beyond it being something that is cooked over a fire. I've seen the show a few times, and have heard of some things. I think it's safe to say that it goes beyond that though!The author/photographer/artist team were kind enough to give me the opportunity to review a copy of their book. As expected, the contents are extremely detailed, and offer a thorough and well-researched primer of the subject.The author and the photographer had a really difficult time finding out where and how to shoot photographs at famous barbecue joints, as none of them wanted to put up any sort of public information. They did find out where they could find some information online by asking the staff/management of individual restaurants. There were some restaurants that they didn't even attempt in order to save themselves from a long and fruitless line. Some are locations where they were unable to shoot at all, because the location manager wasn't interested in having them shoot. The locations were all listed in my favorite guidebook of all time, The Road Warrior's Companion: 50 Years of Guidebooks and Travel Guides . I'm sure they were very pleased with themselves that the book was named #1 on their list of favorite BBQ guides!The author really does provide a good amount of information with just a few photographs, and there is much more where that came from and it's clear that James didn't waste anyone's time. In fact, I'd say this is one of the most detailed and well-researched cookbooks I have ever read, with not a single page not devoted purely to explaining a single concept or technique, and it's hard not to be impressed. James' approach to photography is pretty innovative, and very, very interesting. You can see here why he's called \"The New Southern BBQ Master.\" I love how he uses very low-light and close-up photography to highlight what I thought was the most important, yet usually neglected, aspect of a BBQ cookware, the metal griddle. He doesn't shy away from using a lot of long exposures, and he really emphasizes the need to know what is going on under that lid, especially under those wet barbecue pits.I don't like when cookbooks include recipes or give away too many secrets. That's not how I roll. I like being able to tell someone, \"Hey! I've been thinking about this for a while, and I actually want to make it myself.\" There are many times where I'd rather just cook something for myself and have someone else do the cooking on the fly. James D'Amato does that, in my eyes, and does it on a large scale. His approach to photography also makes this book the best resource that anyone would ever need for their backyard grills. I'm certain that James and Ruhlman will be very proud at the amount they were able to pull off for this project.I'm sure that I'm going to become addicted to reading about the best BBQ in the world. I'm still kind of shocked at how much I really enjoyed it. I've also been told that the cover makes me look like the Incredible Hulk...which is a compliment coming from a photographer that just recently became a father. I think this is something that I don't think the author's meant to be, but it's still very cool, and has definitely helped my appetite and desire to find more barbecue in my area.The book is currently on discount on Amazon as an eBook . You can get it via their website , but be aware that Amazon takes a couple of weeks to update things. This is where the book was made available as an eBook.",
      "Somalia's President Ismail Omar Guelleh has announced that he wants to close the country's border with Somaliland, making it a \"safe haven.\"\n\n\"I announce the closure of the border with Somalia to both Somaliland and Somaliland's state,\" Guelleh said from Mogadishu, according to Radio Dalsan. \"This border would help in dealing with the migration in that direction, as well as protecting our own country from terrorist attacks.\"\n\nGuelleh said Somaliland's ruler and former Prime Minister Abdi Farah Shirdon would welcome the initiative, but added they would not negotiate about it.\n\nA separate statement from Somaliland's deputy prime minister Salah Abdi told the BBC that Somaliland would \"never\" accept the border closure.\n\nThe idea for a possible border shutdown comes after months of negotiations between Somalia's political parties.\n\nSomaliland, an autonomous region of Somalia, has been a thorn in the colonialist-backed Somali government's side since Somalia's secession in 1991. The area claims it is the rightful heir to Somaliland after the loss of the country of its territory.\n\nBut the international community sees it as a terrorist hub, as many Al-Shabab elements operate on both sides of the border, and their presence has led to a growing number of casualties for Somalia's forces and international peacekeepers.\n\nThe idea of a possible border closure has been discussed since June, when a delegation from Somaliland visited the country's parliament with offers for the border to be closed.\n\nThe government, however, has rejected their proposals, and they said the Somali government also refused to discuss the move.\n\nThe Somali president was asked about the prospect of a closure on Sunday, and replied that it is not feasible.\n\n\"The border area in question is the southern parts of the Republic of Somaliland,\" he said. \"Even the government did not accept the proposal that it should be closed.\"\n\nThe border between the two sides, which is only 762 square kilometers (330 square miles), is one of the most violent parts in Somalia and has claimed more than 3,500 lives, according to the Associated Press.",

      "The United Nations has the greatest potential for innovation and human progress in living memory. It is a \"force for good\" in areas of global health and development. But with climate change and poverty in the news so often these days, the U.N. is having a hard time drawing in young activists, and that is not good! If you're not a teenager, that is not a problem. The U.N. does it anyway and you can get involved in the community. In fact, one thing is certain: you can make a major difference by attending a U.N. conference or program!\n\nThere are a few things you must do if you want to be an informed and active organizer for the U.N.'s youth agenda:\n\n\nTake the U.N. to task!\n\nU.N. Youth has many good ideas that would benefit all of us, so take the U.N. to task and tell them what we think is wrong, how we think this can be better, and who can lead us toward a brighter tomorrow. We have the best intentions in the world. Don't let them be our undoing.\n\nSupport the U.N., not the U.N.\n\nThe U.N. has been around for a long time. There have been a hostof important projects over the past six decades. It doesn't have to be the \"us\" versus \"them\" argument that U.N. and U.S. culture often is. The U.N. has many good ideas – but to get them adopted on a global scale requires time and resources. So if you are the kind of person who thinks: how do I help the U.N.? Let me suggest a couple possibilities!\n\nFor U.N. youth: Join a youth summit or an intergovernmental committee\n\nI know this is a tough one for many to take. Many young people don't like the U.N. and don't believe it can help solve world problems. But it's important that we talk about the problems. The U.N. has a long track record of trying to solve the world's problems. We will need to start talking seriously about what we can do differently.\n\nFor government leaders: Get them to stop doing U.N. business!\n\nHow many times have you heard the U.S. government say: \"We are not a U.N. organization,\" or: it's good as it is? When it comes to the U.N., though, the opposite statement is true. The U.N. is the U.S.'s biggest global organization. We can never stop cooperating with U.N. activities. But the truth is that we need to stop doing anything the U.N. does, or at least to stop doing everything the U.N. does.\n\nGet involved as a U.N. youth ambassador\n\nHere's an opportunity that is rarely available – but when it is, it can be the right thing to do: have a talk with a U.N. leader! Don't expect to change anyone's mind. Just make a point. Tell them if they don't listen to this, they are not on the right path, and hopefully one day those leaders will listen to you.\n\nFor journalists: Ask: What do you think?\n\nMany people have the impression that reporters who cover the U.N. are \"unbiased.\" That is not true. I have met so many biased reporters. Many are part of the very same problem the U.N. is trying to address: the fact that journalists, like policymakers, need to get more information. So try to ask some questions – about the issues themselves, why people think they are important, and whether there are other ways that people can help.\n\nFor social scientists and activists: Join a U.N. research project!\n\nIf you think you might want to change things, you can join a U.N. study. Many people talk about this as if it were a way to get into research at top universities. And indeed, many do. But it is just getting through the first month of your program that will get you funded and into the next year's program. There are many options for study abroad, ranging from two weeks to a year in a host country's library or working in a local field station.\n\nFor governments, academics, and NGOs: Make a budget request!\n\nThe best ideas are often implemented only after they are implemented. So when it comes time to propose your own projects, ask for funding. Don't be discouraged, because there is a lot of money involved.\n\nFor the U.N. to continue to be relevant and help us solve problems in the world it is essential that more and more young people recognize the potential of the U.N.\n\nHere are some ways to be heard:\n\nWrite a letter to the editor (or submit your own op",

      "The city of Dallas is taking a more assertive role against protesters. (AP Photo/LM Otero, File)\n\nDALLAS (AP) — The city of Dallas is taken aback by the escalating number of demonstrations this summer, says Mayor Mike Rawlings.\n\nOn Sunday, a group of about 20 protesters stood outside Dallas's downtown police station, blocking traffic and marching, chanting and singing \"this is what democracy looks like.\"\n\nThe city has already taken several measures during its two nights of demonstrations this month in which the city has taken responsibility for policing the demonstrations rather than the police — a shift that seems to be taking a toll on organizers.\n\nRawlings said Tuesday afternoon there had been \"a handful of things\" that he found to be \"unbelievable.\"\n\n\"I am saddened and disappointed that the city would choose to do this to its citizens,\" Rawlings said. \"This is not how we run a democracy.\"\n\nRawlings said the city is willing to work with protesters until \"the violence stops.\"\n\nThe mayor said his office is working with the Dallas city manager, police chief, police union and protesters \"to try to find solutions\" to the protests. He added: \"My view is that there is a level of frustration that is being felt by many citizens in our city, and it is not being expressed through destructive behavior.\"\n\nThe mayor is asking the city manager to develop a citywide policy on protests ahead of the Aug. 7 anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, when the city has been asked to step in with a \"less police heavy\" approach.\n\nRawlings has described Dallas' handling of Occupy protests as a model for protesters nationwide.\n\nHe said it appears the city has \"reformed\" from that point and is ready to handle protests now.\n\nLast month, the Police Department announced officers would no longer respond to demonstrators at demonstrations, where many of those arrested have been injured or have been arrested for other infractions that have included disturbing a peace officer and disorderly conduct. Police have also moved them out of downtown and moved demonstrators closer to home.\n\nIn the days leading up to the protests, Rawlings said Dallas police had engaged in \"targeted outreach\" to those activists and \"diligent dialogue\" to make sure peaceful participants could demonstrate safely. Dallas police announced Tuesday they were opening up the arrests of protesters to journalists and would not arrest those identified as anarchists, a designation that could mean they are part of a criminal organization.",
      "Gentlemen, I think we can all agree that President Trump's first weeks in office have been one of the most unusual in US history. It is only natural that, when faced with this unprecedented situation, President Trump would be reluctant to make any decisions that might have an adverse impact on Americans, but this is not about him, this is really about you, the American people.\n\nLet's be honest for a moment, this has been a very, very rough first week in office, which is why President Trump has done all he can to make things look better. That's why he tweeted about the National Guard and then did the same thing about the NFL. That's why he announced his plans to pull out of the Paris Accords in the Middle East. That's why he gave that terrible speech and then announced to the world that he did not regret it at all. It all comes back to the fact that things are going to be very difficult and it may seem easier to do things the easy way.\n\nAnd by the way, if you're still wondering about how tough President Trump is going to be, just listen to him talk about the economy. He had a conversation with his secretary of commerce about how the economy is doing and there were these little numbers in bold letters that said the economy is doing terrible.\n\nWell what did those numbers mean? Well the first number was 6.6 percent, how bad is it going to get?\n\nWell 6.6 percent, if it was 6.2 it would have meant that we were growing as well. That number would have looked a lot better than 6.4, or any number close to it!\n\nAt 3.9, we're a full point behind where we were before the election, at 4.5, we are even worse off. It would be much better to keep up the growth, but it won't be easy.\n\nBut as the numbers get better and better, will these economic numbers bring President Trump the votes he's looking for? Well, the thing is that even though they get better and better, if he doesn't have any real votes then he's screwed. He is going to lose this election. He is going to continue down his agenda that he has laid out for several months, especially if it can't pass with the Democrats.\n\nThe only thing that President Trump is going to gain from the economy is the votes of those that want to see his agenda through, just like he will only be able to win if he is able to pass his agenda. But as we saw just a few nights ago, when the economy is great the economy is great. There aren't many things going wrong on a positive note.\n\nBut while the economy is good and President Trump is able to continue with his agenda, it is going to take a lot more time if he keeps going like he has been going! But just because it is going well doesn't mean that he should keep going, we all know it isn't that simple. And as we have shown, he is going to be blamed for this as soon as they hit his approval rating, regardless of whether it is at 4 percent or 4.5 or 5 percent.\n\nSo there is a reason he is not trying to move too fast, a reason that he needs to do things in a certain sequence and a reason I'm here today, trying to explain why he has taken so many controversial actions since he assumed office. My opinion will be that the first thing President Trump must do is fire the Firing Squad that has been trying to destroy his presidency. It's as simple as that.\n\nBecause when you think about what we have seen in this first few weeks of office, as much as most people would like to think otherwise, it is not about Trump. It is about you. And it is about President Trump himself. It may seem simple to everyone else but it is not to him, that is why it is so important that he is able to make his own decisions, whether those decisions come from his advisers or his team.\n\nThis is about President Trump taking responsibility for himself and making decisions that he feels are in the best interest of all Americans, and not just on an ideological or political level, but just from a pure business perspective as it relates to how he runs businesses and what he sells.\n\nPresident Trump can make the right decision for America's jobs. He can put the right people in place that will be able to put the right products on the market. He can have a tax system that doesn't suck and has a plan to cut business taxes. He can create a plan that will help small businesses and create a plan that will help individuals do well at work so they can keep more money at home and grow and invest for future growth. With these decisions, President Trump can make the right decisions based on his business background.\n\nHe can set a positive example for those around him. He can demonstrate that he is one of them and not some rich",
      "A few weeks ago I stumbled across the above photo, and it instantly got me thinking about all the different kinds of clothes men have worn that have been worn by women. These include hats, shoes, scarves, dresses, pantsuits, blazers, tops, tops and sweatshirts, socks and gloves. A quick bit of search revealed that the vast majority of men's clothes were manufactured by women, or women by women. How did this gender divide come about?\n\nThe history of wearing clothes by women\n\nThe history of wearing clothes by women is far more complicated than simply, \"women wore more clothes than men.\" While it was probably only in the 18th century that women began wearing clothes, the history of clothing in general is not as clear. The oldest surviving texts are about the 15th or 16th century, and these documents appear to be about men living off the land.\n\nThe first evidence of women owning clothes dates back to the 15thcentury in the UK. At a time when women were unable to own land, the men of this time period would sometimes send out their wives for a job, and the women would come back with a new outfit. Often these outfits featured cloth sleeves - probably a sign that the clothes were part of a specific dress code. This garment culture persisted throughout the 15th century in this country.\n\nDuring the Industrial Revolution, women began to work in much higher numbers, so they began wearing more clothing. This change happened in two ways. First, as textile production greatly increased along with the creation of new garments, the cost of making women's clothing fell, making it cheaper to produce for women than for men. Second, the industrialization of clothing manufacturing also meant that it had to be more sanitary - in the mid-1800s, when many women came to work in factories they were exposed to much higher levels of bacteria. This was partly because these factories did not have good ventilation or ventilation-cleaning systems and a lot of women were exposed to high levels of pollution from the dust particles, so the clothing did become dirtier.\n\nEventually, as manufacturing was made more efficient, women's clothes became less sanitary. So the clothes continued to be more cheaply made, and people continued to wear them. The end of the Industrial Revolution also led to a decrease in women's employment, and this in turn, caused fewer women to come to work in factories. As a result, clothing production began to be done by men and women separately, and it was women in all industries who continued to wear the most expensive and, therefore, the most sanitary, clothing.\n\nHow clothing is made\n\nThere are so many different ways to make clothing, and each method has its own advantages. Cotton has many advantages as a fabric, but it was still very costly to make. Cotton is used for a lot of different stuff, but it was the basis for most clothing in the past, and it still is for most of it. Because it's so cheap to produce, cotton could be cheaply and quickly mass-produced, and that is the way clothes are made today.\n\nCotton can be manufactured in a process called spinning. This involves a series of yarn, which is spun by hand into long threads called wefts, and these threads are then used to sew together the various parts. This involves a lot of spinning, weaving, winding, folding and pressing, all of which are very expensive and labor-intensive.\n\nCotton yarn from a spinning machine.\n\nBut now all that's possible with computer-controlled machines. Cotton can be spun into yarn by computer, a process known as computer weaving. This produces a very fine thread, which can be spun into clothing in a very rapid and easy fashion. With computers nowadays, it's actually possible to use these machines to make clothing that is a lot more durable and comfortable than what you might get from a spinning machine. The downside is that computers are more expensive and slow - it takes years to spin yarn like this. So unless you have huge factories producing clothing in huge quantities, computer-controlled weaving is very unlikely to make your favorite pair of jeans a whole lot more expensive. In addition, the high levels of chemicals required to produce cotton yarn, especially organic cotton, makes computers unsuitable for the vast majority of clothing production.\n\nWool can be woven like cotton or spun, but it is cheaper to manufacture than cotton yarn, and is also much longer in making. It is much harder to spin, but machines can do it. Wool is most commonly used for sweaters and some other kind of fabrics. It can't be spun like cotton, but it can be hand woven; the kind of weaving that you might do with a loom.\n\nLinen can be woven like cotton and cotton yarn, and it is just as expensive to manufacture as cotton yarn. Unlike cotton and wool, linen is not very durable. Linen is primarily used for clothing, but many people also use linen to make up for the",
      "I have some trouble remembering how I got here, so let me explain what we're doing so far. In the picture above, we have: The base game, which lets you build a settlement (more on that later), craft weapons and armor, and construct towers. The expansion, which adds new structures, new resources, and a multiplayer game. The DLC, which adds the new tower mechanic that expands the gameplay and adds even more structures, more crafting, and more towers, which is how we're calling this new game \"The Dwarves: Enchanted Edition\".\n\n\nSo you see, the base game just has some basic mechanics. But the expansions have a couple extra things going for them: a whole lot of them.\n\n\nThe first expansion, called Dwarves: Enchanted Edition, is available on Steam now for $8.99, or $2.99 on GOG.\n\n\nIf you have the base game, there's no need to buy anything else as it comes with all of the basic features.\n\n\nThe expansion adds a bunch of new systems and features. The primary major thing that is different about this update is the ability to craft items in more than one way. You can either craft things in one of the three basic ways, or go the other way and do things with resources, but it changes the way you build almost everything.\n\n\nI'll describe a few of the features that we're adding as the Stretch Goal goes in.\n\n\nCrafting\n\nThe most important thing about this expansion is the possibility to craft in different styles. You can make the basic weapon from scratch, or add a couple extra parts to make something else. You can also go the opposite direction and make the tower look different from the original.\n\n\nYou'll note that on the above picture, I've got two different styles. I could have one of the styles on hand, and the other on the other, but I might not have the two on hand at the same time, since we might only have three weapons, or one tower. Since we add more towers and weapons, it would be weird if the two styles looked different. There are, of course, other reasons for that as well.\n\n\nFor items, the items can be added all in one style like a knife, shield, or something else. Or you can add multiple parts of things like different knives to make different weapons. So for example, we don't know how we're going to add three knives to our tower; we're just going to add three swords. But if you add a sword, a sword and a dagger, we'll add more knives to the tower. So a tower could have three knife styles on it, or it can have a thousand, or it could have ten thousand, it doesn't matter.\n\n\nAlso, each tower has one of the available styles. So if you want to build a tower with multiple styles, you can do that, but you can't mix and match style with style.\n\n\nOne of the other things I'm adding in this expansion is the ability to add buildings and other things to a tower without having to go out and find something by exploring. You can just tell the tower you want to build that, and tell it what resources you have. The tower will then be populated with other types of buildings. For example, if you have a furnace, you can just tell the tower you have the fuel, and what building it would be.\n\n\nWeapons\n\nWeapons are just like any other building, so they'll have one or multiple ways to make them. For the basic weapon, like a basic axe, you go the basic axe-hand style and then you choose parts to make it like a great axe. Then you could add a hand to make it a war axe.\n\nYou'll also notice that we have things that are much more specific to that style. For instance, the axe-hand style is limited to only axes. But if you have a spear, or a mace, that's a different style. If you use a hammer, you're going to get a hammer-hand weapon.\n\n\nSome weapons have more than one style (which we also explained in the Stretch Goal). For example, you can make a shield-hand and a mace-hand as well as shield-hand and axe-hand. Weapons come in all kind of shapes and size to better suit the style and use.\n\n\nThe only one that's not a style of weapon (and I'll explain that later) is the tower hand. For now, you might think of that just like a tower, but it has three different styles that it will be able to make.\n\nResources\n\nOne of the things we are adding in this expansion is the possibility to craft resources. So you can make gold, iron, coal, wood, and copper. And those resources have different kinds of uses. Wood has a lot of uses, like cooking with it. It's also a type of building",
      "Luxury carmaker Rolls Royce has taken a major step in its quest to become the first manufacturer to launch a self-driving car, after the firm was granted permission to test its vehicle on public roads in the UK this summer.\n\nThe carmaker, founded by Sir Christopher Wren in the 1920s and now based in Britain, announced that it had received the necessary safety approvals from the UK Transport Agency. It will only be allowed to test its autonomous vehicles in the US and the Netherlands.\n\n\"We are delighted the TfL have granted the vehicle for autonomous trials in London. It is another important step forward in enabling safe self-driving cars to be commercially viable.\"\n\nRolls Royce, which has a presence in Britain since 1837, said it hoped to be able to test the car in London sometime this summer, but would not be doing so before 2017 at the earliest.\n\n\"We are delighted the TfL [Transport for London] have granted the vehicle for autonomous trials in London. It is another important step forward in enabling safe self-driving cars to be commercially viable,\" said Paul Maycock, senior director for research and development at Rolls Royce.\n\nThe company said it will use the vehicles on public roads so that it can gather public reaction and develop a \"pilot model\" for testing. It expects to use the car to develop and test its autonomous technology and is also in talks with government agencies and insurance companies about testing its system.\n\nThe new system could potentially cut driver fatigue and help increase safety. In tests, the car will be able to detect objects such as cyclists, pedestrians and vehicles on other roads in its vicinity and react, for example, by slowing or stopping in response to collisions.\n\nRolls Royce's cars have now been tested in the Netherlands, Belgium and the US but the UK is considered to be more of a challenging market, with both the European Union and US saying they would need to see further evidence that the cars would be legally acceptable before starting public trials.\n\nSelf-driving cars are being developed as part of a project being led by Alphabet, Google's parent company, with the aim of making them commonplace by 2021. Elon Musk, Tesla CEO, has expressed an ambition to start trials of self-driving cars on public roads in California in 2018.\n\n\"This is a big deal. It is a big step forward for safety in any industry, let alone in automotive,\" said Chris Gerdes, an analyst at the Autonomous Driving Centre at Queen Mary, University of London.",
      "The first thing a new customer might ask is whether you're using our latest product in his home. If so, then chances are that he's coming from an existing system where he uses one of the older versions of our software, or from an existing data center with a system built using a different technology. In a company where technology is constantly changing, we've learned to offer the latest information available to our customers as quickly as humanly possible. That applies even more to our cloud solutions, where we constantly test and update our systems to keep them as stable as possible. This keeps everything running on time and on budget. But sometimes you get an unexpected query that simply can't be answered in the way you expect, and that can make you have some tough questions to ask yourself.\n\nIn those cases, you can use the following steps to make your decision easy. They're not specific to any specific product or technology, so there's no need to search the web for solutions. They just help you know that, while all of our products work in the cloud, we do have different technologies in place for a range of uses.\n\nAsk What Works Now\n\nLook for the products that fit the needs of your company or system (or, in some cases, your company) today. In almost all cases, you're most likely in the right place, if you're looking for the newest and most current technology. However, sometimes you might think that a new service is out of the question for your business — but if you're using one of the older versions of a product like SAP HANA that has recently been phased out, then you might not have anything to worry about.\n\nTake the following steps to determine if you've got a use for a technology that might be considered outdated. If you have a service use case you're having trouble defining, we've got a handy example in our cloud examples section. If not, start by identifying your company, then try to find all the features of your product that could be affected.\n\nStep 1: Review Current Capabilities\n\nIn a world dominated by cloud-based computing, a cloud-based service's core functionality is now easily accessible to a variety of businesses and systems. In most cases, that functionality can be applied to any number of different applications. In such cases, using a product that was created for a specific use case or for a particular technology may be a fine idea — unless the functionality is no longer as useful as you originally thought.\n\nTake the following examples:\n\nOne of your customers is a financial institution. You create a software package for the entire department, with two features: one enables the department to access an application running on our managed platform from any computer in the department, and another allows the department to sign in with their bank account. Of course, this particular function could be done either way, but in this case it's a case in which the functionality is no longer useful as it was originally conceived, leaving it with limitations. Your product doesn't run on the managed cloud, but the department may already be using a database that relies on an older version, or the department may be using an application that was developed for another technology.\n\nYou create a software package for the entire department, with two features: one enables the department to access an application running on our managed platform from any computer in the department, and another allows the department to sign in with their bank account.

Your product doesn't run on the managed cloud, but the department may already be using a database that relies on an older version, or the department may be using an application that was developed for another technology. This example is probably a little more familiar given the number of technology announcements we've recently published about VMware vSphere and Citrix's XenApp integration. Some of your customers have been managing data centers that use older versions of the software you wrote, but for others, the technology you developed can still be used today, so it's not like you've missed out on any customers in the process.\n\nStep 2: Consider Any Use Cases for Older Versions\n\nOnce you're sure that the functionality is no longer necessary, you can start to look for uses for obsolete versions. There have been plenty of new applications and technologies that have moved their capabilities into more modern platforms. Sometimes a product doesn't need that functionality because the functionality already exists in a more modern tool. In those cases, it might still make sense to try to create software that supports the old feature, but it's certainly not necessary.\n\nFor example, one piece of software that is commonly used in healthcare today is the XenApp/XenDesktop Suite (XAS). The XAS team builds, and maintains these tools, but doesn't use them all that often, so we don't necessarily need to maintain them. However,",

      "I had a great time at this year's International Conference on Music, a gathering of scholars, composers and performers from Canada, Sweden, Finland, the U.S., South Africa and China. And if you listen to their keynote speech, you'd be forgiven for thinking that I was doing a good job of summarizing an interminable academic symposium.\n\nThe conference was organized by U.S. composer and critic Pauline Kael in 1986, and I was fortunate enough to be invited to present my paper for the symposium. If you think I was exaggerating in my description of the program (which was quite impressive), then you would have to consider the following.\n\nThis year's conference on music, organized by Finnish composer Mika Saaristo, came about because there hadn't been one since 1979. So I was invited to present an anthology of music written by women composers. This was a bit surprising. When we met with Saaristo we learned that it's a relatively new idea to write women's music, which is what Saaristo wrote a musical for herself. But while most of Western music is written for and by men, women still want to try the other way around, and that's the reason why these conferences have been held intermittently for almost 15 years now — to bring together groups of writers, composers and performers who are passionate about this idea of diversity. The Finnish composer also invited me to join her team, which was quite exciting because I've had the good fortune of being involved with groups that are focused on that goal for my entire career.\n\nYou might think this was a coincidence, but I'll go one step further. I've been a teacher and an assistant professor of music for 16 years and my first five years teaching were spent at UCLA's music department. As a music student, I learned from some talented female composers — Mary MacKillop, Ann Beattie and Sarah Karr. It's only in the last few years that I've studied music theory and learned the technical aspects of composing music for performance. When I arrived for orientation for the department's first concert-in-press workshop in 2014, I was astonished to discover that one of the performers at the workshop was a female violinist who's considered to be a pioneer in this department.\n\nIf you take in the full range of the symposium, you'll hear that the women's music movement is one of the most promising and exciting in all of music.\n\nWe should take into account the fact that only 5 percent of published works are by women, and of these, only 10 percent are written for female audiences. As a professional musician, I've always admired those women composers who are known for their musical achievement but also for their cultural significance. If you take in the full range of the symposium, you'll hear that the women's music movement is one of the most promising and exciting in all of music.\n\nThe symposium was also attended by several men who had dedicated decades of their life to studying and practicing music. These are all musicians with whom I have a great deal of respect. It was extremely encouraging to meet so many women who are so dedicated to this work and are so committed to exploring the possibilities offered by women's music.\n\nAlthough the symposium gave me the chance to present my research, I spent most of my time talking about what it means to be a person who is interested in the intersection of gender and music. My main focus was to help other artists and music educators understand the different types of gender in music. My first step is to provide a frame of reference, which I tried to do, but for me, even the most simple and everyday question can contain an extraordinary amount of complexity.\n\nOne of our presentations dealt with the role of gender in jazz, and another was a discussion about the intersection of identity and musical culture and the meaning of identity music. The panel made it very clear that music, and in particular jazz, is a very personal endeavor that depends on who you are as a person. For many artists, the music they love depends on who they were in the past. But the people who come to the symposium to learn about music education have no such preconceptions — they have a wide and changing view of themselves. Music, and in particular jazz, is very open-ended and it's the musicians who develop the vision for what the community, culture and industry should ultimately look like — not the music educators. So what it takes to build a culture and community is not just making music — it includes the artists who create and the people who listen and support them.\n\nIf musicians do a better job at understanding the importance of all of these areas, then perhaps they can work more effectively to support their communities. As a professional music educator, this has become my main focus these past years. And even though this is about musicians as well as people who are concerned about gender issues, it's important to me that these lessons are not only taught",

This is often necessary for running your own development tools, such as Docker, but even more often if customers have different image repositories than you do.

We started with some basic questions and asked them to give us some tips that might help with our own use case: What are the most popular use cases of Docker for building systems? I am a developer, and I've made large projects with Docker a lot easier than this. If I'm building an app on my host, I'll build an image on a local machine (I have a local copy of the OS image on my laptop for testing) and then push that up. If I'm creating a container, I'll build a local image, and then push that up the container system out to one of my servers (you also can use docker-compose.yml to set up the containers). If I'm using Chef to build up a system, the same process would work for me, but I'd have to go into the Chef container settings, and tell it which container to use, which OS to load, and other things. That's a lot of setup that can be avoided by Docker, so I'm really excited to see how it's going to benefit developers. If I'm testing an image locally, what would you suggest I do? We don't have a solution yet, and I'd have to figure something out myself first. I'd have to look at my image distribution to find all of my images, and then I'd have to setup an image database on my server so that I can pull images from a specific distribution and use them instead of the main image.",
      "After a month since release, I have to confess I'm still enjoying this little box. Its just a bit too slow to be an RPG to satisfy my high expectations. But it might turn into it in the end with a bit more play time.\n\nThe game is pretty much a survival horror, but there is something special going on in this box. If you're not familiar with it, don't worry that this review will be extremely short.\n\nI bought a box because I have some high hopes for this game.\n\nI thought it was one of the most hyped and loved indie game of last month .\n\nSo when I tried it, I felt disappointed. The game didn't even feel like it started properly. It felt like I first tried it and then immediately restarted the game, which is a bit weird. It didn't even go through a preload screen (except for the tutorial). It's as though the game itself doesn't quite feel very complete.\n\nThe only thing that I think would have made this game more exciting would been a few additional things. You have to progress very slowly for a very long time and the game is too dark to make you more optimistic at the end. The game would have been better with a little more color and less dark.\n\nThis is probably the least exciting game in the bunch but it doesn't really matter so much as I'm sure that they didn't intend this for this kind of audience. They were probably thinking that the more gamers play this, the better the game would be. But when they're making a game, they shouldn't take the feedback of gamers into account.\n\nThey probably got a lot of praise from their first game and they thought that by releasing this game in February, it would get much more attention.\n\nNow, if we had known that this game was already finished, perhaps the game would have been released a bit earlier.\n\nWell, I got a box and played it for a week so probably I will play it over time when it has gained more popularity.\n\nThe only things that would make this game even more interesting would be if the devs released a couple more things. And perhaps there are some things in there that I am not aware of yet.\n\nI really hope they will release more stuff in these games, so I can really enjoy this awesome indie video game.",
      "The former CIA chief and NSA adviser argued that a 'radicalisation' of Muslim youth was undermining their capacity to fight terrorism by encouraging them to join the extremist groups.\n\nA leading US think tank's report said Muslims' radicalisation could be traced in part to \"a cultural alienation and lack of identity\" that leads to \"a sense of moral inferiority\" among young Muslims and a desire to leave the countries where they were born.\n\nThe report by the Combating Terrorism Centre at West Point was commissioned last year by a group of lawmakers seeking to prevent young Muslims from becoming radicalised.\n\nRiaz Yousafzai, the youngest US combat casualty with the US military and founder of the Pakistani teenager advocacy group the International Committee of the Red Cross, said many had lost sight of the \"core values\" of Islam and were using \"religious doctrines to justify violence\".\n\nIt emerged last July that Yousafzai had also become a convert to Islam, though she denies that she was ever interested in the religion as a child. She became a critic of Islamic fundamentalism during her childhood years.\n\nIn the interview to be published in full by The Washington Post, Yousafzai said that she had never \"thought about becoming a suicide bomber\" as a young girl but that she had lost her childhood faith. She said that the \"vast majority\" of her fellow young Muslim women around the country were also becoming radicalised, and that she had spent a year travelling the world to help raise funds for their education through a scholarship fund set up by American Muslim NGOs.\n\n\"It's a very difficult situation.

      "The European Central Bank on Wednesday lowered its key interest rate to zero, taking its borrowing costs below zero in an effort to cool overheated European economies.\n\nBut the decision was largely overshadowed by the Fed's decision to keep rates high.\n\nThe ECB said that \"the recent improvement in the outlook for the recovery, in particular in the euro area and in the U.S., and to a lesser extent in Germany, are weighing on the outlook for inflation in the euro area.\"\n\n\nThe ECB's rate and policy committee decided to keep rates low despite \"the stronger than expected recovery in domestic and export economic activity\" in the euro zone, the central bank said.\n\nAt the same time, officials acknowledged the \"frustration at times by the considerable lack of price stability\" in the euro area.\n\n\"The situation is now more favorable for inflation than in the early stages of the euro area crisis,\" the ECB said.\n\nThe bank raised its policy interest rate by 50 basis points to 0.5%, the first reduction in rates in nearly a decade, in a bid to stimulate the euro zone economy. It also announced a €60 billion ($68 billion) package of liquidity to banks to shore up liquidity in the financial system and ease the pressure on investors to withdraw funds.\n\nU.S. Dollar Index futures, which reflect expectations of interest rates, fell shortly after the decision was made.\n\nThe U.S. dollar index, known as the greenback, rose 0.6% to 100.98 as of 12:04 p.m. New York time, while the euro dropped 0.4% to €1.1429, having been up 0.4% on Wednesday.

      "The first major post on this list came from last October, which I decided to expand on in a bit of detail with four previous post, starting with the basics of \"bounce rate,\" (b) and its impact on your bankroll, (c), how to set up your system efficiently for high stakes games (d) and finally the \"sport of life\" (a) vs. \"game of life\" (g). It is no coincidence that these post are in the format that I discuss in the main entry — if a bankroll is getting low — it is time to step it up a gear, and get back in the habit. We start with the topic of \"bounce rate.\"\n\nIf you want to get better, you need to make a deliberate effort and dedicate at least some time on your bankroll management. The first step is determining what your bankroll goal is. You probably have a ballpark amount, or idea of when you are going to be hitting your target, but the big question is: should that goal become a goal you pursue day in day out? Or, should you settle for a percentage of your bankroll?\n\nIf you have a ballpark, or estimate, of cash in the bank, there are two ways you can think about it:\n\nYou need to add on more bankroll. If your goal for your bankroll is to build enough bankroll to max your bankroll out, every day, to max out, for the rest of your lifetime, then you need to create bankroll. There are tons of good books about this topic on Amazon, like the following two ones: The Book of Game, by John Hochman, and A Guide To Growing Your Money by Jack Bittman, which are both excellent, well-written books.\n\nYou need to spend no more (and more!) at a time on bankroll. On the other hand, if your goal is to hit a certain maximum per day or per week, or per month, the answer is simpler once you figure out how to figure that out. However, you need to be careful with this one, because with \"spending some more\" comes \"saving some more.\" If you are spending some, you are going to end up with less in the bank, but that is not a bad thing. This means that you have to think about how much to save, and when to save it.\n\nSo how do you determine your goal? This is a good question to have on your mind. I am going to provide an answer, and then you should decide what your goal should be once you have decided.\n\nThere are a couple different ways to get an idea on what your goal is. The first one is to look at how money behaves in all types of sports. For example, there are a bunch of sports that have fixed stakes, where you can predict the winner and losers based on how much there is to bet on one game. For example, the \"home\" teams in a baseball game is generally known by what home teams are winning or losing. A football game is not so much fixed, but there is a fixed sum of money (points). There are few sports that have fixed stakes, where you are not able to predict winners and losers. These include the \"home\" teams in basketball (points), and also the winners of any \"game of the day\" (points). Some sports also have some \"fixed\" sum of money to bet. Some sports with fixed stakes have fixed \"bets\" (points), and some have varying \"bets\" (points +/– some variable, like the number of points available). And, of course, you should add a few more variables to have a realistic goal. Some, like college sports, have a lot of variables that play a role in determining winners and losers, so they should provide a large amount of variation to help you get a more accurate goal. For example, college sports often take place from early December through late January — which would be in the middle of this bankroll planning chart. If you are building a large bankroll to hit big-money tournaments that often take place in early January and February of each year, I would definitely consider using this model.\n\nThe second way to figure out what your bankroll goal is is to take a game and find out what the odds of a particular outcome are. In the game of poker the two players (the dealer and the dealer's table) can have a different number of chips each, and there is a betting system on how much and how often you can bet in a given period of time. Therefore, they can be considered \"good\" bets, and your bankroll could potentially go up if you get lucky, or go down if you get unlucky. This is an example of probability — so the goal with your bankroll management is the same with poker, and in my opinion the only difference is you go from playing \"good\" to \"bad\" bets.\n\nSo",

      "The world of modern computer vision is quite noisy. Many models require a large number of samples and use many different classes of inputs to make predictions. Even if you have access to datasets that have been preprocessed to limit noise, there are still many potential sources of noise and biases that we have yet to figure out how to remove at the computational level. This talk will take a look at one such source, a feature that is used fairly frequently in many visual models: the spatial smoothness of the input signal.\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe use a good many machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression and Logistic Regression Trees, and some of them assume a good deal of spatial information about an input image. For example, if we work on the logistic regression problem presented on the left, we have access to the training images. If we do not have pre-processed training data, then we have to assume that the feature is in the training images. However, even though our training data is a good source of spatial information, in practice we probably do not have an ideal spatial distribution of our sample images. Many other sources of features are also present, like the noise in the training images and even the class of the input images. The problem is that these other sources of features are also noisy.\n\nWith noise there is a strong chance that our model will fail to fit the data. Thus, in practice we probably want to reduce the noise before passing on any training examples. However, what happens if the source of noise is not the original input image, but the input image itself? In other words, what if we have to reconstruct an image from a single noisy sample? To make this a bit easier, instead of treating the source of noise as the training data, we will now treat it as the reconstruction of an image from a single noisy sample.\n\nAs far as I know, this still involves a lot of complexity, given that it requires at least three different algorithms to compute the reconstruction, compute the reconstruction in multiple steps, and reduce the reconstruction error. However, it is definitely an important problem that needs to be investigated.\n\nHow to solve it\n\nThe idea is that we will try and reconstruct an image from a single sample by doing the following: First, we compute an image using a low-level kernel. The kernel is typically an sinc function with some low-level parameters, for example it could be an sinc function with a low-pass filter applied (or even an sinc function with a high-pass filter).\n\nThe output image will be the transformed image of the high-level kernel. For more details about the low-level kernel architecture, see Section 2 of the blog post on Deep Convolutional Neural Networks.\n\nWe then use the low-level kernel to reconstruct the original input image. Note that we do not need to be able to guess the position of the input image. The reconstruction error will depend on the distance between the reconstructed and original image. Note that if we compute the reconstruction in multiple steps, we should make sure not to overfit as this may cause a decrease in reconstruction performance.\n\nThis technique is not very well designed to represent spatial information in the data, as the reconstruction will be done using the local kernel where the spatial information is represented locally but in the form of a very large matrix. This is due to the fact that the spatial information in the training images is much better than what is required to reconstruct the image of the reconstruction kernel. However, that said, it is feasible to do better at the spatial level, and I will talk about some of the possible approaches in Section 3 of the blog post.\n\nRemoving noise using a low-level kernel\n\nRemoving noise from spatial data is a non trivial task, so I am not going to try and describe it here. The blog post by Yann LeCun on Residual Learning is a good intro to spatial noise removal and can provide some guidance on how to approach it.\n\nOne possibility is to use a low-level kernel based on the local weighted average. We will focus on the local weighted average in this section because it is particularly simple to implement and the code is almost self-contained.\n\nTo summarize, we will first compute an image using the kernel based low-level kernel, while minimizing the loss:\n\nloss = sum ( abs ( y ) + abs ( x ) for s in range ( c ) )\n\nWe now look at a function to reduce the loss, which is just an sigmoid function. As an alternative, we could define the loss function as:\n\nloss = L ( n , mu )\n\nWith this loss function, we can perform the reconstruction step in multiple steps.\n\nThe reconstruction\n\nBefore we talk about why we should care about the reconstruction errors and how to improve them, let's discuss a simple case where we have an input image and the nearest neighbour to it. Let's rewrite our",
      "A federal grand jury has indicted the manager of a New Orleans strip club on a charge of prostitution and a drug charge in Louisiana, the U.S. Attorney's Office announced on Thursday.\n\nSondra Edwards, 25, was indicted on two state prostitution charges and a state narcotics charge related to the May 15 shooting death of a man at the New Orleans club, according to a departmental spokesman. The charges are punishable by up to five years in federal prison.\n\nU.S. Attorney Kenneth Polite said New Orleans police officers responded to a call about a disturbance at the club at 527 E. Esplanade Ave.\n\nHe said the club's manager told police that Edwards, who was in the company of a male customer, was working the front desk.\n\nThey arrived to find Edwards in the bathroom, with a man with a gun, he said. The customer left but police entered and found Edwards shot to death in a bathroom, Polite said.\n\nThe nightclub's manager, Michael \"Mitch\" Davis, was arrested at his home in the 400 block of North Rosedale Avenue. Davis was released on $350,000 bond Thursday, according to Cook County Sheriff's Office records. Edwards was pronounced dead at 9:30 p.m.\n\nPolite said investigators discovered that Edwards was a frequent customer and was charged about $3,000 for private dances on the club's stage. The dancers were underage at the time of the shooting, Polite said.\n\nPolite said Edwards had worked at both a strip club and a video store for about two years.\n\nHis arrest comes the same week President Barack Obama said he had urged his administration to crack down on prostitution. Polite said the president's comments were meant to make sure that \"federal authorities can take appropriate steps, particularly against the operators of the business.\"\n\nEdwards' uncle, Robert Edwards Sr., said he believes the club was trying to get the wrong person in jail, not his niece.\n\n\"She wasn't selling sex,\" said Roberts. \"I think everything's wrong in that situation.\"\n\nEdwards was arrested when she went to the police station to turn herself in, he said. When she tried to leave, an officer asked her for identification, Roberts said.\n\n\"She didn't say anything, I don't know if she knew what was going to happen,\" he said.\n\nEdwards' aunt, Alba Edwards, said she is not surprised by the indictment.\n\n\"I knew she was going to be indicted,\" she said.\n\nEdwards' father, Robert, works as a janitor at a hospital in New Orleans.\n\nHe said the incident is \"devastating.\"\n\n\"It was a beautiful child with one bad influence,\" Robert Edwards said.\n\nHe said his daughter was taking care of a baby and needed money for her car to help her pay it off. She had just quit a job at a grocery store, he said.\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.\n\nrkeller@dispatch.com",
      "The only way to keep us safe is to end the war in Iraq and overthrow Saddam Hussein – and that is why I am voting for the Iraq War Resolution of 2002.\n\nWith only hours to spare before the vote, some members in the House of Representatives, including the speaker of the House, have been trying to slip the Iraq War Resolution into legislation that would set up a fund to compensate Iraqis for some of the billions in damages they suffered after we took over their country. Such a fund might be politically popular with the public, but it would not do much to reduce the danger posed by Saddam Hussein, since we had plenty of time to prepare a plan to remove him.\n\nThe main reason for voting against it is that Iraq is so dangerous and that the Iraqi people are so innocent – a people who have been victimized by the United States for 12 years.\n\nOn October 3, 2002, the president told the American people that Saddam Hussein's \"nuclear weapons program posed an urgent threat to American citizens.\" He warned us that Iraq had \"weapons of mass destruction, and the means to deliver them.\" He told us that the \"Iraqi regime continues to harbor and support terrorist organizations, including Al Qaida.\" President Bush went onto assert, \"It remains clear that the regime in Baghdad is an increasingly dangerous threat to our national security. And with each passing day, the intelligence community must more closely assess the threat posed by Iraq to our homeland and allies.\"\n\nOn October 5, 2002, the New York Times reported that \"U.S. intelligence agencies are closely watching a secret nuclear facility at a mountain near the Iraqi capital, and intelligence agencies have pinpointed the location of a top leadership figure who once worked for Saddam Hussein.\"\n\nAt a news briefing on October 6, 2002, the director of central intelligence told the White House press corps that \"we now believe with some degree of confidence that the regime has chemical or biological weapons\" and could develop a nuclear weapon \"in a matter of weeks or months.\"\n\nOn October 7, 2002, CNN reported that intelligence reports were indicating that we were moving closer to a potential nuclear weapons deal with Iraq. The United States was \"increasingly confident\" that \"Iraq has stockpiles of chemical weapons\" that might be deployed in \"a matter of weeks or months.\" The network reported that \"U.S. officials said they are aware of credible information indicating that Iraq might be close to having the basic materials needed to build a nuclear weapon.\" The U.S. knew that Saddam Hussein was building a \"small, covert, and sophisticated arsenal of biological warfare agents – potentially lethal agents that could be sprayed from aircraft or spread over large areas.\"\n\nOn October 15, 2002, the New York Times reported that U.S. intelligence was \"increasingly confident\" that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program in the last two years of his dictatorship. The Times reported that \"American and British spies have intercepted radio communications suggesting that senior members of Iraq 's leadership are obsessed with acquiring nuclear weapons and have amassed an arsenal of missiles capable of delivering them.\"\n\nOn October 27, 2002, the CIA said that there was evidence that Iraq had resumed its nuclear weapons and chemical weapons programs – the first time that American intelligence had admitted that Iraq was building a secret stockpile of deadly weapons. The agency said that it was \"very likely\" that Iraq had \"made large quantities of uranium hexafluoride gas and spent nuclear fuel\" from 1999 through 2002 from a plant that was destroyed in a U.N. inspection in 1996. The agency also said it was \"very likely\" that Iraq was reconstituting its nuclear weapons program in the last two years of his regime.\n\nOn November 4, 2002 – nearly 13 months after the first invasion of Iraq – the New York Times reported that the Pentagon had concluded after a year of study that Saddam Hussein had \"remained very responsive to intelligence on sensitive issues\" and \"was determined to rebuild his military program to support\" an invasion of Kuwait. The president himself conceded that it \"probably\" remained his administration's view that \"Saddam Hussein now poses a threat of a very serious nature.\" In light of all this, Congress should not vote for the resolution today.\n\nThe vote for ratification of the Rome Statute is in the House of Representatives.\n\nPlease note: A vote to support this resolution must be a yes.\n\nClick here to join the Peace Action Campaign of the Working Families Party (a national, nonpartisan peace organization that is affiliated with the International Socialist Organization in the United States and Canada) and get connected to your local antiwar group!",

They had been left in the care of no one and had no food or care for well over a year. By the time Linda began her first day of work at the age of 25 years old, they had grown to 5 and 4 years old, and all of their medical testing had confirmed that David Gifford's plan had been carried out perfectly.

      "The first ever British TV series to feature transsexual people, \"Transformed\" debuted on ITV in 2006 and proved an even bigger hit than expected. A series about an unlikely new relationship between a woman called Jamie (Carol Hutton) and a transgender woman called Sarah (Laura Campion), the series focused on the difficulties of being a trans woman in a male mind and body. The program was met with rave reviews and the producers of the show went on to create a follow-up, \"Gender Revolution\", which was broadcast as a miniseries on Discovery-UK. The miniseries, which aired in 2010, ran five series and included five seasons, and starred Milipe Le Grand, John C. McGinley, Elana MacKenzie, Jessica M. Steele, and David Walliams.\n\nAlthough the series was shot over three years and won several awards, the last series, \"Transformed 2\" aired on E4 and followed a new set of characters called \"The Gender Rebels\" (which later spawned its own series). After that series, \"Transformed\" had become a cult hit with its audience. It was re-edited and syndicated as a six-part series in September of 2014. The final season was released on DVD last year and included a commentary by the series' crew.\n\nThe following is a brief review of the production of \"Transformed\" that was taken from several interviews/interviews with the cast and crew, many of which were recorded as the series finale was nearing on June 3, 2011.\n\nProducer Chris Eubank\n\nChris Eubank was the producer and show runner for \"Transformed.\" Eubank, who is Scottish, began creating the series before the series was filmed in Scotland in March 2005. He also produced the series' short films (see below) for the series. Eubank also worked through a series of British producers of adult films while the series was in production in the UK.\n\nEubank explained to TVWise:\n\nEubank said that the producers initially approached him about developing \"Transformed\" as a film but his initial reaction was, \"you can probably cut it out because there's no point in making a film about transgenderism.\" \"We actually were looking into how to do something more like a TV show,\" he said. Eubanks said that they found an unusual talent, \"a British transgender actress whose face was actually beautiful, so that's what kind of tipped the scales (in our favour).\"\n\nAfter getting the first pilot order the series was later added to a network development deal with ITV and went on to be shot on locations in England.\n\nActor David Walliams\n\nWhile the original series featured only two actors on-screen, in the series finale, \"Transformed 2,\" two more actors were added. The male-to-female actor, David Walliams, was originally cast as Sarah and had previously made his television debut in the BBC2 series, \"The Sarah Jane Adventures,\" a romantic comedy about a male-to-female transsexual. Walliams played a part on the first year's \"Transformed\" and was not reprising the role when \"Gender Revolution\" aired. (The episode in which Chris Eubank was re-edited was called \"Watershed.\") The actress who played Sarah was actress Laura Campion.\n\nEubank explained to TVWise about the casting.\n\nEubank said that the producers approached David and Laura about going on the show, but neither were really interested. \"Laura's just very straight and didn't have much interest in doing this type of thing,\" he explained. \"She wasn't really comfortable about it or about playing a character who herself was a transsexual.\" He added that he'd never encountered anything quite like it before, and described the scene where the couple kiss as \"very sexy to see.\" He said, \"I've never played a couple together before, or acted with a couple of lovers on a TV series.\"\n\nCarol Hutton\n\nOriginally cast as a gay character, \"Transformed\" introduced the part of Sarah's girlfriend \"Ariel\" (Laura Campion) as well as \"Rachel\" (Miles Jupp) and Rachel's mother (Julie Walters) as part of the storyline which became \"Gender Revolution.\"\n\nEubank told TVWise:\n\nWe cast Carol as Rachel because she really connected with Sarah at that moment, and she was such a natural – she was so believable, she was so sweet and just a very natural way of playing those parts. She just felt a real warmth about them, and she had a terrific time. It was wonderful.\n\nMiles Jupp\n\nThe cast of \"Transformed\" played a range of roles, many of which involved the use of prosthetics. Jupp portrayed Sarah's dad \"David\" (also known as David Chaypor), and Campion, as Sarah",

She also called for the administration to reverse its decision.\n\nMoore added, \"In our opinion Mizzou is denying that they have any such policies.\"\n\nA letter the student union received from the Office for Affirmative Action and Equal Opportunity read, in part, \"As the University of Missouri's Office of Diversity and Inclusion, ODA works with student organizations to implement diversity and inclusion initiatives and to help students realize their dream of becoming a member of the football program.\"\n\nThe letter continued, \"ODA has agreed to collaborate with you on implementing a 'I Am Mizzou' T-shirt policy on the football team that is similar to the guidelines that are in place for students participating in campus sporting events. Since the inception of the T-shirt program, ODA reviews each request for T-shirt requests for potential compliance issues with the student participation policy.\"\n\nThe letter further stated that if the Black Student Union made \"reasonable changes\" to the I Am Mizzou T-shirt policy it would be \"promptly\" sent to the student government to be reviewed.\n\nWhile The Huffington Post asked for comment from the dean of students regarding the university's refusal to allow the BSU to wear an I Am Mizzou logo, administrators did not reply in time to our publication deadline.\n\nInstead, the Office of Disability Services issued the following statement on its web page.\n\n\"The University of Missouri strives to foster a learning environment through a learning community and the Division of Students with disabilities does not provide funds to support university activities that create an unfriendly work environment,\" a spokesperson with the Office of Disability Services told The Huffington Post on Friday morning.",
      "Romeo Dallaire was a former Canadian commander of UN peacekeeping. In 2003, he helped lead a multinational force that helped defeat an insurgent force on the outskirts of Baghdad.\n\nWASHINGTON — In a war zone, a general's command and control is crucial to making sure soldiers don't get lost or killed — and to ensuring that coalition forces have a plan when the fight goes south.\n\nBut in today's Washington, even the best generals can be outmaneuvered.\n\nIn the most embarrassing crisis of Obama's presidency this week, the White House was forced to put out a public plea for more U.S. military officers to serve on the National Security Council, the president's inner circle. The move was announced in the face of a growing backlash from the general officer corps, which contends that President Barack Obama is abandoning officers who know how to fight and win wars.\n\n\"This is not what the nation is looking for,\" said Air Force Lt. Gen. Michael \"Mikey\" Flynn. \"He can't just call any officer in the military and have him go into some country without understanding what is going on.\"\n\nWhite House officials say that the president wants a large number of officers working in the NSC, including the top three officials, and that the request is a sign of how frustrated he and his top advisers have become over what they view as a lack of consensus on the country's most important diplomatic mission. It's particularly galling for some officers who served in the Bush administration with more than a dozen NSC principals, such as Gen. James \"Mad Dog\" Mattis.\n\n\"Obama has made so many decisions and has left so many of us out there,\" said Army Lt. Gen. Gary Volesky, who served in those offices. \"To call all of us back into uniform again is a pretty high price to pay.\"\n\nThat frustration has made it more difficult for the White House to rely solely on the military for national security decisions — an increasingly unpopular move after the U.S. raid to rescue American hostages in Iran was botched, and the president has ordered airstrikes against Syria without Congressional approval.\n\nAfter weeks of back-and-forth, it's clear what the president and his senior advisers want. Obama recently nominated Lt. Gen. Jay Silveria to take over in the NSC from current undersecretary of defense for intelligence, and last week he tapped Army Gen. John Allen to replace him.\n\nA few years ago, it would have been impossible to imagine this arrangement. After the Sept. 11 attacks, Washington spent weeks trying to figure out how the civilian and military branches would work together to solve the looming security crisis. That effort produced a set of National Security Presidential Directives that gave the military new responsibilities, a more robust role on the NSC and increased authority for decision-making authority.\n\nBut with the White House under fire over the botched raid for the men held hostage in Yemen, Obama has had to confront that dilemma again. And with his NSC advisers — who were all military officers until this week — so divided on how to handle the conflict in Iraq, his options are much narrower than they were in 2005.\n\n\n\"The White House has decided that it is time for civilian experts to leave the NSC, including the National Security Advisor and his staff, and take up the task of coordinating and developing the Administration's counter-ISIL strategy, but civilian policymakers should still play a central role in the planning and execution of counterterrorism operations,\" said National Security Council spokesman Alistair Baskey.\n\nWith few other options, the White House has given itself a few options to respond to criticism that Obama is not fully executing the NSC principals — a decision that has backfired from the start.\n\nIn early 2009, Obama decided that he wanted to elevate Gen. David Petraeus to become his commander in Afghanistan. By appointing a senior officer to command in Afghanistan, Obama hoped to move away from the military's traditional role of planning and executing counterinsurgency operations.\n\nBut a key concern was military commanders' reluctance to take responsibility for the counterinsurgency mission without U.S. leadership, according to several people familiar with the decision.\n\nThat led to a standoff between Obama, who was insisting on control of the counterinsurgency campaign, and military commanders. In an effort to ease these tensions, the NSC principals met at the Pentagon and in the White House in late 2009 and early 2010.\n\nAt that point, Obama aides realized they had an opportunity to restore some balance in his NSC, some officials say, but without removing military officers from the equation.\n\n\"There was a clear understanding during those meetings that they had no wish to remove officers from the NSC,\" said a person familiar with the discussions, who was not authorized to speak publicly about it. \"They wanted them to be involved in discussions on strategic plans and other activities. The concern was not about removing officers from the policymaking process in",
      "In what promises to be a very tough battle between the two biggest parties in next year's elections for the U.S. Senate, there may be the rare opportunity for Republicans to unseat a sitting Democratic senator.\n\nThe two-way match-up in Arizona is one of the most highly-anticipated and watched races of the 2014 cycle. Republicans have the clear advantage over their Democratic opponent, Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick and many say it's their best chance to topple a sitting member of the Senate.\n\nIt may not be all that easy.\n\n\"Democrats have a very big advantage,\" said University of Arizona Political Science Professor Mark Jones. \"If you ask me I'm more likely to say there's a chance. They have a lot of money and a lot of political strength. But I think these races are very close. There's a lot of ways you could go. I don't see it being the Republicans' night.\"\n\nThe Senate map for the 2016 election may look like this: Democratic candidates face tough challenges in states where Republicans won a majority in the 2010 election and in others where Democrats haven't reached 60 percent of the vote in more than three competitive races in the past four cycles. For these reasons, Jones said it's very plausible that Republican candidates could hold on to their majority. Or at least hang in there long enough to hold onto their majority or even to pick up a Republican seat in a race where a more competitive, Democratic race appears more likely.\n\n\"There's been a real uptick in the Senate races and in primary contests. That will continue,\" Jones said. \"The real challenge will be winning the three seats where one party had a comfortable majority but then was not rewarded for it with a good result.\"\n\nJones said this could be the year Democrats take back the White House -- and that it's quite possible.\n\n\"The chances of the Republican winning the Senate are going to be significantly reduced, if not eliminated,\" he said. \"And the chances of the Democrats winning the Senate are going to be enhanced. If Democrats win the White House, they have a chance. We'll see what's next year.\"\n\nIn Arizona, the Senate race has attracted a lot of national attention. The race was thrust into the national spotlight in part because of Kirkpatrick's use of a personal server to send out confidential Senate documents regarding her work for a private law firm, Cravath Swaine & Moore, which paid her more than $180,000 annually. Kirkpatrick initially defended the use of the server as legal and said she would work to get the documents back.\n\nAfter the records came to light, however, Kirkpatrick acknowledged that she used the server, calling it an \"inadvertent mix-up.\" She eventually returned all of the documents and apologized for the \"transparent confusion\" over the past 12 months. (Her Republican opponent, Rep. John McCain, who took office in 2009 after spending most of the Bush White House, had a similar mishap.)\n\n\"Let me be very clear, I have done nothing unlawful, and I am confident that the information I have provided is fully disclosed and will be fully accounted for,\" she said on the front page and inside the back of The Arizona Republic at the time of her initial retraction. But a number of Republican and Democratic leaders have come to her defence, arguing that she did nothing wrong and that she broke no law.\n\nRepublicans have countered that she used the server to keep her boss, Democratic Gov. Jan Brewer, in the news, and has accused Republicans of waging an \"arrogant, dishonest and despicable\" campaign. Kirkpatrick acknowledged she may have set the records straight, pointing to the fact that McCain's emails were deleted, but Republican critics still see her situation as more akin to an ethical crisis.\n\n\"She is at best ignorant of the law, and at worst she knew better and tried to mislead the public,\" said David McReynolds, communications director for the Arizona GOP. \"Whether it was a mistake or not is not important. What is important is that when Gov. Brewer hired a private investigator to dig up dirt on her political opponents, she did so through the very contractor whose system she relied upon to keep emails and other records relevant to her official duties safe.\"\n\nJones, however, says there is little precedent in Arizona politics for what Kirkpatrick put forth. There are a few instances where state employees have used personal email accounts for official purposes, he said, but it's not nearly as common as what Kirkpatrick did.\n\n\"There are several examples,\" Jones said. \"But that is only one example among many that have occurred in other states.\"\n\nThe issue comes at a time when Democratic candidates are often accused of engaging in political dirty tricks to distract from the issues that affect voters.\n\nRep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, a Florida Democrat who faces a primary challenge from Tim Canova on Feb. 20, resigned the chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee after leaked emails",
      "Crowdfunding has been an incredible boon to film, television, and music that's exploded in popularity in 2015, and it's on the rise now for videogames as well. And while it's clear that crowdfunding could be another game changer for the medium, what's less clear is whether it's still a worthwhile way for developers and publishers to raise funding.\n\nI don't mean in a negative way. Like many big tech advances, crowdfunding seems to have brought some incredibly innovative ideas to the table, such as Kickstarter's recent move to become an official partner with the App Store, or indie game development with crowd-funding campaigns. And many of the most promising crowdfunding projects are from small teams who are self-funded, like the indie platform Loom. Indeed, some say that the most innovative projects from the crowd-funded gaming scene are those whose creators are doing it solely out of passion.\n\nThere's a lot to love in the gaming crowdfunding scene for creative developers, but also a lot of risk. As game funding has grown, so too has the need to have a backup plan. In response, companies like Fig have emerged, a service that's supposed to provide an alternative to crowdfunding that would let developers fund their games more cheaply and more safely.\n\nThat idea is still in the developmental stages, but according to its co-founder and COO, Chris Dixon, game development crowdfunding has to do with a \"lot of risk.\" He recently spoke about the risk to Ars Technica, and in that lengthy, thoughtful Q&A, he touched on all kinds of topics. Here are some of the key takes from one of the country's foremost game industry experts:\n\nOn how indie game developers can be more successful with crowdfunded game development\n\nIf crowdfunding works for indie games, he says, \"there's no reason it can't work for big games as well.\" But it'll take a lot more money to keep those developers in business as traditional publishers who aren't taking any risks.\n\nFig has attracted the kind of heavy-hitting talent it says it wants, but, in turn, it's made its service more expensive. Dixon told us he wanted to give indies access to an alternative (no pun intended) to traditional publishers that wanted to take a punt on indie-friendly projects, but the platform has proven more expensive than he'd hoped. \"The risk of taking those risks is always there,\" he added.\n\nOn whether the traditional concept of publisher-developer relationships is necessarily a bad fit for the modern videogame industry\n\n\"I think there's an argument that publishers have been doing things wrong,\" Dixon said. \"It's hard to make a good game in the current environment when you get to a point where no one's even interested in making a game that's more than an arcade shooter. So I don't think you should blame publishers for that.\"\n\nHe added that his hope is that publishers will adapt their business more, but at this point, he says, that's just wishful thinking. \"[Publisher] companies have an incentive to try to push out the most profitable product as soon as possible and not take risks. They're not in it for the long haul. The fact that we have this idea of crowdfunding is a step in the right direction.\"\n\nOn the importance of independent developers taking on the risk of crowdfunding their games\n\nDixon also said his company wanted to help build a more sustainable business model for game developers, but said crowdfunding is not inherently bad (even if most game projects are). He compared crowdfunding to crowdfunding for a movie, where filmmakers get to choose the budget of their project in advance and see which projects can raise more money.\n\n\"How are you gonna fund a project when you can't see what the market thinks of it? And it doesn't have to be an arcade game,\" he added. He noted that with Fig, game backers can see if they want to fund a game that has the opportunity to reach a broader audience than one that may have fewer fans or fewer funds.\n\nIt's an interesting take on funding, but it's one we hear often from Hollywood studio executives: big-budget games are too risky, so they just won't happen. It's a view Dixon is well aware of, and he's working hard to get the industry better equipped to deal with the kind of risk he's talking about.\n\n\"It's one thing to be in a bubble and to ignore how we're making games. That's the same thing as not paying attention to how we can make money for our company,\" he said. \"I feel like we have to be open to the idea of taking big risks and doing more with the market. This is a step in that direction to me.\"",
      "The last few weeks, I've been working on getting 3ds Max for Unity to do it right. The problem was, as I mentioned in my previous post, we use a custom editor for this: a custom node based editor.\n\nI didn't want another UI, so I designed a node based editor in the Unity 5 engine. It's all about the nodes, which represent 3ds Max's own geometry. The nodes can then be manipulated with tools like 3D Touch. I'm still refining the system, but it's the first time I've used it to build a 3d model, and it doesn't look too bad so far.\n\nHere's the demo of the new system at work:\n\nIn the last post, I showed how to create nodes from scratch. That's all fine and good, but the nodes themselves are not as flexible. I wanted to be able to assign them to different objects, and even extend the hierarchy as needed. I needed a node as \"the backbone\" of this system, and that meant that everything else needed to be flexible to work with it.\n\nIn the Unity 5 demo, I created a mesh called \"mesh_head.nf\" which just looks kinda like a skull, and a bunch of geometry objects named \"eyes_head_1.nf\". As you can see, I have a mesh, a mask, a few vertices for vertex filtering and normals, and a few faces. I want the mask mesh to be able to represent a face, or a single eye. When I want to add multiple nodes, I'll add \"node_add_face_0.nf\", and \"node_add_eye_1.nf\" etc. Here's a diagram with all the nodes and how they relate:\n\nA few things are obvious:\n\nThe base mesh is based on a texture, and has three masks.\n\nThe mask is a 3x3 grid, and the vertices of the faces are all on the same axis.\n\nThe vertices can be rotated, flipped, and mirrored, since I'm using 3D Transform and Projection Matrix to rotate/flip/mirror the geometry geometry.\n\nThe mesh itself is a cube.\n\nWith these definitions, there's just one thing left to do: I need the edges, which will be a mesh's vertices themselves. I'll add triangles to these edges then. Here's my mesh mesh_head.nf (sorry about the image compression).\n\nFinally, I have to build a node system around that. What I started doing is the following:\n\nA \"node_add_face_0\" node would add a face mesh on whatever axis the face is, for example, \"0,30\".\n\nOn a vertex node, I've made a \"node_add_face_1\" node to add a face mesh on each axis perpendicular to the axis.\n\nOn a rotation node, I've made a \"node_add_eye_1\" node to add a face mesh on each axis in opposite directions, for example, \"0,45\".\n\nThere's a mesh and mask mesh in each of the five axes corresponding to the five faces. We can't just rotate or flip a mesh node by doing a \"node_add_face_1\"\n\n… so I have to figure out some way to \"map\" to a specific axis a single axis mesh node. I decided to have my nodes as a grid:\n\nEach axis node represents a point in space. You can find nodes on a specific axis simply by using this technique:\n\nTake two points in space, then use that point as a pivot axis to generate a point in space. The center of a node is the \"nodes center\", and you take one of its vertices as the vertex offset. The other vertex is then the point to get the face mesh out of. You can do this with a cube or any solid shape:\n\nI know that's not what you want, but you can try it. Then you can rotate or flip the cube by doing a \"node_add_eye_1\" node. If you want your mesh to be centered, make the first mesh node to have the first vertex offset from the center.\n\nThere are a bunch of little wrinkles in the graph that I need to clean up, but here's an approximation of what the graph would look like based on the basic concept:\n\nAs you can see, that's not that different from what we have now. The mesh nodes are also represented in three numbers, so it's not a big deal. I will also probably not use the \"node_add_face_1\" node. That's a bit complicated, and not easy to create. Instead, I'll probably try to make an \"edge_mask\" node for each axis node, that contains a 4x4x4 matrix",
      "If there was any doubt that Microsoft had a big push to give Windows Phone users a new phone in the form of the Lumia 535, the company is proving it on October 28 when it holds its \"Windows Phone 8.1\" preview event in San Francisco.\n\nThe Windows Phone team will be in a great position. It will have a few weeks to fine-tune the product and get it approved for production. This should be an easy job considering that the Lumia 535 is very similar to recent Lumia models, and is also based on the same phone processor at 1.2GHz, so it's a good match for the Windows 7-based OS.\n\nWith the Microsoft Store to play host to the event, I believe that the phones will hit retail shelves within a few weeks. The phones will be available in black or white, not surprisingly, and will come in 32GB, 128GB, and 512GB storage variants.\n\nBut don't be in the dark. The Lumia 535 isn't a perfect successor to the Lumia 520 and could be the first real successor to Nokia's aging 808 PureView smartphone.\n\nLumia 535 specs\n\nAt a first look, there's almost nothing new about these specs. The Lumia 535 features a 5-inch ClearBlack LCD screen, 1.2 GHz processor, 1GB of RAM, dual-SIM capability, 8 or 16GB of built-in storage space, a microSD card slot, 4.3-megapixel rear camera and a 1.9-megapixel front camera with LED flash.\n\nIt's also a bit thinner and lighter than a recent Lumia phone—which makes sense given that the design doesn't include a physical keyboard or navigation buttons.\n\nThe 535 will support dual SIM cards, so you could easily keep two different carriers and use your own SIM card or the Microsoft Nano SIM card in one hand.\n\nThere are also a few new features. One is the addition of a front camera, which helps the phone take better pictures. There's also the addition of an accelerometer and proximity sensor—something that I don't think any Nokia Lumia has had before.\n\nThe Lumia 535 could be the first Windows Phone 8.1 powered phone. And, although Microsoft has been silent about the spec, according to my sources, the phones will come equipped with the same \"Windows Phone 8.1\" software that's been running on older Lumia models. But it's probably the lack of an external camera lens and sensor sensor that will be the biggest surprise among fans.\n\nLumia 535 price\n\nThe device that Nokia showed off during its October 26 announcement event cost $400. Microsoft is reportedly planning to charge $450 to $500 for the Lumia 535. While we still can't confirm these numbers, it is definitely a different price range, and could be a good trade-off compared to the $300 price of the Lumia 820. It's also a different size and shape than an 820.\n\nEven with the higher price, the Lumia 535 could be a good option if you want to get a great device with a bit of a different feel. You might be more comfortable with this device if you don't mind using Windows Phone for a few months to see if Windows Phone devices can really compete with Android and iOS.\n\n\nWindows Phone fans should look forward to this October 28 event. If you plan to attend and want one of your own, there should be many people that will let you have one of their phones for free. I suggest checking out the official Microsoft Store and showing your enthusiasm for Windows Phone. Just don't expect to see any Windows Phone devices other than this one on day one.",
      "\"This is our second try at building a modular system—the first one was a failure,\" said Michael V. P. Stoll, of the University of Colorado at Boulder.\n\nThe Colorado team's \"cascade modules\" consist of smaller-scale buildings of various sizes, separated from one another by an open floor space between them. When combined, they create something that looks like two massive, interconnected buildings, each with its own small \"footprint,\" as Mr. Stoll described it.\n\nOne of the modules is in a prototype stage when it is being built here; the other is about to begin construction, to be followed later by a third stage that will be erected along the Colorado River in Utah. The team's work is part of a larger effort to build a modular system, which Mr. Stoll calls a \"system architecture,\" as opposed to a building, which he says is not sustainable and cannot be built in great numbers.\n\nPhoto\n\n\"We are trying to develop an architecture around something that is modular so that you don't have to add a bunch of buildings with different shapes and designs and sizes,\" he said. \"You can build them as modular systems with their own architecture. You can just put these things together and start having some sort of collective architecture in your landscape.\"\n\nEach of the modules in the cascade are designed to be assembled by robots that can lift and position individual modules around a central structure. The systems can be built on a relatively large scale, said David H. Korten, of UCR's Institute of Biotechnology, and on a smaller scale, by a human worker using a handpiece to attach them together, using a tool to drill holes in their bases to connect them to a third piece or by attaching them to a frame that can be towed across a field in flat pieces that are welded together once assembled.\n\nThe cascade modules would be used in areas of the country, particularly in desert landscapes, where a lot of desert has been cleared for agriculture. In addition to the three prototypes, Mr. Stoll is working on another that is designed to be modular on a much smaller scale, but with a more sophisticated assembly and structure, he said.\n\nThe technology has attracted interest from developers and government agencies in the United States and elsewhere. Some researchers at UCR and elsewhere are investigating ways that the cascade modules might be incorporated into the building materials and energy systems of the future, said Dr. Korten, and they plan to use the cascade design as a basis for their work.",
      "\"The story of my life really starts with a question.\" -- Charles Dickens, A Tale of Two Cities\n\nIt can be hard to get to know somebody who doesn't care to share a little about themselves with others. When you don't want to share your details, you tend not to worry too much about who else knows what and when they find out.\n\nBut as you know, the Internet has created the biggest search engine on the planet...not just for information but for the way people want to find things out about themselves. It's been a long time since most people needed a search engine, but it's one that's always ready to help.\n\nSo, when did we stop caring about other people and start taking a personal interest in ourselves?\n\nThe first major shift was a reaction to the idea of \"secrets\" and it was called \"secrecy.\" We've seen lots of changes since then about the way we discuss, think, and behave. We also have the tools to get at some of the \"dark matter\" that makes up the human soul: fear, desire, insecurity, and regret are all just part of the picture. We have a tool that helps our brains make the right decisions: introspection.\n\nWhat if I told you you could use this tool to help you change? One of the most powerful personal development techniques of our era is introspection. If you want to improve your life, introspect about your behavior and emotions, and use this method of self-understanding to change your own life. The technique is simple, straightforward, and makes an excellent foundation for personal development.\n\nTo do this, we need your consent. Let me share a few principles with you, and then I'll tell you exactly how to apply it to your life.\n\nOne of the most important elements of introspection is the use of the \"I\" language. The first step is to define \"YOU.\" We all have many different \"I's\" inside of us, and some feel more confident than others, as you're just beginning your transformation into a more whole person, but this isn't just a personality trait -- these are all different parts of who you really are. It's the whole you that needs to be explored. Identify where your negative energy is coming from and try to find that place. Identify the things you hate, so you can change what it takes to make your life better.\n\nWhat does \"good\" look like to you? Where does it come from? This isn't just talk -- you'll really feel a change in yourself when this question is answered. It's one of the key keys to developing your real strengths while developing your \"true self.\"\n\nAs you begin to explore, you'll find that things happen and develop where you least expected them to. Your \"good\" side can become less like a blanket statement and more like an actual living, breathing person. You will find that while some things in your life may change, a lot others won't. Some things will only happen when you want them to. And this is the true power of this technique: by asking these questions and finding out what really changes in you, you will be able to identify what you need -- and you'll be able to make improvements. You may change your behavior by changing just one thing that you're afraid of.\n\nWhen you get the courage to really do this and have the courage to ask yourself hard questions about what your true self wants -- and not just what you think you want -- that's the part that's often the hardest to change. You may need to ask questions you've never been able to answer before. This will be something you do alone, on your own time, not when everyone is asleep and you're afraid to face your fears. It will feel hard, but it will be worth it. There's no way it has to be easy. Don't worry about the things you're afraid to ask for. Don't worry about what others think. Don't worry about whether you sound stupid, annoying, or a loser. This is all self-guided, and it will be rewarding.\n\nOnce you get a better handle on yourself, you may also start seeing things in a new way. You'll see the importance of what YOU want and how hard it is for you to get it. If you are feeling lonely, you may begin to realize that you may not want to be with that person. Maybe you want more out of life. You may notice you don't like your job, and you'll see that you need to find something worth loving more than your job.\n\nPerhaps you notice that you're not as excited about some of your friends. Maybe you're not feeling emotionally fulfilled in your relationships and you're starting to wonder if you're \"missing out.\" If a friend of yours is having trouble, you may realize they're really just hurting themselves. Or maybe you realize that you may not like some of your friends and that they could",
      "Rookie is an online magazine and book series for teenagers. Each month, a different editorial theme drives the writing, photography, and artwork that we publish. Learn more about us here , and find out how to submit your work here !\n\nAugust is here and that means that the first wave of fall colors is upon us. If you're planning on wearing any of the autumn color pops — be it rich cobalt or vivid pumpkin orange — be sure to check your favorite brands from last fall. These are the ones I know and adore (and you probably might too!):\n\nL'Oreal\n\nThe color palette of this brand is as unique as their cosmetics. I've found that every color from the top of the palette looks especially good on me. L'Oreal creates their own custom color collection — they offer it up in eight shades with an option for every skintone: ivory, peach, plum, red, purple, black, and white.\n\nIf you're in the market to try an entire color range, you're in luck. The brand's colors were developed specifically for each of its products — like eyeshadow palettes, blush formulas, and lip products.\n\nWhat I love about L'Oreal's color selection is that each item is as unique and distinctive as the person who's wearing it. I've always been drawn to the gorgeous packaging designs and the gorgeous color displays: I also love how they've managed to create new and exciting shades with ease. For example, the new rose-gold lipstick shades are so unique that I've seen similar ones in Paris and Paris-M.\n\nSephora\n\nThis brand has been around since the 1970s, but for our generation it's new — and exciting! They offer four shades of fall cosmetics, all of which are highly pigmented and long wearing. In past years Sephora has created their own custom color range each year, and they also feature other popular lipsticks and eye colors from other brands.\n\nOf these four shades, I love the gorgeous gold-red, gold-taupe, silver-green, and deep-magenta shades most. I also adore the new shades, ranging from rich cobalt to bright orange and even deep purples. I've heard that the new lip tints from Sephora are quite unique, too!\n\nThis month, it's my favorite to use their lip tints — they're so smooth, and they apply a lot easier. Their lip stains give me that natural flush my lips are known for — and because they come in a gorgeous, lip-safe case with an adhesive, it's easy to use and apply.\n\nMacy's\n\nMacy's has four shades in their fall cosmetics and I love them — and I mean I've worn them all! The rich pumpkin peach is perfect for the fall months and the orange and rose-gold are just as lovely. I especially love the new rich red. While I haven't been a fan of past reds, I think the new, brighter reds are just as eye-catching.\n\nThe new \"fall colors\" from Macy's make use of the brand's \"frosted skin\" collection — a makeup look inspired by a makeup routine that we've all been trying. It's a combination of skin perfecting colors that also include skin-tone lipstick and eyeshadow.\n\nFor a look that looks amazing on everyone (and not just those of us with pale skin), you can apply each of these four color shades, just like you would to create a new look on yourself. (Note: Macy's uses a more neutral pink for this look.)\n\nToo Faced\n\nToo Faced has been around for a while, but they offer some special Fall colors in their packaging. I love the cool-toned red-orange that is perfect for a fall wardrobe. I've also been wearing the new orange-beige, as it compliments my complexion just enough that I don't feel it looks too artificial.\n\nA friend's boyfriend told me that they also do some stunning eyeshadow palettes. If you're a fan of the products from the Too Faced makeup line, you're going to adore their brand new fall shadows, which will make you instantly look like a beauty mogul!\n\nDolce & Gabbana\n\nDo you like the idea of buying a full face of colorful, wearable makeup items, but not wanting to spend as much? Do you want to see some other color palettes with vibrant, complex colors? Then Dolce & Gabbana is the brand you've been looking for. These fall colors include three different blushes (taupe, rosy burgundy, and mauve), three lip colors (coral, plum, and green), and eight eye shadows (pink-lavender, burgundy, plum, blue-lavender, light mauvey, dark mauve, burgundy",
      "I think that the way the game was designed was the way the game was developed.\n\nThe way the game was designed by Square is the way the game is developed by Square.\n\nSo you have to keep the people that worked with that team happy because otherwise it's almost impossible to make a game that is going to be as successful as Kingdom Hearts.\n\nIn terms of how long did it take you to make the game?\n\nWell, we have to start from Square for sure because it was going to be an action game, so it had to be done from Square. There was going to be a story going into Kingdom Hearts 3, and it just so happens that Square had just published the PSP version of Kingdom Hearts 2, so our development team had all of that development experience.\n\nSo we went in as if we were just starting the franchise. We took what Square had given us and put it into the new game, and I think that's an incredible amount of trust by Square to give it to us.\n\nThe Final Fantasy franchise has had a long history, going all the way back to the Famicom in the Famicom Disk System. But Kingdom Hearts took it to a new level of quality and scale. It's a series that's really been around for a really long time; in some ways it's been in its deathbed for a long time.\n\nAnd the reason for that is because the action titles of the 90s are now so well-known, they've become kind of jumbled up with each other.\n\nThere's a big difference between doing a big-scale action title and a smaller-scale action title. It's so much fun to do both.\n\nSo the way we approached it was the way we approached it is the way we approached it. Not by telling someone that we were going to do Kingdom Hearts 3, but telling everyone else that we were going to do Kingdom Hearts 3, and we'd be doing it in our free time, not worrying about anything and just focusing on it.\n\nWhen we started working on Kingdom Hearts 3 in 2010, I think it was pretty much the same team that was with us back in 1999. I also had a few additions when I joined the development for the third game because when we started the 3D version in 1999, when I quit the Square project, I was already having success with Kingdom Hearts Re:Chain of Memories, so I wanted to take it even further and make a bigger, better game. And so we built a new art team and we built in a new character designer and we built in a new audio director. We were building a lot of different things on Kingdom Hearts 3.\n\nIn some ways I think Kingdom Hearts was a little bit slow to catch on back then, because I think Square didn't really give it the benefit of the doubt that we could come back and make it a success. So a lot of people didn't give it enough time. I think a lot of people were saying, 'What's going on with the game, it's been over, it's been finished five times already.'\n\nAnd I know that I think a lot of people had forgotten what Kingdom Hearts was before I joined the team. And once I got in, I think the team did start to enjoy what they were doing even more and they really got into it, and I can tell you with honesty, the games themselves became much better.\n\nSo Kingdom Hearts 3 ended up being a pretty unique experience to me as far as my involvement. Not the game itself, but in what we had going on.\n\nWhat were some of the things that you were thinking about when you were making Kingdom Hearts 3?\n\nWell, we had some thoughts because it was, in hindsight, a really good time for the franchise to come back. Kingdom Hearts 2 was a lot of fun for people that played it because it was a big, huge game, but it was hard for people to appreciate when Kingdom Hearts 3 was released at this time because it was so difficult for people to appreciate that it was a big game.\n\nIt was hard for people to appreciate why we did what we did with it, like with the Kingdom Hearts Orchestra for the Nintendo 3DS, which was really cool. Not that it was a huge success, but it was a cool way to reach out to people that didn't have the hardware to get the game.\n\nOr the game we are working on now in the Final Fantasy series called Final Fantasy XV that I'm really excited about. What it does in terms of bringing our vision for gameplay to life really makes my hair stand up on end because it's not any one thing that people think about us, it's the combination of everything. And I get excited and I get excited about all of them, but the combination of those things together I'm really excited about.\n\nWhat do you think of how the new trailer for Kingdom Hearts III compares with some other video game trailers for upcoming",
      "A few months ago I wrote an article on \" Why I don't love the Google app \". The article was about the fact that I no longer care for the Google+ service and the fact that as I learned, Google doesn't care for much of anything either. I still think there's a lot of stuff Google just doesn't love and probably never will. You know when you get up to leave a room, walk in, look in the other direction and realize people in the room are just standing up and chatting in passing? That's how I felt about this whole Google+ service, which seems to offer nothing of value anymore.\n\n\nI'm now about to make a prediction: there's a pretty good chance that Google will kill this whole thing, unless Google has a few more big-time stars lined up to show me otherwise. So I'm making a suggestion.\n\nThe suggestion is that instead of launching a new Google product or launching and acquiring a new service. Google should kill both the Google+ app and the Google+ social network.\n\n\nHere's why... The Google+ app, as we know, has been slowly rotting for two years. It's no longer fun to use nor is it a fun experience to use. Google made numerous changes, and they made them in a completely unorganized way. The main problem with those changes is that they really hurt the Google+ app experience in order to make Google+ look \"cool\" (and maybe improve Google+ in the long run). At this point, the Google+ app is kind of like a broken record. No matter how often it's updated, Google just doesn't seem to listen to what it has to say. The latest update just added a bunch of things you didn't really use. But let's just talk about the actual social side.\n\n\nGoogle+ was created to be a platform for many Google products, many of which are now dead or have no idea what Google+ even is. When asked to talk about Google+ we get a blank stare... like the kid you get at your high school who's always saying \"I don't get it.\" And you can't tell him that \"Hey, I did a thing for you. Let's talk about that.\" So now you can only talk to him about things related to his job at Google or his job at Comcast (or whatever is in between, haha). Google Plus was also supposed to be a place where you could come and hang out, share photos with each other and talk about new stuff with your friends. It was supposed to be fun. And when that isn't happening, all sorts of people start to get angry, because they don't see the appeal of it anymore. At least with Google I think we now know who's angry at Google.\n\n\nIf Google doesn't pull the plug on this particular service at this moment, there are plenty of other options to help you find more information on the Google+, Google+ and Google+ social networks. If you read this far, maybe you already know the best way to search for Google+ in your region to find other people to talk in private with you. Searching in other languages for Google+ are also an option. Also, we can all check out Google's old Google+ social network page here - that old site is now closed and defunct. Don't feel bad for the Google+ team - it had to go to some crazy lengths to try to impress us with itself.\n\nOne would think that Google would learn something from the demise of Facebook and try to make something that actually matters. Instead the Google+ app is simply just a way to show off all the stuff it knows about. But what a way to waste our time!\n\nUpdate: Google has finally given the green light to making this kind of experiment more frequent. A \"Google+ Lite\" app will be launched for all Google+ members who have signed up for Google+.\n\n\nIf you would like to take a tour of the Google+ Lite app, check out the link below.\n\nPhoto by julial.",
      "I just saw this book. Can I read it?\n\nIn the midst of his latest political misadventures (I haven't read any of them, so I can't comment), Justin Trudeau wants to get himself in the limelight again by appearing in a play—in the new world, in which he will be remembered, like George W. Bush, but probably less fondly and for no different reasons. \"Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's life-changing first day in the world of theater,\" reads the flyer that was offered to those who wished to purchase the print version of \"Canada's Great Play: Justin and his Enemies.\"\n\nThe book will be of interest primarily to Canadians who wish to know how a self-described \"very cool guy\" who has made it to the pinnacle of political power has ended up playing a villain in a stage adaptation of a novel published in English nearly a decade ago.\n\nOn the surface, that book reads like an exercise in political satire: The author, Richard Lloyd Parry, makes light of various scandals, including the Liberals' attempt to get Trudeau to run for the presidency in 2004 and how his wife, Sophie, had been accused of running afoul of the House of Commons ethics watchdog over the cost of her wedding cake. Trudeau and former prime minister Paul Martin are both presented as uncharismatic politicians and not-so-smart advisors. By all accounts, Justin did not enjoy these portrayals at the time. He was a popular prime minister, and by his side he had his wife, a woman he adored.\n\nBut, in the last decade in Canada, the country as a whole has become increasingly conservative. It was easy to ridicule Parry's play: After all, the first line of the script, as paraphrased by the Globe and Mail, contains the words: \"If this play is too controversial for your family, then this one is too too for your family.\" More recently, it was easy to mock the author's portrayal of the former prime minister.\n\nBy contrast, the Liberal Party of Canada wants the play to be a hit. In a statement, the party said: \"The story we are telling in this play reflects the aspirations of people across the country. The Liberal Party of Canada believes in hard work; it believes in equality of opportunity; it believes in opportunity—not as an entitlement or a right, but as an achievement we earn.\"\n\nFor Parry, a Canadian author who lives in the United States, the play represents an attempt to explore how his nation functions as a democratic, pluralistic society that tolerates differing political opinions in a political environment in which being on the political right is a \"normal life circumstance.\" \"What's interesting about this story is that it has a lot of similarities with today's Canada,\" he said in an interview.\n\nAccording to the Globe and Mail, the play is slated to run for three weeks. Parry said he will be playing himself, but that he has not decided whether or not he will be wearing a suit. (He may also choose to play himself as a man with no clothes, as in the famous line from the song \"Cecile.\") In the play, Trudeau makes a last-ditch attempt to help his political party take power by staging a coup against the opposition party.\n\nOf course, this is all satire. But a Canadian government official who asked to be identified only as a \"lobbyist\" told me that this play will likely be very popular with his members. \"People will laugh. As for whether they'll believe me, I doubt it,\" he said. \"They'll see him doing all these things that are ridiculous, [and] they're not going to see Justin doing it as Trudeau.\"\n\nIndeed, Trudeau has already proven himself to be very, very bad at being himself. Last spring, he refused to apologize for a 2005 video in which he appeared to congratulate Barack Obama—at one point saying that, as a Canadian, he admired the president—and later attempted to suggest it was merely the product of his former mentor's influence over him. When Canadian soldiers in Afghanistan were killed last year and the government finally called them by their names—Gerald Donaldson, Daniel Jean, Patrick Brazeau—he said, \"As a father, as a grandfather, I have no thoughts or feelings about the individual who may have been involved. I've lost precious friends.\" When a French-speaking Quebec student who had been denied entrance into the United States was murdered this summer, Trudeau took a day off and refused to answer questions; his spokesman, Gerald Butts, said, \"He had a personal, private matter to attend to and has been distracted by a series of other personal commitments.\"\n\nFor the Liberal Party of Canada, however, the play's political content is irrelevant, since, as its spokesman put it, Canadians are far more interested in \"the play itself, its humor, its characters.\"",
      "This is the story of one young woman who has been fighting for her right to have equal rights for most of her life and, to those who say this is simply a matter of a handful of women getting married, I have this to say: It's not.\n\nIf you think this is about a few women getting married, or just two, or just a few years ago, or just the case of a wealthy couple, who's trying to stop their child growing up to be poor, or just the case of a few women getting married because it's the legal tradition of their parents, you do a disservice to your own understanding of what marriage is on this island and why it matters.\n\nIt's actually much larger than you might imagine. A recent Pew Research study shows that one out of every three Americans are in a relationship, and about half of them, a third of all American women in same-sex relationships, are in relationships with women.\n\nThis is more people than the total population of the state of Rhode Island, combined, but that's an exaggeration too.\n\nMost of us would be surprised to hear that one in four women in this country have had a same-sex relationship, and one in four, a higher half, also have a relationship with a woman other than their spouse.\n\nYet to the people who argue you're just talking about a handful of women getting married, I say: That's the story of your own lives, if you think it's relevant. I was raised in a household without a mom, which meant my entire education was based on me and my sister working a series of menial jobs while my father and step-dad worked hard trying to provide for us. My family lived together while my mom was still married to my biological dad. My dad lived alone, and he was the one to raise me as my own sister was growing up.\n\nThe same thing today of my own upbringing and my own family. We were raised by the men in our lives. I've never had a father figure, I don't have a paternal figure in my life -- that's an idea I came to with this campaign. I've spent so much of my life looking for one who wasn't around.\n\nI'm talking now specifically to white, middle-class voters, who don't typically talk about things like marriage equality because they don't want to be seen as \"homophobic\" or \"racist,\" or else as \"pro-life\" if it is to be a political issue. But as I was talking to voters who aren't like me -- who live together on their own and don't have the same kinds of social and economic challenges I've lived with -- it was clear that these kinds of challenges are real for many more American families and people.\n\nMany people who live alone, or on a smaller income, or who live in communities with fewer jobs because of the trade deals and outsourcing, or who feel they've lost a sense of community support are also struggling to keep their marriages together and remain faithful. Many people feel the same way about their families.\n\nAnd when you add this new element of same-sex relationships to the equation, you're seeing the effects of the economic uncertainty and insecurity that many of us see in our daily lives.\n\nI was talking with David Blustein, a gay writer who has a blog called \"I Love Gay People,\" and said that I was in the first camp he's ever met -- the camp of people who are still struggling to define themselves, but also struggling with marriage as a political issue.\n\nHe told me about a conversation he had with a friend of his where he said, \"Oh, you know what, I've always known we all matter. What I was wondering is what's next? How do we define ourselves now that we've figured out who we are? Is it now that marriage equality becomes an issue? And if people are already starting to define themselves differently, why not make that a political issue in 2014?\"\n\nHe's right that the economic and social insecurity we experience everyday means this is an issue the American people are going to have to think about and fight for in 2014. But the question is whether we can do enough to win marriage equality before it's too late.\n\nI'll leave you with this. This issue of people defining themselves doesn't happen by itself, and the people we have to help redefine themselves in new and unexpected ways are the people in this room tonight.\n\nI'm not trying to get you off the marriage equality train. In just the last decade we've seen people come out of the closet and become activists and politicians. The momentum is on our side.\n\nIf anyone's asking for my vote, I'm going to vote \"yes\" for marriage equality. And if anyone's wondering what that actually means beyond just having full equality, that I've got to get to the bottom of some questions I've got about marriage equality and marriage, that's",
      "(CBS) — A Chicago police officer who worked undercover on a murder case was charged in federal court with theft for allegedly taking part in a scheme in which he sold counterfeit drugs while posing as a police informant.\n\nTyrone Holmes, 27, was ordered arrested on Tuesday after two days of testimony by a federal grand jury, according to the U.S. attorney's office for the Northern District of Illinois.\n\nHolmes was arrested on Tuesday after an FBI investigation that began in 2010, CBS 2's Mai Martinez reported.\n\nAuthorities allege that in October 2009, Holmes sold cocaine, marijuana, mushrooms and psychedelic mushrooms to various individuals in the vicinity of the 5111 block of South State Street, according to the U.S. attorney's office.",
      "After months of silence after its launch last fall but renewed optimism this week, a company that claims to provide a new class of internet services known as \"over-the-top\" (OTT) has been quietly working to attract big media names — like CBS, CNN and even Time Warner — to the platform.\n\nThe news website CNET, the blog Gawker and the company itself all described deals worth an estimated $4.8 billion, with Time Warner to be rolled out first, starting in 2015. There has never been any public evidence, although some insiders have suggested the firms have entered in non-disclosure agreements.\n\nAccording to CNET and others, these deals could be the first steps toward delivering a more high-quality and consumer-focused internet. It could also spell trouble for the companies that buy access to OTT services.\n\nThe news comes as a result of a growing body of debate about over-the-top services like HBO Now, Hulu and YouTube. Opponents like Dish Network, Facebook and others worry that the new services are bad for consumers, but consumer advocates and content owners say they can help to lower the cost of a subscription, and also offer consumers more choice.\n\nWhile the new deals would provide a boost to these services, they won't do much to change the way HBO does business.\n\n\"A lot of this is really about how the networks can gain customers and get them to spend more money,\" said Ben Thompson, an analyst at BTIG.\n\nA cable TV network is a big business, and HBO has its eyes on making more money. It's also just one of many companies that will enter the OTT world.\n\nThat's the theory anyway. CNET first pointed out the OTT deals Tuesday, noting CBS would be available from a number of carriers, including AT&T, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, Sprint and Dish Network, and would be available exclusively for streaming on the PlayStation 3 and 4, PlayStation Vue and Apple TV, but not at home.\n\nThe new deals appear to be the beginning of a big push by HBO and CBS to draw more eyeballs to their services. CBS has also signed a deal worth $1.5 billion to offer original programming on the OTT platform for two years.\n\nIn its announcement Monday, HBO noted that the new OTT platform will be available via smartphones and TV streaming devices, including its own hardware. OTT is a popular way, but HBO is trying to make the most of streaming because you can watch it anywhere.\n\n\"As a pioneer in the over-the-top space, HBO NOW has embraced cutting-edge technology to deliver HBO to a global audience of fans everywhere,\" said Bill Hill, HBO president of programming, and Michael Lombardo, HBO's SVP content and innovation, in a press release. \"With this new programming partnership, viewers will be able to stream original HBO programming directly to their TV screens.\"\n\nThe HBO deal with CBS is the biggest, and one that many had expected. HBO has had its eyes on CBS for years and has been pursuing the deal.\n\n\"We have been in constant dialogue with both CBS and Time Warner during the course of the last six months,\" Hill told CNBC, adding that HBO is always open to talking with any major media company.\n\n\"But there have no deals on the table at all for HBO,\" he said of the new deal with CBS.\n\nHill said there hasn't been much discussion about a deal with CNN, which already owns the sports network and has a huge digital channel called HLN that is aimed straight at millennials — just as CNN is aimed at the millennial audience. The cable giant has made no secret about the fact that it is interested in getting younger audiences to subscribe to its own cable channels, and the deal with CNN is another step in that direction.\n\nA Time Warner spokesman declined to confirm the price for its exclusive OTT deal with HBO, or to comment on whether or not the company had entered into a non-disclosure agreement.\n\nTime Warner also said it's in discussions with other media outlets \"who can offer high-quality and reliable OTT services through a multiplatform strategy.\"\n\nTime Warner also announced it has struck a deal to pay $160 million a year annually in perpetuity to stream NFL games to subscribers of its DirecTV service and will now be paying $3.15 per subscriber per month for its ESPN, which is a major selling point for this new strategy.\n\nThese numbers and those for HBO suggest these new services could be attractive to the big television conglomerates, but there are more serious challenges.\n\n\"It's always more important to go for scale on something where you need to,\" Thompson said. \"The big cable companies have some of the strongest markets in the world, and HBO has had some of the strongest, because they've been dominant in their time.\"\n\nThat's why it's difficult for a new OTT service to gain",
      "In early March, an Australian man was arrested by Malaysian authorities when they uncovered a web of links with Islamic State to sell the services of fighters, arms and vehicles to militant groups in Syria, Iraq, Libya and other countries.\n\nAccording to Malaysian police, the man, a 22-year-old Malaysian, recruited at least three other Malaysians and a Pakistani-American as part of the network, which was allegedly run out of the Malaysia's largest shopping mall.\n\nThe arrests were described as an \"unprecedented collaboration\" by Malaysia's special branch spokesman Azharuddin Abdul Rahman at a press conference on March 21.\n\nAccording to Abdul Rahman, Australian citizens Abdirahman Bashir and his brother Khalid were involved in the scheme, which he said was discovered by Malaysian police after they arrested a 28-year-old Malaysian man suspected of working as a terrorist recruiter.\n\nAlthough the police have not released any details about who was arrested or the charges against, the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation says it believes several Australians have joined up with militant groups that have been fighting in Syria and Iraq.\n\nIn the last year, Australian officials have reported witnessing increased number of young Australians travelling to Syria and Iraq to fight in the war.\n\nAustralia's security agencies estimate there are up to 700 Australians fighting in the region, with around 200 of them believed to be connected to militants fighting with Islamic State.\n\nOne of the country's most senior security officials, David Irvine, in March said that Australia's intelligence agencies have not been able to identify a clear pattern of Australians fighting in the conflict, but that there were \"quite significant numbers of young people in the radicalised community, some who are here, some who are going.\"\n\nAccording to the federal Attorney-General's Department, it estimates between 800 to 1,300 Australians are fighting alongside terrorist forces in Syria or Iraq. In addition to the 700 Australians fighting, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade estimates that around 450 are supporting extremists in Iraq and Syria. Of these, it claims 30 have been killed.\n\nMeanwhile, the country's domestic intelligence agency says that the number of Australians radicalised in recent years to fight in Iraq and Syria has risen by 40 percent in the last couple of years, with one in three young Australians expressing sympathy for the militants. It is believed to be the largest percentage of sympathisers it has recorded. The report, by the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation says these figures are likely to be a significant underestimate. It says there has been a 50 percent rise in radicalisation of young Australians in the last five to 10 years.\n\nIn a report published in March, Counter Terrorism International (CTI) identified 20 Australians among the roughly 120 foreign fighters from 72 countries who have been killed in Iraq and Syria. This number represents an increase of 20 percent from the number of international \"martyrs\" identified in a 2009 report, and it suggests that the number of Australians engaged in the conflict could be higher.\n\nAccording to the report, one Australian suicide bomber in Iraq was of Syrian descent, and another had converted to Islam in prison. CTI also said that while an increasing number of Australian fighters were from Queensland and New South Wales, a number of Australians travelled to Syria from Melbourne and Sydney and were radicalized locally. The total Australian death toll is listed as at least 120, but it does not include any casualties from Australia's \"special forces\"-type operations, which are part of a wider strategy to train and help local forces.\n\nIt is the country's government, according to Counter Terrorism International, which seems particularly concerned about the growing number of Australians fighting for Islamic State. At a press conference on March 27, Malcom Turnbull expressed concern that Australia's efforts to stop the flow of fighters, including at home, appeared not to have succeeded:\n\n\"Clearly the issue has come to a head, the issue of radicalisation, where is it happening, how do we stop it? How do you prevent Australians from going to Syria to fight against Australia?\"\n\nAt the press conference, the prime minister asked other members of parliament to \"start looking for opportunities to work together\" to counter extremism in Australia, with a particular focus on identifying and tracking \"the people who may be plotting something in Australia, or who may be coming back from overseas to have contact in Australia with terrorists, with criminals, with people who don't want to come to Australia, just to say please come and kill some Australians\" — an apparent reference to the Islamic State (IS, formerly ISIS/ISIL) threats.\n\n\"The danger is that we might, in the course of the debate we'll have, be distracted from the core questions and not focus on the real source of the problem,\" Turnbull said. \"It is not just in the Middle East but across Asia and Europe that we have faced the same challenges of radicalisation.\"\n\n\"The reality is that this is a direct threat to Australia. What is happening now here is a direct threat to us all,\" Turnbull explained.",

      "\n\"A little less color.\" That could be said of a lot of games on PS4 this month, but it wasn't a compliment that came from PlayStation's marketing team this past June. A PlayStation 4 demo called Journey was being shown off at some trade shows, and a screenshot was accidentally posted to a public PlayStation message board. The image, however, was much bolder in color than the demo shown, and many people questioned why it was being shown at all. Then another image was leaked showing Journey playing on the PS4, and this time, it was actually a bit brighter. Again, it was a public image so there was no way the marketing department could know, but they should have. It wasn't a matter of not being \"colorful\" or anything, but there were some subtle differences between the demo and the final product. In fact, a more recent demo, Call of Duty: Black Ops 3, was shown at Tokyo Game Show playing with a PS4 controller which uses the same PlayStation Move controllers that came with Call of Duty: Ghosts before the game launched and even features the same controller, but it looks much bigger in size – something I believe marketing has been working towards for years.\n\nAs it stands now, there are two ways for you to experience the PlayStation 4 as a console that will be selling for at least $400 when it launches March 17. Sony and Microsoft are going to have their games out before you can see them in stores, and you can pre-order and pick up the PS4 at a handful of stores online – Best Buy, GameStop, and Amazon. At around $400 it seems like Sony's pricing strategy is working out, as well as their marketing plan to convince gamers that the system is something new and different.\n\nSony wants the PS4 to be a \"powerful and innovative gaming station,\" as the first PlayStation console had been on the market for two years before the second game debuted. It's also aimed at bringing the traditional video game audience as well as people that are just looking for a new device that fits a more interactive lifestyle. The PlayStation 4 isn't as powerful as the PS3 and has a low-power processor called the Cell GPU at its heart which runs at up to 500MHz, compared to the PS3's 720MHz. This means the PS4 won't have a Blu-ray drive and lacks hard drive size compared to the PS3. It also doesn't support 4K playback in all of their games as the PS4 has a 4.77-inch screen and is 1080p at 720p native resolution. Those that really want the best of the best will have to take their games to PC and do it with an external storage device.\n\nMicrosoft, on the other hand, is putting a lot of resources into marketing the Xbox One and their games in general. Microsoft and Bungie are also very specific about how their Xbox One will be marketed from start to finish, and they're going to make sure every word comes out with a clear message of what is available for both the launch and future versions of the console. The PS4 will only launch with three game titles and then add more throughout its lifespan – Destiny, Halo 5, and the much-anticipated Titanfall. They've confirmed that the PS4 will require a standard Blu-ray drive and will play games in a Blu-ray disc format, not in a proprietary format like the PS3. The PS4 is scheduled for launch in North America on Nov. 15 and in Europe on Nov. 29, but it may be a little longer than that since they recently started sending out pre-orders earlier.

      "Rudy's Deli: The Bronx-based pizza parlor, which has five locations in the Bronx, has raised $13.5 million in a deal with private equity firm Apollo Global Management that will be disclosed when the deal closes, people familiar with the situation said.\n\nAccording to reports and people briefed on the matter, the deal between the two sides includes a 10 percent stake in Apollo in addition to the $1.8 million that Apollo invested in the restaurants.\n\nApollo declined to comment.\n\nIn announcing a plan to sell to Apollo earlier this year, the company said it hoped to raise at least $40 million in the deal. Apollo's investment will be included in that amount.\n\nThe deal is part of a massive, multiyear capital raise at the fast-casual start-up, with $10 million in new investments in the works recently, executives said. The company also plans to hire 100 people. It is considering opening up to 20 new stores over the course of the next two years, and to hire a sales manager in partnership with the firm.\n\nRudy's is trying to become a real-deal neighborhood supermarket in the city, with a focus on fresh and organic food. It opened a three-store concept on East 179th Street in December 2007. Its first Bronx location on East 159th Street is the most successful, with about 40,000 square feet of space. An additional four-storey location is under construction, on East 178th Street, next to the former Pizza Hut at 178th and Broadway.\n\nBut it is having problems growing beyond that, as it tries to make the Bronx, which has a growing population of young, ethnic residents seeking to live and work in the city, a viable neighborhood of its own.\n\nA Rudy's spokesman and a representative of the firm did not respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs part of its strategy to attract more Bronx diners, Rudy's executives are planning to expand with additional locations in the city and the Bronx this year, said people close to the development.",
      "New Zealand Police say a \"very sophisticated\" computer attack led to a man threatening to behead a woman on Auckland's central business district.\n\nIt's the latest in a string of cyber attacks reported over the past six weeks which has hit dozens of businesses, websites or organisations.\n\nThere are also reports of a number of people going missing using their credit and banking details.\n\nPrime Minister and Police Minister Bill English says hackers are now \"on a rampage\" and a new \"security initiative\" is aimed at stopping them.\n\n'Not just about money'\n\nMr English says the most recent attack is a \"major problem\" but it has affected people's lives.\n\n\"I'm really concerned because, with this, is we are putting people's lives at risk, people's bank accounts were accessed and personal information stolen in this massive assault to hack into various websites and websites.\n\n\"This is not just about money - it's also about people's lives, and that is really serious for me.

      "The World Health Organization announced that more than 200 scientists have joined the agency to address the global opioid epidemic. Here are three things you should know:\n\n1. In a world of 1.5 billion opioid users, the majority, 70 percent, live in countries in Southeast Asia or the Indian subcontinent.\n\n2. In the United States, drug overdoses claimed more than 33,000 lives in 2015, representing a 50 percent increase since 1999.\n\n3. Of the 200 WHO researchers, many work with the World Mental Health Organization. They bring expertise to the agency by working on topics including addiction, pain management and suicide prevention.\n\nThe research teams include researchers from countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and Latin America. The first research team is currently focusing on opioids and brain reward circuitry. \"These drugs are very new,\" said Jeffrey Mogil, director of the WHO Division of Mental Health and Substance Abuse. \"We are trying to learn about their clinical use as well as the addictive potential.\"\n\nA new website has been launched to help people stay informed.

      "The best-kept secret in the world of science fiction is a film with one of the most famous science fiction themes – genetic engineering.\n\nThe story of how it was done and which characters are actually working towards a dystopian vision of our world – a vision they all appear to be following – is pretty interesting.\n\nThe concept is that a new super-soldier is created by injecting DNA from another, and then there is a lot of discussion about whether the new person is any smarter than the first person.\n\nNow we're back at it and looking at what we know about the movie, so sit back, and enjoy my take on the story!\n\nWho is the villain?\n\nThe film's antagonist, \"Mother,\" is a woman who is supposedly a scientist. While her motives are unclear, it seems pretty clear that she is more or less a scientist on steroids. Her motives are also questionable so to call her a bad guy would probably be an understatement. For one thing, she doesn't seem to be interested in our world even though it seems like a more fitting universe for her than ours.\n\nShe is obsessed with creating super-soldiers to fight off the alien invaders. She wants to use them to fight off some sort of \"alien infection.\"\n\nAnd yet, the story doesn't seem to make much sense.\n\n\"V\" doesn't have a mother\n\nIt is made clear from the start that V carries no mother. She's the only person alive who has any relationship with the dead person who made her, \"Otto\". Her name has something of the same origin as the name of the character Otto who created her, V. And her biological father – \"C\" – is a stranger. He may be a scientist or even the scientist behind her existence, but he hasn't been seen for decades now.\n\nSo who is the real Otto?\n\nAs the story begins, we learn that \"Otto\" had a lot of adventures. He had a wife, and he was a successful scientist. He was also the creator of one of the first genetically engineered humans.\n\nThen, as the story picks up, he died. As the story reveals more and more details about the person who actually made V, one thing becomes very clear, Otto was more than just a scientist. He was a father figure to V, someone she trusted and who gave her a future.\n\nV is the daughter of the alien invaders\n\nWe're first introduced to aliens – the Martians – who are coming to Earth to conquer us. The Martians have the ability to transform humans into monsters and are killing all human populations.\n\nOne of the Martians is able to manipulate the human DNA into super-soldiers. He is trying to stop us from wiping ourselves out, but is apparently not successful in doing so. They end up in possession of a new super-soldier that one of our protagonists creates.\n\nWhat are her parents?\n\nOne of the Martians, C, is a scientist but also has an interest in science. C is able to manipulate the DNA into producing a new super-soldier, but he is also being manipulated by another scientist working for Mother.\n\nWe know that Mother is a bad guy, and she apparently wants to kill off all human life, but how does she know that C is a bad guy? She seems to have no concerns about her ability to manipulate C or her desire to eliminate mankind.\n\nSo who created Otto?\n\nAs with everything about the film, a lot of information we don't make very clear. Otto is said to be a \"science fiction writer\" and a \"genius.\" This ties into that she is the villain because she was apparently trying to create a new person better than the first one.\n\nAnd he never said he was a genius?\n\nAnd yet, when V and C get together that was the first thing that he supposedly said. And in this time they have spent together, they've never actually met. And Otto seems completely oblivious to C's existence, he even refers to her as a \"friend.\"\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nV comes back to Earth and her mother informs her that the first experiment is to alter C's DNA. She's not a scientist, so she's afraid of what her mother is going to do. And they go to meet C at his laboratory.\n\nC – The first experiment\n\nSo C is a genius at what he does. He also has a child, named V. He explains the idea he's been working on, which involves putting V through a few different experiences to understand her.\n\nHe then shows a recording of an experiment from when he was a little girl in his laboratory. This one thing is apparently supposed to explain why he doesn't seem to care about making a world that will allow her to live. His goal is to protect her.\n\nWhen he's done, V turns down his offer",
      "The latest round of trade talks between the US and European governments aims to conclude as soon as June in order to finalize a Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) agreement. But many worry that the agreement will be far worse for consumer and environmental safety than the current EU Commission proposal.\n\nTTIP, which according to its supporters is both a \"trade\" and a \"economic\" agreement, includes a wide range of controversial topics such as food safety, financial regulations, and environmental protection. In Germany, for example, the government has already published draft regulations for pharmaceutical imports, and is currently discussing whether a free trade agreement can be formed with the US.\n\n\"The US is pushing the EU to agree a deal on food and the environment that would make Europe's farmers, and consumers, pay for a failure to implement the deal,\" Martin Kuehne, a senior member of the Greens, wrote in the daily Süddeutsche Zeitung on Tuesday.\n\nThe newspaper pointed out that the current draft of the EU proposal already makes it obvious how it should end up: \"EU regulations will be applied in all member states and they go in the direction of requiring approval for the protection of health and the environment that is lacking in the US.\"\n\nAccording to the new European proposals on TTIP, companies will have their own regulation of food safety and they want to make it stricter so that GMOs and pesticides will be removed from products. According to this new proposal, farmers should therefore be compensated for not only the \"loss\" from the loss of their farm land but also the cost of new pesticides and fertilizers.\n\nThe proposal states that there will be no compensation for environmental damage.\n\n\"We believe that the draft has already been influenced to that extent, as have previous European Commission proposals,\" Kuehne said.\n\nAccording to him, the draft would require \"food safety to be defined in terms of regulations to be applied by [the] state and not in terms of state regulations to be applied by the companies.\"\n\nAccording to Kuehne, the aim of the draft is to be as strict as possible so that companies do not have to pay compensation for the mistakes that they and their customers make about the safety of food. \"It has not been considered by consumers so far. The proposals also ignore consumers in this regard. Consumers are not allowed to make decisions,\" he told the newspaper.\n\nKuehne said that it was particularly troubling that the EU proposal would not cover any damage caused to the quality of food produced by farmers, which would therefore end up being paid by companies.\n\n\"That means that if a farmer buys expensive fertilizers and pesticides, then the money will go back to the agribusiness, and not to the farmer. This is unacceptable,\" Kuehne told Süddeutsche Zeitung, adding that the draft also included no requirement for farmers and other small businesses to be involved in the decision-making.\n\n\"The whole concept of food safety in TTIP is completely unbalanced. TTIP is aimed at bringing down the prices of European food, and therefore the EU is trying to compensate companies,\" Kuehne said.\n\nThe Green Party's foreign policy spokesman, Jürgen Flasbarth, also reacted sharply to the TTIP proposal. \"The Commission is pushing an extreme agenda in trade negotiations, but with the American trade talks in full swing, the EU will need to change its game. TTIP could lead to increased food prices, which would make Europe poorer in the long term,\" he told the Rundschau daily.\n\nAn overwhelming majority believes that TTIP will hurt consumers and the environment\n\nBut while critics see the TTIP agreement as a threat to consumers and the environment, the European commission and US government both point to it as a boon for European and US jobs and companies. Both the US and EU countries have already passed legislation on TTIP that would facilitate trade between them on a wide variety of sectors, such as the financial services and transport sectors.\n\nIn a new study, published earlier this year, the Pew Research Center said that 80 percent of Americans think that the agreement would have a positive impact on the country's economy, while 60 percent believe it would have a positive impact on US jobs.\n\n\"Many of these benefits are already underway. Nearly all Americans say they have seen some benefit from a TTIP agreement in their own backyard, and most say it would help jobs and the economy in their neighborhood,\" said Pew and its partners. \"And for many, they think a TTIP agreement will help them financially.\"\n\nBut according to the EU proposal released last week, the future of people's jobs in the US will not change at all. According to the EU Commission, this might make Americans think less positively about trade deals if they are also concerned about who is the main beneficiary, and how they will be paid.\n\nThe European Commission wants to extend the benefits of TT",

      "There are few better signs for an emerging technology than the release of a third generation smartphone. So much has changed over the past three years, and at this point in time, the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are probably the most advanced phone on the market. In fact, I'm happy to report that the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are the first phones to ship with the latest iOS 8.\n\nThe reason for the latest iOS release, however, is not just because it's the latest update from Apple. Rather, it's because it's an improvement on every feature and every application that Apple has published for the iPhone in the past three years (and the iPad in the past five). While the iPhone 6s is by far this year's most powerful model available for purchase, it's nowhere near a revolutionary device in its capabilities. What makes the iPhone 6s the most powerful iPhone on the market is what you get as part of Apple's latest iOS release:\n\nA redesigned, much more powerful A10 processor.\n\nThe iPhone 6s and 6s Plus are almost entirely different devices compared to the iPhone 6. In its original generation, the iPhone 6 offered a much slower processor compared to the A7 CPU it debuted in last year's iPhone 6 and 6 plus. Apple has updated the A7 on both these newer devices but they're still not as powerful as the A10 chip in the iPhone 6s. The A10 is an octa-core ARM Cortex A57 processor with two high-performance cores and one low-power core (although you can't actually see the two cores on the new chip unless you have access to a powerful microscope). The A10 can also go all the way up to two times faster than the A9 when it comes to single-core processing. At 1.0GHz, the A10 actually outperforms the 1.5GHz A9 in the previous generation iPhone 6 by about a second or so, which is a very decent speed.\n\nWhat about memory? Well, the iPhone 6 (with 512MB of RAM) and 6 plus both use the same 8-core 2.3Ghz AMD A10 chip that debuted in the second generation iPad Air. So you're not getting anything new here, though Apple has gone with a slightly different design for the A10 chip. The iPhone 6s and 6s Plus use two A10 processors joined together, and each processor includes its own high-speed integrated graphics processing unit (GPU). The A10 also features support for both a dual-channel DDR3L RAM and 128GB flash storage (not to mention the new Touch ID fingerprint reader, Bluetooth 5 and 802.11ac WiFi).\n\nApple has put a lot of effort in getting this A10 right for the iPhone 6 and 6s. The iPhone 6s in particular has more RAM than its predecessor (512MB vs. the iPhone 6's 128MB), as well as higher performance and better graphics performance. In fact, a single iPhone 6 or 6s Plus can render graphics at twice the detail of the iPad Air 2 at full 1080p HD resolution. And even when the iPad Air 2 is in \"portrait mode,\" it can produce higher-quality graphics on both the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus -- even though the two devices have identical screen resolutions (1,920X1,080 and 1,920X1,080 pixels). The iPhone 6s also has two audio ports compared to the single audio port in the iPhone 6s Plus. The A10 should be great for the audio experience on the iPhone 6s and 6s Plus, giving you a nice boost in performance from the A9 in the iPhone 6 and 6 plus.\n\n\nApple has included NFC and Apple Pay in the new iPhones.\n\nApple has been a good partner here for Apple Pay. In fact, Apple Pay has been better supported in iOS 8 than it ever has been on iOS 6 on either the iPhone or iPad (but of course, many more payment apps have been updated to work with Apple Pay). With that said, Apple has taken a lot of the risk in launching both a new iPhone model with NFC and Apple Pay but has also included a few new tricks in the latest updates that will help it in the future.\n\nThe most notable new trick is the inclusion of a new feature called \"Apple Pay Cash,\" which allows iPhone users to pay with Apple Pay in some stores and places where Apple Pay is accepted. The new feature, which is enabled by default and activated when both touch ID and a phone are enrolled in Apple Pay, uses a new technology called Near Field Communication (NFC) chips in the phone and passes payments from one bank to another. All of the credit cards being used for payment, including those from big banks like Bank of America, Chase, United and Wells Fargo, can now be used by iPhone users with NFC. You can turn this feature on in Settings –> Payment & Contacts.\n\nUnfortunately, the NFC functionality of the iPhone 6s and",
      "If you had told me two years ago that the NHL would be doing something similar to the NBA, I would have scoffed. Well, we are about two years and a playoff game in now and we are here in Tampa still inching closer to the same day.\n\nIt is the exact same scenario that saw the NBA come back from the brink of cancellation to the point that it has now become the NBA's top league.\n\nIn 2012, the NHL was in the final stages of a multi-billion dollar overhaul, where the lockout was still happening and the league was on the verge of collapse.\n\nIn June of 2012, the NHL announced an all-out effort to get as many as 12 teams out of the building in 2011. The owners were desperate for a way out of the situation and while their efforts had some modest gains, the actual goal was nowhere near achieved.\n\nAs it stands right now, the NHL is still on the cusp of collapse and is looking at a shortened season and a more financially limited season for the following season. They are even at the point of negotiating a contract extension with the players that if it is approved, it will extend the current lockout by a year while bringing the total to four years.\n\nThis is the exact same situation today and now a year later, teams are on the edge of having a season that will be shorter than any season in the past half century of the league.\n\nHere is a breakdown of the various plans that were put into play to get the next four seasons started as quickly as possible.\n\n1) In an unprecedented move, a lockout was announced that forced the NHL to cancel 48 games. In return, the league was allowed to put two new teams into the city of Hartford and one new team into Toronto.\n\n2) In 2012, the owners announced that they will be offering to let players have a larger say in the hockey operations as well as letting owners keep all teams intact. But because of the lockout, there would be no expansion.\n\nAnd with all that said, here we are today and the NHL is still at the very early stages of its plans to get the next 48 games played. The owners are trying as hard as possible to reach a settlement and it will take a deal before things change drastically if the owners are indeed to keep teams and continue to do business in this league.\n\nThe final number of games played is still a matter of debate, but this is the point at which the NHL is moving towards having the league be a much better business for the owners and a much better financial deal with the players. I imagine there will be much angst among the owners as we approach the final hour and a half of the first lockout season and it seems that with every game that gets announced, the players appear to be further and further away from a deal.\n\nIt is still a very important time for these talks to happen and there are still several ways that the final hour of games could be changed, including a new CBA, but things will get a lot more interesting in the next couple weeks.",
      "In recent months several newspapers in London have published the names and personal details of Muslims who have worked as teachers, doctors, bank managers, accountants and lawyers for Britain's security services.\n\nIn a bid to discredit the perpetrators of the horrific atrocities in Paris which claimed over 130 lives, some British ministers have said that in the future they will not allow their children to be taught by Muslims.\n\nThe Muslim leadership in Britain has condemned the attacks and insisted that British Muslims will stand together, despite the divisions within the community. The Muslim Council of Britain (MCB) also said that its Muslim communities are \"deeply divided and mistrustful\" over the attacks and accused the media of publishing the photographs to inflame tensions.\n\nMuslim leaders have described this as a \"hate campaign\" which is aimed at demonising Muslims.\n\nAccording to a survey last year, three quarters of British Muslims were \"worried\" about the growing anti-Muslim sentiment and \"feel harassed and threatened\" by the growing anti-Muslim incidents. Nearly half of all British Muslims believe that the media is making a big deal of Islamic extremism but is being far too tolerant of Muslims who wear the Islamic headscarf.\n\nWhile there is also substantial mistrust and antagonism within the ranks of most British Muslims towards Muslim extremists in the UK, the number of British Muslims who want to \"take up arms\" to defend the nation is \"much, much smaller\".\n\nYet the newspaper and broadcasting media are actively pushing the fear factor for the Muslim community.\n\nIn a move aimed at portraying the majority of Muslim men as potential terror suspects, some newspapers and television news channels have published photographs of men whose faces are hidden, claiming they are not identifiable.\n\nThe images show the men in the London Underground as well as on buses, buses and taxis. The men identified by the media but not named include Pakistani immigrants to the UK.\n\nMany of the perpetrators in the terrorist attacks in Paris last November had been living with their family in the UK, posing no threat to the UK.\n\nThe Telegraph published an image of a taxi driver who has been identified as Mohammed B, from Bradford. His face is obscured but that of his father Mohammed A was visible.\n\nThe Mail On Sunday published a profile of Rachid Redouane from the Molenbeek district of Brussels.\n\nOther articles have revealed details of individuals, including some of the \"most radical figures\" who were known to national counter-terrorism services, but whose activities were deemed to be of a \"low threat\" by public authorities.\n\nIt has also emerged that a Muslim woman was killed in Istanbul while trying to help the victims of the terrorist attacks in Paris earlier this year.\n\nSome newspapers have attempted to imply that Muslim women are \"asking to be raped\" in a bid to drive a political agenda. In many cases, the identities of the women are concealed or blurred out, and they are referred to only as \"victims\", \"survivors\" or \"victims' families\".\n\nThe Mail on Sunday has attempted to use the image of the anonymous woman, who died after getting off a tube on London Underground on April 7th, as a way of suggesting that women are \"asking to be raped\".\n\nIn its article which was reproduced by a number of local newspapers, it described the woman as a \"French Muslim mother\" who is understood to have been in a relationship with a \"jihadi\" (i.e. radical Muslim) man. The man was murdered in Turkey last month.\n\nA story in the Telegraph read: \"Two Muslim women are said to have left their children behind as their husband drove them – barefoot and without their hijabs – to an attack on a Paris-bound train last week.\n\n\"The women, from east London, reportedly lost touch almost immediately after the family fled the country, which was a favourite destination for European jihadists last year.\n\n\"Last night, the Telegraph reported one of the women's father as saying: \"These girls are asking to be raped. The terrorists should take revenge.\"\n\nThis article by Mail on Sunday was heavily distorted. It was intended to use the example of a couple fleeing to Syria to suggest that women are asking to be raped but the article completely ignores the fact that Muslim men travel to Syria to fight with extremist groups.\n\nThe newspaper also quoted from reports detailing a number of murders by suicide bombers – which is perfectly legitimate – and it made many other factual errors, including the claim that the two victims had been killed in the Paris attacks. There was no reference made to the fact that the two women were in Turkey, and it could only be assumed that the two women were being \"harassed\" by Turkish authorities due to their being Islamic.\n\nAn image of one of the dead men, Mohammed B, on the Mail on Sunday website.

The band will release new material in September and the first single \"Where the Streets Have No Name\" will be used to give away tickets to their upcoming festival in the USA.\n\n\"This illness is not going to stop us,\" Bono stated. \"We are not a band of musicians who are meant to be stuck where we are in order to be able to tour for months to come.\"\n\nThe band will not have a full slate of dates to play through the end of September, but those with tickets to see U2 in Miami, New Orleans, Washington DC or Brooklyn are encouraged to enter the contest that will begin on September 1 at noon CT. Tickets for the tour will be available on the Fyre Festival website starting September 1 at noon CT.

      "\"I know he didn't take the time at the start of the season to really focus on me,\" said midfielder Jack Harrison, who has started each of the club's 15 games this season and appeared in 24 matches during the 2011 campaign. \"But we've built a really good rapport on and off the field. His work ethic and preparation on that level is what you love in a player. It's what you expect in a professional player.\"\n\nAs long as those attributes remain high, Harrison said, Toronto's core of players will keep the team as intact as they did when the team won its first title in 2011. He added that when the team's top players are healthy, the rest of the roster thrives.\n\nThe biggest question surrounding that team last year was whether or not the young core and veterans would play well together enough to challenge for a championship. There were the occasional lapses. But for the most part, TFC appeared to be a well-oiled machine, which is why the expectations are still so high.\n\nHarrison said he hasn't been able to watch last season. He knows one major reason for that is because he has to concentrate on his football. The other players in his team know how hard they've worked to get him where he is.\n\n\"I'm a big part of that and it's not an easy position,\" he said. \"All they really wanted to do was win MLS Cup. So, this off-season is important for me because I want to be ready when it's time. I know there will be a few games where I will be rested and not on the field. I want to be ready to go.\"\n\nThe team's goal this off-season will be to play the same kind of style of football that carried the team to the 2011 MLS Cup, but Harrison said he has noticed a new level of attention being paid to the team this year. Many players have returned to the club from overseas to take part in preseason training and Harrison, who has played with players from several other MLS clubs in the past, has found it difficult to break into this new wave.\n\n\"I haven't played with so many top quality players. It's like a new team,\" Harrison said. \"You have to adjust. For the most part, the guys that are playing are older than you and you've got to be comfortable with them.\"\n\nThe team also has to work on its defence because of injuries to captain Steven Caldwell and defender Nick Hagglund. Harrison said the team has started looking at what it can improve on defensively. The club has to focus on defending set-pieces and on the midfield as well. Defensively, the club will have to get back to the same aggressive mentality the team used to have when it defeated New York City FC in the playoffs last season.\n\nWhile he has been a supporter of the club, Harrison has had no problems with its direction under TFC president Kevin Payne. He was also one of those players who didn't want TFC to make a move for former San Jose Earthquakes captain Chris Wondolowski in 2011.\n\n\"You can't expect to win everything right away. We have to keep building on the foundation we have and eventually we will win some titles,\" Harrison said. \"We're a new team. The coaches and players have a lot of young guys. I think we can be a playoff side.\"\n\njtorralva@postmedia.com\n\ntwitter.com/torruralva",
      "The U.S. government had agreed to pay at least $10 billion to resolve an antitrust lawsuit brought against it by the company formerly known as Enron, a former Department of Justice official has said.\n\n\"We have resolved all outstanding claims to the tune of approximately $10 billion,\" said a former official, who declined to be identified, in an interview. \"There is a lot more of that story that I can't tell.\"\n\nThe former official's statement contrasts with a November report from the Government Accountability Office, a federal watchdog agency, which said there had been \"no indication\" of any other major U.S. law firm taking up the case. The former official's assertions, which were made in the government's interest, could not be immediately corroborated.\n\nGovernment officials declined comment on the government's $10 billion settlement.\n\nEnron, which filed for bankruptcy in October 2005, claimed in 2003 that the Department of Justice was conspiring with some of its competitors to keep it from getting a fair accounting and for a better deal on its debt.\n\nThe lawsuit also called for U.S. Justice Department officials to disclose the names of other firms that the Bush administration and others said had offered $100 million to Enron before it filed for bankruptcy.\n\nThe government had estimated it would cost $16 billion to settle with Enron. But Enron, which was based in Houston, Texas, was able to reduce the settlement to about $6 billion, based largely on a $2 billion credit line from a federal fund to help states and municipalities restructure their utilities.\n\nAn earlier lawsuit against Enron by the Securities and Exchange Commission accused five former Enron executives of fraud. The federal government alleged that between 2001 and July 2004, Enron's executive committee approved more than 40 trades by the company's CEO, Kenneth Lay, and his closest subordinates that allowed the company to evade reporting and accounting rules for over $4 billion in earnings.",
      "\"They have taken steps to protect our kids and teachers. Our schools are the most vulnerable we have. They are the oldest, with the most students in them - it's our future,\" one parent said.\n\nAn overwhelming majority of the parents interviewed at the school district's parent day said they agreed or strongly agreed with the statement: \"With respect to student safety, we should invest in the classroom.\"\n\nOne mother said the district's education staff should be on the alert for suspicious activity, and other parents said teacher monitoring and safety equipment would make the school a safer venue.\n\n\"You're not getting any information from your superintendent. You're not getting anything from the district. ... It's a shame,\" she said.\n\nSome other parents agreed. \"I think it should be an obligation of the schools,\" another mother said.\n\nA separate school district official said the threat against school officials was \"extremely concerning and outrageous. ...

Our security team is very alert and diligent in their efforts to investigate security incidents.\"\n\nSchools 'the No. 1 target of terrorist attacks'\n\n\nIn addition to the threats, school and district officials said it was believed there has been some type of terrorist threat, but the source of those threats remained unclear.\n\n\"We are just as concerned about our schools - the No. 1 target of terrorist attacks,\" San Diego's principal and superintendent Bill Curley said at a Monday news conference.\n\nThe school district said it has more than a million students. The district had no information about students' schedules, but Curley said the district had implemented measures to notify parents if there were disruptions to students with extenuating circumstances, an important piece of information for parents facing possible disruptions at school.\n\nSan Diego Police are on scene in connection with the threat\n\nCriminal justice and homeland security experts also said they are concerned about heightened security concerns.\n\n\"The reality is that San Diego is such a large city,\" said Peter Neufeld, vice chairman of the board of directors & executive director of The Neufeld Group.\n\n\"Security is a huge issue and the district, like most law enforcement agencies, have a huge security program that has been put in place,\" Neufeld told CNN. \"The big concern here is with any kind of major terrorist attack - we have to be prepared.\"\n\nIn 2007, a terror attack on U.S. military recruiting centers rocked America, and the San Diego Police Department has recently increased patrols of potential targets such as airport checkpoints and bus stations.\n\nSchool district officials have also said they have placed security cameras in schools, and the city of San Diego will be adding cameras to 10 schools near the border with Mexico.",
      "The New York Times' Eric Lipton wrote an article yesterday, and a video clip that was added, that is just bizarre and insane — one that is now being widely circulated. It claims that the Obama administration's new surveillance programs are \"unconstitutional,\" and that they have nothing to do with fighting terrorism. That Obama officials were given \"secret warrants\" to read e-mails between terrorists and potential terrorists and to monitor their communications.\n\nThe New York Times' Eric Lipton wrote an article yesterday and posted the video clip.\n\nYou need to know this: In order to prevent another 9/11-style attack or an even worse, massive attack in New York, Washington, D.C., Boston, or Los Angeles, and in the wake of a series of revelations in recent weeks about the NSA's surveillance efforts, President Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have taken unprecedented steps to give the intelligence community unprecedented tools to track terrorists, and to track their communications. The most controversial is what are called \"special access programs.\" We know from leaks that the N.S.A. is keeping logs of phone calls, email records and other communications with foreign operatives or suspected terrorists. When I asked for more information about the N.S.A.'s role in that program two years ago, I was told that it wasn't collecting the kind of information normally shared with the F.B.I. That was true then, and it is still the case now — the N.S.A. is only monitoring and storing the communications of known suspects. But a secret F.B.I. court that approves some F.B.I. requests allows the N.S.A. to scan more than 1.3 million \"telephony metadata\" records every day. And it is holding onto that data indefinitely. That's a staggering violation of Americans' Constitutional rights. The law, they say, allows this, so there is no big deal. But there might be if that surveillance were lawful. And we don't know, because the government won't say for obvious national-security reasons.\n\nIn some ways, this isn't so far out of the norm. The Bush administration argued it could not legally warrant the spying programs they were committing because the president wasn't being directly involved in the planning, but we didn't actually find out who the terrorist was before the attacks, so it's difficult to say it's \"unconstitutional.\" The Obama administration is, though — the president himself has defended and defended to the press the fact that the government spied on him, and then tried to get a warrant for it.\n\nThe surveillance program that is now being defended by the administration has the government scanning emails, phone calls, and other communications with suspected or known terrorists — including citizens who are not under suspicion of any crime, let alone a terrorist attack. So it seems that this is the one that has to go, as far as the Obama administration is concerned.\n\nThe video is now being seen and shared on Facebook as a way to support people who were detained for no reason at all by the authorities.\n\nYou can see the video here.",
      "\"A whole world has a reason to laugh for the first time in many, many years. We're living in a world that's being shaken up. We've gotten so good at not making these kinds of jokes. To go back and be like, 'Oh, this is how the world is' – it's just wrong. You're not getting the idea,\" said the comedian. \"The first time we really get this in front of our faces is going to be the first time that somebody gets hurt over [this]. Someone has to get hurt out of the whole thing.\"\n\nDuring a recent appearance on the late night program Conan, Louis C.K. recounted his experience with a man named Brian McNaughton who has an extremely unusual and highly unusual story.\n\nC.K. had the comedian recount an extremely strange and strange encounter from the time he was a young comedy writer in Chicago. The incident occurred while C.K. was in one of the more run down neighborhoods in the city. C.K. and his writing partner had spent three days trying to find a room to stay the night. In an area that was usually devoid of people, there were only two hotel rooms left available that they were able to check into. The room that C.K. was staying in was a room full of \"guys playing cards and dudes laying on the couches sleeping on them.\" All of the men there were \"cousins\" of Brian McNaughton. All of the women, except McNaughton, were in the adjoining room, all of whom were a bit younger.\n\nIt had only been a couple of days since Brian was in the hospital after a car crash. The former professional athlete had apparently been paralyzed for months.\n\nThe man who came to Brian's room was, C.K. said, a person whom McNaughton \"never saw before, a guy who walked like he was paralyzed, a guy who's got a limp like a zombie. He has no sense of time. [C.K. and his partner] were terrified. We were like, 'It's a weird guy. We don't know how this is going to go.'\"\n\nC.K. and his partner got a room and began the awkward process of trying to get McNaughton to open up. It took C.K. about half an hour to finally get McNaughton to open up \"and talk about, basically, how much he was looking forward to being there for us.\"\n\n\"He never does that,\" C.K. continued. \"It takes some effort to keep talking to these guys because there's no one else there. And it really was kind of boring.\"\n\nC.K. said they all ended up leaving the hotel, as one can assume Brian was not interested in spending the night. After they packed up their things and headed home, C.K. said at that point they \"were not really that nervous anymore to start our night\" and they started to think \"that [maybe] we could work together.\"\n\n\"He had this amazing charm in his voice like, 'Yeah, let's start out by meeting in person,'\" C.K. recounted of McNaughton. \"And he was very kind and he let me tell all these stories about how we'd found this crazy person who we'd befriended during our time there, who was so kind and so nice. That just kind of blew my mind. I'm like, 'Yeah, I think we have a thing. Could we put things together?' He said, 'Sure.'\"\n\nC.K. recalls that McNaughton then suggested that they both go to \"someplace nice and quiet that was a little sketchier,\" and so they walked down to the nearby bar on their respective nights of drinking and getting frisky.\n\n\"This is when we realized that this was a guy who had all these cousins that he was very close to,\" C.K. recalled of McNaughton. \"We were like, 'Oh, my god.' We kind of laughed, we kind of laughed, we joked around, and it's like, 'This guy is just so very kind.'\"\n\nThe two men proceeded to sit in the bar for about an hour, chatting and drinking the night away.\n\n\"We had a blast,\" C.K. said. \"It was a very nice and happy place. It was this amazing bar that was very chill and everything. We went out a lot. We drank at places that are like, I don't know, where a group of guys hang out and drink a lot of beers and get drunk and have a party and whatever. People like to do that on the weekends. Then we went out for dinner or something and this guy goes, 'I'm meeting my cousins.' I'm like, 'Oh, oh, a friend of yours?' 'Yeah.' And I'm like, 'That's interesting! I don't know what",
      "The U.S. Army's top officer said Tuesday he believes the U.S. needs to prepare for a time of war against the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS), but not fight the military's own soldiers for doing so.\n\n\"I do not think you have to fight your own soldiers,\" Lt. Gen. Mark Milley, the Army's vice chief of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \"My basic point is always have enough troops on the ground by all means to win the war, but not necessarily have them in harm's way.\"\n\nMilley's comments could signal that the U.S. could go to war against both the military's own forces and ISIS. President Barack Obama is contemplating sending 50,000 more troops to combat the terrorist group in Iraq and Syria, while U.S. forces are already fighting ISIS in eastern Syria and have bombed ISIS forces inside Iraq.\n\n\"I absolutely believe in the need for American forces to be able to operate wherever they're needed, on the ground and in the air, if it's necessary,\" Milley, who has led the Army since July, said at the Senate committee hearing.\n\n\"If you think America is going to be at war always against terrorists, I don't think you're going to have the soldiers we need serving in support of their country,\" he added.\n\nWhen asked about the U.S. war in Iraq and their own soldiers' involvement in the conflict, Milley said he believed \"nobody can say what would happen if you got up in the morning and were about to be deployed, and you're wondering if they're going to be here.\" But he indicated the military was doing everything it could.\n\n\"If you were deployed, and you didn't understand what time it was, or the weather or if there was an imminent threat, and you don't know what time it is, you were a casualty,\" he said.\n\nThe Pentagon has been reluctant to get the American public ahead of a planned troop surge into Syria in the wake of ISIS beheading U.S. journalist James Foley. But as Milley acknowledged Tuesday, there are risks associated with the military's own troops.\n\n\"The biggest risk to our soldiers who take these deployments is when they're attacked on the battlefield. The most vulnerable ones are the ones who take the dangerous deployments to be around the enemy they're there to fight,\" Milley said under questioning from Sen. Joni Ernst (R-Iowa).\n\n\"My soldiers, they're fighting for our freedom. They're fighting for our country. They're willing to sacrifice themselves for us,\" Ernst said, defending the soldiers' participation in the training missions and the missions they take part in. The senator added the U.S. is going to be \"extremely worried\" if these troops are killed on American soil.\n\n\"If the risk can be mitigated...then it's worthwhile,\" Milley said. \"I think there's great risk to do it. If it's risky, and there's no benefit to the United States, then I think it would be counterproductive.\"\n\nIn addition to the threats ISIS poses to the American people, the administration has struggled to find a strategy against them.",
      "Budget cuts have been a long-time concern for government health expenditures. With the recession starting to bite, the Congressional Budget Office projects that spending on health care will likely decline slightly in 2010, but rise slightly in 2011. It will likely continue to fall in 2012 and decline again in 2013, the CBO projects. What this means for health care costs and access is likely to be the subject of much debate — and one that most Americans don't really know about. In fact, there is no consensus on these issues, even among people who are sympathetic to the public health approach. Even if cuts will make a small difference, it's difficult to know what the overall impact will be on access, quality, service and cost.\n\nThe U.S. government has the unique privilege of serving as the single largest payer of health care in this country, and yet our system is not even close to being at the top of the list across the world in terms of efficiency and cost. We use a lot of expensive, sophisticated technology to improve patients' health and extend their lives; we spend a very large percentage of our taxes subsidizing health insurance companies that are supposed to provide the best care for the most people; we are one of the world's largest countries not to have a national health system or a national retirement savings program.\n\nAt the same time, we spend a very small percentage of our tax dollars on the entire health care system. The rest is subsidized by various programs outside of government — Medicare, Medicaid, private insurance companies, the Veterans Administration, state and local governments. In the process, the U.S. government is far and away the largest payer in the world on health care, and yet we are widely recognized as the world's most expensive health care system.\n\nThat, at least, is what is being claimed by a wide range of experts who are not government employees. If there is an argument over who is more efficient or who offers the best value for money, the government is not the right place to start. Government employees spend a lot of time writing reports and studies on issues they aren't allowed to get into the office to study. The vast majority of those studies and recommendations are ignored by politicians to whom it's all a little too inconvenient to spend any actual time.\n\nThe bottom line is that the government spends an inordinate amount of time, money and attention trying to find ways to cut back. They have a strong incentive to push for new ways to cut down on health care costs, especially when there is little public input into the decision. The current federal budget allows more than $300 billion for direct health care costs in 2010, and that doesn't include the hundreds of billions more that are paid out through subsidies to health insurance companies and by the government via Medicaid. It's a lot of new money coming at a time when the U.S. is paying down the national debt.\n\nThis is the real story. It's not about how to cut down on spending, it's about how to find ways to spend less.\n\nHere are five areas in which the government spends time, money and attention making big investments in reducing health care costs:\n\n\n1. Quality and Access\n\n\nWe are the most expensive country in the world for two good reasons: first, that we spend an inordinate amount of time trying to cut down on costs compared with other wealthy countries; and second, that we spend an even greater amount of money subsidizing health care for the wealthiest people in this country.\n\n\nThe U.S. spends more than twice as much per capita on health care as other affluent countries, and so it is in our best long-term interest to spend less, even if it means we lose some of our market dominance. Since 2007, the federal government has spent more than $2 trillion on health care in 20 different programs, including Medicare and Medicaid. These programs provide health care for the elderly, poor and many minority groups.\n\nThere is a lot of debate about which of these two approaches is better or, as proponents put it, what is more efficient. Both are important, but it's not the government's job to make a decision that would save $50 million or $1 billion. So we should be able to look at the evidence, weigh the pros and cons of both approaches, then make a decision.\n\n\nIn principle, we should be able to use an evidence-based approach by using a combination of patient-oriented health care models (think medical homes and networks, not government-run models like for-profit insurance companies), quality improvement in both provider and patient environments, and more government spending on quality, access, efficiency and administrative support. This approach could be called Quality-Based Health Care.\n\nWhile it is true that we spend more than anyone else on health care, our spending is more inefficient than some other countries, in part because we can't use government money to get more quality. In 2009, the government spent more money per person on providing insurance coverage to people",
      "There are countless stories of people who have made the worst mistake and wasted their life. If you are among them, then you should take heed from the following list of top five mistakes you, as an artist or business person, should avoid making. You will be glad you have listened.\n\nDon't waste your time – The moment you find the thing that you are passionate about, the only thing that matters is to keep going. All else is useless. In a study done by Gallup, the world's most prominent polling company, the study found that the average American spends about 2 hours a day on their hobbies (they use Google Docs to record), about 1 hour a day on entertainment (Netflix) and about 4 hours a day on social media. Now that is some serious work.\n\nDon't be afraid to experiment – This isn't a hard and fast rule, but it is important that you experiment with different tools and platforms in order to get better understanding and knowledge when it comes to digital marketing in general and the way you can make the biggest impact with your website, products and services.\n\nDon't try to take on too many projects in one year. If you are not a team player, then this might be the only time that you will be able to find the right strategy for your business. The more hands you have on your shoulders, the more responsibility that you will carry, the more the chance that you will screw it up. Make it a priority to get the right team around you and work as a team – there is nothing worse than being in a team which doesn't work as a team.\n\nDon't work for free – It may feel that you have to make a profit for your company but if you do it to the point where you aren't earning anything, then you might be working in vain. There is no such thing as free lunch, just as there is no such thing as free beer. A lot of successful people work for free.\n\nDon't think you can just take on everything at once – When you get more accomplished and start seeing results, go back to the drawing board, re-examine your idea and then pick one that you are still not 100% sure about. You will most likely discover that it is not the best idea for you at the time, but once a certain amount of time has passed or the idea hasn't been explored further then it would be best to move on.\n\nDon't make the worst mistake – It is possible to make these mistakes, it is just that they would be the last thing you would want to make because it will make you look like a fool if you do it. There are no shortcuts in the way of success and it has nothing to do with luck. It takes hard work, dedication, experience, passion, persistence and the will of the individual.\n\nFollow them carefully!\n\nHave a wonderful Monday everyone!",

Williams, a former CIA contract officer for more than 20 years and currently executive director of the Center for Defense Information. Formerly, Williams was with the CIA and the Office of Near Eastern Affairs, and worked for several intelligence agencies. Williams had previously worked for the National Security Agency, the Central Intelligence Agency, and the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency.\n\n• William F.

He has served as the co-chair for the Washington and London Iran Chamber of Commerce. Bahrami was involved in several international agreements involving both Iran and the U.S. government as well as various economic projects, including projects in Iran.\n\n• James V. Grimaldi, co-founder of the Iranian-American Development Foundation and, in 2008, former chairman of the board of the National Iranian American Council. He is also a former board member of the Iranian American Private Network, an organization of Iranian-Americans in the United States.\n\n• Maryam Khatami, the former Iran chairwoman for the National Iranian American Council. Khatami is part of the National Iranian-American Council, a coalition consisting of Iranian-American organizations in the United States that was involved in drafting the Iran sanctions legislation. Khatami is currently senior vice president for the National Iranian American Council and, prior to the Obama administration, served as an adviser to the UN special envoy to Iraq. Khatami was also a member of the National Iranian American Council.\n\n\nThe Iranian-American community, some of which are in opposition to the Iranian government, expressed disappointment with the list of names.\n\n\"The list in today's OFI report, which lists individuals with U.S. citizenship, is troubling because these individuals were not designated for sanctions under the Iran Sanctions Act,\" said Shirin Ebadi, director of the Iran Project at the National Iranian American Council. \"The Obama Administration is targeting the majority of Iranian-Americans who oppose the regime. We are asking the executive branch to ensure that such actions are taken in a selective and selective way, which does not reflect the values of the American people or the majority of Iranians.\"\n\nWhile no group is named as the source of this list, the report says that it was obtained through information sourced to the National Counterterrorism Center.\n\nThe report also says that this list was the tip of the iceberg. \"U.S. officials told the International Atomic Energy Agency that many other dual nationals who served as CIA agents in recent years were subject to the IAEA's 'follow-the-money' investigation and have come under scrutiny by the intelligence community for possible cooperation with Iranian intelligence,\" it quotes from the executive summary of the report.\n\nRead the entire report from the US Department of Treasury.",

      "The latest figures from the Census have revealed a slight decline in the size of the UK's working poor, while those in the bottom third of the country say they are better off than in the past.\n\nThe annual survey shows that 7.3% of workers were poor (less than two-thirds of the median income) in 2013-14 according to figures obtained by The Sunday Telegraph.\n\nHowever, of the 6.6% who were below the poverty threshold for a family of four, 4.7% were working, an increase of 0.1 percentage points on the number of poor workers in 2001-02.\n\nThe average income of a working poor was £16,200, while those at the bottom of the scale earned €9,700 to €13,000.\n\nThe lowest paid 2.6% of workers were paid the minimum wage, the survey also showed, although this was only 2% compared to 3% in 2013-14.\n\nIt also showed that more than one-third of working poor families had two or more parents employed.\n\nThe figures also showed that the share of workers in the bottom third of the country who receive some Government help was increasing, as is the number of people relying on tax credits.\n\nThe number of working poor who did not receive any benefits has fallen by 11% since 2009-10, in contrast to a rise of 1.7% in the number of working poor who receive some help.\n\nThe number of workers reliant on tax credits has risen in every year since the Coalition was formed, reaching an all-time high of 2.4 million in 2013-14.\n\nIn a statement, the DWP said its figures showed that the number of working poor aged 14 to 64 had fallen to 31% in 2015-16, compared to 33% in 2001-02.\n\nIt also claimed that the number of families relying on benefits – which fell by more than a quarter between 2010 and 2013 – had fallen back to pre-crisis levels.\n\nThe survey also showed that women were more likely to live with a part-time job: 31%, compared to 22% of men.\n\nLast month the Resolution Foundation think tank revealed that for the first time, women are now in the majority of part-time jobs in the UK and that two-thirds of those are part-time low-paid jobs.\n\nIt added that part-time working, including those on zero hours contracts, was also growing, with women now accounting for nearly half, 54%, of part-time workers. \"These figures are hugely significant in two major respects,\" said Resolution Foundation research director James Pringle.\n\n\"Having women take up part-time work at the same rates as men is a significant sign of the gender pay gap finally being closed. This should be a relief to women, as it suggests that women will get a payrise, without necessarily having to start work later and without taking on more flexible or part-time hours.\n\n\"Secondly, and more tellingly, these figures confirm that there remains a huge difference in the work habits of women and men when it comes to part-time work.\"\n\nA DWP spokesman said: \"We know that part-time work remains a significant barrier to full-time employment.\n\n\"Our reforms in April and May, including a new minimum wage threshold for these types of jobs and increased protection for women in full-time work, will help ensure the UK attracts the best and brightest to work.\"\n\nThe figures, released to coincide with International Women's Day, are among the most detailed data on the UK's working poor since the 2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe annual census of households, which is carried out every April to provide a snapshot of the country, also revealed a sharp rise in households without their own home in 2013-14.\n\nMore than a quarter of households – 23.8% out of a total of 37.9% – were living in temporary accommodation, including caravan parks, homeless hostels and social housing, and 18.8% lived with other families.\n\nThe proportion of households living in temporary accommodation had fallen by a third since 2007-08.\n\nMore than a third of young people in Wales are now living in family-sharing, or shared accommodation, a form of care home that involves a household paying for the accommodation for another person in their life and, in return, getting help towards their rent or mortgage.",

You've always been an Ace, so what are you doing playing other numbers?\n\nIf you're anything like some of your friends, there is something wrong with you.\n\nThis was the reaction we heard during a recent poker night gathering. Some fellow players were frustrated by the apparent lack of Ace value in their deck. They said they'd been playing well for the last hour, and suddenly their good hands just didn't look nearly as good as they had earlier in the night, when they had been playing low-Ace hands. And then, even worse, they couldn't seem to stop themselves from throwing in a high-Ace pot, even when it wasn't obvious to them that they had an Ace in the hole and the rest of their cards were low.\n\nWhile this behavior might seem like a bit of bad luck or variance, it's something that poker players can use as a skill. Knowing when and where to move up or down on the board (or in the pot) can make or break your poker game, and knowing why it happens is equally as important.\n\nIn this piece, we'll break down the four basic Ace positions we'll all eventually come across, and show you how knowing when and where to make these moves can help us improve our games.\n\nAce Value Basics\n\nMost players are familiar with a basic Ace rule:\n\nAce = 9\n\nIt goes without saying that if you're holding an Ace (9), we expect you to make the bet or raise your hand to 9.\n\nBut beyond Ace, there are several other basic Ace rules we'll explain here. Each one helps reinforce the one above, and gives us a broader look at when and where to make a bet or raise in order to get ahead.\n\nFor example, imagine your opponent is holding three pairs, aces, and a kings. How would you know when and where to make the next bet?\n\nHere's what you might see:\n\nTwo pairs\n\nAce\n\nTwo aces\n\nThree aces\n\nAs a rule of thumb, we'll call those bets. For a more nuanced view, we'll also see how to make these bets at specific intervals throughout your hand. In this case, a bet when your hand is one pair, two aces, and two kings is generally recommended, as is doing a bet when your hand is either two pairs or ace/10 (though you'll rarely see a hand like this).\n\nIf you want a quick primer on understanding Ace value (and how to make bets), we've put together a handy Ace value cheat sheet here.\n\nWhen and Where to Bet\n\nAll poker players need to know when to make one or two bets rather than a large bet and then slowly back off into the pocket.\n\nFirst, keep in mind that your two biggest bet choices are one-pairs and 2-handed pots. These are generally the bets that are most likely to be called, so it's often a good idea to make them as soon as you can. You'll also want to make a larger bet if you expect your opponent to call (more on this in a bit).\n\nWith that, let's take a closer look at where and when you should be making these bets.\n\nOne-Pairs\n\nA good rule of thumb when it comes to one-pairs is to get your best hand as high up on the board as possible. We know you, but you don't know we.\n\nAnd this is why we sometimes like to call these hands a bit sooner. Because if the bet is called, you should be able to take more advantage of it and move up to higher values.\n\nOf course, the call is not always guaranteed -- with the money on the line, a lot of the time you'll just come away empty-handed, as the hand is very unlikely to move all that high.\n\nWith that in mind, as soon as you can you should always put your best hand on the table so it doesn't get called down.\n\nEven if you have to fold your hand for some reason, this is a bet that will give you a great deal of confidence in your hand and make it better for the rest of the hand. Remember, your bet is only as good as your hand.\n\n2-Handed Poker\n\nOnce again, we'll cover this one by taking a slightly different look at one-pairs.\n\nA lot of 2-handed games are won via bet-raising or bet-making, which means your biggest bet is usually a 2-hand",
      "Hackers were reportedly able to break into a Jeep Cherokee and steal three guns and ammo this week, according to local reports.\n\nThe Cherokee, located in Tennessee, was stolen from an east Tennessee home on Feb. 26. The home's owner says the Jeep was reported stolen out of Tennessee and the owner was unsure of what happened to it. The thieves allegedly forced their way inside with the keys in the ignition.\n\nOne of the guns was a .45-caliber Glock 18 pistol, another was a 9 mm Ruger and the third was a 7.62x39 mm Russian pistol, said the report, which said there were other guns stolen as well.\n\nThe two men are reportedly from the Cincinnati area, according to a report by the Nashville Tennessean. Officials say that when law enforcement agents went to the suspects' residence, they found the stolen firearms.\n\nA Cherokee spokesman confirmed that the thefts did happen, but said the vehicles were taken out of Tennessee and to other states. When asked if the Jeep was stolen out of Tennessee, he said, \"No, it was not. That is incorrect.\"\n\nThe spokesman said that the three weapons would not be available for sale at any point, but he was not able to confirm whether the three guns were stolen.\n\nThe Knoxville News Sentinel reported that the thieves were able to escape with the weapons because the Jeep, with its air-conditioning, was not equipped with a security system. The vehicles were reportedly found with keys in the ignition.\n\nThe owner of the Cherokee was reportedly not happy with the thieves for stealing his vehicle, but believes that they are not the same guys who tried to steal a car out of his driveway on Christmas Eve.\n\nThis is what happens when you leave your door unlocked @Jeep Cherokee @ChattanoogaNewsChannel pic.twitter.com/tZx0L9VpCd — John Paul Cianciolo (@jpdianciolo) March 4, 2016\n\nChattanooga Police spokeswoman Sherelle Roberts told WBIR that officials were looking into the matter.\n\nFollow @WBIR for instant breaking news and updates.\n\nAlertMe",
      "The White House is pushing Congress to enact a permanent, permanent ban on open carry of firearms on federal land.\n\n\nThis news was first reported by local radio journalist Matt Viser.\n\nAfter more than 40 million Americans voted for Obama in the last election, the White House and its media allies immediately latched onto the idea of \"guns in classrooms\" as a way to win back lost support from those who voted for Mitt Romney.\n\n\"The President is committed to using his bully pulpit and his new bully pulpit,\" White House Communications Director Dan Pfeiffer told reporters. \"He intends to take more aggressive action on gun violence in schools, where these actions are much more likely to have an impact. As he noted last week: 'We have to change the culture of violence in this country'.\"\n\nThe proposed bill, the Campus Accountability and Safety Act of 2015, would \"bar the Department of Homeland Security from providing any federal money to any school, to prevent such school from receiving certain grants, to prevent state or local law-enforcement agencies from securing school grounds against armed felons and the mentally ill,\" reported Washington Free Beacon's Steven Greenhouse, and \"expand the current prohibition against the concealed carry in schools.\"\n\n\"By broadening the scope of an existing law, the bill aims to make it nearly impossible for local school districts to set up their own gun-free zones. In essence, the bill would undermine the power of local governments to keep students safe by restricting the ability of local schools to set their own policies to keep themselves free of potentially illegal firearms,\" Greenhouse reported.\n\nThe bill would also \"enshrine the federal government's ability to prevent local authorities from enforcing federal gun laws against citizens.\" But the bill's sponsors say federal laws would still be enforced, \"just not against federal officers or employees.\"\n\nRep. Paul Ryan (R-Wis.) told a local Fox affiliate, \"Obviously, nobody's denying there are some dangerous people out in our society. You have the National Rifle Association and gun rights groups. But I think we ought to focus more on the fact that we have about 30 to 40,000 school shootings in this country every year, including about 70 percent of them on school grounds.\"\n\nThe media responded by focusing on the NRA's opposition, rather than the potential consequences of a massive federal crackdown on school shootings. And the Obama administration's latest press conference and press release both ignored the consequences of expanding the federal ban to all federal land, a move that would also result in a massive federal crackdown on gun rights in a vast swath of the federal land system.\n\nThe White House's push comes shortly after President Obama hosted an executive order banning the transfer of military-style weapons onto federal land.\n\nFollow AWR Hawkins on Twitter: @AWRHawkins.

      "I know, I know, it's been a while. I'm sorry! What's the deal? It's been a long, long time since I've posted anything here on the blog (almost 10 years and counting, in fact). I've been pretty busy with work lately; so busy that I've almost forgotten all about the blog (it's not that I didn't want to, I just forgot). Anyway, as is my custom, I wrote a blog of sorts when I wasn't working and I made sure to post a few things like this on there every so often.\nThe other day I decided to pick up the ball again as I had some free time on my hands. I finished a few more lines on one of the pages I had written earlier on and I thought I'd share it  here as well.\nI'm actually hoping a new version of the book will come out in the near future so that I can get back to that. However, I don't know what's on the horizon for me these days. I also want to get back into writing more on my own and I need a new way of doing that. I'm trying to find a way, somehow, of writing a novel that I'm satisfied with. A novel that comes from inside. I hope to have some more information about when I launch this new book (probably after the end of this month). \nIf you haven't read this series before you should definitely check it out. It was one of my favorites at the end of the 90s and it seems to have gotten its sequel. I'm certainly glad to learn that I do, in fact, feel the need to revisit it all so fast. It's such a great experience!\nWell, you can see for yourself, right now, on my blog.",

      "This article originally appeared on VICE Canada\n\nOn May 22nd, the Canadian province of Manitoba held its first-ever LGBT Pride parade. Organized by members of the LGBTQ community and other representatives of the LGBT community, the pride parade came after a period of growing activism from the province of Manitoba, known more for its agricultural industries in general, than its progressive political and social policies.\n\nWhat was once just a fringe group started to gain influence in the province. It's now grown to over 100,000 people and is considered the largest pride celebration in Canada.\n\nWhile this is quite a new story—the government in Manitoba did not consider any of its residents a \"minor\"—it is still a story of acceptance and growth. From the very beginning, Pride was about a lot more than just the LGBTQ community. It was also the community's chance to showcase its culture and to take advantage of the government's willingness to make space for them.\n\n\"This year, we're starting with two Pride events instead of one.\"\n\nLast year was really about opening up the government to the LGBTQ community. It's a space that was already being opened up to the public in other ways: during the summer, there was always a large open space where there was a giant statue of Robert Louis Stevenson's Little Prince — the first openly gay man to be depicted in a mainstream book.\n\nThis year, Pride was also a celebration for the growing community of Aboriginal people, who were the first people in Canada to achieve full legal equality.\n\nIt was an opportunity for the LGBTQ community to be a part of the growing community and they welcomed it immediately. As one of the organizers of the pride parade in the province of Manitoba told me when I interviewed them, \"The LGBTQ community was always welcome in the same way. Pride can be a chance to be together instead of alone,\"\n\nIn fact, that very moment was when Pride started as a safe place. The organizers of Manitoba's first Pride parade were faced with a real challenge when the city of Winnipeg was preparing to host its first ever Pride festival—that is, when the city and the province were not sure of what they were, who and what they wanted to celebrate. When they went through the motions of trying to find the community and to start organizing a parade, they learned that there were a number of small, local events that had already been organized.\n\nAnd this is the idea I would always keep coming back to: that Pride was being organized through local action. When I asked them about why it was important for their first Pride parade, to be about not only being an event celebrating the LGBTQ community, but also a celebration of all marginalized groups, like race groups and people with disabilities. The organizers explained it this way:\n\n\"For us, this parade is about bringing together all the communities we would like to see in a space that's more inclusive and less homogenous. For us, we're really just an expression of these people coming together and trying to make an experience that's positive for all groups.\"\n\nThis idea isn't completely new—just look at when South Africa held its first ever Pride parade a few years ago. The South Africans knew they would have a challenge with organizing a Pride event at that time because of the country's current political situation. In fact, they even put the government in charge of their first Pride parade.\n\nHowever, the political climate in New Zealand's government had not yet been prepared to welcome all the different communities. Pride in New Zealand was a much more diverse event that also focused on the LGBTQ community.\n\nIn the same way New Zealand had to open up their government, Alberta was facing a lot of controversy over its treatment of transgender people due to new regulations.\n\nThe political climate of the province of Manitoba was just the perfect opportunity, to allow the entire community to feel that it was in charge of what was happening. While Pride itself was still mostly about LGBTQ, the entire event was also a chance to let everyone know that the province was still taking a more progressive approach than it was back when the event happened.\n\nSo why weren't the organizers going to try and take the whole province with them?\n\n\"We were always a safe space for people who want to bring other marginalized communities into our community.\"\n\n\"We never had any fears that the government would try to take over the [event],\" said Mandy Brown, one of the organizers of the Manitoba Pride parade.\n\n\"We were always a safe space for people who want to bring other marginalized communities into our community,\" Brown told me, \"And we have people who just care about our community — they wanted to do our community proud. Like, 'Hey, we're gonna take it for our own.'\"\n\nBrown explained to me that there had already been an LGBTQ-themed film festival that was being held in Winnipeg at the time, that was similar to what they were doing in Manitoba. So, the organizers thought, they could just use that",
      "How do you define success? Is it about getting one million views? Or making a billion dollars? Do you focus on a number? Maybe you're trying to get to the top of the food chain. One of the best companies at making things better is Amazon. We believe that all businesses need to have success—just not all the time.\n\nThere's a huge amount of innovation being done on a daily basis in the world of enterprise software. We have some amazing tools that help build better, more efficient processes and processes that can be used in every organization.\n\nThe best companies make great software, not just for their own advantage. We want better IT products for their organizations, so you can spend your time doing what matters most.\n\nSo what does that look like? Let's take a look at some tools that the most successful companies have.\n\nAmazon (NYSE: AMZN)\n\nAmazon is an extraordinary example of success. The company is one of the most successful in the world—and it doesn't always use the latest, most popular software.\n\nHere are some great things they've done that aren't exactly in the popular IT spotlight:\n\nThey've built a giant network of \"pipes,\" connecting warehouses and their customers using some of the world's best telecommunications equipment.\n\nThey offer \"buy it now, pay later\" subscriptions for their services. This makes it very easy for companies to get things, or get access to a ton of people's stuff when it's time to pay back those subscriptions.\n\nThey've started building out their own cloud services to compete head on with the big guys. One example is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which they call \"the best software you'll ever install.\"\n\nThey are always looking for ways to get their software into more hardware. Right now, they are a leading enterprise software vendor to run in the cloud-based data center of HP's $20 billion data center division, HP Inc.\n\nThey're doing things the hard way at a huge scale. As an aside, they're also doing things the easy way (they're very generous), so they get credit for this distinction too.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\nAnother example of great technology is Microsoft. Many big firms, both large and small, rely on Microsoft's software and services. So how do we define success there?\n\nFirst, Microsoft's market capitalization has grown from $4 billion in 1980 to over $200 billion in 2013. This means that people are actually willing to spend money on Microsoft software.\n\nThey get credit for doing things that are easier than going directly to customers: For example, they focus on making technology easy to use.\n\nThey've been doing some amazing things: They built and improved the Windows operating system. They built and improved Office. They pioneered the cloud. They built the Windows Azure cloud service. They pioneered Microsoft's Cloud platform. They're a big company that's been a big beneficiary of the internet.\n\nBut they also have been building out the \"cloud\" and are still working on how to get the next major Microsoft service off the ground. Microsoft believes in big bets, they've made a lot and have been rewarded by getting people to spend their money.\n\nOracle (NYSE: ORCL)\n\nSome of the companies on this list are very specific about what they do. Oracle, on the other hand, uses a broader scope in terms of the software they create. They're a true success.\n\nOracle is a true success—they get all the credit for building and refining an entire system for building databases. They know how to build things that other firms can use and they get all the credit for doing it.\n\nThey're focused on creating software, not only for databases but for everything from trading floor software to data center software. They've taken their network approach in data centers and applied it to everything—no one is in a better position to compete and create a massive ecosystem for data.\n\nNow, it's important to remember that these aren't companies that are in the spotlight for their software. They're companies—a large group with many very different strategies—all focused on what could potentially create the greatest economic value in the market.\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nLast, but definitely not least, we'd like to show a picture of what it looks like when Google is on top of the enterprise software market. They've made it a staple of the company's business to focus on improving their search-related services and products.\n\nAs an example, they have been building their own cloud infrastructure to compete against Amazon. And they've done so very, very well.\n\nThat's why they get credit for doing things that are easier than going directly to customers: They focus on making technology easier to use.\n\nTheir data centers are huge and well-planned, and they rely on the power that their servers can tap into",
      "A new study on the impacts of sea-level rise shows that some large cities, such as New York, will be inundated by sea levels as high as three feet by the end of the century (with several meters of water inside of the city).\n\nThe study, published on September 19th in the journal Nature Climate Change, looked at a number of scenarios related to climate change, and compared them to current patterns of sea-level rise.\n\nThe study concludes that, while these projections are pretty alarming, this is simply what we can expect:\n\nWe used a range of climate projections to show which cities and regions would be most at risk from sea-level rise, including our global low-emission scenario and a less aggressive scenario involving only low emissions and no emissions-limiting policies. The range of projections for sea-level rise under low emissions scenarios ranged from 1–5 m for the year 2025 to 1.7-5.9 m by 2100. We used a range of climate projections to show which locations outside of New York and Tokyo would be most at risk from sea-level rise, including our global high-emission scenario and a scenario with only low emissions and emissions-limiting policies. The range of projections for sea-level rise under high-emissions scenarios ranged from 2–9 m by 2100. The range of projections for the total cost to society from a high-emissions scenario ranged from $0-$7 trillion for coastal property damage in the United States and Canada, to $7 trillion for societal costs worldwide, with $21-$33 trillion for the total economic cost by 2100.\n\nAccording to the report, many large cities are at risk due to global warming, though it does not go into any detail on individual cities. For example, the report notes that New York City will be inundated by six inches of sea-level rise, though it does not specify which areas. The study also notes that \"there will be several meters of water inside New York City,\" which suggests that the city will be inundated by the six feet that the report estimates the city will see as a result of global warming.\n\nThe study also notes that the city of Singapore will also be at risk from sea level rise, due to the massive influx of water that is expected from El Nino conditions.\n\nIn other areas, the report notes that some locations, such as the Great Barrier Reef, will probably find some areas to be habitable, but that other areas likely will be uninhabitable by 2100. The report also predicts that more heatwaves will occur, but that this will not occur because scientists have observed a reduction in the number of extreme temperature events.\n\nThe study further warns that flooding will become \"rapidly and intensely disruptive,\" since climate change will lead to stronger winds. Many of the places at risk of flooding as a result of sea level rise will see flooding as early as the end of the century, the report notes.\n\nThe study notes that some of the locations at highest risk of flooding will be in some of the countries that are the most vulnerable to climate change.\n\nCities of the world, take note: #1 and #2 ranked cities of the world (both by population) are likely to be inundated by up to three meters of sea level rise by end of century. #3 #4 and #5 cities of the world are likely to be inundated by up to nine meters of sea level rise by end of century.\n\nThe researchers note:",
      "The FBI has just announced that in the wake of the Boston Marathon bombings they are \"actively investigating to determine if there are other suspects.\" In short, two brothers in Boston may or may not have been terrorists but they are currently suspects.\n\nThis is a step in the right direction that the Federal government is finally taking terrorist plots seriously. However, they won't reveal this information.\n\nThe fact that they are actively investigating doesn't mean one will ever be caught.\n\n\"The news follows months of investigations of the men, who are being held at a Boston-area prison and not yet charged with any crime, federal authorities said Friday.\"\n\nWhat I say in bold is a direct quote…\n\n\"Federal authorities said Friday that two brothers suspected of being linked to the marathon bombings are being held in a Texas prison, but they have not publicly linked any other suspects to the assault.\"\n\nThat's amazing.\n\nWhy won't the FBI actually confirm that we have been attacked? What about the \"terrorists\" they want to catch?\n\nWhat the hell is going on?\n\nI have no idea, but I feel pretty good about my chances. I have been very active over the past year on the message boards – trying to get people thinking this way. The more these people talk on the message boards, the better our odds get.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nNothing, it just means they are trying to keep this information secret. I know I'm not going to convince everyone that these people don't have connections with other people or that they don't have the ability to carry out a horrific attack like this, but I can't believe that these idiots are so clueless that they don't at least look into connections. Even the most obvious of connections is too much to keep quiet.\n\nDo you want to have any chance at all of getting away and living?\n\nI'm not just talking about money – I'm talking about something as mundane as your own safety and your own sanity. The last thing we need is another attack. No matter what the outcome, it's clear we need to make changes.\n\nDo you believe the FBI and other security agencies have it in the bag?\n\nThat I do.\n\nWhat are those changes?\n\nA good start would be to get on the message boards and show the world what you know.\n\nYou need to start writing about things on the boards and on message boards that don't have any official word to them. It shouldn't be done in an \"I'm wrong, you're right\" fashion. It should be done in a fact based way.\n\nYou can't \"be quiet\" and expect to survive.\n\nIt's like saying the Titanic didn't sink while standing on a floating oil platform. They knew this ship was going down and they weren't going to \"be quiet\" and try to change that fact. And yet in the end we ended up with the worst possible outcome.\n\nThis is where it all comes down to. We need to be proactive and change the culture if we want to survive and live.\n\nYou can't be silent and expect to live.\n\nThe truth is out there, it's just not being discussed on the boards because these stupid assholes can't seem to comprehend it.\n\nThere has to be more people willing to give their lives to make America a better place than they are – and many of them have already.\n\nFor those of you that think these things are crazy – you are part of the problem.\n\nDo what you can to stop the insane.\n\nI will be posting the results from the Boston bombings on the website I started for this very subject last week here.\n\nSee you on the next page!\n\nAdvertisements",

      "In the 1970s, the San Francisco Chronicle asked San Francisco residents to answer a simple question —\n\n\"What are the most important problems facing our city today?\"\n\nMore than 3,000 people answered, but one of the more popular choices was \"education.\" The question was the first of a series meant to focus not only on one area of concern, but also to create an issue-based, and possibly \"actionable,\" approach that could then be used to find solutions.\n\nThis is what I think is happening in education today — and what I've come to see is a way for San Francisco students to do something about it.\n\nWith this blogpost, I'd like to offer some suggestions to make the education system better for students in my district, and for communities and schools across SF. You are invited to share and comment on this post — I'll answer as many as I can!\n\nI think it's time for education in San Francisco to step up and solve the problems it faces in an actionable way.\n\n1. Education is expensive.\n\nIf you've lived here your whole life, you've probably seen the sticker shock when you move out onto the street with your car.\n\nWhen you factor in the cost of public education, the cost is almost inconceivable to many families.\n\nAs the San Francisco Public School Coalition recently noted, \"Students at private schools in our district pay an average of $15,843 more in teacher-related costs than similarly situated students in San Francisco Public School. At the other end of the spectrum, students attending public schools in our district pay much less than the public sector average in annual teacher-related costs … we need additional funding from parents and the community to increase funding in all areas of the district.\"\n\n2. San Francisco Public Schools currently do more with less.\n\nThis is where some of the problems arise: San Francisco Public Schools are underfunded far beyond their needs.\n\nSome of the money needs to go to better-trained teachers.\n\nAll told, it is estimated that more than 40% of education costs are not being paid for by the state or local governments.\n\nBut here's the great news: The good news is that we're doing some things about it!\n\nSan Francisco Unified School District is on the right path with a long-term strategic plan to reduce the amount of money San Francisco Public Schools spend, and the district is currently using revenue from a recent ballot measure to meet the demand.\n\nThe plan calls for a total of $2.6 billion in school budget cuts over the next 7 years. That's more than triple the cuts made over the years under the last administration.\n\nAnd it's a plan that we can take to the voters at the ballot this November.\n\nYou can sign up here: Save San Francisco Public School District.\n\n3. You don't need a college degree.\n\nThe best college degree a student can have is college degrees in math, science, social work, and English.\n\nI want a college degree so you don't have to spend $120,000+ a year for a degree, and I want to make sure it's in this district.\n\nAnd we believe we can make college and careers more valuable to San Francisco's kids.\n\nWe need to focus and invest in education, and make sure schools in San Francisco are as great as they can be. Let's help our kids get the best chance for college, careers, and life.\n\n4. San Francisco Public Schools already have incredible students from all walks of life.\n\nEven with current funding levels, San Francisco Public Schools will still have some low-income students, many English language learners, many students with disabilities and others. And this means we have already achieved an amazing college graduation rate: 91-99%.\n\nBut we also have students from every race and class background, every religion and country. (You can check out more of their demographics here.)\n\nWe're all fighting for education to live up to its potential.\n\n5. We need more money to recruit high-quality teachers.\n\nWe are currently spending an average of $8,534 / year on a full-time assistant teacher. (That's $19,918 for two assistants!)\n\nTo have an assistant teacher, a teacher must be certified. Unfortunately, only 38% of SF's principals are certified — and that's despite the fact that the amount of teachers certified per each SF elementary school principal has gone up dramatically over the past 15 years.\n\nIt's time to make sure all of our teachers are certified and that we have a strong pathway toward certification. That means investing more money in the classroom of every teacher.\n\n6. Our teacher evaluation system needs more rigor.\n\nOne of the most important problems with our teacher evaluation system is that it's based on tests, not student learning.\n\nA new study in the",

      "In November 2011, I visited a few of the places where she's been living since then. And, I had a nice time. She was a wonderful person, in spite of the circumstances.\n\nBut I'm afraid her situation might become even more complicated now.\n\nShe has asked me not to discuss the details of this story. But, in her own words, here's an excerpt from the letter I recently got from her as a parting gift (and not one about the wedding):\n\n\"I will be telling my story from the perspective of a person who was living in another country during the height of the Arab Spring.\n\nAt the time, it seemed as though the world had reached a tipping point in terms of the future of both political parties involved. While I was in the country, I had no idea what was in store for Egypt. I was only concerned with my safety and well-being. However, as things started to happen, I became so aware of how fragile the situation was. One day a friend I was staying with was killed in the streets. The next day, my home was ransacked, and my mobile phone was stolen just before it literally burst into flames. I thought I had seen everything.\n\nSo what became of the revolution? When I left Egypt, I became more determined than ever to do everything in my power and fight in every possible way to change their current predicament and bring peace and stability back to a country that had just been through so many problems.\n\nAs a result, in October 2013, after a year living in Libya and a trip back home to Egypt, I finally got my chance to return to Egypt. It was a strange experience and was very challenging for me. After almost 3 years, I was ready to return home — that was what I was looking for, that was what I was hoping for. But I had to leave. And as I was packing all my things, I was asked to sign a few documents, such as a permission from the government. My signature was in the document.\n\nAs I thought about what I was signing and what it meant, something seemed different. I was signing my own personal death warrant.\n\nI was now a victim. I wasn't signing anything I did not want to do — I had already left everything behind and was going to live a simple life as a free man, without any obligations to anyone. I was just one day more than a prisoner. But I hadn't been fully aware of the gravity of the situation before. Now, at 36 years old, I know exactly what I was signing. This had to change and my home, everything that I owned…everything was going to become a commodity…something I had to give away.\n\nIt was time to move…now. I was not going to live in a country that might have trouble standing up to it's own population at its own home in the future. It was not just about my safety and security — I was being told by some very powerful people that I had to leave Egypt because Egypt was going to be destroyed. You can believe what you want — Egypt is a big country. I could not live in the desert or on the Egyptian- Sinai border. This was the reason I signed it so freely, but the reality was not the same. Egypt is not as big as I thought, it is not that big a country anymore.\n\nI know that people can say, 'What do you think? Egypt has been destroyed a long time ago.' Yes, I did think about Egypt being destroyed when I left Egypt, but I also remember Egypt was much simpler back then – it was not yet a majority-Muslim country. It was a multi-ethnic, multi-religious country with a thriving agricultural and industrial sector. Now it is a Muslim country with a large minority population. I guess that is why I signed my own personal death warrant, to save the country from its future. But when I went back, Egypt has become more Muslim and more Muslim countries than ever before. Even in my homeland, there are many issues that cause trouble.\n\nThe only hope I had was that something can come from within Egypt. If I was going to make this new country work, I needed to bring about change. I needed to make my country a better place for all Egyptian citizens. But, in the past 12 months, the situation turned into a totally different one from before. There are so many differences, and the government still shows no signs of understanding what I am saying or what I am trying to accomplish.\n\nI'm not going to be part of this problem anymore…I am leaving Egypt. I am sending many things I love and I want to see back home. I will be in Dubai at the beginning of February. In the meantime, my husband (who is also now out of Egypt) is working for a large company in Abu Dhabi, where we will live.\n\nI can't wait until I can go back to America and be part",

      "\nPolls have shown that Americans have a strong preference for candidates with experience in public office.\n\nDonald Trump, the man who most recent polls show is leading the Republican primary field, is, at least for now, not in office.\n\nAfter weeks of flirting with running for president, Trump has now said he will not, even though he will be the first nominee ever not to have held elected office.\n\nTrump has repeatedly said that public service will be a key priority when he takes office. He has repeatedly criticized public service as not being the strongest career path for politicians — in spite of decades of experience in the business world.\n\n\"That is a poor way to make a living,\" Trump said in March 2015, as he addressed the National Press Club at George Washington University. \"That's the way you end up losing all of your friends in Washington: You are just there taking all these votes. So, I'm just not interested. I think it's a joke. I think it's really a joke. When I look at it, why would I want to do it? I'm a businessman. A businessman has to look for the best people. I'm not interested in that.\"\n\nThe Republican establishment, for its part, has long been concerned with Trump's political inexperience, his history of bankruptcies and his often-gaffes. But Trump has made clear that a desire to serve — something that his supporters say is the strongest reason for him to run — does not qualify as an \"experience\" in the eyes of voters.\n\nThe first time the Federal Election Committee registered Trump's campaign, it did so with a disclaimer noting that his \"total combined assets... are less than minimum amount required as security for any federal candidate or committee\" — a requirement imposed by Federal Election Commission rules that, according to the Federal Election Commission's website, \"prohibit a candidate from having a total gross contribution of more than $5,000.\" In the same filing, Trump listed seven different companies as being held by him. This means Trump could have given up to several millions of dollars to his campaign. As a result, he doesn't appear to qualify on the FEC's official list of registered federal candidates.\n\nThe FEC's website does not state the minimum contribution that candidates have to match in order for them to run for office. It would be difficult to determine precisely the dollar amount he is legally required to contribute.\n\nBut some experts noted that his financial disclosures would not be necessary because he is likely to become a major donor to the Republican Party. He will likely receive contributions from rich individuals and companies that are based in other countries.\n\nTrump is not the only GOP candidate that has publicly said he would not have the requisite experience when it comes to working in the public sector. Jeb Bush said he does not have the required financial commitments to serve in office if elected president. And Ted Cruz, in his debate with Marco Rubio, said that he does not think the public has a right to be confident that the people who will lead the nation — whether it is a president or a senator — actually know how to serve as one.\n\nOn the whole, candidates often say they have the experience to run for president but don't actually have it. The same has happened with most members of Congress throughout history, although not all members have qualified for the race.\n\nA survey released Sunday by Public Policy Polling found that 55 percent of Americans favored the idea of Trump running. Just 29 percent said they would not.\n\nThis article has been updated with additional information from Trump.",

And it makes a wonderful contribution to the regeneration of the waterfront.'\n\nIncluding a £4.6 million, six-storey extension, the Museum of Liverpool will be at the heart of the city centre for visitors from the 14 days of the city's summer festival.\n\nOn Saturday, May 7, the Liverpool Waterfront Partnership and Liverpool Arts are launching a new programme for the festival, which will showcase a new wave of work from the world's leading contemporary artists.\n\nOpening on Thursday, May 11, the exhibition will showcase pieces by New York's Mark Lintott, Manchester's Tom Biscuit, London's Matthew Hollingsworth and London-based artist, Mark Spillett.\n\nFrom Wednesday, May 26, the exhibition will feature the installations of German-born artist, Anna Dzubik.\n\nThe programme will run in three main galleries in the museum, which will showcase artists such as London-based artist, Alex St. Martin and Germany's Paul Stahl.\n\nThe museum's collection, which is being preserved between 1789 and 1962 as part of the Liverpool Art Gallery, includes many of the city's most important masterpieces and works of contemporary art.\n\nAmong the more notable pieces to have been brought to Liverpool from the city's past are the first wooden horse galloping into Liverpool on March 3, 1768 and a miniature of the Abbey Church in 1545.\n\nMore than 100 paintings and drawings, including works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Holbein and Munch, are in the collection.\n\nThe exhibition that opens on Thursday, May 11, is curated by Paul Leach and displays some of the biggest contemporary works from across the world.\n\nIt features works of art from around the world, including paintings by Italian painter Enrico Carbonara (1836-1914) and American painter James Turrell (1863-1949).\n\nMore than 100 paintings and drawings, including works by Rembrandt, Rubens, Holbein and Munch, are in the collection.

      "A few months ago, I sat in a classroom in a suburban neighborhood a few miles outside San Francisco. As in so many of the classes I teach at a tech industry training company, the room was full of new software engineers. Everyone had just graduated from either an Ivy League college or a top tech training school in the Bay area, or had recently moved from San Francisco. One student was from Africa. Many were women. As I watched them struggle to grasp code and write reports in a language they barely knew, I felt a little queasy about the scene — and myself.\n\nFor the last year, I've been teaching a summer programming course at one of the biggest tech training firms in the world. The company, called Udacity, is backed by Facebook billionaire Mark Zuckerberg. It is now offering classes that teach coding to anyone who wants to learn it.\n\nA year ago I would have seen this event for what it was: the emergence of a new elite within America, a new class to which some elite institutions would soon succumb.\n\nBut something unexpected happened last year: Silicon Valley seemed to fall into line. Many big tech companies, including Facebook, Google, and Apple, began to sponsor the courses, and to sponsor more and more courses. It became hard for me to look with disgust that hundreds of students — mostly college students and college graduates — could learn to code for free.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#ad#\n\nA year ago, a small group of protesters gathered at the San Francisco offices of Facebook. These protesters were concerned about a new requirement: A big part of Udacity's curriculum will now require students to take a \"programming language\" class and write a program to show for it. Because of the way many big tech companies work these days, many of the programmers that are hired to write those programming languages will be from India, India, and South Asia, to say nothing of the East.\n\nOne of the activists, an Indian-American named Pranav Jain, said that they were particularly concerned because Udacity has a strong focus on India. Jain complained that the \"diversity in the company's software development, hardware engineering, and education positions is so extremely thin that I can't even begin to imagine how it will reflect our tech workforce.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI think it is remarkable that the tech industry has rallied around this idea, which is pretty outrageous, but there it is.\n\n#page#\n\nJain is far from the only one that thinks this way. The other activists, many of them software engineers and computer science professors outside of the tech industry, were alarmed by this shift. They felt that they were letting down the many people who work so hard to make the tech industry great. They said they were also concerned about the effect this would have on young people from lower-income backgrounds — because some of them may have felt so discouraged in their attempts to obtain college degrees that they would take a coding class just to feel like they were doing something to help.\n\nJain and his allies have since dropped their protest effort, but the issue is alive.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwo other problems beset the course too. The first is that Udacity makes its coding training available to everyone: No matter how expensive or hard a student works to achieve his or her mastery of a particular language, they can simply download a course and start learning it themselves without having to enroll at any college or university. This opens up a class of students to potential abuse as well as the potential for student error and a lack of understanding of language syntax, as well as to abuse of their privacy.\n\nThe result of this, critics say, is a growing threat from hackers for whom this sort of unsupervised coding is a free form of art. As one Udacity spokesperson told me, \"The goal is to make programming accessible to the underutilized, but we are not saying that the most competent and accomplished among you shall have the most opportunities to do so.\" They are not, of course, saying that. Their language is only offering them another tool to exploit.\n\nAs one student said to me two months ago: \"As a new member of what we perceive to be a new elite class, I have absolutely no idea how this will influence my life. I am now being asked to become part of this new class that is supposed to represent the best and brightest. It's a terrifying thought.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMany have pointed out that for all the problems the coding school creates — both for the education it produces, and for society at large — the problem is not that it is free. Some people feel that it is too easy to sign up: Udacity does all of the legwork for you. When a prospective student signs up they are automatically enrolled in the code course, as the company says that it \"does not make money from students.\" You don't have to send in any money — the cost of the instruction comes entirely",

      "Roughly 90 percent of all Americans use some form of digital payment at some point. But the numbers of those who use credit cards are declining even as they've risen dramatically for mobile payment providers. One thing that's holding those numbers back is consumer protection: banks, payment processors and debit card providers continue to play games to make it difficult for consumers to transfer money to their friends and family.\n\nLast month, the Electronic Privacy Information Center argued in a lawsuit that these protections are unconstitutional and a waste of taxpayer money.\n\nIn addition to suing the big three banks, EPIC also filed a class action to encourage its network of consumer protection lawyers to take the case. That's what the group did earlier this year as well, in a new case called United States v. E-ZPass Systems, claiming that the system's \"bureaucratic and confusing\" restrictions prevent consumers from \"buying and paying for the things they need to live, work, travel, or play, without their banks having to approve each of those transactions.\"\n\nEPIC also noted that the EZPass system has a \"lack of consumer protections\" and \"no recourse\" for people who've been harmed by the system.\n\nLast month, the judge in that class action, District Judge Stephen Thacker, rejected the banks' attempts to dismiss the case. And in a new order (PDF) sent Wednesday, Thacker sided with the EPIC and said the banks must give those consumers and merchants who use the system a choice.\n\nThe judge noted, \"A good and effective alternative to the EZPass system is the traditional means of payment: cash or credit cards. The public interest would be served by providing consumers with an efficient, secure, and simple means of paying for their daily necessities.\"\n\nWhile Thacker's order will affect consumers, consumers who use mobile payment apps will no longer need to deal with the complexities of the EZPass system. That should help in the future.\n\nBut even though those apps aren't affected, the judge notes there's still another problem with the EZPass system. Under its terms, the systems require that retailers collect data from every customer who uses it and transmit it to the companies that run the EZPass payments network for processing, but Thacker says the data can't be retained longer than four months.\n\nAdditionally, the information collected by the system can't be shared without permission from the owner of the account, he notes, which essentially protects the privacy rights of credit card users.\n\nThacker says he wants companies who run the EZPass system to give users the option to transfer funds to their credit or debit cards without getting approval from the companies for each transaction. For example, users could send one person $1 and then transfer it to another person.",

      "This past weekend, the two main men of the UFC, UFC President Dana White and UFC Chief Operating Officer Lawrence Epstein, met face to face for the first time since the UFC bought the company this past summer.\n\nDuring the brief meeting in the days leading up to UFC 168 in Las Vegas, White and Epstein discussed various topics that were included in their discussions this past weekend.\n\nWhite's first question to Epstein was simple: \"How'd it go between you two?\"\n\n\"Well, I can't tell ya how's it go,\" Epstein told him. \"I'm just here so our partners know we're still there. So we're here and we're very happy with what happened and are now a partner, so just enjoy the show.\"\n\nWhile Epstein said he's extremely happy to be a part of White's organization, he also acknowledged the tough decisions that lie ahead for the UFC.\n\n\"I think we are always going to have to make tough decisions, because everything is changing,\" Epstein said. \"A lot of people were saying that there was so much stuff, so many different things that we need to deal with. And you know, we've been thinking about it, so we have some options. But there's just no doubt that there needs to be some things fixed -- a lot of stuff that needs to be fixed and a lot of that stuff. It's not the way that they wanted it to go, but it was just a necessity and now we've got to go and address it.\"\n\nOn the topic of what needs to be fixed, Epstein explained that UFC was never truly going to get the right balance of fighters to support a live event for the company.\n\n\"It's so hard for me to think ahead when we're doing the event,\" Epstein said. \"There's just too many people, too many fights going on -- it's hard. It's not just one event with a big draw and it goes away. Now you've got to look to your next event and figure out how do you plan to sell so many tickets?\"\n\n\"A lot of things need to be fixed,\" he continued. \"I've seen it. I've been in this business a long time and I've seen things that are good and bad. But, I will tell you that there is a better balance than people had before you guys bought it. There is a better balance that needs to be brought in. And it's just a process, but it's a very complicated process, but it's a process that needs to get fixed, and it just has to be.\"\n\nA quick recap of Epstein's message:\n\n1. The promotion needs to plan for every possible outcome during every UFC card. Even in a world where every fighter is under contract and has to be released by their management once a fight is over, there will always be plenty of fighters that the UFC could use in a fight.\n\n\"You will always have this situation,\" Epstein told MMAFighting.com . \"There always is a fighter that's not getting paid because there's some reason why. They're under contract. We're going to try and take care of them and make sure they're getting paid and make sure they get their full allotment of fights and everything going forward until they're ready to retire.\"\n\n2. The UFC doesn't like it when a company buys a promotion and then doesn't live up to all the promises that the promotion made.\n\n\"The bottom line is that we all don't want to go out of business,\" Epstein said. \"It's hard and it's a lot more complicated.\"\n\n3. Fighting will never go away. As long as the top-notch athletes and fighters continue to fight at their best, the UFC will be on the right path by promoting them. As long as the UFC can continue to produce great fights and continue to find an exciting story line every week and bring in new star fighters, the UFC will continue to be there to promote that story line.\n\n\"We're gonna have to look at what we want to do,\" Epstein told MMAFighting.com . \"I think we have to do everything to make sure we have a top-heavy roster. We have to make sure we have a whole lot of options. You just can't say, 'We're not gonna do it,' because we're going to have to have more than just one show with the same thing going on so you can bring in some different things and make a bigger thing.\"\n\nA little more on Epstein's position:\n\n4. The UFC's deal with Fox doesn't mean that they will be able to promote UFC shows on other outlets or networks. As long as a promoter is able to make money off the event, the UFC will promote it. Their contract doesn't allow Fox to promote the shows, but as long as they could make money off it, they'll promote it.\n\n\"Everything, I mean everything will come to fruition,\"",
      "In a world where the United States has been at war with Russia since 1941, it is not too surprising that American policy makers in the Obama years have been eager to create safe zones in Syria to protect Syrians. The idea is simple: Provide a safe haven for refugees; deter Syrian President Assad from using them for military purposes; and allow for a safe zone to exist at least some of the time so that the United States and its allies can maintain some military presence along our southern border. This is, of course, an option that would be politically toxic in the United States.\n\nHowever, according to recently declassified documents from the National Security Council, there is already a program in place to establish safe zones in Syria.\n\nIn fact, the program started before the United States even took office. On December 6, 2014, President Obama traveled to the presidential retreat at Camp David to announce that the United States would establish safe zones in Syria to protect Syrian civilians. The United States and its allies would also coordinate with Turkey to secure those safe zones through the use of special forces and intelligence personnel.\n\nTo the surprise of many, the program is not very popular with some members of Congress. To some, it is reminiscent of George Orwell's 1984, in which a vast military apparatus is used to enforce a strict totalitarian regime. To others, it is simply another way of protecting innocent civilians who have become the very target of the conflict-induced displacement that we are currently experiencing.\n\nHowever, the Obama administration's efforts to use \"humanitarian\" principles to achieve regime change have produced a remarkable response. On Saturday, Russia, Syria's main supporter, said that it has accepted the idea of establishing such safe zones, adding that they could be expanded. This would also mean more American troops on the ground to protect them.\n\nDespite these steps forward, the White House continues to insist that such zones cannot be an option, even if Russia and Syria are agreeable. When a House Democratic member from New York mentioned the program on August 17th, White House spokesman Josh Earnest replied that the proposal was not part of the administration's policy objectives in Syria, but of the international community's in Syria. He then elaborated that the Obama administration could not support the creation of safe zones because it would inevitably involve the United States in a military component to that war.\n\nEarnest went on to note that such \"safe zones\" would likely require direct American military involvement to protect civilians and create security. It might be useful, Earnest suggested, to provide humanitarian assistance such as food and medical assistance along with safe zones to alleviate that pressure:\n\nThis is not a decision that we have made based on any preconceived notions. This is a strategy that is consistent with Secretary Kerry's call in Geneva for a diplomatic approach in order to get some of the pressure off the Russians. We don't believe the United States can be an honest broker in that negotiation, but the United States does believe that we could make it easier for people to find safety and freedom in that territory….\n\nEarnest's remark is problematic, not because it ignores the actual issue of Syria's humanitarian crisis. Rather, it points to U.S. policy as lacking in clear objectives, one which, according to most analysts, is an effort to ensure regime change in Syria. If the U.S. is to have any success protecting civilians in Syria, it will require a policy that does not simply rely on political rhetoric to achieve that end. Until that happens, the United States should not assume that safe zones and similar options are something that the Kremlin will approve of, and it should not try to \"save\" innocent Muslim refugees in other countries while using military force to overthrow the government of its own country. Doing so will simply fuel the cycle of war that is being exacerbated by the U.S.-backed Syrian opposition and its supporters.",
      "Fishermen on the River Thames off south-east England are facing an unpleasant surprise. They will be banned from using a method to catch the largest fish on the planet – the swordfish.\n\nThe ban, if implemented, will come into force from 8 September and affects about one per cent of Britain's fishing fleet of 12,000 outrigger canoes.\n\nIt follows years of lobbying by British fishing companies against the use of the catch-as-you-throw method, commonly referred to as \"fishing with a stick\".\n\nFor decades this method has proved to be the only method used that has successfully taken the biggest fish in the world in recent years, the swordfish. It has also been the preferred method in the English Channel waters in recent years to take the giant swordfish.\n\nBut this has not been without criticism from British trawlers worried that the method involves trawling in areas they have been asked not to and could result in a decrease in their catch.\n\nFishermen who used the canoes have long used this method for their fish when the giant fish had not been found. They claim that the catch of the greatest fish in the world and a commercial lure are now being cut down as a result of the ban.\n\nThe Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) has been consulting on ways to tackle problems that have arisen as a result of the decline in large swordfish catch levels in recent years.\n\nThe problem with swordfish, which can grow larger than 20st, is that it requires a very specific type of habitat. It grows best in waters where deep water coral reefs are abundant and healthy and large concentrations of phytoplankton are present. It is also very sensitive to fluctuations in oxygen levels, and the water temperature, and is more susceptible to pollutants.\n\nIn a statement, Defra said it wanted to \"maintain healthy fish stocks, and to do this the use of the catch-as-you-throw method of fishing will be banned for the following season, with all fisheries having an option of using alternate methods in the following season\".\n\n\n\"The department is also considering options for a future season to allow for alternative catch-as-you-throw methods to be used, with options being considered.\"\n\nThe move is backed by the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations which claims fish stocks and jobs are threatened by this new ruling. The group also highlights concerns that an end to the swordfish catch may mean an increase in other large species being caught using the method, including cod and haddock.\n\n\"The department has not considered this in an open and transparent way,\" said Paul Whitehead, director of the federation. \"Fishermen have been using this catch method for decades and a ban means they are no longer able to take these fish. Fishing with a paddle can be done by people who have never even been fishing before.\"\n\nWhitehead said the federation would be meeting this week to discuss the implications of the new ban, including whether the ban should be extended to the canoes that use the catch-as-you-throw method.\n\nThe group is also seeking a meeting with the fisheries minister, George Eustice, to discuss the problems with the swordfish and other fish species that have suffered from dwindling stocks as a result of overfishing.\n\nA Defra spokesman said a discussion of the new rules will take place during a consultation in the autumn.",
      "MOSCOW/BERLIN (Reuters) - Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Washington should take a decision on who it believes is responsible for an attack on a Russian passenger jet that killed all 224 people on board.\n\n\"We'll consider who the guilty party is. We'll be discussing this with our American colleagues,\" she told a Russian news agency, Interfax. \"Either the Americans say it was the Ukrainian authorities, or they admit responsibility - which is already happened.\"\n\nRussia's state-run RIA news agency cited a source in the U.S. State Department as saying the U.S. State Department believes that pro-Russian separatists shot down Malaysia Airlines flight MH17 with a surface-to-air missile last Thursday.\n\nA Ukrainian officer from Kiev's Security Service (SBU) was quoted in the Russian daily Novaya Gazeta as saying two individuals involved with a large-scale arms cache that was seized in eastern Ukraine were suspected of shooting down flight MH17.\n\nThe same report said the information was shared with U.S. diplomats in Kiev and with the head of the U.N. Security Council.\n\nIn a statement, the U.S. Embassy in Ukraine said that State Department deputy spokeswoman Marie Harf said she was unaware of those reports.\n\n\"We are still gathering information about reports of the downing of a civil airplane and are not in a position to confirm or deny them,\" she said in the statement.\n\n\"There is no doubt that those responsible for providing arms and other assistance to the separatists who are conducting military operations in eastern Ukraine bear primary responsibility for the safety of all 298 people on board.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Russia's Security Council, Anna Fotyga, told Interfax the report was a \"tactic\" meant to divert attention from the United States' alleged involvement in the Malaysian plane disaster.\n\nShe said this was meant to \"sensationalize the tragedy of the crash and use it for domestic purposes, to make Russia look guilty and bring more international pressure to bear on Russia.\"\n\n\"What is happening now is nothing new,\" she said. \"The only thing new is the fact that something such as this has not happened in such a long time. Russian and international law enforcement bodies have been observing the flow of arms from Ukraine into the hands of terrorists in the eastern part of Ukraine for well over a year.\"\n\nThe pro-Russian separatists in eastern Ukraine have denied accusations of using a Russian-made missile and Russia's authorities have urged countries to hold off on condemning those charges due to Russia's status as a signatory to the international nuclear Non Proliferation Treaty.\n\nThe incident is one of the biggest tragedies involving an airliner since the Sept. 11, 2001 tragedy.",

      "Kissing his way through life, the film's director, Brian Robbins, will release his new film, The Other Side of Loneliness, on iTunes on Sunday September 22. This week we share an early look at the film - and what it's all about.\n\nDirector Brian Robbins recently shared the story with the Loneliness Conference at the University of Oxford.\n\nIn the film Robbins, whose credits include Inception, The Social Network and Wall Street, paints a rather bleak picture of the modern world.\n\nHe says: \"The human race is experiencing a profound change in the quality of life. People no longer have the luxury of not being connected to every facet of their lives.\n\n\"Today, in the age of social media, the average people have a virtual reality that is no bigger than a mobile telephone and an endless stream of new distractions of entertainment, news, gossip, celebrity.\"\n\nIn the film Robbins talks about loneliness in a way that feels a little familiar but nonetheless feels true. He talks about it, for instance, as a type of social anxiety he describes.\n\n\"We're looking for a kind of social solace,\" Robbins explains. \"All this social media is creating a desire for connection, but at the same time it's creating this loneliness.\"\n\nThe film includes interviews with people in New York like John Lanchester and Tom Perrotta; in California like Kevin Kiley and Sam Lipsyte; and in the UK at the Royal Institution, where psychologist Robert Reich explains loneliness, the causes and treatments.\n\nRobbins explains what drives people to seek friendship and social media sites.\n\n\"These are things that drive our attention because we want our attention to be focused on us,\" he explains. \"And our minds do that really well, but at the same time, it makes it much, much more difficult for us to feel connected with other people. And this in turn is why people are going to seek out other distractions.\"\n\nRobbins, who's also a co-owner of the band Muse, continues: \"At the heart of it is just loneliness.\"\n\n\"So the way that you're seeing it is that you're having this profound change in your life and you're seeing yourself in the mirror.\"\n\nThe Other Side of Loneliness is out on iTunes on September 22.",

      "There aren't many people who would argue with the proposition that \"the last refuge of a scoundrel is a good villain.\"\n\nYet when the New York Knicks brought in free agent forward Derrick Williams, the reaction from many critics on Twitter (and many within the franchise) was both predictable and predictable.\n\nIt was predictable that the majority of fans would assume that Williams had the worst shooting touch of anyone on the team, and that his offensive game was not a fit for the triangle offense that the Knicks are currently installing.\n\nIt's predictable, because the Knicks' offense as it exists right now under Jeremy Lin, Carmelo Anthony, Jose Calderon and J.R. Smith is not the one Williams played with in Phoenix.\n\nBut it was certainly predictable, too, to question Williams' motives.\n\nBut Williams has given a different answer.\n\nThe 35-year-old Williams, who was on hand with the Knicks at Madison Square Garden Monday night to see the team win a preseason game against Chicago, has explained why he joined the Knicks last weekend for the first time as a free agent.\n\n\"It was the right thing to do based on all the things I've heard about the team and the organization,\" Williams said, via Newsday's Frank Isola. \"I was excited. I got involved for the first time and I'm glad I was able to.\"\n\nThat's a good answer, as many of us were in this position. We all assumed the last place a player would turn would be the team that he played for his entire basketball career. Williams, however, opted for this opportunity in New York because his family feels welcomed by the Knicks. His wife, Rachel, is a member of the Knicks, she has a home there, and he sees the team as a great organization. And Williams was not alone in his assessment.\n\n\"When you are a player, you want to do the right thing by the organization and I want to be a part of it,\" Williams said. \"It was an easy decision for me to come here and play for the team, because of the love that Carmelo, Jose, Jeremy. Jeremy had made me feel welcomed to the team. Jose and the staff are such a great group of guys. They care for each other.\"\n\nWilliams played alongside Jason Kidd in Phoenix, and he noted that he feels Kidd's impact on his career to date as a veteran teammate. Now, he's joining Kidd in New York. But why was there such a difference in Williams' feelings towards this particular organization?\n\n\"I played there for years (and I knew) the culture was good, but the team wasn't there,\" he explained. \"All the guys had had long, successful careers and they were happy. I just wanted to play for that. I wanted to be part of a franchise. And when I look at this organization now and what I see in front of me and what the players have to look forward to, I know that the players feel the same way. That's why you have Jeremy Lin and Carmelo Anthony in New York and what they're going to bring to the team.\"\n\nWilliams, for his part, is excited to be in New York. But the biggest question is whether or not this will happen as a short-term solution.\n\nWilliams was signed to a three-year deal worth $23 million, and the team gave $10 million guaranteed to both him and Calderon. Even if New York trades Williams now, which is apparently their preferred option, it would take a trade exception (probably the $5.3 million New York traded for the rights to Marquese Chriss) to bring back the 35-year-old, who is averaging 9.4 points and 8.1 rebounds per game. Williams will be 32 next month and he is coming off one of the worst seasons of his life last year, and has yet to put together any back-to-back seasons with more than six points and five rebounds in a season.\n\nBut Williams is looking for the opportunity not only to start a career, but to contribute to the Knicks' pursuit of the No. 1 seed in the Eastern Conference. If all goes as Williams hopes, the Knicks will make that goal a reality.",
      "There is no single \"right\" way to use the Internet. Everyone is an \"Internet expert.\" And everyone is using the Internet in different ways.\n\nAs I write this, my home Internet connection is down. I'm in a house that is not equipped to accommodate anything over a gigabit. I have several other options, but if my home Internet goes down, the only way I can be sure it doesn't happen again is by keeping up with news here and on the blog.\n\nBut if you're not part of the average user, what does your Internet \"do?\" A lot. And there are no rules that guarantee you'll do it all correctly, or even at all.\n\nTo that end, I've created five articles that will help answer basic questions about how to use the Internet. Here they are, in roughly equal parts:\n\nHow to get news from the Web.\n\nHow to post a blog.\n\nHow to get paid for the things you do.\n\nHow to build a social community.\n\nHow to build a community that will keep you online.\n\n(And if you want more in-depth information about any of these topics or other related topics, have a look at the related pages!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHow to get news from the Web\n\nHow to post a blog\n\nHow to get paid for the things you do\n\nHow to get news on the Web\n\nThis first article looks at how to get news online for personal, personal use. As I said, everyone is using the Internet differently, and the best method for getting news—whether it's for yourself, your blog, or for a project you're working on—depends on your situation.\n\nSo to help you figure out the best way to get the news, the three main principles are:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Get a news source that helps you get the news you're interested in.\n\n2. Provide value for anyone who wants to read the news you get.\n\n3. Post news you get from a source you trust.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n1. Get a news source that helps you get the news you're interested in: You can't figure out what you want to know all on your own if you don't know what you don't want to know. If you don't have enough news to feed the desire, or if you want news you can turn into information you can use, then look for a news source that offers both—or a feed of news with your interests at the top so that you can focus on what you want to know. This article is just the tip of the iceberg about the sources you can use for this. Other articles at the Daily Dot that talk about other outlets include:\n\n2. Provide value for anyone who wants to read the news you get: If you're a publisher or editor, the first thing you need to do is figure out your readership: How many people in your industry are actually reading your work? How can you ensure new people are reading your work? If you don't know, find out. Find out where people are coming from, and who they are, and start thinking about your next steps to reach them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe next thing you need to do is determine how much time you're going to give your readers: For some of us, it'll be a bit of time; for others, a lot more. To be best at this, you need to be very active on social media—both on your own blog or in your circles at work. You need to actively participate, to tweet when and where you can, which will help you get the word out about your blog, but also make you a better writer. In the article on how to get paid for the things you do, I talked about the need for bloggers to get in the habit of being active on social media, but there are other practices as well. Don't just follow your friends and \"like\" everything they do. There's also a big difference between following to see what they're doing and following just to be in the \"friend group,\" and following out of fear of being \"watched\" or because you can't imagine that you would be worth anything without them.\n\n3. Post news you get from a source you trust: You might not think this is particularly important, but it can get confusing when you publish information, and someone has to go looking for it on the Internet, particularly if you have several sites that are all the same on the Web itself. So how to ensure that you always get accurate information? When I was researching this article, this came up in discussions. What did they mean? The best thing is to search for the source on sites such as Google News. The more sources you have, the more data you have. You can even ask the person who finds the news you publish to send you articles from sources you know you can trust. If you want more",
      "The European Union's foreign policy chief, Federica Mogherini, voiced her support for President Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and said the decision was \"very, very significant.\" A few minutes later, she spoke at the opening of a two-day Middle East peace conference, during which she urged the parties for an urgent return to talks to end the Israel-Gaza conflict. The remarks were the first time a top EU official had expressed support for Trump's decision.\n\nMogherini, who was born in Milan, said the United States has taken an historic step in recognizing the city. The European Union, the Middle East Quartet, China and Russia had also declared it as the capital of Israel, which Mogherini accused of being in breach of the status quo that has prevailed across the occupied territories for more than 40 years.\n\nMogherini's public remarks in support of the United States decision on Tuesday came a day after Israel's Foreign Ministry released an official statement saying that, despite \"overwhelming pressure\" from many countries, Mogherini had spoken in favor of Israel.\n\nHowever, Mogherini's comments on Wednesday were seen as a departure from her previous tone during the two weeks since the Middle East peace conference in Washington where she was a keynote speaker. Mogher the European Council President for this week's conference, which will continue on Thursday in Ramallah while a third stage of talks is due to open early next week in Brussels, said it was time for the Palestinian leadership to start talks with Israel.\n\n\"The Palestinian authorities should go back to the table and the time for an immediate cessation of hostilities and negotiations with Israel should be resumption of negotiations,\" Mogherini said to the Palestinian Media Watch group.\n\nThe head of the EU External Action Service, Federica Mogherini, addresses the media in Ramallah on December 15, 2017. Photo: AFP\n\nShe added that European Union member states would \"support every step to put in place a new settlement that respects the status quo.\"\n\n\"But this is no time for excuses, for justifications, and for the continuation of violence. Instead of violence, it is time to negotiate and bring peace and stability to the region,\" she added.\n\nMogherini also made a speech to the press and said the EU has been \"completely and totally isolated\" by \"those who try to put a smokescreen, in my opinion false flag\" to prevent a peace process with Israel.\n\nShe highlighted the EU's support for a Palestinian state and expressed hope that the conference in Ramallah will help pave the way for the restart of Israeli-Palestinian peace negotiations that are on hold since 2014.\n\nRead more:\n\n\"I hope that this conference will lead to a real opportunity to restart the peace process,\" she said.\n\nHowever, the European Union seems to be divided over the Israeli move. Mogherini was asked about a draft statement by the EU-Arab Peace Process working group for peace which is set to release next month, in which it states that the EU should recognize Palestine alongside Israel. According to a report by the Foreign Ministry, it wants the EU to say that it recognizes Palestine as well.\n\nMogherini noted she and other EU diplomats supported the draft resolution on \"recognition of two states on the 1967 borders for the State of Palestine and the State of Israel.\"\n\nShe also noted the EU's stance on the situation in Jerusalem. \"The European Union reiterates its full respect for the position of the United States. We do not recognize a move to change the status quo because if we do, the danger for the two-state solution is a dangerous escalation.\"\n\nThe EU had said it did not support any unilateral move that may affect the status quo in the territories or endanger the two state solution.\n\nAsked about reports that European Union ambassadors were set to vote to support Palestine's bid for non-member observer status at the United Nation's annual body, Mogherini did not directly deny media reports, but indicated it was premature to comment, according to press notes.\n\nThe EU ambassador to Israel, Lars Faaborg-Andersen, was also asked about the draft resolution by the Middle East Quartet and what the bloc would say if it were to support Palestinian membership. Faaborg-Andersen confirmed the reports. However, he said the EU did not believe that Israeli settlements or the Jerusalem decision were obstacles to peace.\n\n\"We have to continue working in order to make the conflict reach a conclusion...We would not support any unilateral decisions such as recognition ... that might have a negative impact in our relations to Israel,\" Faaborg-Andersen said.",

      "When the first round of talks between Iran and the big powers was opened in Vienna on Jan. 16 and 17, I knew that Washington officials were expecting an agreement by the end of January—this was what they told me. And I believed them (until I saw the deal). But now there is a real chance for an early agreement, and it should not be dismissed.\n\nThe two sides have to agree on a few important points, namely: on the right to enrich uranium, and the timetable for removing the core components of the Arak reactor that is under the control of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). But let us start by discussing the right to enrich uranium.\n\nIran says the deal does not allow that. Yet there is ample documentation of past U.S. intelligence claims that Iran has been enriching uranium, and that it continues to do so. Moreover, if one does the math correctly, it is likely that Iran is on track to enrich enough uranium to reach the threshold for the first time ever, sometime next year.\n\nThe U.S., the United Kingdom, and France have been pressing for an agreement for five years now to stop Iran from obtaining the ability to enrich uranium for a nuclear weapon. For some reason they are still insisting on the need for a specific date for agreement, saying that an agreement signed today will give Iran the capacity to break out in a few months. But the current agreement is not that kind of agreement.\n\nA key to any acceptable nuclear deal, such as the one being put forth in Vienna, must be a clear timetable for removing all the core components of the Arak reactor—an enrichment facility, a reprocessing facility, a heavy water reactor—as well as all the infrastructure that supports enrichment.\n\nSo while Iran does not, for now, have the ability to enrich uranium to weapons grade level, that does not mean that Iran can start producing weapons-grade material today. On the contrary, if Iran wants to enrich uranium to weapons-grade level, it has to dismantle its centrifuges and build new ones quickly. It also has to replace all the heavy water that it used to enrich uranium. And it has to replace a plutonium core, which it had been developing since 1998.\n\nIn short, the key to a successful agreement is a transparent and timetabled plan to get Iran to dismantle its nuclear program, in order to ensure that Iran will never produce a nuclear weapon. This is the \"green light\" that all good negotiations have. Yet, not so much in these past five years, according to many sources, including the International Atomic Energy Agency. In January 2015, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) declared that Iran has been \"making slow, steady progress along its path to having the technical capacity to produce weapon-grade nuclear fuel.\" This, according to one of these officials, was based on the assessment of four of the six inspectors—there were two left in 2014 and six left in 2015-the same as last year. (The fact that six has been reduced to four in 2016 makes the claim dubious, as there were six inspectors in 2014.)\n\nNow there are actually three inspectors in Tehran; but their jobs—to verify that Iran is actually building fuel elements for weapons, that Iran's nuclear facilities are for peaceful purposes, and that there are no \"secret nuclear\" facilities—are being done on the taxpayer's dime, and in a rather opaque manner.\n\nThis was the case before IAEA inspectors began inspecting Tehran at the outset of the Bush administration, in 2003. And this continued with Obama's first term.\n\nThe United States and Iran disagree on a great deal. The Iranian negotiators want, as I discussed in the preceding article, to stop, dismantle, and build the nuclear centrifuges that are presently enriching uranium. And they are demanding the right to enrich uranium to 20 percent. Washington rejects this plan, however. In November 2015, at a press conference at the White House, Obama said that if Iran was to be permitted to increase enrichment \"to the number that we see as potentially usable for a civilian nuclear program—it might not be the number we see today.\" He said that Iran must agree to certain limitations on Iran's \"enduring right\" to enrich uranium (the current agreement is based on a \"continuous enrichment\" threshold). He did not clarify what these limitations should be—they are not even mentioned in the text of the agreement!\n\nBut Iran is pushing back. Its government spokesman in the United Arab Emirates, Hossein Jaber Ansari, told the news agency, Reuters, that Iran was \"open to any suggestion to clarify existing issues and to resolve the disputes that exist between the Islamic Republic of Iran and international community.\"\n\nSo while the Iranians say they are committed to the Vienna framework for a nuclear agreement, and would like to start removing their core components of the Arak reactor—if it were in Europe, a major destination for Iranian goods and the biggest buyer of Iranian oil",

At school, they don't really want to do homework because they don't feel like they really have to, but when it's time to put in that extra bit of effort it's the least they can do.\n\nThere's lots of humor and a lot of the songs don't quite feel like they're meant to convey a lesson… this is actually a common problem with many kid's shows, which can leave you feeling like they shouldn't be taking themselves seriously. In the first episode, we see Powerpuff Girls trying to learn basic math, and, instead of taking things seriously, they use it as an excuse to actually have fun. And not only are they having fun, but they're helping each other along the way! You see, they didn't really learn the math concept at all, but they also didn't care about it. They used the test as an excuse to get in a little mischief.\n\nAnother example of humor in their show is the song \"EVER SING\".\n\nThis song features a group of friends, who are in competition for the most money at the moment. One of them, Princess Buttercup, has a talent for singing, which can get her a lot of attention. One of the other girls, Blossom, is a terrible singer, and as a result, she gets all kinds of hate from the other girls. But when one of the girls, Blossom Pink, realizes that Buttercup is in fact really good at singing, she decides that she'll try to get her to practice. Of course, Blossom Pink is very confident in herself and will try her best, but will her new friend ever listen? Watch this video, and find out!\n\nPowerpuff Girls wasn't just created to be fun. It was built on the idea that a lot of girls really want to pursue a career in music. But when it comes time for them to actually pursue it, they just don't have the right stuff. So in the second season of the show, they give their girls the freedom to do whatever they want to do.\n\nBut when the group of girls go out and actually practice, they're not having fun… they're actually feeling nervous. Now this is a bit of a common criticism of shows that have a musical element. When these shows are put on you expect to laugh and you're sure to feel warm and fuzzy inside. But they don't make you want to dance and sing and laugh. But in this show, it makes you want to run around and sing and laugh like crazy. These girls have no idea how much fun music can be! And they don't know it because they don't do it. Music is not something they think about. They love it because that's how they can show off their musical talents.\n\nIn other words? Don't be afraid to put yourself out there. Don't feel like you have to hide or put things on the back burner because you think you can always do it better. Do it. Because sometimes you can!",
      "How many of you, after having read the introduction to this article, thought, \"This man must be a Christian and must definitely be a good person! If they had an evil character in this book, the author must be a great Christian. Maybe it's just that he was inspired!\" The fact is that the author of Exodus, a book so widely known in the Bible, did not have a \"great Christian\" character in mind when he wrote it.\n\nYou have probably come away with this question or thought, \"How did God inspire a bad guy like Moses?\" It should be apparent after studying this article that his inspiration did not come from God's will or plan. I have read about this topic so often in the past few years, and I have seen many discussions on it in my classes, that I have decided to write this article to explain that God didn't inspire bad guys like Moses. I will let you decide whether or not Moses was God's chosen man.\n\nBut first, let us talk about why Moses wasn't a great Christian.\n\nIn the book of Moses, one of The Ten Commandments is a law that tells you why you cannot be a thief; it says that if you want to be a thief, you must kill someone. What kind of a law is that?\n\nI like to think of that law as a \"screeching lion,\" which tells you who the people are who will become your enemies:\n\n1) The lion will roar, and you will fall into the lion's jaws.\n\n2) The lion will bite, and you will die.\n\n3) The lion will roar again, and you will fall into the lion's jaws.\n\n4) The lion will roar, and you will be caught.\n\nIn other words, if you want to be a thief, you would have to kill someone in order to become a thief. If God were truly in favor of stealing, he would leave no loophole for anyone. But we know from the Book of Exodus that he didn't want us to steal, did he?\n\nYou have probably heard of a \"no man leaves my land until he has earned my land\" kind of law. In this case, \"earned\" means, \"By being an ass.\" If the king was really \"in favor of stealing,\" this kind of law would not be very important. If we are honest, we have to admit that when a man is king, he is going to have a lot of slaves. He has to keep them all happy to stay in power.\n\nGod wanted to have a king who would lead his people as the example of a righteous leader in the Middle East. He didn't want a king who liked to steal. And he certainly didn't want a king who like to torture people.\n\nThe most common reason given for bad people's behavior is that they don't like to kill people. \"I hate to think about that guy who's killing people!\" \"I don't agree with my brother murdering people!\"\n\nThat's like the woman who says, \"This country doesn't understand how dangerous it is for women to be alone in the city at night.\" Is she really not in favor of this country's laws that make it illegal for women to be alone in the city in the middle of the night?\n\nWhen you ask an atheist why he doesn't like to kill people, he'll reply, \"That guy who kills people kills babies,\" and that guy doesn't like that kind of attitude. When you ask an atheist why he doesn't like to rape women, he'll say, \"No, that guy who rapes women is a rapist,\" but when you ask a Christian why he doesn't like to rape people, he might be able to give you a plausible answer. I'm willing to bet that a Christian can come up with a plausible answer to this question.\n\nIf God wanted us to be good, he would have told us who to be good to. Instead, we are told in the Bible, \"God said unto Moses, The Lord thy God shall raise up for thee a prophet from among thy brethren, like unto me; thee shall hold his hand: and in his name shall all thy deeds be done.\"\n\nThere is something deeply wrong with any law that says that to be God's messenger, you must be good to everybody. \"We're looking for a good messenger, but God wants to pick his own messenger.\"\n\nThe word \"prophet\" in the Hebrew for this task is nefer, which means, \"a son of an Israelite.\" So, to be a prophet at all, an Israelite must grow up as an Israelite under the eye of God, and become a child of God. This is not the only way to be a prophet, but it is the way the prophet of the Old Testament was chosen and trained. And this is how God chose Moses, because God wanted a great prophet. This fact gives us a",
      "Finnish Prime Minister Juha Sipilä has announced his plans to raise taxes.\n\n\"I feel that we may have missed our opportunity to create some additional taxes,\" Sipilä said at a press conference after chairing a ministerial meeting.\n\nThe announcement follows up on a pledge made last week to increase taxes on businesses and higher tax rates for wealthy individuals. The tax increase will go into effect in 2018, following the implementation of the new budget tax code in April 2016.\n\n\"The increase in the personal income tax will be based on the higher of the tax rates of 2015 and 2016, plus 2 percent, and the rate of the corporate tax will be based on 2017 and the increase in the top tax rate as a result of the new budget tax code, plus 2 percent,\" Sipilä says.\n\nThe finance minister is planning to cut the corporate tax from 28 percent to 23 percent.\n\n\"When we think about a tax plan, we think about what is fairer. But a plan without a price is a bad plan and that's what we want to avoid here. We are planning to make the company tax fairer,\" he said.\n\nThe plans to hike taxes and cut the corporate tax tax rate could increase the costs for consumers in the long run, as Sipilä did not state the exact amounts.\n\nIn February, Sipilä signed a deal giving a big boost to the country's already overstretched healthcare system, a move dubbed a \"revolutionary bill\" by critics. The tax increase and the healthcare bill are likely to add more to the national budget woes.\n\nThe government's proposed healthcare reform is also not a tax increase as the reform will be financed by increasing tax credits. It will also include a measure to expand the tax refund for health care. It had been expected to generate more than 200 billion euros ($255 billion).",

      "From Wowpedia\n\nJax, known as the Lord of the Dark Portal in the original World of Warcraft, was an orc warlock who served as the first leader of the Horde's Dark Portal in the aftermath of the Second War.\n\nJax, along with the Dark Portal, played a major role in the Horde's military defeat. His death would be mourned around the Horde by his fellow orc warlocks and by their fellow orcs. Following the collapse of the Burning Legion, Jax was made a lich. He was later transformed into the Lich Jaxor, a lich that commanded the power of the dark side.\n\nBiography\n\nEarly life\n\nJax and his fellow warlocks (known as warlocks)[2] of the Dark Portal in the Second War sought to achieve immortality through rituals and dark arts,[3] but failed. They did, however, discover that dark magic could be stored within orcs and used to empower a warlock to a great extent. As Jax became more powerful and learned the art more deeply, he would soon have access to a great dark power within his body and dark magic coursing through his veins.[4]\n\nSecond War and Rise of the Horde\n\n\"Jax was one of the last known members of the Dark Portal army before the Scourge invaded our world. He is known as the Lord of the Dark Portal.\" — High Commander Sylvanas Windrunner[10]\n\nJax was the first of the Horde's warlocks to discover the dark side's potential in orcish society and to put the Horde to work in exploiting its potential. He began by using the Horde's vast, ancient library to acquire the darkest lore in the orcish race.[2] To keep tabs on these dark texts, he would send the most promising orc aspirants to a private school near his own residence in Ironforge, Darnassus. However, most of his apprentices failed, or were forced to go to other races' institutions. The warlocks' great master used to say that no orc could be taught to manipulate his dark powers.[5]\n\nHowever, Jax would soon have new recruits in the form of two orc warlocks, Jagg and Grommash Hellscream. Hellscream would prove far more adept, not only at manipulating dark magic but at wielding it. As the warlocks became increasingly reliant on each other, some of them developed an unhealthy rivalry in the form of a kind of \"Game of Thrones\".[3] Some warlocks, such as Jog and Grommash, were particularly bitter enemies with one another.[2]\n\nJax himself had remained relatively quiet in the aftermath of the Second War (though he was still active during the Third War). However, he found himself in conflict with Sylvanas Windrunner and High Commander Sylvanas. Jax felt Sylvanas was attempting to usurp leadership and rule without him, and he had decided that she was a usurper. For this reason, he left the Horde and entered the service of the Alliance; he was one of the few orcs to do so.[2][10]\n\nSecond War\n\nJax, the first leader of the Dark Portal\n\nDuring the Second War, Jax was instrumental in the Horde's efforts to liberate the Quel'thalas zone from the Horde of Draenor. In these circumstances, a group of draenei, led by Archimonde, entered the zone in order to destroy the Dark Portal. They found it open and occupied the area, so Jax had the orcs prepare to defend it. While the orcs were not able to prevent the draenei from destroying the Dark Portal, both factions gained much of what they did not lose.[5][9][10]\n\nAway from the Light\n\nJax returned to the Dark Portal after the Third War. It soon became clear that the orcs' efforts to destroy the Dark Portal had had little effect.[5][9] Rather than simply closing the portal, Jax began studying its dark energies and the arcane magic stored within it. The dark magic that Jax learned led him to believe that he could use it to bring the orcs—and all orcs—under the command of the Dark One himself. The demon had also learned that if he could harness the power of what remained of the Horde under Jax's control, he would be able to re-unite the Horde with the rest of the Alliance.[5][9]\n\nJax's plan to control the dark energies of the Dark Portal was never fully perfected. As the Horde fought valiantly against the draenei, the portal eventually began to leak into the Twisting Nether. By the time the Dark Portal had once again begun to spread the corruption of the Burning Legion, Jax had not been able to fully seal it off. Yet as the orcs' numbers grew and the Dark Portal became ever more corrupted, Jax knew that the corruption would ultimately kill every orc who entered. This decision allowed Jax",

      "I think you will be pleased to hear that I recently had a very pleasant interview with David Mitchell. What I found most fascinating, to me at least, is that his \"writing career\" actually goes back far before that. Here he tells his story and tells it well.\n\n\"I was a journalist, a writer… it was my job to go to places that newspapers never go. I was one of those who worked for the News of the World. All right, that's the wrong answer but that's the way it was.\"\n\nI'm not entirely sure that what Mitchell does as a \"writer\" now constitutes journalism. He is a good writer at some levels… but what distinguishes him is that he has actually written and published some literary work. He is currently co-editing a collection of first-person essays by an unnamed writer called The Hollow Men, and he is working on a novel that he intends to complete in 2004.\n\nThat may be the first time a self-published writer has published anything of any note. And it is indeed his best work to date.\n\n\"The Hollow Men\" is about a group of young people struggling against the encroaching apocalypse. The author is not named, but one senses that it is one of Mitchell's own \"brothers\". In fact, \"The Hollow Men\" is part of a book called The Human Division, which is a collection of short novels. In \"The Hollow Men\", one of the protagonists is a former soldier looking for his brother in a zombie-chic version of the United States. The rest of the novel concerns his life after \"retirement\" in a small English village and in the aftermath of a nuclear exchange. The story is set in a smallish, sparsely furnished room above a pub.\n\n\"The Hollow Men\" is written with a sort of comic style. Characters drop references to other pieces of fiction, usually novels. \"The Hollow Men\" is not entirely satirical, though you don't have to be a reader to be amused by the way it reads. The book is filled with references to books and authors that Mitchell has read in his own life, even having to stop his narrative to point out that a character is referring to James Joyce's Ulysses. The novel is also filled with references to works by other authors, too. There are several passages that refer to \"The War of the Worlds\" and \"It's the End of the World as We Know It\", for example, and a number of other similar themes.\n\nThe characters in \"The Hollow Men\", in contrast to the narrator, who seems to be a former soldier now writing about life after the end, aren't quite the people that Mitchell is famous for creating. He writes a bit like a nonfiction writer, but there isn't much in the way of the \"conversation\" that we read about in most contemporary fiction. The writing is sometimes uneven, the language is sometimes coarse and sometimes rather charming. For me, this is where the real novelty really lies. There's so much of the voice and style that Mitchell brings to his writing. He takes a very long piece of writing and makes it lively, funny, touching, and rich in its imagination. Sometimes, this might seem like a problem. There is nothing wrong with a book that has a kind of vaudeville quality or a kind of casual, jaunty style. But I can't help but like the way that Mitchell has woven his prose together at the level of the most subtle characterisation.\n\nMitchell has also made many references throughout the book to Shakespeare and Tolstoy. The book is structured as a series of short stories, but Mitchell does not write without a certain kind of intentionality. He's constantly making an attempt to tell a story. The characters in each story are different in kind and in kind and in kind, but they are also the same in kind and in kind. He does not just jump from one kind of character to another. He is not writing a collection of short stories about different character types. Rather, he has set up a structure that allows him to go from one story to another and from one kind of character to another. A reader will almost certainly go through this book three or four times without even noticing.\n\nHe has not forgotten how to write. The characters are recognisable but seem to change as they progress through the book. They are not so familiar that you can almost put them in the same place at the beginning, but rather a reader has to go through them a couple of times before they realise they are different. The reader doesn't get lost, the characters are always there ready to meet their readers. If you don't get a feel now, when you are done with \"The Hollow Men\", then it is because you still don't know them.\n\nAnd I have to say. I am really fascinated by Mr Mitchell's ability to create these stories. He can tell one story very well, but his prose is always on",
      "\"We need to go out there and win these games\"\n\n- Tony Romo\n\nThe Dallas Cowboys (5-3) have been one of the most consistent teams in the NFL and their win over the New Orleans Saints (3-5) will only solidify that. Dallas is one of only four teams remaining in playoff contention, so they have come back to life and are now back in the mix.\n\nWe have seen the Dallas offense put together one of the best offensive seasons in modern NFL history with a combined 5,064 yards, 41 points, and 5.7 yards per play. Their offense is very efficient, and it's easy to see that because of how many yards they have received and how many points they have gotten.\n\nThe Cowboys defense leads the league with 17 interceptions, while the defense has forced 15 turnovers. Their first four games were an impressive 8-1 and they only missed one game during that time frame. So, it has been a bit of a surprise that they struggled against the San Francisco 49ers, winning only 21-17 and being led in the game by Tony Romo.\n\nWhen you think about it, I think it might just be that Romo has more than enough chances to get the win against a team with a lot of talent than he does with his two games against the Saints this year. Let's talk about some of their strengths and weaknesses:\n\nSTRONGNESS\n\nTony Romo:\n\nTony Romo has been having a great season by himself, and he has been getting better as the season has gone on. He has been completing 67% of his passes and has also shown that he can be effective as a runner and in the playoffs. There are also rumors circulating about his health, as he has had at least one injury before each of those games. I think the main reason he is the best QB in the NFL is because of how he can turn around games and make the offense go.\n\nDefensive end Greg Hardy:\n\nGreg Hardy's play has been an eye-opener because I expected that he was going to be the next big free agent signing. He is a great player, and is great with his hands. He is also a great leader and one of the best teammates that you could hope for. When the media gets to Hardy when they talk about the team, they talk trash to him, but I never do. Why is that? Because this season has just been a good step in his development.\n\nWe need to go out there and win these games - Tony Romo\n\nThe other thing about Hardy is his ability to sack the QB. He has done it on two different occasions in his last four games and has shown that he can do it on the run, as well. The Cowboys have only had two good games from the front on defense this year and the sack rate against them is 12.8%. They should have one more great game from Hardy this week if he continues to be effective as he has been.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nPossible turnovers:\n\nWe have seen the Saints throw the ball a ton against Dallas this year. It is possible that they continue that trend and the Cowboys lose this match-up. They seem confident, saying they want to put pressure on Cousins and force him into making mistakes.\n\nPossible turnovers on Dallas' side:\n\nThis will be the most difficult game of the season for the Cowboys and they have been one of the worst teams in the league when it comes to turnovers. They have six fumbles and lost eight straight games since Week 11.\n\nThere is no reason not to win this game - Tony Romo\n\nHowever, this game is still wide open, and I think the play of the rookie Dak Prescott can make a difference. Dallas could have three turnovers. However, I think they can avoid those if they can be ready when they have the football and not turn the ball over. They have the best defense in the NFL and a very good offense. If the Cowboys can get in the end zone and score a lot of points, they will likely win this game.\n\nPrediction:\n\nI think the Cowboys will steal this one against the Saints defense. Dallas is really talented on offense, and I think the Saints will have their hands full. Cowboys will get the first and two points, and I think they will be able to move the ball in the second half. Dak Prescott will take over in the fourth quarter and will pick up some more points on a few big plays.\n\nThe Saints need to win this game, and hopefully it is coming this Sunday, December 1st.",
      "In the days and hours leading up to the vote, Republicans were convinced that Democratic votes for the amendment were a reflection of their \"soft on abortion\" base.\n\nBut now, it appears, they won't get any help from their supposed allies in the pro-life movement.\n\nThe vote comes on the heels of House Republicans' proposal, which would allow abortions in cases where a woman's life is in danger, if the fetus can feel pain or the father is a criminal. It also includes a ban on all abortions after 20 weeks, which some advocates say trims the window for abortion to the point of fetal viability.\n\nThe Republican strategy is working: pro-abortion-rights groups have pledged to use the threat of a vote against the bill to bring out voters in favor of a bill they believe will win the support of voters and the American public at large.\n\n\"I would like to think that there was an element that made [Democrats] think there would be a benefit. But I don't think it's working,\" said Mark Harrington of Maryland, who worked as a field organizer for NARAL Pro-Choice America for several years during the 1990s, before retiring in 2011. \"So far, it's just like a political witch hunt.\"\n\nThat sentiment is echoed across the country.\n\n\"I'd say it's working to our benefit. We've gotten a lot of folks to the polls and to the phone banks. We have that base,\" said Heather Busby, president of National Right to Life. But she acknowledged that the efforts of her group, which also supports the 20-week abortion ban at issue in the Wisconsin bill, have brought her little good fortune.\n\n\"We've had one phone call that we got from some of our abortion people in Colorado, as you know, and it was a whole lot more of the same kind of thing. What we don't know, we don't know yet, but [we] know we're going to be having more phone calls come in tomorrow with some of our abortion people saying, 'Oh my goodness, I didn't even realize I was part of that bill.' \"\n\nThe latest GOP proposal — which would ban abortions after 20 weeks after conception, as well as ban abortions in cases based on rape and incest — does not include protections for survivors of rape or incest.\n\nThat provision, while widely supported by pro-life activists and their friends in conservative circles, has been blocked in similar cases in Arizona and North Dakota. Last week, the Senate approved the abortion bill with what's called a \"conscience clause,\" which would allow doctors to object based on religious objections to abortion. It has a Senate companion in the House, though it hasn't yet cleared a final vote.\n\nEven though the measure is now supported by most women who are surveyed, the pro-life group still sees more reason to question whether it will even pass.\n\n\"I think it's going to fail. Because I think the numbers just don't work in favor of the bill,\" said Nancy Keenan, president of Concerned Women for America. \"I don't know why that is.\"\n\nBut Harrington disagrees, as evidenced by the hundreds of phone calls they're getting on the subject. As for the threat of a vote, he said, \"There's a pretty well-known group I've talked to all day long, and they always say, 'Yes, we're going down our list.' And there was one individual who called me who said, 'When you say come down your list, I'm down, because I really want to give my vote to the man.'

      "What's the difference between a \"man of the House\" and a \"housewife of the House?\"\n\nHousewives are on many TV shows today — and I just got off the phone with a TV exec of a Housewives franchise — and she said there's something to be said for the idea of Housewives being a women's work, that their stories and their roles could be told by women in a way and at a time when the public was more receptive to their stories and roles.\n\nWhen you talk to Housewives women, are you struck by the way their stories have changed in the past three decades?\n\nI think they have certainly changed. They don't tell the same story now as they did when the show started. There's much more sex in a modern Housewives episode than there was in 1993, and I think it's a good thing to show that you can have a sexy show that is still entertaining and make you laugh and make a lot of points you might not have thought of.\n\nDo they tell the same story in the same way now?\n\nOh, yeah, 100 percent. I think a lot of what keeps them interesting is that they tell the same story differently. They've always been telling some version of the same story, and a lot of it has to do with the personalities of the women and the kind of work they do. I think that the fact that they have such a varied range of roles is really what keeps them interesting, and it's the one element that I think people really get behind. There are women who are all about the money, there are women who are all about the work, and there are women who are all about the life.\n\nThere's been such a boom in reality TV, and it can be pretty confusing for younger women now.\n\nIt's the same for everybody. When I was growing up, there were some shows I didn't really watch: You could say, for example, that The Beverly Hillbillies was really silly and played up that women were really silly, and I didn't watch that show. I think you will always have a little niche where it's not going to get on, because when you're putting on a TV show, people expect certain things of you. You have to have a show go away, and then when you do put it out, it has a life of its own. When the show stops being something the audience feels comfortable with, then it's going to lose some of its value. But if the show has a lot of fans, it has a life beyond just the audience's comfort level. I don't think that that's necessarily true for anything that's not scripted, but it is true for scripted TV — and that has been true lately.\n\nWhy is reality TV increasingly popular with women, and why do you think that's happening?\n\nI think it just depends on your own life and what drives you and where you're at in your life. If I had to put a number on it, you'd probably say the generation that is just getting into Hollywood — that is maybe 23, 24 years old — is going to be the biggest audience. That's a large group that you cannot hope to reach anymore because there are so many of them, and they're smart as hell. They're in their 20s and they've already done a lot with their lives, and they've got so much to offer. As long as they think they can come back to it, that's all I care about. I don't get that many of the women who do that work are just trying to fill a role in TV, and people who do it with comedy, people who do it in drama and so on. It's not just something you do when you get home from work.\n\nHow did you get involved in that genre?\n\nThe only time I was a part of that kind of comedy was on Friends, which is funny enough on its own, but it's pretty much a TV show. On Friends we did a lot of really crazy antics. I've done some of the crazier things that have happened on Mad About You, but none of those was what I would call dramatic. Then came the pilot for The New Adventures of Old Christine, which was a drama — they were going to be doing four different movies of the same story. The one that didn't make the cut was \"The Wife and the Son,\" which is the one that we didn't do, but it came out in the mail. There were two or three other shows that were in the mail, and I got a call from one of the producers, and he said, \"You know who should do the pilot for New Adventures of Old Christine? It could be one of your wives.\" I said, \"Whoa. I've never heard of it.\" He said, \"It's a really good show. You don't have to do it. If we don't get picked up, that's okay. But we",
      "\"The idea of building a stadium here was actually a response by the government to a need in the country,\" says T.J. Schubert, the stadium's main developer and the city's director of development. \"This isn't the place we imagined. We imagined a soccer stadium, but this one has that look of a convention center or a convention center where there are lots of restaurants along the walls.\"\n\n\n\"You have a lot of young people who are attending and it's really important for them to see and experience culture in other countries,\" he adds. \"The soccer field here is so nice; it's a great attraction. We want to make sure they keep coming back to this as we build the downtown.\"\n\n\nThe stadium's roof is a giant retractable screen that allows for concerts and special events.\n\n\nTo celebrate the stadium's first night of existence this past Monday, city officials organized a parade and fireworks display.\n\nThe stadium's stadium seat seats around 1,500, and was funded in part by a $4.8 million state grant.\n\n\n\"This is a new home for the St. Louis Union, and one of these nights we'll have a special day,\" said Jeff Agoos, the club's president. \"We are looking forward to being back here again.\"\n\n\nThough there has been a lot of speculation surrounding the stadium, the club says it's not looking for another soccer stadium, but rather an all-MLS sports venue.\n\n\n\"It has been said in the past, and is even being said now, that building a soccer stadium at the intersection of Broadway and Pine is 'the holy grail' of Major League Soccer stadiums,\" added Agoos. \"The club has had great success in St. Louis, but now needs another reason to prove that it can compete at this level. With the Union, we'll prove it in our debut, and in our next stadium plan.\"\n\n\nIn addition to live soccer, the stadium will host regular soccer and other events, including movies, concerts, festivals, and more.\n\n\nThough no plans for that third team have been determined, St. Louis has been in the running over several potential locations -- including a downtown site on the Southside -- for months now. A location at the Fairgrounds is one of them, and St. Louis is currently the top candidate in the process, according to Dave Peacock of the Sports Entertainment Commission.\n\n\n\"I think they're doing everything they can within the existing law,\" says St. Louis City Councilman Sam Adams. \"Their plan for the Fairgrounds could be the location. That's where we all need to sit down and have meaningful conversations about where we should go.\"\n\n\nThe stadium is expected to open in mid-October. The city has already hired the architects of other soccer stadiums around MLS, and will continue to work with its consultant and attorney as it shapes its plans into a finished product.\n\n\n\"A major challenge is working with the site and the city to accommodate the unique needs of the stadium,\" says Schubert. \"You don't just tear apart something that's on a site that is already in use; you need to get it in that right location as quickly as possible. We've been extremely fortunate that things have gone off without a hitch.\"\n\n\nIn terms of the surrounding area, the stadium is expected to have 3.25 acres of land, which will allow for an entertainment district that could be the city's next downtown.",
      "The New Jersey Devils made some changes to their defensive pairing for Thursday's game against the Minnesota Wild.\n\n\nIt is not a surprise that the new guy in the hole is none other than Adam Larsson. He joined Marek Zidlicky of the Carolina Hurricanes at the end of the 2012-13 season and has started 30 games for New Jersey since then, with only one of those being a shut-out. His best defensive partner would seem to be Colin White, who is still on long-term injured reserve, but the Devils have a great deal of trust in Larsson.\n\n\nLast season, Larsson posted good positive numbers for the Devils and, combined with Zidlicky and White, had a team that was second on the team in expected goals against. It was clear that Larsson had become the team's top defensive prospect, as well as one of the better young defensemen in the NHL for a decade.\n\nLarsson had 17 points in 45 games last season; he won the Norris Trophy after finishing seventh in it. With Adam Larsson the Devils were 14th in expected goals against last season. I can see that being a problem for the Devils because they played a lot against top teams, but they will likely find a way to keep him relatively sheltered on Thursday.\n\nAlso missing is Mike Cammalleri (lower body injury) and Cory Schneider (neck injury) is back at practice. Also back is Dainius Zubrus (lower body) and Patrik Elias (hand).\n\nThe Devils are currently in a four-way tie for the final wild-card spot in the Eastern Conference.",
      "I was in a car accident where I was pulled out with two holes in my chest and a very bad leg break. I have no memory of driving my car, but I know that I tried to drive at least to the hospital.\n\nI was injured very badly, and my whole back and legs were bruised. I saw a surgeon, but he didn't understand that my leg was broken so badly, and he didn't know it was a huge hole in my chest, because he didn't have an x-ray machine to take them. He did an operation and cleaned the wound, but that is it for me.\n\nI feel like a human being. Every time I open my mouth it feels like somebody is trying to push in some food, or something. It hurts when I do anything, and it makes my chest hurt. Sometimes I have problems breathing.\n\nI am not allowed to go out and I can't do anything. For the first few days I thought that I would never be able to walk again, but after it healed, I could walk and do what I wanted to do.\n\nI don't know what else can happen, but I hope that I will get better soon.\n\n—\n\nA girl in North Florida needs help\n\nI'm 14 and I was walking up and down my street when I took my life. I went to school on Monday and all Wednesday I was at home crying. Friday I was in hospital and spent the weekend there.\n\nI was on medication for bipolar disorder, anxiety, depression and my mood swings.\n\nI am currently on the waiting list for a place to live because the family didn't want me. So I am staying at my brother's house in the middle of nowhere, so they can't tell anyone. He has to move out and that means I have to move in! It's really hard to be away from my family and friends.\n\nI am not allowed to move anywhere. I am not working, I just want to be left back where I am. My family wants to move to another part of Florida, but I can't.\n\nI just want to get home and be surrounded by my friends and get some quality time with my family again. I can't go anywhere, I am sick.\n\nI love and miss her so much and I know she loves me so much too.\n\n—\n\nAn 8-year old girl is having a hard time after being kicked during a football game\n\nI am 8 years old, I've been in a lot of bad things. There is a group of kids my age that do drugs and I am trying to protect my sister and I from them. One day my mom found a bunch of people in our house and my mother kicked some out of the house.\n\nOne of them was an 8 or 9-year old boy. He is really thin and I could tell he had some mental health issues. My mom took away all his stuff and kicked him out of the house. He started kicking my mom in the stomach, so my mom kicked him back in the house.\n\nMy mom then got mad at my cousin for hitting the boy. But my mom then kicked the boy in the arm and head again. Then my mom hit my cousin's head and the boy cried all the way home for hours.\n\nMy cousin wanted to hit my mom the first time he saw her, so he left the house and went home. He came back the next day and apologized. I am just so grateful to him.\n\nHe still misses his mom and he needs some time to be with her and get over this. Right now, he is on medication and will be for the rest of his life.\n\nSo I just want you to know that he has a mother who likes him enough to do something so terrible for her, and he also has a grandmother who loves him that is willing to go this far for him when his mother won't let him in the house. My sister needs his help, but so many people look down on her because of this.

It was a nurse at Children's Memorial Hospital. They took one look at my bandages, told me all my problems would be over soon and sent me home, saying they would send me more if they had my consent.\n\nI am so thankful that she was there when I opened my eyes. It takes a lot of courage to ask for help, but she has been here for me with everything since I woke up. I wouldn't be here today without her support.\n\nAt first I did need to sleep.

      "A new set of leaked documents was released today by Anonymous, the international hacktivist group. This particular leak was of documents dated from 2003, but many of the documents have also been released in 2010, and they provide a lot of useful information. Most of the documents are spread over seven different sites, and they cover a wide range of information in an article at Forbes, titled \"These Hacker Hackers Can't Tell the Difference Between American and Israeli Intel!\" The original article discusses the nature of the leaking, which included the following:\n\n\"The documents were posted from multiple domains to Pastebin.com on September 18 and have been copied from an unclassified site used for sensitive CIA documents. One leak showed a draft of a secret NSA tool code-named Bullrun, a joint task force intelligence unit, which contained a list of targets, targets' vulnerabilities and a link to a website where the full list of targets could be viewed.\"\n\nI believe that most of the information in the leaked documents can be found very easily in a good amount of information released on the internet, particularly through WikiLeaks for a whole host of recent leaks, such as the Guantanamo Bay files, the US invasion of Iraq, etc.\n\nThis particular leak includes documents that reveal, among other things:\n\nThe names of several current and future intelligence officials\n\nInformation about the relationship between the spy agencies of various countries\n\nThe names of a variety of companies that provide financial, logistical and technical support for the intelligence agencies\n\nThe names of companies providing support to Israel's intelligence agency, The Mossad.\n\nSome of the documents also have data from the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) which provides information on the cyber capabilities of various countries.\n\nThe leaked documents were in a number of different formats, including PDFs, JPEG pictures, and Word docs.

      "When this week's season opener between the Cowboys and Redskins kicked off on Monday, most of us in the nation's capital expected the Cowboys to come out with a convincing win that would put them two games up on the Packers. Unfortunately, just when it appeared the Cowboys might prove the naysayers wrong, they were met with the sight of a Green Bay team that has been without their star tight end, Jordy Nelson. After a pair of bad misses on drives, the Cowboys were unable to convert on fourth-and-1 to keep the ball as the Packers drove back and took a 24-13 lead. It was a familiar problem for Dallas, who had just finished up the loss of Dez Bryant due to a pectoral injury suffered in Week 2. As Nelson stood at the top of the end zone that night, the Cowboys looked to be looking up. Unfortunately, they left him in an apparent position to suffer another major injury as he took a hit to the head and was knocked out for most of the fourth quarter.\n\nWith just over a week of practice, Nelson went through what Dallas fans had feared, the potential for a serious injury. But despite the team having no practice the night before, the Packers weren't done with Nelson and even went after him with some physical play. Nelson was able to return to the game in just under a half, but he was unable to give his full effort. Instead, he was able to make some plays during the game, such as a first quarter tackle that put Jared Allen on the ground. While his injury appears to be serious, no timeline has been announced for his return. While the injury could ultimately delay the team's plans for how they handle Nelson, it could also allow the team to use him in a more productive way. As we have seen from his past injuries, it is never a good idea to rush Nelson back or place him into an impossible position. After the game, head coach Jason Garrett was very optimistic about Nelson's chances of making it back in time for the second half, saying \"I hope he gets in there next week, but I hope he's ready to go for the rest of the season.\"\n\nWhen the game ended and the whistle blew again, Aaron Rodgers was hit with three more incompletions. When Green Bay found itself down by only a touchdown, the game was far from over and the Packers needed to get into the end zone to keep things in reach. A long kickoff return by Clay Matthews, who is normally one of the better special teams players in the league, gave the Packers room to run. On the next play, a simple touchdown for Randall Cobb put Green Bay in front and gave the Packers a commanding lead. But with two more plays to go and both the Packers' and Cowboys' first-down options open, the Cowboys looked to get a crucial first down. The Packers were unable to convert on fourth-and-short, and Green Bay was able to close out the game on the ground. While they won easily, just what it would mean if Aaron Rodgers were unable to play in the playoffs has yet to be decided.\n\nWith a quick turnaround this week, what will the Cowboys do now that Aaron Rodgers won't be ready to return until the week before the second round of the playoffs? First, they will have to decide where their priorities are. There will surely be some thoughts of moving back to their bye week. In order for them to do this, they need to keep in mind the needs of the rest of their team over the rest of the season in order to keep the team healthy and ready to take on the NFC. There are two teams with significant injuries in the Atlanta Braves and Tampa Bay Rays. And while the Astros and Mariners seem to be the most healthy during this period, it would seem that a team would need a two-game weekend to stay ready for the playoffs. If the Cowboys are able to beat the Giants on Sunday night, they will have two more days to prepare for their Week 16 matchup against the Giants. That is not enough time to rest the key players, let alone rest the starter. Moving into Week 17, there will be plenty of time to be at full strength if the Cowboys are able to beat out the Giants, but they would likely need to at least win out against the Giants in order to secure a playoff berth.",

      "Calls for immediate talks are growing among the British government's own experts on climate change\n\nOne senior environmental official has called for a meeting of \"key international players\" by the end of January, in what would be a last-ditch effort to avert more severe hurricanes heading towards Britain.\n\nThe official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that the British government's own experts in climate change knew that climate change was the most likely cause of the storm currently threatening southeastern Britain that has killed at least 15 people, and is now the strongest hurricane to ever hit the British mainland, with winds of 195mph.\n\n\"They know we're heading for a hurricane,\" the official said – an unusually direct admission of the consensus in the scientific community. The official urged all governments – including the UK's Theresa May's – to consider taking action to deal with a climate threat that is well underway.\n\n\n\"We have to understand that it's coming,\" the official added – pointing, as did other senior government officials, to the fact that no major hurricane has struck Britain since 2005.\n\n\nThe hurricane – currently rated Category 2 on the Saffir-Simpson scale of hurricane intensity, based on sustained winds of at least 125 mph – has been blamed for at least 30 deaths, so far.\n\n\nSome commentators – including the Daily Mail in the UK – have claimed that the hurricane was caused by human meddling after a tweet from former US president Barack Obama was used to suggest that there was \"some connection between climate change and extreme hurricanes\".\n\nThe storm has had its own political consequences with UK MPs questioning whether the government ought to play down the effect of rising sea levels and rising sea temperatures. On Thursday MPs on the science committee, which scrutinises government science and has been asked to investigate climate change, urged the prime minister to explain why her government wasn't working on ways to reduce the chances of another disaster.\n\n\"Climate change and hurricanes are one and the same,\" said MP Graham Stringer. \"We need to understand fully and urgently it is one and the same issue.\"\n\nAsked by the Guardian why the UK government was not taking action, the government climate change chief, Greg Barker, told the Guardian: \"A hurricane like [Hurricane] Harvey is not caused by climate change, it's not caused by pollution. You can point to other things that have happened as a result of it.\n\n\"I've heard from the government that we've been involved in hundreds of hurricanes from the Caribbean to Asia, so we know what hurricanes are like and what their consequences are if we are not prepared.\n\n\n\"We know what the impacts are from extreme heat. We know about the impacts of global warming in our seas and we know that we have a responsibility for reducing emissions to stabilise the climate.\"\n\nHe added: \"Hurricane Harvey made up a bit part of this month's weather. But this type of extreme weather is a long-term trend and one that we need to address.\n\n\n\"The government's approach has been to focus on the short term. The government's priority right now is to prepare for and respond to extreme weather. So, it's a bit like a sports team. Sometimes it's one game, sometimes it's next week's game, sometimes it's another three years' game – but you always want to have good preparation for all of these games.\"\n\nBut the storm has also been used by government ministers and campaigners to question why other countries hadn't taken action on climate change in such a dramatic way.\n\nThe prime minister has admitted that she is concerned about the \"catastrophic\" storms which have been linked to climate change.\n\nMay has described the hurricane as an \"incredibly difficult situation\" with \"horrendous loss of life\", and told the House of Commons that the government was prepared for the storm.\n\n\nEnvironment secretary Michael Gove said during storm-related meetings with the National Security Council last week that climate change meant \"a storm like Hurricane Harvey is a reality that we must expect and should prepare for\".\n\nHe added that the government's response to climate change has been \"consistent and ambitious\" and added: \"The actions that we take, we will continue to make sure that we are the best prepared going forward for this. It is a matter of common sense.\"\n\nThe latest reports from the UK Met Office showed for the week ending 12 September that the UK had endured two major storms since the start of the month.\n\nThe first storm, known as \"Storm Frank\", hit the British Isles on Tuesday 1 September, leaving three dead in Scotland, two more in Northern Ireland, and an estimated £200m in damage to Scotland.\n\nThe second storm, also known as \"Storm Severe\", hit England and Wales on Monday 8 September, leaving two dead, more than 1,500 homes damaged, and at least £50m in damage.\n\nThe Met Office now says that only a \"minor increase\" in",
      "If you follow me on Instagram, you'll see I recently made the move from Portland to Los Angeles. I've been following my mom for a minute and she mentioned this local sandwich shop just down the street. And I was so excited to find one, as I've always wanted to try a Chicago style meatball. It's not the most appealing sandwich, in terms of flavors and textures, but I'm always happy to try new places if they're good. Anyway, when I first got to L.A., I spent a night in a friend's neighborhood. The next morning I was up early (5:25am). This is when the meatball sandwich was at its best! They had a few of the other sandwiches available. Unfortunately they didn't have a beef-ball-pesto version... I ordered a beef-ball-pesto. But the meatball itself was just alright. The crust wasn't crispy enough and the meat wasn't moist. If you don't have a beef-ball-pesto, I think it's still a pretty decent sandwich. I thought the meatball patty wasn't that great. I think the crust was too soft, and the other ingredients were the problem. I could also only find this sandwich in my friend's neighborhood so this is a little out of my usual sandwich area. I'll try a Chicago-style meatball at another local place I know before I move back up to Portland.\n\nThis place is good for a quick bite to eat. My brother's fiance had the sandwich and asked for the pesto - which was DELICIOUS!!!! The meatball is a little too soft and flaist too mushy (not like a real meatball sandwich) for me to recommend that.\n\nI have been to all of these places around the city. This place is BY FAR the best. Very simple with the only different ingredient being their meatball. The whole sandwich is made with a crispy crust and the meat is delicious. The pesto was also delicious and a little spicy but not enough to give me any issues. The cheese was my favorite of the many I had.\n\nMy favorite place in Los Angeles. The meatballs are great, the bologna & bordelaise dip is scrumptiously yummy, and everything is made from scratch! I would go there anytime!\n\nThis place was OK. You could tell it was popular based on the large line-up and long wait times. I ordered the meatball platter with garlic-garlic mayo, pesto, and bologna. The meatballs were kind of dry and soggy - but they were very flavorful. The pesto was also good but nothing special. The bologna was a bit on the bland side. However, the bacon was a really delicious addition to the sandwich. The garlic mayo was a milder version of a \"secret\" seasoning. I wish I had tried it...maybe next time.\n\nVery good meatball sandwich I had the beef-balls in Pesto. Everything is made fresh that's why they are so delicious. And they have the best potato salad too. Highly recomends.\n\nI had high hopes for this place. I wasn't disappointed. Meatballs were good but it was still too soft. So I went somewhere that was more authentic. I wanted something that was crispy and I got it. I am glad I did, because it was the best. Service was fantastic. Staff was friendly and so was the owner. I would definitely come again.\n\nI had heard of Chicago meatball sandwiches but I always was bummed out when they came out. I can't imagine what it's like to eat a Chicago \"meatball\". My friend was able to convince me to get this place and my friends didn't turn me away for saying that. They get it and they get it well! I will probably go back when in the area again.\n\nMy husband and I went to visit LA on vacation a couple of months ago. I loved going to these shops and trying their products. I have to say that their meatballs are delicious! So soft and delicious. My husband says they are better than our beloved Sausage & Meatballs!\n\nI had never tried Chicago style meatballs before, but came here for a late lunch, and I couldn't have been more happy with the meatballs I had. As soon as I walked in I saw the line out the door at the deli section. I was very skeptical, but I was sold. They had the best meatball I've ever eaten, especially for a sandwich. It was flavorful, seasoned nicely, and served in a nice brown bread bun with a good amount of beef meat. The whole sandwich was great, and I loved getting the pesto! I know that I will come again!\n\nThey have their own shop in a commercial center. Food is not so good. I am not a huge",
      "As part of his \"A Day in the Life\" series, NPR's Robert Siegel recently sat down with the former director of the National Security Agency, retired Gen. Keith Alexander.\n\nDuring the interview, Alexander said that President Obama's efforts to overhaul the FISA court were unconstitutional and said that the President is only \"partially\" upholding the U.S. Constitution.\n\n\"He needs to use the Patriot Act and the FISA court to get around the Constitution,\" Alexander explained. He said he thinks all three branches of governance in Washington \"have been hijacked\" by a president who has no authority to act, and that the FISA court is the most obvious example. (RELATED: Obama's NSA Spies Have All The Legal Authority The President Wants)\n\nAlexander also had something to say about NSA employees:\n\n\"They should be ashamed of themselves. We have got a bunch of people who are part of the intelligence community and they're the ones that really need to be fired and fired quickly.\"\n\nWhile Alexander said he has no personal vendetta against employees of the NSA, he did say that some \"really good, good people\" had been put in office during what he called a long-neglected, \"desert\" period of intelligence reform. He also noted that some intelligence agencies have been \"very, very aggressive\" in implementing and enforcing NSA reforms.\n\nListen to the latest clip below via NPR:\n\n(h/t NBC)\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",
      "What's a Vulture to Do?\n\n\nWe can spend some time here in discussing the nature of \"the species,\" our collective mental construct of what it means to be a human being. A question that has popped up all over human culture over the centuries has always been this:\n\n\n\"What is a Vulture?\"\n\n\n\"I see a Vulture…?\" I hear you say. This question is pretty simple to answer - for our purposes here, it's not so much the answer as the question and the answer are equally simple - a Vulture is a Vulture is a Vulture.\n\n\nI see a Vulture?\n\n\nWhat, then, is a Vulture (or what are they)? The concept of a \"Vulture\" has been adopted from the Old English, Wæstig, meaning \"strange.\" In Old English this word had a broader definition including, for example, \"animal that flies through the air like a bat.\" In modern English, on the other hand, the word \"Vulture\" has been used to describe large creatures or unusual species that are solitary, nocturnal, and often foraging for food.\n\n\nBut when did we start referring to our social and economic systems as \"Vulture like?\" It's a little odd to look back at some of the early Anglo-Saxon writings, such as:\n\n\nThe Laws of the English, 1076; \"Vereor eorl ðam fole heortan, þonne ðæra beorhtne wæs þæt to ealle ða wædnes dæg to godspellicere mægerne.\"\n\n\nHere we see that the laws here are not specifically about birds of prey, but describe a kind of creature that preyed upon livestock. (Though this same law also says, \"the wrens [are] the vulture's food.\") Later Anglo-Saxon law books from about 1150 refer to \"skeletons wæs wæt heora beorhtne hæle, ðaða heo wæs þærrihte mid gife hæle and mid geseah, and seo cyrcan heo ongean to heoro.\"\n\n\nAnd at least three other times in Anglo-Saxon history we find that this vulture was to be seen hunting and eating \"the birds that used to be called eavs, as the dove, and the cranes.\" In a law from the year 1198 we find that the vulture was to be \"taken [and] pursued for the wreves and the other eavs, and the other birds used to be called eavs.\"\n\n\nThen, in the twelfth century, a law code tells us that the following birds belonged to this vulture: \"eagle, shearwater, sparrowhawk, kite, gander, dove, crayfowl, cormorant, sparrow, swallow, and wild parrot.\" The same law also tells us that to eat one of these birds was \"unacceptable\" - which of course is quite a strong statement - \"for those who were not members of the community.\"\n\n\nThe earliest descriptions we have of what a \"Vulture like\" animal might look like in English literature are very different from those of our modern understanding. From about the 1160s we see a much different animal being used in English folklore. In Latin texts they referred to the \"daggers of the vulture, that preyed on deer and game birds.\" In the twelfth century the description of the vulture as an \"earthenware\" vulture is used. The earliest depiction of a bird of prey we are given in English literature, that we know of, dates all the way back to the early 1300s. And, like the first mention of what we now call a bird of prey in England, this bird seems to have come at the urging of a king.\n\n\nThe \"King of the birds\" was named Gormred, and we see him in this story from the early 1300s. In the story, Gormred is king of the vultures, he sends a messenger to the goddess Aesir who agrees to let him live in her temple until he dies. Gormred takes with him two of the goddesses who live in her temple, but he makes the bird in question his personal messenger. Upon his death, the bird returns to Gormred, whom he places on his head and places in his palace at the top of St. Martin's church in Gloucester.\n\n\nHere we have the bird Gormred sends to the goddess, who in turn decides to send him the other vulture that the goddess loves. And so the next time we hear of a vulture, we are told that this is another of the two vultures Gormred has",
      "Golf Club & Fitness: Why Golfers Should Give Back\n\nAre golfers really more generous? The media and the philanthropic community keep pushing the message that their generosity is the only possible explanation for their success. It's time to ask: Are they really?\n\n\"It was only when I realized that you don't have to spend all your time giving away money to help others that I truly found an answer to my own dilemma. It's not about money, it's about being in the moment.\" Johnnie Moore\n\nWhen we think of a golf professional, our minds immediately conjure images of golf course employees, of course, but also of golf club leaders. We assume that if a golfer is successful in their chosen sport they must be super rich. We may never ask, \"How did they do it?\" The answer might seem obvious to golfers, but it turns out that the reason golf is so popular and successful is not only because of the golfers: it's also because of the golfers' community.\n\nGolf clubs are the organizations that have the power to shape and elevate the course of a golfer's career. It doesn't matter how good a golfer is if the person who owns the course or clubs is not willing or able to provide them with the support they need, either on and off the golf course. If one golfer doesn't have the time to play every week because he has a full day job and another golfer only gets out a few times a year, how will they get up to speed on the sport by the time they get older? How will the game develop into a competitive environment where talented juniors will be able to make their name for themselves?\n\nGolf community leaders are responsible for providing a healthy environment for all of the players by creating environments where golfers can play with ease. Whether it's a private driving range, a private hotel or even a golf course, community leaders play a huge role in creating an enjoyable environment for golfers.\n\n\"As much as I am proud to play golf, playing on the course is really the best thing. It's where I get to go away and play with friends and have some fun. This doesn't happen at home. It really helps keep the game exciting at home and in the field.\" Johnnie Moore\n\nIn the past 20 years it is a well-established fact that golf has become the nation's best spectator sport. More than 4.9 billion fans watched the Masters, two PGA Tour events and the U.S. Open all in one year. Golf is also on the rise in popularity among professional athletes. According to an International Golf Federation survey, golf's popularity among professional athletes has increased tenfold during the past 20 years.\n\nIn many golf courses the players can rent their own cabanas for their own use and even go on long-range outings like golf trips or even overnight stays on tour. Many clubs are now giving away their tee times for free which means that golfers have more options for when they are looking to take a break with golf or can't play at their local course.\n\nWhen golf fans do their part it doesn't take long for everyone else to realize that they are being successful. This can create a virtuous circle of increased awareness on the golf course as players gain more confidence and learn to better themselves, and it can also create a sense of brotherhood among golfers.\n\n\"I think golf is great because golf players are more compassionate and the game has a positive influence on people because they play better. I think the game is so good because of the community.\" Johnnie Moore\n\nWhile golfers are making an impact at all levels of society from the top to the bottom, there is not a single golf club, golf course or organization that does not benefit from the generosity shown to them by their golfers. The generosity that golfers show to the people who run their courses and clubs is what can keep many of the courses in operation, allowing many more golfers to enjoy the sport. Golf clubs and golf courses should be grateful for the generous golfers who keep the sport going. Golf is for everyone.",

      "A few days ago we told you about a new, highly anticipated Nintendo release. It wasn't a game for the Wii U or 3DS, it was a portable system that would be exclusive to Japan. But is this Nintendo portable really all that revolutionary?\n\n\"It's not like I'm saying it isn't innovative, but the idea behind the system is a lot more in line with what we've seen before.\"\n\nSo says Nintendo president Satoru Iwata when this game comes to light.

      "Sodium, which is found in salt, can raise your blood pressure because it causes your body to hold onto extra fluid. When there is extra fluid in your bloodstream, your heart has to work harder to pump blood throughout your body, which can lead to an increase in blood pressure. Here's how it works: When you eat foods that are high in sodium, your body absorbs the sodium into your bloodstream. In order to keep the right balance of fluids in your body, your kidneys remove excess sodium and water. However, if you eat too much salt, your kidneys can't remove all of the excess sodium and water, which can cause the level of fluid in your bloodstream to increase. This extra fluid puts more pressure on the walls of your blood vessels, which raises your blood pressure. So, to help keep your blood pressure at a healthy level, it's important to be mindful of your sodium intake and try to choose foods that are low in salt.",
      "It is not currently possible to fertilize a woman's egg with the set of chromosomes from another ovum (egg cell). This is because the process of fertilization requires the combination of a woman's egg and a man's sperm, which contain half of the chromosomes needed to create a baby.\n\nEvery person has 46 chromosomes in each of their cells, which are arranged in 23 pairs. One chromosome in each pair is inherited from the person's mother, and the other is inherited from the person's father. When a woman's egg is fertilized by a man's sperm, the resulting embryo receives 23 chromosomes from the egg and 23 chromosomes from the sperm, giving it a complete set of 46 chromosomes.\n\nWhile it is theoretically possible to combine the chromosomes from two eggs to create an embryo, this is not something that can be done in practice because the process of fertilization requires the egg to be fertilized by a sperm. Additionally, even if it were possible to combine the chromosomes from two eggs, it is not clear whether the resulting embryo would be viable or healthy. Therefore, it is not a technique that is currently being pursued in reproductive medicine.",
      "Hot things tend to emit light because they have a lot of energy. When an object has a lot of energy, it starts to vibrate and move around a lot. This movement can cause the object to give off light, like a light bulb.\n\nNot all materials emit light when they are heated up. Some materials, like metals, tend to get hot but not give off light. Other materials, like gases, can give off light when they are heated up.\n\nThink of it like this: when you rub your hands together really fast, they start to feel warm. This is because you are creating heat by rubbing your hands together and creating movement. Similarly, when an object is hot, it is moving around a lot, and this movement can cause it to give off light.",
      "The sweet spot for a car's fuel efficiency is the speed at which the car uses the least amount of fuel to travel a certain distance. This is because the amount of fuel a car uses depends on several factors, including the speed at which it is driven, the weight of the car, the drag on the car (caused by wind resistance and other factors), and the efficiency of the engine.\n\n\n\nAt lower speeds, a car's engine is not working as hard, so it uses less fuel. However, as the car's speed increases, so does the drag on the car, which means the engine has to work harder to overcome the resistance and maintain the higher speed. This leads to an increase in fuel consumption.\n\n\n\nAt very high speeds, the drag on the car becomes even greater, which means the engine has to work even harder and use even more fuel.\n\n\n\nSo, there is a sweet spot for fuel efficiency where the engine is working hard enough to maintain a reasonable speed, but not so hard that it is using a lot of fuel. For most cars, this sweet spot is around 55 mph. At this speed, the car is able to maintain a good balance between fuel efficiency and speed.",

      "Semi trucks are built to last a long time because they are used for heavy hauling and need to be able to withstand a lot of wear and tear. They are also designed with very strong and durable parts that can withstand the demands of the job. On the other hand, smaller cars are not built to handle as much wear and tear as semi trucks. They are designed for people who use them for everyday transportation and do not need them to be as tough as a semi truck. Because of this, they are not built with as strong or durable parts as semi trucks, which can cause them to break down more easily. Additionally, smaller cars typically have smaller engines, which means they do not have to work as hard as the engines in semi trucks. This can also contribute to smaller cars lasting for a shorter period of time than semi trucks. Overall, the main reason that semi trucks last for hundreds of thousands of miles while smaller cars may start breaking down after just 100,000 miles is that semi trucks are built to handle more wear and tear and are made with stronger and more durable parts.",

      "Barclays Bank Description Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nBarclays bank is a UK-based Multinational Corporation headquartered in London and operates in the financial niche. The universal bank was established in 1860 in London as a goldsmith’s lending business offering people loans and saving options. The bank’s resilience in the corporate domain made it navigate all the challenges, and it still operates to date. Barclays bank remains relevant in the financial industry because it analyses societal trends and changes its operations to suit human needs. At the height of feminism in the 1950s, it became the first bank to appoint a female manager in 1958, Hilda Harding, who served the bank until her superannuation in 1970. The bank has more than 4750 branches located in different parts of the world in 55 countries. However, 1600 of the branches are located in the UK. Barclays bank has thrived in finance because it leverages technology, social listening, and adopting an effective leadership structure.\n\nDescription of the Organization\n\nThe bank operates in two distinct divisions for efficiency, Barclays UK and Barclays International, all of which are supported by the Barclays executive Services. The bank’s standard services include wealth management, investment, retail, and commercial banking. The bank boasts of having employed over 83,500 members of staff to ensure the smooth delivery of services to the organisation (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021).\n\nAlthough the business started as a partnership between James Barclays and other goldsmiths, the state of ownership has changed over the year to remain in tandem with the practices and regulations affecting the people. In 1981, it changed its entity and re-registered as a public limited company (Vakhrusheva et al., 2021). The state of ownership allows members of the public to purchase shares. Some of the most significant shareholders in the company include Raymond James, Natixis advisors, and Cambiar Investors LLC. In 2021, the bank generated a total profit of 5.75 billion sterling pounds (Barnes and Newton, 2022). The bank uses strategic management options and cultural competence to thrive in different regions with different cultures.\n\nDescription of the Organization’s Structure\n\nBarclays bank is a British universal bank owned by shareholders. Since it is a limited liability company, the shareholder’s property cannot be sold when the bank fails to pay its debts (Vakhrusheva et al., 2021). The principal shareholders of Barclays Bank include Qatar investment authority, Dodge and cox, BlackRock fund advisors, and the Vanguard Group Inc. The organisational hierarchy is headed by the Barclays execution services (BX), which manages the two main groups, Barclays international and Barclays UK. The CEO further appoints directors to every functional area of the bank to make it work efficiently (Barnes and Newton, 2022). The bank’s primary business model is sales and trading, where the sales agents solicit ideas and opportunities from prospects. At the same time, traders advise clients and execute orders to ensure the client’s goals are attained (Schachter, 2018). It is imperative to note that the organisation’s leadership structure allows for a closed feedback loop.\n\nFigure 1: Barclays Business Structure (Ozili, 2022).\n\nThe chief operations officer (COO) and execution services are virtual offices that coordinate and evaluate all operations. Mark Ashton is the current position holder and coordinates Barclays UK and Barclays International (Schachter, 2018). The COO receives reports from the management committee, which comprises the CEO, Coimbatore Sundararajan, the chairman of the board and the different directors for crucial operations. Specialisation and division of labour are encouraged as each exceptional service, such as investment banking, wealth management, and compliance, requires a director who concentrates on the assignment.\n\nAll the directors report to the executive committee to grant better services in the long run. Barclay’s organisational structure promotes specialisation and division of labour (Bari and Syazwani, 2018). Closed loop reporting and a feedback mechanism designed through the structure make the universal bank thrive despite the turbulence in the banking sector. Contemporary companies must learn from Barclay’s organisational structure for effective communication, feedback, and decision-making.\n\nBarclay’s Key Management Theory\n\nThe leadership style and organisational structure use Fredrick Taylor’s scientific theory. According to the scientific management theory, leaders must break down tasks and allocate them to specialised people other than relying on the employee’s decisions. The approach explains that everyone can be trained to deliver on their speciality. Barclays uses the top COO to supervise and receive information from directors specialising in their field (Schachter, 2018). Barclays benefits from the scientific leadership theory because it increases collaboration and enhances team efficiency and objectivity. When the correct extrinsic and intrinsic motivations are used, the employees are likely to be more creative, motivated, and result oriented to ensure that they deliver positive results (Tahir, 2018). Although the scientific theory of management by Fredrick Taylor is no longer being applied in many businesses today, most of the application principles are evident in Barclay’s structure.\n\nExternal Influences That Might Impact Barclays Growth\n\nA strategic SWOT analysis is conducted on a business to determine its strengths, weaknesses, opportunity and threats. The strengths and opportunities eliminate the organisation’s weaknesses and threats (Bari and Syazwani, 2018). Similarly, the PESTLE analysis determines the political, economic, social, technological, and legal factors likely to affect an organisation or determine whether the business would fail. The political environment is an external factor which can help favour the organization when the law supports profitability. Social factors include the demographics and characteristics which make people seek services from the organisation (Tahir, 2018). The three critical external areas that Barclays should focus on include social, political, and economic factors. Although the factors are beyond the organisation’s sphere of influence, the management can take them into account and work with the relevant external stakeholders to improve its performance.\n\nSocial Factors\n\nThe social factors in an organisational analysis include society, culture, and how it affects people in the long run. The banking industry can only thrive when people in society are successful in their economic endeavours. For example, when the demographics have a small number of people with formal training, unemployment will be high, and the business will not have potential customers (Bari and Syazwani, 2018).\n\nFurther, gender stereotyping and lack of entrepreneurial spirit may negatively affect the business as society members will lack economic empowerment. Barclays can leverage social factors to empower people to be financially independent in the community. Investing in corporate social responsibility by offering entrepreneurial training, giving people loans to develop themselves, and increasing their saving capacity makes Barclays an economic jump starter in society. Consequently, the bank will get customers, and it may thrive in the long run. However, corporate social responsibility must be implemented strategically to add organisational value.\n\nPolitical Factors\n\nPolitical factors play a significant role in the operations of banks. Political instability, unfavourable taxes, corruptions, and pricing regulations are part of the external environment that may hinder a company’s growth (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021). Although the factors are out of Barclay’s control, it can partner with other relevant organisations to lobby the government for changes in policies to make them favourable such as reducing the minimum wage and setting an interest rate that guarantees profits (Ozili, 2022). Further, having new rules on mandatory employee savings will increase the revenue for the bank. The bank must therefore hire a legal director to monitor and evaluate political regulations and lobby for rates and regulations that favour the bank.\n\nEconomic Factors\n\nWhen conducting the PESTLE analysis, Barclay’s bank should consider the economic factors that may lead to poor organisational performance. The economic system in which a country operates must be considered to ensure the operations are in tandem with the economic system being operated in the country (Purshouse, 2020). For example, if a country it operates in has a socialist economic system, it should design its operations to meet the expectation of the people. Further, the level of government invention in strengthening the economy must be analysed and understood to ensure that Barclays benefit from any governmental interventions. The inflation, interest, and unemployment rates must be considered before investing in programs relating to the affected population (Haralayya and Aithal, 2021). Barclays must therefore hire an economist always to analyse the economic situation to avoid making bad decisions.\n\nConclusion\n\nBarclays bank is a thriving organisation that started in the UK and spread to other parts of the world. The organisation started as a goldsmith lending enterprise, then a partnership and finally became a limited liability company. The ownership status in such an entity is through the shareholders, and public members are always welcome to buy shares. The company has numerous motivated workers who are willing to perform better. The organisational structure depicts bureaucratic relationships and division of labour as per Taylor’s theory. The PESTEL analysis is an essential tool used to determine whether or not an organisation can thrive. Barclays must consider the political, social, and economic factors to blossom.\n\nReference List\n\nBari, A. and Syazwani, N.A., (2018). ‘ Bank specific and macroeconomics determinants of profitability in Barclays Bank PLC, United Kingdom ’.

      "Collective Climate Change Responsibility Essay\n\nClimate change has negatively impacted millions of people worldwide and is an existential threat to humanity on the planet. The debate rages on whether climate change is anthropogenic but scientific research has proven beyond reasonable doubt that climate change is primarily artificial and controlling the human activities that cause it could significantly reduce it. The biggest culprit in climate change is the greenhouse phenomenon that emanates from greenhouse gases such as methane and carbon dioxide. Sources of greenhouse gases include burning fossil fuels that fuel cars, coal plants that feed the electric grid, and factory farming that produces food for the nation. The question then emerges whether adjusting individual behavior can have a significant effect in curbing the climate crisis. The fact is that individuals are not the most critical contributors to the climate crisis, and while ditching the plastic straw might feel good on a personal level, it will not solve the situation.\n\nIt is not that individual behavior such as going vegan or buying electric cars is not a good gesture, but it probably does not go beyond just a gesture. Climate change is a political issue both in the US and at the geopolitical level. While the progressive might perform these virtuous acts, the average Republican is mocking them for believing in a hoax. To combat a global existential crisis requires a concerted effort on a worldwide scale. The entire globe would need to agree; until climate-change evangelists can convince everyone that the planet is on fire, switching to vegan burgers will not significantly reduce greenhouse gases. In addition, the climate change strategists need to concede the impracticality of some proposed measures. For example, some countries have switched off their nuclear facilities only to end up with energy deficits necessitating them to reopen their coal plants. The truth much energy is required to maintain the average lifestyle of a westerner, and until there are reliable energy sources, climate change will continue to be a polarizing issue.\n",
      "Researching the World Sport Ministries Essay\n\nA sports ministry is a charity sponsored by religion and uses sports to create links between religions and society. Through such organizations, character development, cooperation, and fair play skills, and Biblical principles are shared among its members. The principles help harvest discipleship and create hope within society through the love of Jesus Christ. This paper discusses World Sport Ministries, its efforts, benefits of the efforts, and components of the ministry.\n\nWorld Sports Ministries (WSM) champions the use of sports to represent Jesus in different ways. Its plan encourages and accommodates the children, youth, and adults hence expansive. With the large number, much effort is put to help acquire resources that can help an individual train and be in a position to implement ministry. The resources, in this case, include- ‘develop sports ministry,’ which helps an individual proclaim the gospel. Another resource is the ‘outreach strategies’ such as sports camps and youth sports leadership, which physically and mentally mentor the youths. Lastly, through WSM efforts, it is also possible to acquire free library materials on the ‘Ready Set Go Manual’.\n\nThe ministry efforts also bring together the children, youth, and adults into one pool to share different experiences and Biblical experiences. For example, the children are exposed to outreach programs such as holiday sports camp, which gives them an experience of a lifetime and teachings based on Christian values (Waller & Cottom, 2016). Through outreach programs such as school ministry, the children can also engage in sports and education, positively impacting them. On the other hand, the youths are engaged in youth sports leadership skills (YSL), which takes about 7 to 12 years and impacts one with character, faith, mission, and faith development.\n\nThe youth also have a chance to engage in tournaments such as touch rugby and 5-aside, which creates time for sharing the word of God. Lastly, the WSM also offers the youth a detached sports ministry, ensuring a connection between the disciples who can help with guidance and sharing. WSM also has adults who can engage in sports, exercise classes, sports event screening, and sport quiz. The events enable the adults to have significant experiences, such as having short talks and sharing testimonies.\n\nWSM is divided into various components: outreach programs, resources, support, management, and Get Involved. The outreach programs enable members to grow in body and mind and utilize sport to spread the gospel. On the other hand, resources give more data about WSM and the great experiences when an individual becomes a team member. Support elaborates how one can help through donations and prayers to help the growing population and make the program successful. Lastly, the management is responsible for controlling the flow of operations by empowering the members through various skills, experiences, and the world of The Lord.\n\nThe ministry has made the components to be implemented by displaying their plan to the public. WSM operates as a charity that changes lives through sports hence easily convincing people to join. Their plan is genuine and has 120 teams onboard in over 15 countries, which means the program has helped thousands achieve their goals in life. Therefore, the components guide the general public on how the programs are run through the management. An individual can also use the resources to navigate some of the achievements and history of WSM. The components are therefore effective and give the public an idea of what is happening in WSM.\n\nReference\n\nWaller, S. N., & Cottom, H. (2016).

      "Sophie Germain’s Story of a Woman Mathematician Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor the academic community of past centuries, it was common not to listen to women’s views and keep them out of scientific work. For a long time, it was thought that women could not bring new knowledge to science, and therefore their presence in universities and laboratories was undesirable. However, the history of the world has consistently sought to show otherwise: Ada Lovelace, Marie Curie, Wu Jianxiong, and hundreds of other women from around the globe have contributed to specific fields of knowledge comparable to men. One of the most striking examples of gender bias in academia is the story of the French female mathematician Sophie Germain, who made significant contributions to differential geometry and number theory. This essay evaluates this contribution and describes the significance of Germain’s figure for the mathematical sciences.\n\nMain body\n\nPrimarily, it would be helpful to briefly discuss the biographical details of Sophie Germain’s life, without which a study of her academic weight is incomplete. Sophie was the child of a liberal jeweler who disapproved of his daughter’s pursuit of mathematics (Flanders, 2018). The girl’s parents can be understood: society did not recognize a woman’s intellectual capacity, so an earlier investment in a child’s development of scientific knowledge might have been ultimately detrimental. Nevertheless, Sophie used her father’s library and studied math books on her own, one of which was Montucla’s “History of Mathematics” (Swetz, 2017).\n\nGrowing up, Sophie was aware that she would not make meaningful progress in science because of her gender, so the woman had to adopt a male pseudonym: Sophie began using the name Monsieur Leblanc (Flanders, 2018). Sophie used this name in her business correspondence with the eminent mathematicians of the time, namely Dalembert, Lagrange, Fourier, and Gauss. Her secret was soon discovered, but it was followed by public recognition and landmark awards. Thus Sophie always used the opportunities and tricks available to her to do herself, which ultimately allowed the woman to solve one of the most critical problems in mathematics.\n\nOne of the fundamental theorems of algebra is called Fermat’s Last Theorem. This statement postulates that equations of the form\n\n— a particular case of which is the Pythagorean theorem for right triangles — where have no solutions in the numbers and . Many men of science have tried to prove this theorem, which is a challenging task, especially for the level of proficiency in mathematics characteristic of the nineteenth century. Sophie Germain created a proof of this theorem for several exceptional cases — for example, when — which was an impossible task for Euler and Gauss (Flanders, 2018). The universality of the proposed solution made it possible to noticeably expand the range of prime numbers for which the theorem worked since Germain proved the effectiveness of the Last Theorem for all prime numbers smaller than a hundred. In other words, unlike redundant but unworkable proposals by other mathematicians, Sophie did not focus on private proofs but instead found a solution for a whole class of numbers when .\n\nAmong Germain’s mathematical discoveries, her proposed number theorem should be highlighted, which, although correct, has not received adequate attention from the academic community. In general, the problem she constructed was to prove that a number of the form was not prime. The elegance and wit of her solution to this problem cannot fail to amaze. In the equation below is the approach by which Germain proved the complexity of this number. In this solution, one sees that if can finally be represented as the product of two multipliers, then it is a composite.\n\nAnother of Germain’s apparent contributions to science was the study of elasticity theory using Chladni plates as an example. As a German physicist in the field of acoustics, Chladni discovered that sand poured on thin plates takes on a spectacular pattern when vibrations are applied to them (Lydon, 2018). Napoleon instituted a two-year competition and a significant prize for whoever could theorize the phenomenon. Germain spent two years studying elasticity theory, analytical mechanics, and vibration theory, but she lacked the depth of physical knowledge to complete the work. In the meantime, her work was improved upon by Lagrange, resulting in a solution to the Chladni problem for several simple cases.\n\nThis included Germain’s severe criticism of Poisson’s academically accepted approach to solving the problem, although according to modern concepts of acoustic physics, Poisson was not wholly accurate (Adeoye & Awodola, 2020). Eventually, and after numerous attempts to clarify her proofs, Sophie Germain was awarded the Napoleonic prize, but she defiantly did not show up at the award ceremony.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it should be emphasized that the scientific communities of past centuries were not as loyal to women as they are today. Because of this, there are few examples of women who have truly revolutionized the sciences. Sophie Germain is one of them: raised in an environment of non-recognition of her mathematical abilities, Germain was forced to hide behind a male pseudonym in order to correspond with iconic French mathematicians. Sophie was able to provide proof of Fermat’s Last Theorem for a whole class of prime numbers, develop her own proof of the complexity of any number of the form , and create a foundation for solving the Chladni problem for the elastic vibrations of sand on plates. It is safe to say that Germain was in many ways ahead of her time, and had she been born later, her intellectual contribution to mathematics would have been even broader.\n\nReferences\n\nAdeoye, A.

      "Use of Language and Stigma towards Persons With Substance Use Disorders Essay\n\nAt various levels, stigma encompasses thoughts, perceptions, practices, and institutions and can result in prejudice or discrimination towards those with cognitive function diagnoses or substance use disorders (SUD). Medical professionals have a significant amount of discrimination and negative attitudes toward substance abusers, partly due to disparaging or condescending terminology (NYS OASAS, 2021). At the time of treatment, stigma does not deter individuals with SUD from using substances; instead, it creates feelings of worthlessness and triggers further use (NYS OASAS, 2021). As a result, patients present to treatment late, do not disclose substance addiction, downplay suffering, and seek care elsewhere.\n\nMedical professionals must investigate the underlying causes of individuals abusing substances, such as adverse childhood outcomes (ACOs) and their health consequences. Additionally, clinicians should conduct trauma-informed treatment, which includes an awareness of the pervasive effect of trauma and the ability to recognize trauma-related clinical symptoms in their clients (NYS OASAS, 2021). As a result, they are obligated to respond by fully incorporating trauma understanding into regulations and vigorously resisting re-traumatization (NYS OASAS, 2021). Denigrating language in health records harms clients’ feelings and the treatment they deliver, as it perpetuates bias among other clinicians.\n\nPhysicians can strengthen language by creating a welcome setting, avoiding judgmental communication, and employing identity-affirming dialect to foster stigma-free and inclusive patient care settings. Health professionals should use a person-centered and strength-based approach when communicating with individuals with SUD (NYS OASAS, 2021). By avoiding terminologies such as addict, user, heroin addict, and druggie, medical workers can provide more appropriate care to people with SUD (NYS OASAS, 2021).\n\nFor new practitioners, patient records transcription is frequently their first experience. When studying their health records outside the medical environment, patients with SUD are more involved and in control of their care (NYS OASAS, 2021). Moreover, effective patient-centered treatment bolsters the patient’s perspective, encourages endurance, and promotes healing.\n\nReference\n\nNYS OASAS. (2021).

      "Lien Invalidation Due to Its Late Submission Essay\n\nThe theme of securing transactions is directly related to the topic of lien. The focus of this study is whether a lien can be invalidated for being filed too soon. Besides, this paper elaborates on the legal issue of the lien invalidation due to its late submission. It is shown how these issues are addressed under the law. The possible implications of the relevant legal regulation for business are discussed.\n\nIt is necessary to start the research by disclosing the meaning of the terms used. A lien is a legal hold that a creditor has over the property of another to secure payment or discharge an obligation. Perfection is the secured party’s way of declaring the security interest to the rest of the world. A security agreement is an agreement that creates or provides for a security interest. Having dealt with the terminology used, we will proceed to the analysis of the case.\n\nAccording to the case, Lattanzio neglected to document the lien statement with the province assistant’s office within six months after the date he stopped working or furnishing materials for the crop. Thus, the lien was dissolved and is unenforceable against Brunacini (Lattanzio v Brunacini, 2018). Violation of the deadline for filing the lien, as follows from the court decision, leads to the annulment of the lien right. To avoid such situations, one should learn about the deadlines for applying; such preliminary awareness will allow business organizations to avoid material risks.\n\nApplying to the completion of the contract also threatens the company with the annulment of the application. As happened in the second analyzed case Kaweah’s lien was eventually declared void due to its failure to meet the legislative requirements (Kaweah Construction Company v. Fox Hills. Landowners Association, et al., 2017). Companies need to make sure that all necessary legal requirements are met before applying; otherwise, there is a risk that the court will dismiss the claim.\n\nReferences\n\nKaweah Construction Comapany v.

      "The Apache Culture: Impact of White Privilege Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nCulture as a phenomenon plays a critical role in all individuals’ lives, significantly contributing to the formation of their perceptions, views, and behavioral patterns. When different cultures encounter each other, it can result in both the fruitful exchange of cultural heritage and achievements and even severe bloody conflicts leading to terrible aftermath for both nations. The video “Apache Indian Resistance – Geronimo” gives an excellent example of such confrontation, where emerging American society eventually conquered Indians, thereby paying an enormous price. This essay aims at examining the impact of aggressive cultural conflicts and white privilege on a community of color, namely Apache people. For this goal, the paper interprets the video through the lens of chapter 3 named “Culture.”\n\nThe Meaning of Culture\n\nCulture is the aggregate deposit of experience that embraces beliefs, religions, values, social roles, arts, hierarchies, concepts, and material possessions obtained and shared by a particular group. Culture formation is usually stipulated by the need to transmit the acquired knowledge to generations to promote their survival and the development of relationships within society and with nature. It has an immense impact on people’s behaviors, worldview, and lives overall and is manifested via languages, symbols, customs, and various forms of art, especially literature (Witt, 2020). These manifestations determine the differences between cultures and, in some cases, the supremacy of one group over another. However, it is worth noting that the surrounding environment, significant historical events, and individuals, primarily of considerable or epochal scope, place a noticeable imprint on a specific culture.\n\nMost societies and nations that consist of many ethnic groups have a dominant ideology. It implies a kit of beliefs and practices formed by the largest group to legitimate their existing political, social, and economic power (Witt, 2020). Dominant norms usually suppress alternative opinions and understanding to maintain the status quo and the ruling class. Furthermore, the science about culture recognizes such term as ethnocentrism meaning that particular persons or groups can perceive their way of life as a standard, simultaneously having an arrogant attitude towards other cultures (Witt, 2020). Typically, the concept is associated with various political and social extremes, such as fascism, Nazism, ultra-nationalism, and other radical ideologies. In contrast, sociologists also offer the term cultural relativism referring to the view when individuals consider other people’s behavior and customs from the angle of their culture. This concept highlights that different cultural groups understand the world diversely and that there is no supremacy of one culture over another.\n\nApache Culture and Society\n\nThe Apaches relate to Southwestern American Indians, which consisted of different tribes, including Jicarilla, Chiricahua, Mescalero, Salinero, and others. In ancient times, their territories extended over present southeastern Colorado, southeastern Arizona, western Texas, and southwestern New Mexico (Laluk, 2017). The Apache homelands comprised watered valleys, vast deserts, deep canyons, and high mountains, which are together known as Apacheria. In later history, Apache adopted a nomadic manner of life, focusing mainly on raids and horse raising and transport.\n\nTraditionally, most tribes functioned without a centralized organization, but they had bands, an independent political and military unit supervised by the most potent headman. The headmen usually deserved their titles rather than inherited them. The most famous leaders include Victorio, Mangas Coloradas, Cochise, and Geronimo who all belong to the Chiricahua (“Our culture,” n.d.). The video concerns the life of Geronimo, the latest leader struggling against Apache’s enslavement by the US Government. Geronimo was highly respected among both their people and enemies for his wisdom, bravery, and leadership skills.\n\nMaterial Culture\n\nConcerning the material culture, having moved to the Southwest, Apache developed a flexible subsistence economy that encompasses hunting, farming, gathering wild foods, and receiving food, tools, and other items through trade, raiding, and livestock hunts. Some tribes grew corn and other vegetables and hunted buffalo, an American bison. In contrast, the Chiricahua was the most aggressive among the Apache groups, raiding into New Mexico, Arizona, and northern Mexico.\n\nCognitive Culture\n\nThe Apache’s cognitive culture comprises their distinct tribal language and values. In particular, Apache shared the Athapaskan language inherited from Navajo, a Native American people, and including several dialects that have been preserved to this day (“Native American,” n.d.). Regarding values, the Apaches are well-known for their inexhaustible endurance in wars and faith in friendship and tribal ties. Moreover, according to the video, Apache people respected their land since they sincerely believed that it was connected with the spirits of their forefathers (Ahwahneechee, 05:15-05:31). This people also worshiped the power of nature and prescribed supernatural qualities to trees, rocks, wind, and other natural objects (“Our culture,” n.d.). On the contrary, Europeans were primarily inclined to build material wealth; they sought free territory and exploited its deposits, including gold, coal, iron, and other natural resources. Besides, European culture was distinguished by the focus on innovation since, unlike Indians, they possessed different advanced inventions, especially those related to military equipment.\n\nNormative Culture\n\nFinally, the Apaches had rich normative culture carefully passed down from generation to generation. As in most old civilizations and tribes, the men led wars, hunted, and traded, while the women were engaged in householding. In addition, the latter skillful providers, gathering foods, wild plants, seeds, berries, and nuts (“Our culture,” n.d.). The Apache people also were described as gentle and hospitable individuals, welcoming everybody who came with peace. The attitudes towards their children were kind and attentive, with a substantial emphasis on teaching them correct manners, such as fortitude, obedience, deference, and kindness.\n\nDespite a relatively strict hierarchical structure and sex roles, the Apaches adhered to social mobility allowing for flexible marriage rules. For example, they even could accept foreigners in their bands or married girls to Europeans if the latter present sufficient material gratification. The puberty rite ceremony named “Rite of Passage” was one of the most sacred traditions practiced by the Mescalero Apache (“Our culture,” n.d.). This ceremony, marking the transition from girlhood to womanhood, was accompanied by familial feasts, blessings, dancing, and rituals deeply rooted in ancient centuries. It exhibited a young girl’s good manners, discipline, knowledge of the tribal language, and overall upbringing inculcated from infancy. Rituals and customs conducted in such and similar rites sometimes provoked cultural shock in white people. Overall, as the video shows, many traditions were preserved even in the reservation period.\n\nConflicts and their Aftermath\n\nIn the region now referred to as the US West, many Indian tribes began to confront the colonialists who initially peacefully coexisted with the Indians due to the low population density of the territory. Nevertheless, the situation radically altered with the discovery of the vast gold deposits in the Great Plains, which resulted in the Pike’s Peak Gold Rush of 1859 (Drew, 2014). To expand gold mining activities, there was a need to expel the Indian tribes occupying the lands. Moreover, during the American Civil War, the volunteer infantry and cavalry formed by the California and Oregon governments actively fought against the Indians. One of the most prominent figures of that period was General James Carleton, who began to clear the territory from Indians cruelly.\n\nIn turn, Cochise launched a military campaign against reservation conditions and intrusion into Apache lands that became extensively subjected to coal, gold, silver, copper mining. Running 25 years of confrontation with US military forces, Cochise’s group was eventually defeated by superior American troops (Mort, 2013). Other Apache tribes followed their example between 1871 and 1873, but considerable numbers continued resistance. In particular, Geronimo and Victorio waged an active guerrilla war against the US Army. The surrender of Geronimo and his accomplices ceased the bloody Apache Wars in 1886 (Mort, 2013). The Chiricahua tribes had to move to reservation areas, and any attempts to disobey were suppressed by severe punitive actions.\n\nThe consequences of these severe, prolonged clashes were adverse for both sides. The American government embarked on a course on the assimilation of the indigenous American population and the forced resettlement of many Indian tribes from their primordial lands to the reservation areas. Tribes were forbidden to raid each other, and any attempts to disobey were suppressed by severe punitive actions. According to Haozous, wars Apache lost around 80 percent of their population due to wars, diseases, malnutrition, and most importantly, direct genocide policy (Ahwahneechee, 04:25-04:55). The federal government also paid an enormous price for this war, spending $40 million for every 100 Indians (Ahwahneechee, 03:43-03:56). In their turns, Apaches slaughtered thousands of soldiers and settlers.\n\nWhite Privilege\n\nIt is also worth noting that against the background of conflicts, clear ethnocentrism from emerging American nations can be distinguished, which persists in the modern era. Specifically, in a book, Blakemore (2017) indicates that the idea of white supremacy was the prime force of complicated relationships between whites and other races, especially Indians. This belief implies the natural superiority of the white race over other ethnical minorities, thereby justifying white privilege and power. White supremacist groups believe that their race should reside in a distinct, whites-only society to prevent white extinction and maintain their peculiar culture. In the video, McNeley states that American troops and settlers considered that it was their destiny bestowed by God to conquest Apache lands and take their rights (Ahwahneechee, 01:25-01:50). Such actions can be interpreted as apparent signs of nationalism or even fascism.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, the paper has examined the issue of culture, Apache culture, conflicts between the Apaches and the American nation, and the problem of white supremacy. Culture is cumulative knowledge that embraces beliefs, religions, values, social roles, arts, hierarchies, concepts, and material possessions obtained and shared by a particular group. The Apaches represent diverse, affluent, unique culture with its specific beliefs, customs, rituals, ceremonies, attitudes, and norms of behavior. In particular, their religion was primarily based on the worship of a supernatural power that could be mirrored in natural objects and animals. The clashes mainly stemmed from settlers’ strive to occupy Indians’ lands and exploited natural resources such as gold, silver, coal, and copper. As a result, because of numerous devastating wars causing diseases and famine, reservation, and purposeful genocide policy, indigenous people lost most of their population. The conflict was significantly exacerbated by the dominant ideology of white privilege over people of color.\n\nReferences\n\nAhwahneechee. (n.d.). Apache Indian resistance – Geronimo . YouTube.

      "Ca2+ Molecule Description and Its Functions Essay\n\nCa2+ is a flexible signaling molecule that regulates various physiological functions (Genovese et al. 6; Jacobson et al. 213; Clapham 1047; Courjaret et al. 2; Gautier 2; Alvarez et al. 204; Duchen 57). Separate signaling pathways permit tight Ca2+ control, which, when combined with the elastic machinery’s unique Ca2+ receptivity, allows for even more perfect VSM contractility (Ghosh et al. 50; Feiteiro et al. 580). Calcium modulates cytoskeleton proteins including actomyosin and tubulin, and at high doses, it can even trigger microtubule depolymerization (Umemoto et al. 2098; Nicholls 1373; Giorgi et al. 37). Ca2+ is involved in several critical biochemical elements that influence the survival and death of cells, particularly resistance and regulated pathways of cell death, including cell autophagy, necrosis, and cell cycle (Giorgi 258; Pinton et al. 6407; Orrenius et al. 552).\n\nIn several tissues, mitochondria may function as a regional Ca2+ buffer, modulating the transient Ca2+ concentration in the cell micro-domain (Duchen 57). This process controls functions that rely on local cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentrations such as Ca2+ flow across the -gated channels (Duchen 57). Chondrosomes utilize calcium ions as well as ions from the surrounding protoplasm (Irannejad and Zastrow 109). If the presence of calcium in the chondrosome rises excessively, the chondrosomal membrane becomes more porous, increasing absorption in a positive feedback mechanism (Irannejad and Zastrow 109). Increased chondrosomal porosity can result in a necrotic overload mechanism, which prevents ATP generation and, if left uncontrolled, can culminate in the complete collapse of the chondrosome (Irannejad and Zastrow 109).\n\nWhen the ligand attaches to the GPCR, the q component of G-protein is triggered, which then triggers phospholipase C (PLC), a cell membrane protein (Dhyani et al. 3). PLC converts phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2), a phosphatide component of the plasma membrane, to IP3 and diacylglycerol once active (DAG) (Dhyani et al. 3). Because IP3 is permeable in the protoplasm, it disperses throughout the cell and attaches to the IP3-receptor (IP3R) on the outside of the ER or SR, causing Ca2+ to be transported from the ER or SR to the protoplasm (Dhyani et al. 3).\n\nCells use several elements of the Ca2+ signaling toolbox, such as Ca2+ entry and Ca2+ ejection mechanisms, to appropriately regulate intracellular Ca2+ impulses in a timing and space-dependent approach (Schwaller 1; McMahon et al. 244). Ca2+ absorbers, a group of cytosolic Ca2+-binding polypeptides, play the role of oscillators, mainly close to the end Ca2+ impulses (Schwaller 1; Nicholls 1374; Galluzzi et al. 1200; Mikoshiba 1426). An apoptotic signal, like the release of neurotrophins or exposure to chemicals, induces a pro-apoptotic constituent of the Bcl-2 protein family, like Bax, to permeabilize the outer mitochondrion in the intrinsic route (Franklin 1437). This permits cytochrome c to be redistributed from the chondrosomal intermembrane gap into the cytosol, where it activates caspase proteases, resulting in the death of cells (Franklin 1437).\n\nMultiple elements of mitochondrial malfunction have been linked to various common diseases, making mitochondria a potential pharmaceutical target for the management of a broad spectrum of ailments (Javadov et al. 1177; Varghese et al. 3017). Mitochondria are significant actors in cancer growth because of their ability to provide required key components for anabolic physiology (Genovese et al. 9; Gautier et al. 2). Additionally, Genovese et al. insinuate the capacity of the mitochondria to develop ROS that has essential involvement in the induction of the death of cells communication by reducing cancer cell growth (9). Numerous mainstream medications have been modified to boost anticancer properties by binding mitochondria-targeting molecules (Genovese et al. 14; Fujisawa et al. 5). For example, drug resistance appears to be reduced by triphenylphosphonium enzyme doxorubicin (Genovese et al. 14). Furthermore, Genovese et al. (14) suggest that the chondrosome-targeted variant of glycyrrhetinic acid causes death in tumor cell lines via inducing membrane leakage shift.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAlvarez, Javier, et al.

      "Black Lives Matter: Diversity Awareness and Self-Reflection Presentation\n\nPresentation Script\n\n 1. Introduction to the event;\n 2. Experience influence;\n 3. Key concepts;\n 4. Engagement with diversity;\n 5. Challenges and Strategy;\n 6. Positive and Negative Emotions;\n 7. How to deal with negative emotions;\n 8. Steps to advance human rights and justice.\n\nIntroduction to the Event\n\n  * “Black Lives Matter” in the USA;\n  * Hillsborough, NJ made a statement on June 6, 2020;\n  * More than a thousand citizens joined a protest;\n  * The theme of racism cannot be ignored;\n  * The silence “spoke” that moment.\n\nThe “Black Lives Matter” movement continues to spread across the United States, provoking a number of positive and negative emotions. Many American states have already joined the idea to support racial equality in society. On June 6, 2020, the citizens of Hillsborough, New Jersey, organized a peaceful protest to demonstrate their solidarity. Despite the restrictions imposed by the COVID-19 situation, about a thousand citizens came to the intersection of Route 206 and Amwell Road, one of the busiest parts of the town, to discuss the theme of racism in the country. In addition to people’s stories and memories, a remarkable feature of this cultural event was the silence that lasted more than eight minutes.\n\nExperience Influence\n\n  * It is possible to change something;\n  * The effect of the crowd is impressive;\n  * Black people do not want to ask for help;\n  * White people experience fear because of prejudice;\n  * Nothing should be based on color.\n\nIs it possible to change someone’s mind in several minutes? The experience obtained during the Hillsborough protest proves that everything is possible – to make the loudest street keep silence, to be heard by the globe, and to learn how unfair human judgments could be. It is enough to gather and exchange public experience. My perception of diversity and differences was never distorted, and I believed that equality is something people cannot be lost. I was wrong, and this cultural event in my community shows the real situation. Many black people are not able to ask for help because they have already lost hope. Many white people feel fear not because it exists, but because they are Americans, and it is their nature to be afraid of something. This event is an opportunity to prove that nothing should be based on color.\n\nKey Concepts\n\nRace\n\n  * Blacks are inferiors;\n  * “fear ruled everything around” (Coates, 2018, p. 134);\n  * Discrimination is a denial of equal access (Zastrow et al., 2019);\n\nGender\n\n  * Gender issues usually mean women’s issues (Katz, 2012);\n  * Male domination predetermine women’s and girls’ role in society;\n  * Sexism provokes new inequalities.\n\nClass\n\n  * Class debates are “stripped from popular culture” (Mantsios, 2018, p. 173);\n  * Global comparison hides the American truth;\n  * Wealth and power are related.\n\nAfter visiting the chosen cultural events, the worth of such concepts as “race,” “gender,” and “class” has been considerably re-evaluated. Although many American people believe that they live in an equal society, Blacks are still considered as inferiors. Coates (2018) uses the explanation that fear rules people, and racial discrimination exists as a form of denial in human relationships. Besides, the quality of life is determined by gender stereotypes that are usually identified as women’s issues (Katz, 2012; Zastrow et al., 2019). Because of male domination, people are not able to understand how women and girls are discriminated. Sexism provokes additional inequalities, and class diversity is one of them. Mantsios (2018) show that Americans avoid class debates because they believe that the USA offers its citizens better conditions, compared to developing countries. However, wealth and power give birth to the elite that dictates rules and diminish the poor.\n\nEngagement with Diversity\n\nTo engage with diversity means:\n\n  * to recognize differences in people;\n  * to respect differences that shape human experience;\n  * to communicate and learn;\n  * to participate in social events;\n  * to differentiate between privilege, power, and oppression.\n\nSocial workers have to cooperate with different people, regardless of their race, gender, or social class. Therefore, engagement with diversity and differences cannot be ignored or misunderstood. I consider this type of commitment as an opportunity to recognize and explain differences in people not to discriminate but to respect because it is the only way to respect human experiences and knowledge. History cannot be ignored, and individuals should be ready to communicate and learn, as well as to participate in social events. Such experience in social work practice will help to differentiate between privilege and power and never oppress minorities.\n\nChallenges and Strategy\n\n  * Challenge One : the lack of effective communication (to be heard, people use protests and rebellions);\n  * Challenge Two : resistance to change (even if alternatives are offered, society does not want to believe in their power);\n  * Strategy : the promotion of clarity to avoid unnecessary judgments.\n\nIt is always easy to identify problems, shortages, and concerns in today’s style of life. People like to complain, but do not find it necessary to do something and promote positive changes. This course and social event experience help me identify two main challenges associated with diversity in society. First, there is an evident lack of effective communication between people. Even being aware of racial or gender inequalities and subjective stereotypes, it is hard for people to share their opinions. To be heard, it is necessary to organize a protest and an event, causing both negative and positive attitudes. Second, even if society recognizes a problem, many individuals do not act due to their resistance to change. If a problem does not touch their families directly, it is not necessary to change something. To address this challenge, the promotion of clarity is one of the possible strategies. This step will help to predict unnecessary judgments and inform people. Clear goals, intentions, and activities will demonstrate that society has to be changed.\n\nPositive and Negative Emotions\n\n  * Hope that people are interested in not only discussing diversity concerns but acting.\n  * Disappointment that many people continue living in anger and despair today.\n\nDuring the past ten weeks of the course, I have got a number of opportunities to understand the quality and worth of human life from the social worker’s perspective. I believe that the American nation is one of the strongest countries in the whole world, and the growth of the “Black Lives Matter” movement serves as evidence. I am pleased with the fact that American students, teachers, as well as other citizens, are interested in solving the discrimination problem in society. There is a hope that something can be done to change this world, and people are ready to act. However, the analysis of the literature, communication with peers, and observations show that many Americans still live with the feeling of anger and despair that no help is coming. Some people are afraid to share their true attitudes toward the current situation and need additional motivation.\n\nHow to Deal with Negative Emotions\n\nCollective thinking is the way to find a solution.\n\nDespite the intention to create a perfect society and achieve the highest levels of life quality, negative emotions cannot be neglected. Instead of avoiding them or demonstrating anger, it is high time to find a solution. Regarding my experience and observations, I consider the idea of collective thinking as an appropriate strategy to address negative emotions. People are eager to communicate and cooperate, and there is a need for a good leader or even several leaders who could support collective thinking. As soon as citizens start discussing their emotions, memories, and experiences, they will be able to listen to and hear each other and make decisions.\n\nSteps to Advance Human Rights and Justice\n\n 1. Participate in local social events;\n 2. Communicate with people in social media;\n 3. Visit local churches and public agencies;\n 4. Learn theories, regulations, and political mechanisms;\n 5. Invite new people to discussions.\n\nMy collective thinking strategy includes five main steps:\n\n 1. I will continue visiting local public events to gather the opinions of people;\n 2. I will talk to people of both genders and different races to learn their experiences;\n 3. I will go to local churches and agencies to find emotional support and motivation;\n 4. I will continue my education to be theoretically prepared for social work practice;\n 5. I want to invite as many people as possible to contribute to the “Black Lives Matter” movement.\n\nReferences\n\nCoates, T. N. (2018). Letter to my son. In M. Adams, W. J. Blumenfeld, C.

      "Marketing Plan Timeline: Press Waffles Essay\n\nThe marketing plan discussed in this work requires a detailed timeline in order to achieve the goals established. Given that Press Waffles can be regarded as a part of the specialty eatery industry which is focused primarily on customer intimacy, these notions will have to be reflected as soon as possible. Thus, the first major objective to be achieved is securing the attention of the target audience and conveying the mission statement developed by enforcing specific promotion techniques. This aim can be accomplished within the first month of the marketing campaign, during which the notions of enhanced customer experience and the uniqueness of the product will be translated. Moreover, the alterations to the standard menu will be addressed as an element of the advertisement, certifying that the target group is aware of the ongoing developments.\n\nSimultaneously with the first stage, the product changes will be launched as part of the marketing plan. This includes adjusting the current menu of Press Waffles and adhering to larger groups of clientele. Launching the original vegan waffle and vegan toppings will be an important element of the timeline. It is suggested that the promotion and distribution of the new product will be completed within the first month of the campaign.\n\nAfter that, the next step of the approach implemented encompasses utilizing additional pricing options, which are imperative for the company’s future development. The initial change to the current system consists of offering a Press app, which provides the customers with supplementary mechanisms for purchasing our products and receiving extra benefits from maintaining continued loyalty. If the number of new clientele increases, it will be more effective to propose the use of the application. Finally, as the steps discussed have been fulfilled, another location in Mequon will be opened, presenting the clientele with a new café and securing further profits. A substantial level of interest and sustainable customer flow is of exceptional need for the conclusion of the last activity.\n\nAccording to the timeline examined, there are several goals to be accomplished during the marketing campaign. These objectives include receiving successful customer feedback after the launch of the promotion plan, as well as securing stable levels of clients’ interest in the new product. Furthermore, it is crucial to accomplish credible statistics regarding the number of vegan waffles sold, which should corroborate the proposed figures. Another aim will be the popularity of the Press app, which should rise steadily after its launch. Lastly, a specific number of customers should continue using the suggested benefits, as well as visit the newly opened location. Hopefully, these statistics will increase continuously, enhancing the distribution of the novel product.\n\nIn order to control the achievement of the goals and assess the overall flow of the marketing campaign’s success, particular metrics will be used to determine these characteristics. A significant measure will be the number of customers served at the distribution points after the vegan waffle introduction, as well as the statistics regarding the product sold. The clients’ interest in the newly included menu option will be evaluated by comparing the amounts of current and novel waffles dispensed. After that, the percentage of clientele utilizing the Press app will be ascertained, including the number of loyal clients and the frequency of additional benefits used.

Blood pressure is measured in both systolic and diastolic terms (Neurologist 2006). Systolic pressure is the pressure exerted by the blood after a heart beat while diastolic blood pressure is measured between each heart beat. two numbers are written to represent these two terms, for instance, as 120/80 which is pronounced as ‘one twenty over eighty’. This is around the most favorable pressure, (even though 110/70 is sometimes estimated as a more preferable blood pressure). Blood pulse pressure is a term used to define the disparity between the two different blood pressure readings (that is diastolic and systolic). Normal blood pulse pressure is estimated at 40 mm Hg. Even though it can differ by a few points devoid of being seen as abnormal.\n  * Graphics : The above pictures are used to illustrate how blood pressure is checked.\n\nBlood pressure chart\n\nSystolic reading       Diastolic            Category               What needs to be done                                                                         \nBelow 120 mm Hg        Below 80 mm Hg       Normal blood pressure  Maintain a healthy lifestyle and exercise                                                     \nBetween 120-139 mm Hg  Between 80-89 mm Hg  Pre-hypertension       Maintain a healthy lifestyle and incorporate exercises.

If the blood pressure goes beyond this range, it is considered too high and can result in health issues. A person whose blood pressure is beyond 120 over 80 but below 140 over 90 is considered to be in the pre-hypertension stage (Neurologist, 2006). This is a dengerous stage and appropriate measures should be taken to bring the blood pressure down. Blood pressure above 140 over 90 is alarming and medical advice should be taken to control it.\n  * Sound: youtube.com/ROME06MD .\n  * Graphics: the above chart gives a summary of the different type of blood pressure readings, their implication and measures that can be used to maintain a normal blood pressure.\n  * Interaction/Activities.

Stress (Rocio, 2009).\n  * Text: There are apparent connections between high blood pressure, obesity, resistance of insulin, metabolic syndrome, diabetes and cardiovascular disease. So there is enough reason to guard against it. Many people belive that high blood pressure is mainly caused by consumption of salt, but the answer is NO! The two main causes of high blood pressure are anxiety and stress. It is advisable for people who do not have a normal blood pressure not to worry so much because the blood pressure might even get higher.\n  * Graphics: The picture on screen N9 illustrates a very high blood pressure.\n  * Interaction/Activities. This links gives more information on the causes of high blood pressure.\n\nHow to lower high blood pressures\n\nThe common techniques that can be used to lower high blood pressure include:\n\n  * Meditation;\n  * Soothing music;\n  * Exercises;\n  * Healthy diet (Rocio, 2009);\n  * Text : Good meditation techniques, soothing music, deep breaths are some of the ways that can be used to keep a blood pressure as normal as possible. It is also advisable to avoid caffeinated beverages as this interferes with the blood pressure.\n\nThe brain\n\nFunctions of the brain:\n\n  * Memory;\n  * Attention;\n  * Speed;\n  * Flexibility;\n  * Problem solving (Anon. 2011);\n  * Text : In addition to the things discussed earlier (relaxing and reducing caffeinated beverages), brain exercises and can be used to lower blood pressure. Anxiety and stress are associated with the brain, thus if the different functions of the brain are used appropriately, high blood pressure can be prevented or lowered.\n  * Graphics : Figure shown on screen above explains the different functions of the brain.\n  * Interaction/Activities : Screen N12 to N16 expounds on this.\n\nMemory\n\n  * Memory is one of the functions of the brain;\n  * It is the sharpest part of the brain;\n  * Memory is tied to general intelligence;\n  * Text: Memory is the sharpest part of the brain that is used to store information. A sharp memory helps one to remember certain things and improve performance. Good performance results in happiness and gets rid of anxieties and stress. More information is provided in the proceeding screens.\n  * Graphics: the sharp object is used to show.\n\nAttention\n\nSome people record high blood pressure due to luck of attention. If the level of attention is low, People end up making mistakes and this creates Stress and anxiety. Attention training can be used to improve this condition (Rocio, 2009).\n\n  * Text: Attention training improves the ability to perform well in exams and other activities that demand visual. Improved attention helps to filter out distraction thereby increasing productivity which reduces anxiety.\n  * Graphics: figure on N12 illustrates this function.\n\nSpeed\n\n  * Thinking fast and clearly;\n  * Quick thinking solves problems instantly;\n  * Text: Exercising the metal processing speed helps in thinking more quickly and clearly and therefore get rid of anxieties and stress. It also helps in increasing alertness and awareness. This can be achieved through brain speed training.\n\nFlexibility\n\nThe brain is like a spiral that can be stretched to different shapes and sizes. It helps in:\n\n  * Strategic thinking;\n  * Controlling impulses;\n  * Avoiding mistakes (Anon. 2011);\n  * Text: Flexible thinking helps to articulate thoughts better and provide a person with the discipline to refuse to give in to temptation. When one is able to think flexibly, precision and cognitive control are improved. Flexible thinking skills can be improved by taking some flexible exercises. These skills include strategic planning, controlling impulses, and avoiding mistakes.\n  * Graphics : figure above shows that the brain is not static but flexible.\n\nProblem solving\n\n  * This helps in making accurate decisions;\n  * Avoiding mistakes, thus avoiding anxieties (Anon. 2011);\n  * Text : Problem solving skills can help in making accurate decisions. People need to train their problem solving skills that will help them in making mental estimates and thus achieve more efficient thinking. The brain is the key to every thing and if used properly, many illness can be prevented.\n  * Interaction/Activities : user clicks here and goes to this link for more information.\n\nCourse summary\n\n  * Blood pressure is measured in systolic and diastolic terms;\n  * A blood pressure of 120 over 80 is considered optimal;\n  * High blood pressure results in hypertension;\n  * Stress and anxiety are the main causes of high blood pressure;\n  * Healthy eating, exercises, soothing music, among others can be used to manage high blood pressure;\n  * Proper use of the brain is the key to preventing high blood pressure.\n\nLet’s review some of the key points in this course. Blood pressure is measured using two terms systolic and diastolic (screen N7 and N8).\n\nA blood pressure of 120 over 80 is considered to be normal and beyond this reading is dangerous. High blood pressure results in a condition called hypertension which can be managed by seeking medical advice in addition to healthy eating and exercises. The main causes of high blood pressures are stress and anxiety (Rocio, 2009).\n\nFrom this course it is clear that control of high blood pressure is the sole responsibility of an individual. This can be achieved by eating a healthy diet, exercising regularly and taking enough time to relax.\n\nIf the brain is taken care of properly, then the problems of high blood pressure can be reduced.\n\nScored assessment\n\n  * What is blood pulse pressure?\n  * Blood pressure is measured in?\n  * Consumption of salt is the main cause of high blood pressure, yes or No. Explain your answer\n  * What is the normal blood pressure reading?\n  * What are the measures that can be used to control high blood pressure?\n\nAfter completing this course, you should be able to answer the above simple questions. This questions are designed to test whether you have understood the course. The questions are graded with a rubric that is based on the objectives of the study.\n\nCongratulations on completing this course\n\nYou have come to the end of this course, congratulations for your time and effort.\n\nCongratulations!

      "The Necessary Reforms for the UN System Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe establishment of the UN organization took place in 1945, but soon after, the necessity of reforms became evident. The UN Secretaries-General have made attempts to implement the necessary reforms, but the more they tried, the more need for constant reforms was encountered. The frequency of reforms in this body represents it as more dynamic due to subjective and diverse reflection of interests. Such diversity primarily contributes to why the association faces difficulties in carrying out reforms (Azam, 2021). Few reforms such as the agenda for peace 1992, Brahimi Report, and freedom initiative by Koffi Annan were implemented, but still, the entity needs to reform the peacekeeping budget and the Peacebuilding Commission among other options.\n\nThe organization has struggled with reforms because of the following aspects. First, it is highly decentralized, complex, and multi-faceted, and therefore, the only solution for the members was to work under the concept of agreement (Azam, 2021). Unfortunately, as the Member States, the subjects have never united to support specific goals for reform because they commit to passing contradictory ideas, making any alterations complicated. Secondly, the union encompasses the Member States with deep-seated agreements on political interests. The worldwide interaction involves the poor, the rich, the powerless, and the powerful pursuing specific interests. These are the problems that shape decision-making in the UN, keeping it a divided and contradicted agency (Azam, 2021). Thus, the issues about reforms at the UN stay either unsuccessful or incomplete, and therefore, this term has been considered vague among the Member States. The achievability index is low because reforms in this association are politically capitalized, take time to be implemented, and require patience and resources, which remain unavailable. Regardless of these issues, there is a need to make reforms that when handled, can support the entire firm.\n\nPrevious Reforms\n\nThere is a record of reforms that have been worked on even if they were not successful. The first one is the agenda for peace 1992, which was elaborated as Boutros Boutros-Ghali’s initiative, which was UN’s, Secretary-General. The Brahimi Report, which was drawn up in 2000, was written by the independent experts’ high commission led by Rahim, an Algerian diplomat. The third reform was considered a freedom initiative submitted by Koffi Annan (Azam, 2021). This report’s main intention was to implement the commitments of this organization as contained in its 2000 Millennium Declaration during the World Summit and to initiate the authorization of missions. The subjects permitting the mission were supposed to use force to ensure the mandate is fulfilled.\n\nThe Necessary Reforms\n\nPeacekeeping Budget\n\nThe first necessary reform for the UN is the organization’s need to refine the peacekeeping budget. The annual budget is formed from 1st July till 30th June, which needs to be done 12 months in advance. This principle demands every individual government to contribute concerning its salary scale and rank. The problem which has affected for long this reform is that the Member State contributions, which are done compulsorily, are late or fail to reach implementation time. Currently, it is becoming difficult to pay the troop-contributing nations as expected. The UN is presently indebted to the Member States for the sum of USD 3.5 billion (Azam, 2021). Such a scenario forces the UN to refill the annual assessments and other financial resources to settle the gap brought about by this situation. Reform is needed to affect the subjects to ensure funds are supplied to the UN appropriately and without fail to support the smooth running of events.\n\nPeacebuilding Commission\n\nThrough the Peacebuilding Commission, the organization can achieve early warning and be empowered to comfortably execute internal monitoring. The peacebuilding center was established in 2010 and has supported the need to ensure a constant flow of information to delegates and missions’ security (Azam, 2021). Through this body, coordination of situational and political information from various sources to the UN’s premises is executed comfortably. This center needs to be active and stable because when a crisis emerges, the agency becomes a facilitator. Therefore, to activate the crisis response mechanism, the organization needs proper coordination (Azam, 2021). Such architecture will only succeed if mediation and prevention capabilities, field mission, and the Secretariat are staffed adequately. It is therefore a recommendation to reform this structure to ensure it can carry out its mandates appropriately by considering proper human resources policy.\n\nMy Opinion\n\nThe UN’s peacekeeping mission needs to cooperate with the host government, multilateral partners, and bilateral agencies to ensure gender issues are exhaustively addressed. Women’s participation in such issues as reintegration, disarmament, and demobilization is essential since it will not only form a diversified workforce in the UN but also empower women (Azam, 2021). The Suh step would make it easier for the organization to manage any slow implementation and practical which occur as challenging to handle. It is essential to ensure the necessary reforms for this organization are initiated.\n\nIn conclusion, apart from the reforms which the UN has tried to handle, such as the agenda for peace 1992, Brahimi Report, and the freedom initiative by Koffi Annan, the performance of the entity still leaves much to be desired. The UN as an agency is confronted with the dilemma of managing its mandate because the union operates in a highly decentralized, complex, and multi-faceted environment. To smoothen its workability power, the organization needs to support peace-support architecture by ensuring it is properly equipped. Besides, host governments, bilateral agencies, multilateral partners, and others need to be included in even decision-making channels.\n\nReference\n\nAzam, S. (2021).

      "The White Stone: Six Choices Presentation\n\nIntroduction\n\n  * Handy presents a speech for managers.\n  * His discussion offers propositions for the next 25 years.\n      + It addresses the period from 1996 to 2021.\n  * In 2019, we can see how these ideas were or were not implemented.\n\nIn his speech, Charles Handy discussed the state of business and the job market in 1996, offering his thoughts about the upcoming 25 years. Now that this period of time is coming to an end, one may critically analyze the points that the philosopher made. It is also possible to compare the author’s ideas with those that are visible in modern societies. The author discusses jobs, companies, and capitalism as well as people, talents, money, and education, and he shows how the major issues of humanity are interconnected. One can also employ different philosophies to evaluate the concepts that Handy believes in, including Utilitarianism, Value Theory, Kantian theory, and Egoism theory.\n\nCritical Summary: What Sort of Jobs?\n\n  * Job force, as predicted by Handy:\n      + 50% – full-time employees.\n      + 25% – part-time workers.\n      + 15% – self-employed individuals.\n      + 10% – unemployed or in training.\n  * The increase in self-employment and freelancing requires people to possess soft skills and a level of awareness about their personal talents.\n\nAccording to Handy, the job market would continue to shift towards a decrease in the share of full-time jobs. The philosopher stated that companies needed to hire fewer people in order to keep up the growth of their profits. Therefore, full-time positions would have to be reduced, thus contributing to the growing number of part-time jobs, project-based positions, and self-employed people. Indeed, many companies now work with freelancers who do not have similar protections, benefits, or stability. These people, as prophesized by Handy, are not educated by the company but through their own means.\n\nCritical Summary: What Sort of Companies?\n\n  * Companies grow continuously through acquisition and merger.\n  * Federalism – the dissemination of authority to manage large corporations.\n  * Example: International Postal Federation.\n      + Where is the central office?\n      + Each subsidiary is equally important.\n      + The center as a whole follows agreements between its parts.\n\nHandy argued that companies would increase in size by using technological advances to create international systems. As the same time, all businesses would have to become smaller. Here, Handy introduced the principle of federalism – the distribution of power from one entity to multiple smaller units. The author, however, rejected the idea of a “Superstate” that had one or multiple strong centers. Instead, the idea was to disperse authority among people interested in the company’s profitability. Currently, many companies are international, and a significant number of them dominate their industries by buying or undermining their competitors.\n\nCritical Summary: Trust Is Cheap\n\n  * Employees can work without constant supervision if they are motivated by:\n      + Owning company shares.\n      + Contributing to the discussion.\n      + Gaining profit from the business’s success.\n  * Trust is vital in virtual firms where workers do not see each other.\n  * Mistakes are a component of the learning process.\n\nCompanies that have offices in different cities, use virtual spaces, or employ freelancers need to address the issue of trust. Handy argued that businesses could not successfully grow without believing that workers could do their jobs without continuous supervision. Thus, it would be easy for firms to function in small units where people were well-acquainted with each other. Another vital part of trust is the right to make mistakes. Handy stated that companies could devote additional time to educating workers about their organizational processes and then allowing them to self-manage. At the present moment, many firms are collaborating with remote workers who rely on themselves and are only limited by deadlines and a set of company guidelines.\n\nCritical Summary: What Sort of Capitalism?\n\n  * People are the company’s assets because of their skills and talents.\n  * Tangible assets have less impact on organizations’ success than employees.\n  * Socialist principles may motivate people and redistribute wealth.\n\nHandy argued that the standard model of Anglo-American capitalism would not work on its own in the future. Therefore, he advised the integration of socialism into business processes to include the idea of “sympathy” for others. As people come to be considered the main assets of many firms, their place in companies changes. If a valuable talent leaves the business, it may substantially affect the organization’s success. It is not practical to treat employees as property, limiting their access to profits. The example provided by Handy, a list of America’s richest men, shows that the current situation is similar to that of 1996. The divide between the rich and the poor is still significant, which shows that Handy’s idea did not reach its fulfillment.\n\nCritical Summary: What Sort of Society?\n\n  * First possibility: 20/40/40 society:\n      + 20% of people are well off.\n      + 40% of people make barely enough to live.\n      + 40% are excluded individuals.\n  * Second possibility: service age:\n      + Narrow niches for people with unique talents.\n      + Self-employed entrepreneurs who develop a particular skill.\n      + Independence from conventional education.\n\nHandy believed that society would move away from mass production into a period focusing on of services. He stated that making money out of nothing would be simpler for people who discovered their unique skill and found a niche. Therefore, increased attention would be given to various needs, and new businesses would appear based on demands that had not yet been explored. The philosopher also noted that the existing paths to education were not essential for people to achieve success since skills could come in all forms.\n\nCritical Summary: What Sort of Education?\n\n  * The current educational system:\n      + Failure on a test is permanent and impactful.\n      + Exclusion of people who do not succeed immediately.\n      + Final results are not personalized to students’ abilities.\n  * Handy’s proposed system:\n      + Failure is not punished, and tests can be retaken.\n      + Students’ competencies are tracked and recorded.\n      + Upon leaving school, people are aware of their individual strengths.\n\nAs mentioned previously, Handy did not believe in the effectiveness of the existing system of education. Instead, he proposed a different model that would address the existing shortcomings. In the speech, the philosopher opposed the focus on relative success or failure that is enforced by tests and examinations. A model that could work would be based on people’s unique capabilities and the option of taking tests whenever a person feels ready. The competencies of students would become the priority, and the recognition of their personal skills would allow them to represent themselves in the market or in the world as a whole.\n\nCritical Summary: What Sort of Life?\n\n  * Stages of life:\n      + First 25 years – apprenticeship.\n      + Second 25 years – work and creation of a family.\n      + Third 25 years – time for self.\n      + Fourth 25 years – preparation for and acceptance of death.\n  * “More” – a flawed measure of success:\n      + Success is unreachable.\n      + All pursuits end in failure.\n      + The process yields no satisfaction.\n\nHandy used an idea from Hindu philosophy that separated people’s lives into four 25-year stages. According to this idea, people’s work should change after they reach 50 years. Employees need to be prepared to leave their jobs and explore other interests by this time, and companies have to accommodate people’s desire to do that. Moreover, Handy stated that people have to understand such concepts as “More” and “Enough” in order to live a meaningful life and pursue the goals they value. The idea of “More” does not see any limit to earnings or riches, making true success virtually unreachable. Instead, people are always reminded that someone can surpass them if they stop working.\n\nCritical Summary: The Doctrine of Enough\n\n  * An antithesis to “more.”\n  * “Enough” serves as a limit for achieving success.\n  * After getting enough, one may move on to something else.\n  * The doctrine opens up opportunities for self-discovery.\n  * If people have enough, they do not feel the need to compare their resources.\n\nThe opposition to the idea of “More,” proposed by Handy, is the Doctrine of Enough. It states that a person should be able to find the limit that would satisfy all their needs, and then work to achieve it, but not surpass it. In this case, the doctrine offers a solution to the problem of focusing too much on work, money, or success and ignoring other parts of life as a result. “Enough” is a concept that gives people the ability to find themselves without sacrificing time to gather more power or resources that may be necessary for comfortable living. This idea corresponds to the previous propositions for raising individuals’ self-awareness of their personal skills. It is impossible to measure whether this concept has affected the current job market, but it is clear that the majority of people have not embraced this doctrine yet.\n\nEthical Theories: Utilitarianism\n\n  * The choice is ethical if it results in the best outcome for the most people.\n  * Socialism in companies promotes employees’ contributions.\n  * Handy’s system of education praises everyone’s skills.\n  * The Doctrine of Enough makes success reachable.\n\nAccording to the theory of Utilitarianism, the most ethical choices are those which produce the maximum amount of good for the largest number of people. Handy’s beliefs align with the ideas of this philosophy. For instance, his proposal to introduce federalism into companies’ structures can lead to workers’ gaining profits that would otherwise stay in the circles of owners and upper management. Therefore, a larger number of people (employees) would have enough resources to live comfortably. If one takes the ability to explore one’s potential as a measure of happiness, then the Doctrine of Enough is also supported by Utilitarianism. If competition and envy are limited in the job market, more people would be less stressed about their achievements.\n\nEthical Theories: Virtue Theory\n\n  * People possessing virtues make ethical decisions.\n  * Possible virtues:\n      + Justice;\n      + Temperance;\n      + Bravery;\n      + Prudence;\n      + Fidelity;\n      + Self-care.\n\nThis theory holds that moral actions are performed by people who possess cardinal virtues. Such qualities as prudence or temperance are among the ones that are emphasized by Handy’s rhetoric. The philosopher’s Doctrine of Enough is based on people’s ability to enjoy life in moderation and overcome the desire to acquire more resources than may be necessary. His beliefs about the redistribution of wealth are in line with such virtues as justice and fidelity – the idea of “sympathy” he introduces promotes care for others. Finally, the Hindu stages of life discussed above are also supported by the virtue of self-care, which states that people have a duty to care for themselves.\n\nEthical Theories: Kantian Theory\n\n  * Kantian ethics operate on the basis of duty fulfillment.\n  * Actions are morally right if they are performed following a categorical imperative.\n  * In this case, the imperatives are:\n      + Not to contribute to the inequality of wealth.\n      + Not to damage the environment.\n\nIt may be more challenging to assess Handy’s propositions since his speech was addressed to a large number of people. Thus, his ideas may be cited by people with different intentions, even if these persons come to similar results. The philosopher’s personal view shows that he both wants people (including himself) to find comfort and satisfaction through their personal skills. Moreover, some of his educational and workplace policies originate from a desire to help the world economy to progress without leaving people without jobs. While he shows that companies would need to decrease their number of full-time positions, he introduces a model that would still offer people new jobs.\n\nEthical Theories: Egoism Theory\n\n  * Self-interest is the only reason for any pursuit.\n  * Egoism could support Handy’s propositions if:\n      + They will lead to success.\n      + People will understand the outcomes of these actions.\n\nThe ethics of egoism somewhat differ from many beliefs that Handy expressed in the speech. His idea of adding socialism to the capitalist system may be viewed negatively by business owners who wish to continue as the primary authorities in their companies. In contrast, one could argue that this suggestion would lead to a firm’s success, which could be interpreted as an egoistic goal. Handy’s argument for trust and mutual effort may align with the Egoism theory if people realize that teamwork can be justified by self-interest. Here, the comparison of “More” and “Enough” emerges as a decisive factor in determining which one is considered preferable.\n\nConclusion\n\n  * Handy’s speech remains relevant.\n  * Its propositions are rooted in temperance and teamwork.\n  * Some of his predictions have come true.\n  * Others may still come about in the future.\n\nIn 1996, Handy was able to recognize some problems with the job market and society that were then common. He proposed many solutions and shared his vision for the future. Some of his views can be recognized at the present moment – the workforce is shifting towards digital freelance employment. Others have not been realized since income disparity and testing in education still exist. Some of the concepts introduced by Handy should be considered even now as they remain relevant to contemporary issues.\n",
      "Avery Associates Architects Approach to Research Essay\n\nAvery Associates Architects, a company established in 1978, employs an effective research approach, combining some technical and philosophical aspects. The organization starts the work on a project with the exploration of the exact needs of the customer in the course of detailed interviews. Architects want to understand what is expected, as well as the degree of the customer’s ambition.\n\nOne of the benefits of the research is its structure and the focus on diverse parameters, including practical details and ethical, aesthetical, and philosophical aspects. As for constraint identification, the research includes such components as constraint, contiguity, content, climate, construction, choreography, and concinnity. The architects concentrate on customers’ needs, budgetary constraints, history, and context. Importantly, the company pays specific attention to sustainability, trying to ensure that its buildings will remain in harmony with the setting and environment. One of the important stages of research is the examination of the relationship between people and the building, expectations, and their satisfaction.\n\nThis type of research is the most appropriate in the modern world due to its potential to lead to innovation and sustainability. The architects do not only identify some technical expectations of the building and its practical characteristics but attempt to use a more holistic approach. The detection and analysis of constraints are instrumental in developing plans that can predict diverse emergencies and deviations that often disrupt the work on the project. It is critical to pay considerable attention to the aesthetics and philosophy of every site and every project. Unfortunately, many companies ignore these elements. However, these aspects ensure the development of projects that contribute to the sustainable development of communities. People feel safe in such places and have a clear view of the potential of each building.\n",
      "“Recent Advances and Future Directions for Quality Engineering” by Vining Essay\n\nThe authors in this study talk about the current and future changes in the field of quality engineering (Vining et al., 2015). In manufacturing, engineers are concerned most about the efficiency of processes and methods used to enhance performances. In the past decades, individuals identified statistical approaches used to improve productivity excellence in any engineering system. The authors start by first providing an overview of significant advances and trends that have taken place in the past decades and inform further how engineering should evolve to make new contributions.\n\nThe article is majorly a reflection on where quality engineering is headed in light of the current situation associated with manufacturing. According to the authors, the field is transforming from the past challenges. Initially, individuals perceived quality engineering as the concept for improving the value of products, services, productivity, or reliability in the manufacturing sector. Individuals in the field contributed to such notion through the existence of agencies such as the American society for quality engineer certification (ASQ) (Vining et al., 2015).\n\nOn the contrary, contemporary issues need adaptation to key basic tools in the industry, and the future depends on how well the equipment is embraced. In the coming days, it is perceived that robotic systems will control the manufacturing environment to enhance productivity. Economic and high-tech sensors for data collection will obtain valuable information to improve outcomes of the products. Such changes will result in sophisticated operations and a series of more complicated processes. Consequently, research methodologies will be required to meet the industry demand.\n\nThe future of quality engineering is deemed to have brighter changes, and it will also contain significant challenges. According to the authors, one issue that will face the profession is an increased divide between practitioners and academic research needs (Vining et al., 2015). Professionals need to focus on the problems in the real world to meet the demand for new applications. The study mentions recent advances such as the extension of standard methodologies for addressing issues, experimental designs, profile monitoring, computer experiments, statistical approach, and software advances. While current software can perform complex statistical analysis, there are new capabilities such as computer experiments modeling with new systems features.\n\nFuture directions will involve integrating quality engineering concepts into systems, using massive data sets, image data, experimenting with functional profiles, and focusing on reliability and statistical engineering. Traditional designs and analysis of systems played a crucial role in the innovation and creation of products that customers could never imagine. Introduced changes in the manufacturing field have brought quality engineering to the focus on creativity.\n\nWhile changes in the systems have taken place, what has facilitated more growth is practitioners’ training. The authors argue that software development or changes sometimes exacerbate problems because they do not recognize when users are misapplying statistical methods (Vining et al., 2015). With that, follow up training tend to counter errors.\n\nThe quality engineering field has to evolve for survival, and experts in the field must look at the productive path forward. With changes taking place in the industry, opportunities for significant contributions prevail. Quality engineers combine the appreciation of process thinking and knowledge of variability to handle emerging problems. Experts and practitioners in the field must seize opportunities and adapt steadily.\n\nReference\n\nVining, G., Kulahci, M., & Pedersen, S. (2015).

      "BX-14: Market Analysis and Strategies, Segmentation Analysis Report\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nThe idea of starting BXIV came from the analysis of the men fashion industry and the brands in it, we analyzed that brands are offering these products for very higher amount that middle class cannot afford that, for that purpose we are putting our foot in this business, We conducted different surveys and researches for analyzing the market and the technological industry, for that we interviewed different people from different classes and got to know different pay scales of people, keeping in mind the average pay scales of people and the amount people want to spend on buying different products we are offering we have set the price of our products, and the most popular way of promotion in the city is billboards and that we are using for promotion, besides that the secondary promotion tool which attract a lot of consumer is media, we are using TV, radio, print media for the promotion of our brand, we also got to know by interviewing and giving people questionnaire that the innovation in a product is the thing that a product carries and forces people to go for shopping so we are also using this marketing strategy as promotion of our brand. For distribution purposes we would target the economic hubs of the city over there we would open our franchises and market our product from those particular areas of the city (Johansson, 1993).\n\nSegmentation Analysis\n\nMarket segmentation is used as “a strategic marketing tool for defining markets and thereby allocating resources. Segmentation studies use statistical techniques called factor analysis and cluster analysis to combine attitudinal and demographic data to develop segments that are easier to target” (Dyrud, 2002, p. 23).\n\nWe have divided our groups on the basis that which segment of the population is in the most need of our product, so we analyzed that businessmen that is the corporate sector is in the most need of our product and we would be catering to them initially (Davenport, 1993).\n\nGreiner Model\n\n1 st Phase\n\nThe Greiner model basically starts with the growth stage of the product. Where the entrepreneur is too busy handling the important functions of the business and most of the communication that is taking place is informal because the number of employees is less when the business is new and growing and the rewards for extra efforts put in are given in the shape of stock options or profit-sharing. But as the organization grows older and there are more employees within the company so it becomes necessary that the conversation used should be formal, and the same sort of situation will be implemented during the growth stage of BX-14. Most of the time leadership crisis arises in this stage so it is necessary that bX-14 management should hire someone professional in order to eliminate this problem\n\nPhase 2\n\nThis phase is basically related to the growth through the direction. This would be needed when our product BX-14 has achieved a lot of growth and the environment of our organization is more formal rather than informal. There are so many specifications regarding a product which is difficult to find out and it becomes difficult to manage everything. This is where BX-14 could face autonomy crisis and it is necessary that the power should be distributed among the members of the organization in order to make sure the smooth sunning of the business.\n\nPhase 3\n\nA lot of crisis arises in this stage when the middle management fails to indentify the growth opportunities for the business and all the important work decisions and important work are been done by the top management. In order to save BX-14 form this sort of control crisis it is necessary that all the different and separate parts of the business should work together.\n\nPhase 4\n\nThe unorganized products of the business reorganize them into product group or services. What happens at this stage is that there an increased amount of bureaucracy in the company because of which the work becomes submerged. And as a result of it the growth of the company becomes slow or almost very slow. At this stage the BX-14 management should end the red tape crisis so that a new culture for the organization can be developed if any such problems are identified in the company.\n\nPhase 5\n\nThis is the stage where the growth of your company takes place through collaboration people are working in teams and the rewards are given according to the performance given by the teams. Most of the times there are crisis of internal growth at this stage the BX-14 can only achieve the target of future growth by developing important partnerships with the other complementary organizations.\n\nPhase 6\n\nThe last stage is about the growth of BX-14 through extra organizational solutions. At this stage the growth of BX-14 should continue through mergers, outsourcing, networks and other solutions involving companies. The growth of our company may vary between different phases. And the each phase duration of the growth period depends on the market in which they are operating.\n\nTarget Analysis\n\nOur brand focuses on the business man mainly people from the corporate sector and as we are currently selling our product to the corporate sector or the business man so our target market is business mans. At present we are operating from china so currently we are just focusing on the business man of china. But b 14 is only currently focusing on business man in the future it will expand its target market and move towards students, workers and so on. Our brand identified the need of a portable device which has facilities of Bluetooth, scan, multilingual dictionary, remote output, voice input etc. So in order to carter that need of the people basically business man we decided to create out product which has all the facilities that they needed from the portable device. Our product offers all the facilities which make our product distinct from all the other similar sort of products. Some of the characteristics of our product are:\n\nBlue Tooth, Scan, Multilingual Dictionary, Remote Output, Voice Input, Microphone and Memory Card, these are some of the characteristics that we are offering through our product to our target market which is basically the business man or in short the corporate world and look to offer it to everyone in the future.\n\nProducts and Services\n\nOffering\n\nWe are offering a pen named BX 14 with a lot of multipurpose functions and characteristics.\n\nBX-14\n\nBX -14 is a multipurpose pen being offered by us. It caters the modern needs of the people which require mobility and multipurpose devices and instruments. Those multipurpose instruments include a lot of characteristics these characteristics are things like blue tooth, scan, multilingual dictionary, a remote input, a voice output, a microphone and a memory card. The pen also provides you with a facility to conduct conferences between individuals. This pen is currently targeted towards business a person that is the corporate world but its qualities are just not limited to them only this is a versatile product and in future we aim to carter other segments of population as well that is the students and workers etc. The product which has so many options usually have higher costs, the higher costs are usually because of the so many functions a small device is offering you. Because of the so many features of the product it results in higher manufacturing cost because of the usage of so many electronic parts. In the beginning the cost of the product will be higher but later on it will be lower as we will expand and target the other segments of the population. For e.g.: (A) Workers and (B) Students\n\nServices (Return Policy & Exchange Policy)\n\nThe defected products can be retuned back to us within 1 week of purchase of the product. Product can also be exchanged within only 1 week of purchase of the product. Any time after that product will neither be exchanged nor returned.\n\nPricing\n\nOur brand is a high quality product because of its features and characteristics and the mobility of functions it offers with the pen. Therefore the price of our product would be a bit higher in the beginning because of the electronic parts that we would be using in it. Since electronic parts would be used so it adds up to the cost of manufacturing and increases the cost of our product. But we would only be offering the product with higher prices in the beginning later on it the prices would be lower as we would move on towards other people other than the business man such as the workers and the students.\n\nPlace\n\nAs our brand is a high quality product as well as a highly unique one. So it will be a complete revolution in the market of multifunctional pens all around the world. It’s the right time to introduce our brand all around the world as it’s the era of innovations and technology. Our brand will be having its main center in China and will be having displacement centers all over the world. As we have been in the market for almost 10 years and have done great research about the multi-functional products so it’s the right time to enter in to the multifunctional pen markets as we see a lot of growth in this market as no such product like our brand has been introduced before.\n\nPromotion\n\nPromoting a product is the most difficult thing to do. It is necessary to know how to convince the customers to buy and have faith in the product. Similarly you should know the ways to persuade a customer towards a brand. Different companies use different way of promotion which includes the ATL activities (above the line) BTL activities (below the line and OTL (on the line) activities, as our main target market is business man and teachers and students, so we have to be very precise in selecting the promotion strategy, We will be having an ATL strategy to persuade the customers towards our brand, we will directly communicate to go with our targeted market through conferences and spokespersons.\n\nPeople\n\nPeople play the most important role in the success or failure of the brand. People are the one who actually make the marketer know where their brand stands and where their brand cans even faster grow. So understanding people and their needs determine the brand to perform in a certain level and way. Our brand focus on business mans and the teachers and students mainly. So we will be having different research methods to determine the needs & wants of these people.\n\nPackaging\n\nPackaging plays an important role as “a medium in the marketing mix, in promotion campaigns, as a pricing criterion, in defining the character of new products, as a setter of trends and as an instrument to create brand identity and shelf impact in all product groups” (Gomez-Mejia et al., 2008, p. 45). Packaging has to be the influencer at the point of purchase. It should play an important role to make the customer influence to buy the product. A packaging must have these characteristics in order to attract customers. We will be paying more attention on our product packaging by doing well in the following packaging characteristics. We will be having an eye catching appearance which typically youngsters respond positively to, we will be giving a lot of attention on the design shape and color of the packaging, it increases the post and the packaging will be very communicative so it can communicate and gain customer attention\n\nUnique Selling Proposition\n\nThe unique selling proposition is the uniqueness of the product which differentiates itself from other products in the same product category. Our brand is totally a unique innovation itself. As there has not been any such product in the market yet. The multi functionality of our brand make it unique in the market and that our unique selling proposition.the multi functionality includes the features which are starting from a high tech blue tooth in the panthers a scanner in the pen, multi dictionary, a remote output, a voice input microphone and memory card. These features just make this pen so unique itself that itself it is a unique selling proposition.\n\nPoint of difference\n\nThe point of difference is the concept that every product has something similar which full fills the need but have some point of differences which makes them different from those competing products in the same product category. Our point of difference is the features we are installing in our product.\n\nPoint of parity\n\nPoint of parity is the similarities between the products competing in the same product category. The point of parity is with the other products are the efficiency of the pen in writing and as like other pens it also fulfills the basic need of a person of writing. Leaving the other features behind and focusing on the writing features ,like all other pen it gives you a smooth and comfortable writing and makes your writing experience more delightful just as you will feel by using the other features of the pen.\n\nMarketing Strategies\n\nMarketing Objectives\n\n  * To occupy 20% to 30% share of the multi-function products’ Market.\n  * To make considerable profits of the company (Probably 1,000,000 to 2,000,000 pounds).\n  * To achieve market acceptance of our products totally. To bring profit to the company every year.\n\nSWOT Analysis and Internal Performance Analysis\n\nCompany has enough resources and tendency to produce the product as per market demand.\n\nConstraints Analysis\n\nThe company will only be facing the constraint of being global. Going global is not an easy task to do.\n\nMarketing Mix\n\nAs mentioned above.\n\nExternal\n\nCustomer Analysis\n\nBusiness man and teachers and students are our customers, and according to their needs and wants we have designed our product\n\nCompetitor Analysis\n\nOur product is so unique and distinctive that we are actually facing no competition in the market or we can say that we are entering in to the blue ocean market\n\nTechnological & Legal barrier\n\nThere is as such no technological and legal barrier with respect to our brand\n\nFinancial Plan\n\nStarting the analysis of our financial plan we will start it with the analysis of our profitability ratios. In this we will analyze our profit and loss statements, balance sheet and our cash flow statement.\n\n 1. Increase/ Decrease is sales%= (S1-S0/S0)*100= (100,000-10,000/10,000)*100 = 900. It indicates that the sale in the current year has increased as compared to the least year. The rising trend in sales reveals that company product market share increased in one hand and on the other hand it reflects the satisfaction of customer over our product. Sales revenue of the company is treated as oxygen. The increase in sales also requires future investment and expansion of business activities.\n 2. Gross Profit to sales%= (GP/Sales)*100= 75% gross profit margin on the sales depicts the trading profit earned by the company out of sales but before meeting operating expenses ,interest, tax. It should be more than 30%. It also indicates that the difference between sale price and purchase cost or manufacturing cost.\n 3. Cost of Goods to Sales% = (GP/ Sales)*100= 25% it shows the cost of goods sold in relationship to sales. The management should try to control it in order to increase or maintain the gross profit margin out of sales.\n 4. Operating Expense%= (Op.Exp/Sales)*100= 14.23% it indicates the amount spend today on business operation for generating revenue. The increase in expense can only be justified if there is an increase in sales. The management should control the operating expense in order to earn reasonable profit/EBIT. Because operating expense in one of the important factors that the company should maintain in order to get higher levels of revenue from their earnings (Hill and Westbrook, 1997).\n 5. Sell distribution and marketing expense to sales %= (selling exp/ sales)*100= 1.92%. Selling expense directly relates with sales revenue and marketing operation. An efficient marketing operation based on strategic market plan yield increase sales revenue, sales promotion activities help in survival of company’s product in the market and maintaining its shares.\n 6. Admin Exp to Sales% = (Admin Exp/ Sales)*100= 3.84%. It basically measures the relationship between administrative expense and sales. Administration staff provides support services for managing the business activities. Administration Expense are also covered from sales revenue in order to have an effective, efficient office system admin Expense are incurred.\n 7. Net Profitability to sales%= (Net Profit/Sales)*100= 10.769%. Net Profit to Sales ration indicates the profit available for ordinary shareholders who are the real owner of the company.\n 8. Return on Asset= NP/ Total Asset=22.4%. It shows the rate of return on total amount invested in assets as per balance sheet. It is compared with market rate of return.\n 9. Return on Owner’s Equity= NP/OE=it measures the rate of return on total owner’s equity is equal to shares capital+ reserves+ retained earnings.\n\nKnow moving on to the next part of analysis of you cash flow, balance sheet and profit and loss account. The second stage includes the analysis of our liquidity ratios. These are very important form a company’s point of view and important steps should be taken in order to make sure that the proper ratio is maintained.\n\n 1. Current Ratio= CA/CL= 1.07. It measures the financial ability of the company to meet its shorter obligation and failing due on maturity immediately.\n 2. Working Capital= CA-CL=5000. Working capital in a business is treated as blood running in the veins of people. It insures the smooth running of business operations without any hurdles or bottle necks. If the working capital is not enough to support the business operation than sales cannot be achieved.\n 3. Asset Turnover= Sales/total Assets= 2.08. It measures the utilization of resources for generating sales revenue. The utilization of resources depends on management ability/ skills/ expertise/ planning, controlling, decision making. In order to generate maximum revenue management should use the resources in most efficient and economic ways. The management performance is measured on the basis of assets turnover.\n\nThe next ratio that we would be discussing is the debt ratio which also basically helps a lot to the company in decision making process and maintaining the creditability of the company (Katkin, 2005).\n\n 1. Debt Ratio= (total liabilities/ total assets)*100= 100. It measures thee claim of creditors on total assets. It also indicates the amount invested by the creditors in total asset of thee firm.\n\nA company achieves its breakeven point when the total of it sales or revenue is equal to its total expenses or its cost. At breakeven point neither the company is making any profit and nor incurring any losses, so whenever a company is in this sort of a situation than it is said to be in a break even position. The calculation of the breakeven point is critical for any business because it is the lower limit for profit margins. There are many types of cost that has to be taken into consideration while calculating thee break even analysis, these costs are very important and must be considered when calculating the breakeven (Sullivan and Stevens, 2003).\n\nThe break even analysis of our company can be done by taking into consideration the total revenue that is being generated from the sales of our product and the total cost that is being incurred in the manufacturing of our product. Currently the total revenue generated by sales of our product is 262,000 and total cost in generating it is 232,000. So currently we are in a surplus situation at the moment we have surpassed are breakeven point and currently we are earning profit from the business. It is because the total revenue we are generating from the sales of our product BX-14 is quite more than the cost that is being incurred in its production. The total cost “includes all the expenses and cost of sales that were being incurred at the time, after or during the production or sale of our product BX-14” (Miller, 2006, p. 30).\n\nLeadership Style\n\nLeadership style is the “manner and approach of providing direction, implementing plans, and motivating people” (Miller, 2006, p. 32). There are three major leadership styles which are\n\n 1. autocratic\n 2. participative\n 3. delegated.\n\nThe autocratic style is not favorable in now a day’s environment by not including the employees in the decision making process, the participative style is letting the employees to participate but still taking the decision him or herself. The declarative style allows the “employees to take the decision.In our organization well be having a participative style to follow” (Miller, 2006, p. 46).\n\nSummary\n\nIt is quite evident from the marketing and financial analysis of BX-14 that it is one of the greatest products with a great future a head of it. The characteristics of this product differentiate it with the rest of the products that are available in the market. The main competitive advantage that this product holds over all the other products is that it has an added feature of mobility. It is easy to carry anywhere you like and the extra features it has Bluetooth, scan etc., which makes it a far better product then the rest of the other that are available in the market. One of the other great strengths of this product is the variety of functions it holds. Its convenience to take it anywhere you like is also one of the greatest strength of this product. It is also provides you a lot of opportunities, the first is that it is a progress for the collection of multi-function and secondly it is progress for the universal of technology in society and thirdly that is one of the boldest technology for the transformation of a pen. Break even analysis also indicates that there is a cash surplus with the company which shows that BX-14 is currently operating in a very profitable manner (Gomez-Mejia, et al., 2008). It shows that the future aspects are bright, and currently everything is in the favor of the company and the product BX-14\n\nReference List\n\nDavenport, Th. (1993).

      "Adidas AG: Functional Currency of the Company Research Paper\n\nForeign currency transactions and hedging activities\n\nAdidas arranges and hedges their contract as well as the organized currency option and swap to reduce the risk associated with foreign exchange transactions. In the year 2010, the company had currency options of about € 7million. It recognizes hedging in the financial statement by having hedging reserved in the balance sheet and posting hedging cost in the income statement. For example, in 2010, the company recorded € 16 million for currency options and € 25 million for forward contract in the hedging reserved. In the income statement, € 4million was recorded as premium. Most purchases were made from the U.S. and recorded in dollars (Adidas-group, 2011).\n\nFrom the financial statements, one can note that in 2010, there was a figure of negative € 3 million, which was in hedging reserved relating to foreign entity investments (Adidas-group, 2011). These figures can only be removed from the books if the foreign entity is disposed off. “Contracts, transactions, or balances that are, in fact, effective hedges of foreign exchange risk will be accounted for as hedges without regard to their form” (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 1981, p. 4). “The currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates” is the entity’s functional currency (IASCF, 2009, p. 1383). “The currency of the economic environment in which cash is generated and expended by the entity” (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 1981, p. 5). Operational forms, such as a subsidiary, division, branch, or joint venture, can make an entity. If a foreign entity’s books are not kept in the functional currency, then the book must be re-measured into the functional currency, prior to translation (Westerfield & Jordan, 2007; Gustafson, Peroni & Pugh, 2006).\n\nFunctional Currency of the Company ADIDAS AG\n\nThe functional currency of Adidas is Euro, but the group makes most purchases in dollars. For example, in 2010, the company made purchases of $ 3.7 billion. All transactions of the company and those related to subsidiaries are translated into reporting currency that is Euro (Adidas-group, 2011). All assets and liabilities denominated in other currencies apart from the functional currency of Addidas are adjusted to reflect the current exchange rate on that date. Transaction gains and losses, which result from adjusting assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency or from settling such items, are recognized in the income statement. All gains and losses attributable to a foreign transaction that is hedged and of investment in a foreign entity are recognized separately as a component of shareholders’ equity, in which adjustments arising from transaction foreign currency financial statements are accumulated. Meanwhile, gains and losses attributable to intercompany foreign currency transactions that are of a long-term investment nature are recognized separately as a component of shareholders’ equity. Last, the company defers and includes in the measurement of the basis of the related foreign transactions gains and losses attributable to foreign currency transactions that hedge identifiable foreign currency commitments.\n\nThe objective of the re-measurement process is to produce the same results that would have been reported if the accounting records were kept in Euros rather than the local currency. Translation of the local currency accounts into Euros takes place according to the temporal method; thus, the resulting translation gains and losses must be included in the functional currency for most of their subsidiaries. For those fluctuations that do not impact cash flows, the adjustments for currency exchange rate charges are excluded from net income (Schlosser, 2002). However, for those fluctuations that do affect cash flows, the adjustments for currency exchange rate changes are included in the net income. “Translation adjustments that arise from consolidating that foreign operation do not impact cash flows and are not included in net income” (Financial Accounting Standards Board, 1981, p. 4). However, the translation adjustments affect the cash flows directly in the case of domestic operation, and such gains or losses are included in the net income (Brealey, Myers, & Marcus, 2007).\n\nReferences\n\nAdidas-group (2011).

      "Don’t Talk to Cops: The Fifth Amendment and Public Opinion Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Duane’s Assessment of the 5th Amendment\n 2. Surprising Points\n 3. Changing Public Opinion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nDuane’s Assessment of the 5th Amendment\n\nProfessor Duane’s assessment of the 5th Amendment is valid. During his lecture, the professor provides seven strong arguments to support his statement (“Don’t Talk to Cops, Part 1”). It is clear that a perfectly innocent person can make incriminating statements due to various factors, including but not confined to being too emotional, being unaware of some laws, and being intimidated. The professor also adds that contemporary technological advances can also be used against a person who talks, which is true.\n\nThis view is supported by some researchers and practitioners. For example, Mohan and Villasenor state that the digital era is associated with various means that can help a person prove his/her innocence, but there are cases when technology can incriminate (12). Duane provides a simple example of when a person could be incriminated if his/her answers were tape-recorded, but questions were not.\n\nSurprising Points\n\nOne of the surprising points was the fact that the police officer also supported some of Duane’s arguments. He noted that innocent people might say something that may be used against them, which happens all the time. One of the factors provided is rather surprising. The police officer says that people make incriminating statements as they are “stupid” (“Don’t Talk to Cops, Part 2”). A simple test held in the classroom shows that people are inattentive even if they are in a relaxed and friendly environment (“Don’t Talk to Cops, Part 1”). Thus, even if a person is innocent, he/she can say something that can be used against him/her as the devil is always in the detail. One of the most common pitfalls is that answers can be used as regards the entire situation or even case rather than a particular question posed (Arnold and Farashahi 35).\n\nChanging Public Opinion\n\nIt is necessary to note that the 5th Amendment is seen rather negatively in society. This right is often associated with adverse inference (Szak 11). People tend to think that if a person does not want to testify, he/she has something to hide, which makes this individual guilty. The recent case of Martin Shkreli can be regarded as a good illustration of that negative attitude as people believe the former chief executive of a pharmaceutical corporation is guilty as he does not testify (Pollack and Huetteman par. 34). It is necessary to add that people already have a negative view of the defendant as he is a representative of the pharmaceutical industry, which is seen as unfair and corrupted. People think that Shkreli does not testify, and only this makes him guilty.\n\nThus, concealing or simply refusing to provide certain evidence is also regarded as proof that the person is guilty. However, there are many cases when the person may want to be silent as interpretations of words can make even an innocent person guilty. Duane provides various examples of such instances (“Don’t Talk to Cops, Part 1”). It is important to make Americans change their attitude towards this Amendment as, during courts, it is still seen as a thing against the defendant. People should understand that keeping silent is a right that protects them from errors, which are very common in the judicial system of any country, even the USA. To change this opinion, it is important to use media and start a wide debate on the matter.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nArnold, David L., and Afshin Farashahi. “The Fifth Amendment Privilege Against Self-Incrimination in Civil Cases.” Virginia Lawyer 58.1 (2009): 34-37.

      "Apple Inc.’s Company and Ratios Analysis Essay\n\nOrganizations use a number of indexes to evaluate their annual financial performance. One of the most commonly used measures is the operating leverage that helps explain the responsiveness of operating income to change in sales. The best way to understand the concept is by looking at a real example. In the fiscal year ended on Sep. 27, 2014, for instance, Apple Inc. recorded an operating leverage of 1.1 times (calculations shown in excel). The implication of the index is that a 10% rise in sale during the next time period is likely to increase the operating income by 1.1%. Conversely, a 10% sales decrease in the next fiscal year will lead to a reduction in operating income by 1.1%.\n\nOn the other hand, the return on investment (ROI), also referred to as rate of return, is a popular performance evaluation metric that helps assess an organization’s success in terms of the earnings generated in a particular time period relative to the initial investment. Apple Inc.’s ROI for the period ended on Sep. 27, 2014 was approximately 8.8%. The implication is that the investors expect to earn a rate of 8.8% from their investment in the company. This is a high rate considering that it is above the free interest rate. However, there is a need to evaluate whether there exist other investment opportunities that promise a superior rate. An investor intending to commit his/her funds in the company will need to explore other available growth opportunities in the market. If there are such investment opportunities, it is prudent to choose the ones that promise the highest returns.\n\nThe economic value added (EVA) is also an ideal performance evaluation metric that can help estimate Apple Inc.’s investment for the period ended on Sep. 27, 2014. It is a useful tool that tells us the amount generated by an organization above the actual cost of equity. Its key purpose is to measure whether the management is creating value beyond the expected rate (Daft 2010). In case of Apple Inc., the company recorded an estimated EVA of $38,418,000 in its last reporting period. It is a positive figure implying that the firm’s management generated a higher return on invested capital than the cost of capital.\n\nIn addition, the market value added (MVA) is also a vital financial measure that is basically the spread between an organization’s fair value and the capital invested. In particular, the index denotes the excess value created by an organization beyond the actual resources committed in form of capital. In the fiscal year ended on Sep. 27, 2014, Apple Inc. recorded MVA of approximately $474,614,000. This implies that the organization’s market value was very high compared to the invested capital. It is a good indication that shows the company is creating more value than other firms operating on the market.\n\nThe abovementioned financial measures present a number of advantages and disadvantages. One of the chief advantages is that they are relatively easy to compute and interpret. Most of them do not require sophisticated computations. Moreover, they provide good ground for comparing performance between different time periods or/and organizations. The predominant demerit of the metrics is that they do not account for time value of money. Most of them make use of nominal values, which are highly prone to inaccuracies. In addition, they all use historical data that are also vulnerable to biasness.\n\nReferences\n\nDaft, R. L. (2010). Management . Mason, Ohio: South-Western Cengage Learning.\n",
      "The Psychiatric-Mental Health Assessment Essay\n\nThe information was obtained from Mrs. B., a 24 years old female. The psychiatric-mental health assessment is necessary in this case because the patient is viewed as insecure about her appearance by members of the family. She frequently throws up after meals and is anxious about her weight most of the time. A survey was used to assess the patient’s mental status (Goroll & Mulley, 2014). She has got the highest possible score, and it is a significant factor because it indicates that no significant mental issues are present. No problems with self-esteem were noted. It is noticeable that she has frequent mood swings and tries to draw attention to herself. Overall, it is evident that she has a distorted perception of her body.\n\nThe patient’s current diet may be described as unreasonable. She has suffered an enormous loss of weight over the last few years that should not be disregarded. Mrs. B. avoids certain foods and prefers fruits and vegetables in most cases. It needs to be said that laxatives are also frequently used. She does not have a history of drug use, and it is a significant factor because it could worsen the situation. It is also imperative to note that the process of eating is viewed as something terrifying by the patient and often causes discomfort. The fact that she is not physically active is significant because her muscles may be severely weakened as a result of such eating behavior.\n\nMrs. B. immigrated approximately six years ago. The patient has noted that she thinks that the treatment may not be complicated by issues that are associated with culture and traditions. She does not use traditional medicine and views it as extremely ineffective.\n\nThe patient has reported issues in the family. The primary issue that causes conflicts and disagreements is that most are not satisfied with her eating behavior. Husband often criticizes her actions, and he does not agree with her beliefs that she should lose weight. Mrs. B. has noted that nobody else in her family thinks that she needs to lose weight.\n\nShe currently works as an accountant for a local corporation and has plans for career development. It needs to be said that her current condition may be an issue because the employer may view her as mentally unstable because of her eating behavior.\n\nThe patient has issues with sleep and frequently wakes up in the middle of the night. It is paramount to note that nightmares are quite common. She struggles to fall asleep quite often because she has paranoid thoughts about her weight. The patient has also noted that she often feels sleepy during the day, and it negatively affects her overall performance in the workplace.\n\nIt needs to be said that teaching is a significant issue in this case because the patient does not view opinions of others as important and does not trust health care providers. SSRI antidepressants may be used to make sure that the patient can maintain healthy weight for her height (Yager et al., 2014). It is a major problem that needs to be addressed because it is entirely possible that she is at risk of development of numerous severe conditions. Overall, she should be educated about the dangers that are associated with unhealthy eating, and complications that may occur.\n\nReferences\n\nGoroll, A., & Mulley, A. (2014).

      "The Reform Process in China’s Judiciary Essay\n\nThe judicial system in the Republic of China is part of the three-pronged government of the country, besides the executive and legislative arms. The system has its foundation on the civil law models of Germany and France, though with further integration of the local characteristics (Clarke, 2007). The system has undergone constant reforms and the development of adjudication in the past four decades. This essay analyzes these developments.\n\nDeng Xiaoping was an economic reformer. He was also a commercial crusader rooted for judicial reform in the Chinese Republic as a propeller for commercial growth. Despite never having held any political office in the nation, the leader had a strong leadership voice in the country. Many referred to him as the “paramount leader”.\n\nHe was also credited with propounding the theory of the soviet style of law, which was the socialist model. He advocated for a separation of the capitalist divisions of the country from the socialist ones, where given towns and regions would be under socialism, while others were governed under capitalism (Lubman, 2000). This was incorporated in the 1979 constitution that reaffirmed the place of socialism in the country by creating a framework for communities living together in the communistic spirit.\n\nIn this initial face of reform, however, the focus was laid on the revision of key legislation, such as the law on marriages, as well as laws covering criminal procedures, with the focus being on easing the litigation and procedural courses. These demands for reform were met as drafts were pulled off from dusty shelves and reviews conducted on them, thereby creating an improved and robust legal system.\n\nFurther, the 1970s period saw the creation of a new law known as The Organic Law of the People’s Courts , 1979, which provided a fresh organizational structure for the courts. It gave an elaborate procedure on the appointment of judges, which aimed to avert the then rampant cases of corruption in judicial appointments (Liebman, 2009).\n\nThis law was later revisited in 1995, creating some modifications and passing a new statute known as The Judges Law , 1995. This new statute introduced a more robust foundation for a professional and specialized judicial system that was separate from the other arms of government and had its system of salaries and remunerations. It was aimed at extinguishing the judiciary’s dependence on the executive (Liebman, 2009).\n\nIn the same year, new laws on public procurators and lawyers were passed, to reform the increasingly unpopular legal system of practice that was marred with corruption and a lot of irregularities (Lubman, 2000). These laws were further reviewed in 2001, creating a bar exam as an entry requirement into the legal profession that was aimed at boosting the credibility of the profession and further building proficiency in the profession.\n\nThe judicial system is, however, not free from challenges and setbacks in its path to total reform. The Chinese judiciary, for instance, has a wide distribution of 3,500 courts all over the country, with over 170,000 judges. While this may be seen as growth and development in the eyes of the public, it drains a large amount of money in form of salaries and other recurrent expenditures. This leaves no room for further development of the judiciary (Liebman, 2007).\n\nAdditionally, the comprehensive reform process that has been undertaken in the past 35 years in China has done little to curb what may be considered as the real issue in the problems that face the judiciary.\n\nThe greater challenge that is faced by the judiciary emanates from the other arms of government and not from the judiciary itself. Therefore, a plan to change the laws governing the judiciary or the legal fraternity does little in uprooting the real challenge. For instance, corruption still thrives in various government departments in China.\n\nAlthough the judiciary may do its level best to fight corruption in the judicial system, corruption still finds its way through other government arms. Thus, a broader approach to reforms should be taken by the nation in its entirety and not only the judiciary in seclusion (Liebman, 2007).\n\nReferences\n\nClarke, D. C. (2007).

      "Ethical Issues Behind Feeding People With GMOs Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Data and Facts\n 3. Actions and Outcomes\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nGenetic engineering is the amendment of the genetic composition of a particular organism or simply the adjustment of an organism’s transmissible matter in a bid to produce desirable characteristics (Starr, Evers, and Starr 190). It involves methods such as transgenesis, which employs lentiviruses’ capacity to relocate DNA or RNA materials to animal cells. Genetic engineers have been working to improve the quality and quantity of animal and plant production. The engineering involves itself more in prokaryotes, reproducing a variety of species using different strains in the hybridization process, and recombining various deoxyribonucleic acids (DNA) to produce quality species (Starr, Evers, and Starr 108).\n\nThere has been much controversy on the ethical issues that concern genetic engineering including questions of whether it is right to interfere with the creation and evolution process. Is it moral to change the genetic composition of an organism that cannot defend itself? Is it ethical to feed human beings with genetically modified organisms that are not clearly labeled? Is it moral to change the environment through genetic engineering? These ethical questions have triggered the minds of many people.\n\nHowever, the major ethical concern about genetic engineering is on Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) and their impacts on human beings’ health, spirituality, environment, decision-making, and ability to choose what one wants in life. The argument is that since genetically modified organisms have altered genetic composition, they are likely to affect the organisms that consume them negatively. Genetic engineering produces specific genetically modified organisms compared to the use of mutagenesis (King 9).\n\nThe science does not result in a defined genetic composition of the resultant species. The process depends on the choice of engineering that is done on the genes ranging from gene alteration, gene insertion, or gene removal. In the process of creating these steady changes, organisms are exposed to various treatments that end up creating unspecific alterations. For instance, the engineer may choose to insert the required gene artificially into a virus or else decide to use a tiny syringe to pop in the DNA into the nucleus of the target organism using a gene gun. The process alters the peace of the host, for instance, a rat, a sheep, or even a pig, as it has no choice of rejecting regardless of the cost thereof since the engineers only focus on the intended results. This case is not ethical to many opponents of genetic engineering.\n\nAnother is that it is unethical to alter the genetic content of an organism to form elements that no one knows their advantages and their predispositions. The alterations in the genetic makeup may act as predisposing factors to diseases and other environmental factors. The use of selective production in plants and the adoption of somaclonal (differences seen in vegetation that have been formed via tissue culture) in animal reproduction have also been opposed on ethical grounds (Crevel 385).\n\nProponents of genetic engineering and genetically modified foods, in particular, argue that it results in increased nutrients and quantity in plants, improves plants and animal resistance to pathogens, improves the growth speed and that it enables plants and animals to survive in adverse weather conditions. They have therefore been able to use genetic science in transgenic plants for example rice, cotton, corn, soybeans, and other plants. Both man and animals consume the plants’ yields. Therefore, genetic engineering has been useful in this case based on how it has resulted in high food production, which has in turn been a plus to the population.\n\nIn addition, the reduced utilization of pesticides has been associated with the increased health levels of people. Since genetically modified foods are made through transgenesis, opponents of genetic engineering regard feeding human beings and animals with such food as unethical. The argument is that transgenesis involves inserting transgenic genes from a species into another different one. Opponents are also against changing the genetic composition of an organism from the way it was created since scientists will not create another organism with original genetic composition. To them, the act is unethical interference with the creation.\n\nScientists have been accused of playing the role of God in modifying the creation whereas they cannot begin their creation (Deborah 30). Most of the crusaders of ethics in genetic engineering have referred to genetic engineers as people who are driven by their ego to care about individual benefits that they get from genetic engineering and not what society and the environment get (Epstein 37). Such genetic engineers disregard the ethical principle of professionalism that dictates that an action can only be done when there is a certainty that it will not harm an individual or society or when its degree of harm is known. In most cases, genetic engineers do not know the impact of the marker gene on society and the environment.\n\nFor instance, tomatoes that have been modified to take longer before ripening bear the marker gene, which might be left in the gut when they are consumed, and later leads the victim animal to build up resistance against antibiotics. It is therefore difficult for them to take precautionary measures. Scientists use cisgenic modifications in plants that are not easy to crossbreed (Deborah 33). When genetic engineers crossbreed organisms whose genes are very closely related, they are not required by law to go through the normal tight regulation procedures. To the opponents, this big loophole is unethical since it gives scientists the right to interfere with creation negatively.\n\nWhen researchers alter the genetic composition of any organism, they test its qualities before recommending it for food. Some regulators and mediators work independently to ensure that quality standards are adhered to during the whole process of genetic modification (Lassen et al. 267). After the adjustment, the product is taken through a series of tests by the regulatory authorities. It is only after such regulations that the engineers are allowed to send the product to the market.\n\nTo the proponents of genetic engineering, there is a proper inspection and regulations before the products are released to the market. After the regulatory authorities give a green light to the modification, mass production of the organism is done for the market. Various researchers such as Deborah have approved genetic engineering while others such as Lassen completely oppose it, or are reluctant to adopt it arguing that it is unethical. Based on this foundation, this paper explores the ethical issues in genetic engineering focusing specifically on the ethical issue of feeding human beings on Genetically Modified organisms (GMOs).\n\nData and Facts\n\nIn genetic engineering, several scientists assume the role of directing the creation towards what is good and bad according to the way it was created. Epstein argues that scientists act as if they were God to alter the evolution process of what has been in existence since creation (39). Whenever a scientist takes the role of altering the genetic elements of an organism, he or she assumes that engineering can work better relative to natural selection and even evolution in managing world habitation. Genetic engineering should improve the quality of life for human beings. However, the use of Genetically Modified Foods may negatively affect human beings.\n\nIt is through the consumption of these foods that various genetic components get into the human body. Crevel establishes that 45% of the corn being consumed in the United States currently is genetically tailored (385). Moreover, 85% of the soybeans being consumed in the United States are also a product of Genetic engineering. Since most Americans depend on corn as the staple food, they are therefore consuming huge percentages of genetically customized organisms every day.\n\nGenetic materials can be consumed in the form of viruses from genetically adapted organisms, bacteria, and vaccines. Epstein points out the fact that, when new genes get into the human body, they alter their genetic orientation (39). It is factual that genetically tailored foods contain a unique gene referred to scientifically as a marker gene. The marker gene accompanies the gene that carries a particular trait that the genetic engineers want to be manifested in an organism.\n\nScientists have confirmed that the gene is resistant to antibiotics. Although it is only an indicator of whether the required genetic traits have been inherited successfully, it makes the human and animal bodies resistant to antibiotics. The ethical question that is generated from this premise is whether it is ethical to feed human beings with a substance that may endanger their health especially when such Genetically Modified Organisms are not clearly labeled. Every genetically modified organism that successfully undergoes the process of gene transfer contains a marker gene. When humans and animals consume such an organism, the marker gene gets into their systems thus making their bodies resistant to antibiotics.\n\nIt is estimated that between 70% and 75% of industrially processed foods in most local markets are products of genetic engineering. Such a percentage is very high for the population to depend on without proper education. It means that most people consume genetically tailored elements without information. Out of ignorance, any consumer of GMOs who takes such foods when taking antibiotics the medicine is made useless by the marker gene.\n\nHis or her health situation is made worse to the point of dying from bacteria attack and multiplication. The person also becomes more prone to bacterial diseases, which are very common in the world. Is the outcome ethical? A person who consumes these tailored foods for a long duration will develop resistance to antibacterial medications. Consequently, when such a person ails, no antibacterial medicine will help treat his or her illnesses. People have died with others becoming sicker by consuming foods that they do not know whether they have the marker gene or not. Such action is unethical and a threat to human life.\n\nLassen et al. observe that genetically modified foods have been used deceptively to meet marketing ends (263). Genetic engineering has made people consume vegetables and fruits with lower nutritional levels without information. A good example is what happens when genetic engineers adjust vegetables and fruits by inserting a certain gene onto them to make them live last without decaying. When shopping, consumers of such vegetables are not able to distinguish whether the vegetables have been on the shelves for many days, or they are fresh. As vegetables and fruits stay on the shelves, their nutritional value changes.\n\nLassen et al. affirm that these customized foods have certain genes inserted on them to make them appear bigger, have better colors, and or look attractive (263). Such artificial qualities of GMOs deceive shoppers to purchase the items without proper knowledge. The move is unethical because it may negatively affect patients who have had medical recommendations on the nutrients that they should take. The deceiving nutritional value of GMOs may just weaken their health. It is unethical to deceive people by color and appearance. Epstein cautions that genetically modified foods carry more toxins than naturally grown food (39).\n\nThe resistance of these foods to some pathogens may be a weakness to allow for attacks by other pathogens. Levels of toxins in GMOs also increase due to reactions of the natural genetic composition of the organism with that of the inserted gene. What is the case for people who are allergic to certain food materials? What happens to them when they consume foodstuffs containing food elements to which they are allergic?\n\nSome people are allergic to protein, which means that they are negatively affected by the consumption of protein elements (Starr, Evers, and Starr 33). However, Rifkin observes that, when genetic engineers inject protein genes into certain plants to improve certain qualities, they do not relay such information to consumers (22). A consumer may eat certain vegetables containing milk genes without information. Such a person’s health is negatively affected by the protein element. Interfering with someone’s health without any consent is unethical. A person who is aware of his or her health condition avoiding certain foods may consume GMOs containing the same allergic substance without consent.\n\nIt is also unethical to make consumers buy products made out of Genetic science even when they are not for it. Genetically modified materials are sold without proper labels in various shopping outlets. Customers always buy the products without information on their genetic composition. Such a move is unethical. Rifkin is for the idea that GMOs may reach humans in the form of food without their approval (22). Living things are very volatile when they are let into the environment.\n\nHence, it becomes almost impossible to recall them back. Therefore, scientists lose control of genetically modified materials that they release to the environment hence posing adverse effects in generations to come since genetic materials are transferable across generations. When such genes are transferred in the form of GMOs, they reach various generations without their knowledge of the genetic composition of the organisms they consume. Such acts are unethical.\n\nScientists use bromoxynil chemicals and glyphosate to make genetically modified plants pest-resistant. These elements have been associated with carcinomas and development retardation in fetuses. Use of Bovine Growth Hormone to make cows produce more milk has also been associated with cancer. The hormone(r BGH) makes cows produce milk with IGF-1, which causes human cancer. It is therefore unethical to feed humans with milk containing IGF-1 without their consent.\n\nIt is also immoral to inject animal genes into plants and use the resultant organisms to feed vegetarians without their consent. Such a person consumes protein contents without his or her information. It is also unscrupulous to feed a Muslim who does not consume pig meat with vegetables whose genetic composition has been altered by injecting them with pig genes. Such an action goes against the ethics and spirituality of the consumer. All GMOs ought to be labeled.\n\nActions and Outcomes\n\nFrom the above scientific facts and discussion, it is arguable that genetically modified foods have various unethical results. It is, therefore, necessary that various steps be carried out to avoid the negative impact of such unethical moves from influencing human life negatively. Genetically Modified Organisms should be clearly labeled to provide the necessary information to consumers. It will make those opposed to genetic engineering avoid consuming such foods against their ethics.\n\nMaking those opposed to genetic engineering consume GMOs is unethical. Genetic engineers should therefore come out openly and brand products of genetic engineering. When animal genes are injected into plants, scientists should indicate the genetic composition of the final products. The engineers should take into consideration the utilitarian principle. All actions on genetically modified organisms should be good for all human beings.\n\nScientists should be guided by morality to make the world better. Effects of genetic engineering are not known meant that genetic engineers play games with human life. Scientists should therefore be guided by utilitarianism principles. No one should change the genetic composition of certain human foods without knowing the exact composition of the product (Deborah 30). This paper also recommends that proper testing, production guidelines, assessments, and reporting procedures be put in place to ensure that factual information that goes to genetic engineering is equally reported. Errors that have been made by scientists in the past shall then be avoided.\n\nWith such measures in place, people shall have the information required when using genetically tailored organisms. Finally, scientists should put in place proper civic education procedures to educate people about genetic engineering, genetically customized organisms, and their impact on their health. Hence, they are not prepared for the ramifications of consuming GMOs.\n\nEpstein asserts that civic health education should also explain to people the consequence of the marker gene that is transferred together with the genetic material that is injected into the organism during the genetic engineering process (32). The fact that the gene is resistant to most antibiotics and that it transfers the same resistance to the defense mechanism of the consumer should also be made known by every likely consumer.\n\nSuch efforts will be of great importance to people who are taking antibiotics and to those who are likely to have similar medical recommendations. The findings of this paper reveal that the nutritional value of various foods that are made of genetically customized organisms should be clearly labeled especially when such foods are sold. Such a step is necessary to ensure that consumers have information concerning the nutritional value of what they consume.\n\nIt is worth noting that such genetically modified foods are not likely to have a nutritional value similar to that of the natural organism. Most of them have a lower nutritional value compared with natural organisms. People should also be informed about the level of toxins in certain GMOs. Governments of various countries must defend their citizens from any health hazards. They should therefore investigate various processes of developing GMOs and analyze the product. They should ban or put tight regulations for genetically modified organisms whose content is not well labeled.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCrevel, Reinout. “Allergenicity of Refined Vegetable Oils.” Food Chem Toxicol 38.4(2000): 385-93.

      "Obesity Among Children in San Diego, California Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Demographic data\n 3. Healthcare costs\n 4. Health care-related challenges\n 5. Wellness program\n 6. Service and marketing needs\n 7. Addressing the challenge\n 8. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nObesity is a chronic condition that is increasing rapidly in children. Obese children have body weights that surpass the level that is considered healthy for their age and height. In the recent past, the number of obese children has increased rapidly in major cities. This paper will give a demographic analysis of obese children in San Diego, California. Further, the paper will give an outlay of the healthcare costs, healthcare challenges, healthcare services, and wellness programs about the chronic condition.\n\nDemographic data\n\nSan Diego County has a population of more than 3 million people from different ethnic groups. The physically unfit residents of San Diego County have different family statuses and different educational levels. Of the population, about 50% of the adults are either overweight or obese, whereas, 30% of the 5th, 7th, and 9th-grade children are obese. The students’ obesity statistics vary from one race to another, where, the Asians and White children are considered to have better fitness standards than children from the other races. About 41% of the whites and 40% of the Asian children meet the fitness standards. On the other hand, only 23.2% of the Latino’s children meet the heath fitness standards, and about 21.8% of the Hispanic’s children aged between five and nineteen years are obese (Serpas, Brandstein, McKennett, & Hillidge, 2013). From a critical view, it is evident that a great percentage of the non-white residents of San Diego are unemployed, and thus they have low incomes. The non-white parents with substandard education offer their children reckless lifestyles that increase their chances of becoming obese.\n\nHealthcare costs\n\nWhenever children become obese at their tender ages, the burden is shared out with the taxpayers. Heart diseases, stroke, type II diabetes, and lung diseases are some of the diseases associated with obesity. Every year, the San Diego County government spends about 4 billion dollars of taxpayer money to treat chronic diseases that are associated with diabetes in children (Serpas et al., 2013). The outpatient visit expenditures, prescription drug expenditures, and emergency room expenditures are examples of additional healthcare costs for obese children, which are $320 higher than the expenditures on normal weighted children for every hospital visit. Children are very fragile to handle, and health care service providers have difficulties dealing with obese children. Health care institutions in San Diego will have to establish additional outpatient and emergency rooms for children with chronic diseases associated with diabetes. The pediatricians, nurses, and other healthcare service providers working in the pediatrics section would have to work for extra hours to meet the demand of the rising number of children with chronic conditions associated with obesity. Generally, the health care costs and services will rise considerably with a rise in the number of obese children.\n\nHealth care-related challenges\n\nAs stated before, obesity increases the probability of having lifestyle diseases like diabetes, stroke, and high blood pressure. Of course, healthcare costs and the number of prescriptions drug would increase considerably, and these are the two major healthcare-related challenges in children. It would be more costly to maintain obese children than children who are physically fit. Essentially, children who are obese during their early years of life (6-19 years) undergo various additional healthcare costs as compared to normal or underweight children. Outpatient health care costs would be about $194; the prescription drugs would cost approximately $114, while the emergency room expenditures would be around $12 for every hospital visit (Finkelstein, Fiebelkorn, & Wang, 2003). The healthcare institutions in San Diego would have to spend about $14.1 billion per annum to treat chronic diseases associated with diabetes in children. In addition to the care given at the hospitals, the health care providers would have to deliver home medical care for the fatally ill children.\n\nWellness program\n\nSan Diego County executives noticed the adverse consequences of the chronic obesity condition that was interfering with the San Diegans’ children. They set out to offer services that would help the county to reduce the health care expenses related to obesity. The “Live Well San Diego” wellness program is a great example of a wellness program that guided the San Diegan children into living healthy, safe, and thriving lifestyles. Healthcare providers in San Diego were obligated to build better service delivery systems. The main objective of the health care service was to support positive health care choices and change of lifestyles. The government obliged the Health and Human Service Agency (HHSA) of San Diego aimed to engage children of different age groups in adopting an active lifestyle for ten years. From the beginning of the year 2010, all government entities and businesses were to work together to create “Accountable Care Communities” that would breed healthy children to serve the succeeding generation. Research done by the University of California in 2012 revealed that San Diego County had reduced obesity in children by 3.7%. Essentially, that was the largest reduction ever reported in Southern California. The “Live Well San Diego” wellness program will play a great role in reducing healthcare costs. At a reduced rate of 3.7% every two years, San Diego County government will have reduced its expenses on obese children to about $11.49 billion by the end of the 10th year.\n\nService and marketing needs\n\nFrom the demographic data, it is evident that a given class of individuals is exposing their children to reckless lifestyles that endanger their lives. The best approach to reach the intended audience is to broadcast health and wellness education through various media outlets. The Latinos and the Hispanic parents should be educated on the various approaches to ensure that their children live healthy lifestyles. Children’s aerobic demonstrations should be aired on specific days when children are likely to watch the television. Lastly, the teachers that handle children aged between 5-17 years should be encouraged to emphasize physical education lessons.\n\nAddressing the challenge\n\nAs evident from the discussions, every individual in San Diego County society is affected by the obesity tragedy in children. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the entire community to address the issue. It is recommendable that the Nutrition in Healthcare Leadership Team (NHLT) promotes healthcare wellness across the county. NHLT comprises wellness professionals who address the obesity epidemic in children, and currently, every San Diegan is aware of the obesity epidemic. Parents and the teachers who are the core people with more contact time with the children than anybody else ought to ensure that the children are involved in vigorous activities that facilitate their healthy lifestyles. Moreover, children ought to learn how to take responsibility for their lives (Barlow, 2007). Finally, the hospital systems and the community should make it their obligation to advocate for the provision of healthy meals in all food joints in San Diego.\n\nReferences\n\nBarlow, S.E. (2007).

      "Virtual Temporal Bone Surgery Software System Essay\n\nSoftware Process & Management\n\nSoftware Management Risk Measurement\n\nThe challenging factor for the IT experts is to acquire the updated information and utilize them for the specific purpose, which makes people life more comfortable and convenient solution. Software design for the human lifecycle is the basic requirement of this era. Many software engineers proposed the lifesaving software that deal in tumour surgery and improve the performance of the surgeon during operations.\n\nThere are several ideas and management discussions are in process for finding the better solution of the critical problem in human body as well as tackle such sensitive case via practicing the virtual operations. In general practices, universities graduates pay their worthy attention towards the software development process for the human lifecycle which is basic requirement of today’s surgeons. The proposed model of Software Development Lifecycle is present by the software engineering department students in University of Melbourne.\n\nThe effort of particular team by named “Aura” is suggest the plan in front of management which is clearly specify the modern technique for tackle the temporal bone diseases by surgeons. Aura’s team represents the virtual surgery project with its distinguished features and characteristics by creating a link between the software experts and surgeons. The conceptual theme of this project is to facilitate the medical experts with innovative technology which helps to deal with the serious patients of skull injury / cancer. In the proposed system of Aura’s team, there are a lot of risk factors are involves.\n\nThe key feature of Virtual surgery project is base on the information system which is available in form of explicit knowledge, but this software can’t deal with the critical nature of problems with support of limited information. The tacit / expert’s knowledge having their significant impact on virtual system. The presence of expert creates the wisdom approach on the bases of their valued knowledge and experience. After implement the virtual technology during surgery, nobody can denied the impact of realism.\n\nIt have own importance for human lifecycle, minimize the risk and desired results produced is the most demanding situation by the patient from surgeon rather from virtual surgery technique, which proposed by the Aura’s team. By adding new technology can be less effective for generating the expected results in the field of medical. Although, this project is expensive in sense of bearing the fee of experts from two different fields i.e. medical and software engineering.\n\nThe availability of experts is most crucial factor which can be the cause of failure, because many experts are engage in their routines job and focus towards the existing systems of operations. Medical experts give less attention towards the new technological approach because they are symbols of saving life rather put their patients into more critical situation after practicing the virtual surgery system.\n\nAura’s team mention under Software Project Management Plan during march (2010) that virtual software system is provide the support to medical examiner for improving their skills but the surgeon opinion is clearly reflect in opposite direction. The skill development process is relied on knowledge and insight which gain by an individual during his/her work performance via facing the turbulence situation. The unbalanced situation can be raised for the team to engage all the experts with their time commitment and contribution towards virtual surgery system via focusing decentralization approach. While this concept work in an artificial environment but in real existence biasness of knowledge intellect and conflict among the experts is create the barrier for successful implementation of virtual surgery system by Team Aura.\n\nThere are several complication involve in the system for the end user and make them reluctant to practice this innovative technology in routine work. A materialize sense of end user shows less confidence for using system in appropriate way, because human brain are less efficient to memories the thins / operations after single or twice a time teaching. It will prefer continuous process of learning for a longer period which is not cost effective approach by Team Aura.\n\nCharacteristics, Features & Requirements\n\nAs discussed earlier the primary aim of the software system is to enable the surgeons to virtualize the temporary bone surgery in an effective manner. The drilling process and the surgery surroundings with structure of the bone are shown in the system, which creates the helpful environment for the surgeons to enhance the possible of a successfully bone surgery.\n\nThe characteristics includes in this software system that enables the user to interact with the surgical surroundings with special features of sound and zooming, by utilizing these special focused features towards the temporal bone surgery, the surgeons successfully implement and execute a typical temporal bone surgery. To remove the bone from the skull, a drilling tool consists of a burr used. The burr is driven by electric motor.\n\nBy the proper use of different types of burr, the surgery can be customized as to remove fine or small parts of bone or to remove larger piece of bones. As far as practice concerns, this system can partially fulfil the surgeons to practice and enhance their abilities in a familiar and adjustable situation and such a cost effective and safe way to learn the basic methods of the surgical process. This software consists of a package for hearing and balance disorders which are the advanced surgical method applied in temporal bone surgery.\n\nThis software requires the more complicated tests to generate the finer results. A 3D model concerted CT scan results, which interactive functional access to rotational view of the model. It is a very typical process to get the actual 3D model from the slices of CT scans. The perfect interaction of the 3D model with the software system is another critical matter, which can easily be viewed and rotated as per the environmental situation.\n\nThe next step required the specific burr to use in surgical process. The measurement of the result oriented burr is very difficult and complicated task to perform by an inexperienced student or novice users, who are non familiar to temporal bone surgery. To select the required texture of burr, specific size, sufficient torque or speed and adequate pressure, a crucial examination required. Mostly student could not perform well at this step and fails to successfully simulate the software system. The clear view can be seen by the zoom view of the 3D model produced by CT scan, which are very important to practice the temporal bone surgery.\n\nIt is necessary that the 3D model of CT scan is structured to rotate and zoomed view by 3000% (30x). Furthermore, the sound and voice system also in a good condition as sound is very helpful in surgical process. In this step the software system of virtual temporal bone surgery requires a significant examination of the situation and makes a proper plan to execute the bone surgery.\n\nAt the earlier stages and first sight, the software system of virtual temporal bone surgery, seemed to be a great achievement of medicinal and surgical field. But in later phase different complications pointing out towards the difficulties and negative measures of the software system. Virtual temporal bone surgery still required more research and development work with prototype modelling, which focusing towards the analytical and behavioural sciences to implement and carry out the more cost effective and simpler way for the novice students and inexperienced staff to learn the basic techniques and successfully achieve the desired objectives.\n\nFurthermore, spotlighting towards the theoretical models involved in temporal bone surgery. These theoretical models can easily be generated and students cannot find any difficulty and complication to examine the methods of temporal bone surgery.\n\nTo examine the pretesting approach in software development lifecycle, this technology should be offer in a portable condition, to examine the patients of different regions and different places of the world. There should be no boundaries, which bound the technology to some specific regions of the world, and couldn’t successfully implement in the other affected countries. The software system described above is a very long term software development lifecycle, which crease more hard to adapt and apply the system in an effective manner. Risk management and accuracy of the surgery is also an important matter. By the implementation of the software system, accuracy is doubtful as the conversion of CT scan into 3D model is a complicated task and could not be properly done by mostly students and inexperience teaching staff.\n\nSurgeon preferences are play a vital role for the execution of new software application. It must correlate with the existing system and slight change in technology is welcome by the end user easily. Accessibility and reliability is based on the real experience rather then simulation practices meanwhile building a surgeon confidence comes under first priority. The ultimate concern of this innovative technology is to generate the business and provide the valued services to the affected person from diseases. Pre-testing and evaluation of virtual system is based on the results and response form patients and surgeons.\n\nIt is concluded that virtual temporal bone surgery software system required more research and prototype in their software development lifecycle to produce the highly successful and cost effective solutions with accurate results in the surgical process, which makes it a powerful and result oriented system to learn and execute the actual temporal bone surgery.\n\nReferences\n\nTeam Aura, (2010), “Software Project Management Plan”, Virtual Surgery, Revision: 1.42, 1.1.1 Heading: Project Description no. 1.1.1, p. 01.\n",
      "Ecstasy Production and Its Use Among Teens Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper is designed to provide some significant information about an abusive street drug is known as ecstasy among its users. The information given here is about the therapeutic and recreational use of the drug, its adverse effects, and implemented laws against the use and possession of the drug. The whole paper is written in simpler words to make it easier to understand by the people who belong to fields other than health sciences. The point which is specially discussed here is; the use of ecstasy and its use among teens. The issue of the use of ecstasy and other street drugs is thoroughly discussed with solid reasons to give a complete perception of the issue.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe drug 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine(MDMA); popularly known as ecstasy is becoming popular among the astray youth for its mood altering effect. The drug MDMA was first produced by Merk (a German pharmaceutical company) in 1912, initially it was produced for therapeutic purposes but after discovering its heroin, cocaine, and other drug mimicking effects, it was made banned in all parts of the country. The reason for its popularity is its mimic effect of generally used drug like heroin and others, for this image effect of the drug, it is referred as designer drug.\n\nMode of Action of the drug:\n\nMore often, ecstasy is found in the form of pills, it starts affecting right after 20 minutes of the drug administration; first it affects the brain by transmitting serotonin; a neurotransmitter which carries the signal from one nerve cell to the other. Due to the rise in serotonin level in the blood the user of the drug feels changes in mood and feelings forwith interacting with people. The effects of the drug get more adverse sometime when after the administration of the drug; the user starts feeling nausea with blurred vision, anxiety, high perspiration, cognitive disorders, and irregular palpitation which leads the user towards agitation.\n\nTherapeutic use of the drug\n\nInitially, ecstasy gained fame as a psychotherapeutic drug anan not as a abusive drug, it was more popular as a therapeutic during 197 but if look back in the early period of the drug ,we will enjoy an interesting fact about the drug is; the drug was first used as an appetite suppresser among the troops of Germany. This smallest fact provides us the ground to become hopeful about the usefulness of MDMA. Apart from its initial beneficial use this drug produces other mimic effects to provide peace of mind to the patients it administered to. Several relation had good results of this anti depressant drug thus, this drug helped in the creating a feeling of self esteem, love and trust among the psychologically disturbed patients for their friends, family and the love ones. It is on record that that within the span of eight years (1977 to 1985) the drug was administered to half million patients. Besides the use of this drug in the field psychopathology, it was also used as an analgesic like another drug from the same category called morphine by suppressing the feeling of pain in terminal cancers. After a long term ban on the drug’s production and sell; In 1994 Federal drug. This research will be made for studying effects of the drug on brain chemistry and the solution to suppress the adverse effects of the drug on brain will be found and it will also be tested for the treatment of several psychological disorders like schizophrenia and traumatic conditions (Elk, p. 4).\n\nAdverse effects of the Drug\n\nThe use of ecstasy could be fatal due to its hyperthermic effect, each year about 50 deaths occurs due the use of ecstasy leading toward hyperthermia. High water intake by the ecstasy user to reduce the heating sensation; forms body fluid imbalance which is quite dangerous for life.\n\n“Scientists debate whether ecstasy causes permanent damage to nerve cells in the brain. Studies in rats and other animals document damage to the nerve structures that produce and process serotonin. In humans, some brain scans of frequent ecstasy users show permanent damage to serotonin pathways. Furthermore, tests in humans indicate that the drug may negatively affect memory, learning, and other mental processes”.\n\nThe illegally sold pills of ecstasy by the unauthorized labs; most of the times contain other illegal compounds such as cocaine and others which leads drastic rise in serotonin level. The long term ecstasy effects can not be controlled with out calculating the ingredients of the pill.\n\nThe aim of the production of MDMA was therapeutic; it can be useful in the field of pathopsychology if administered in low and infrequent dosage. Another plus sign of the drug is that, it is not produce physical addiction like other drugs like cocaine and heroine.It can also be used for the treatment of anxiety due to the experiencing of some traumatic event like earthquakes, hurricanes and floods (Brown, p. 1).\n\nAccording to a survey; conducted by The National Institute of Drug Abuse in 2007; the use of ecstasy was monitored among the students of 8 th grade, 10th grade and 12th grade. They categorized these students according to the span of drug use. The result showed astonishing findings and revealed that 2.3 percent of grade 8 student, 5.2 percent of grade 10 and 6.5 percent of grade 12 students are life time users of ecstasy while other findings says that 1.5 students of grade 8 started to use ecstasy in 2006 while this percentage for the students of grade 10 and 12 is 3.5 and 4.5 respectively. The percentage of the students of grade 8, who started to use the drug just last month prior to this survey is; 0.6 while among the students of grade 10; it was 1.2 and for grade 12 students; its 1.6.\n\nAnother research organized by the same department says that in 2006 about 860,000 Americans used ecstasy first time in their lives which is a gradual increase from the last year survey report. Among the beginners of using the drug 70.1 percent were in their teens; mostly 18 years old.\n\nRise of the Illegal use of the drug\n\nAll the drugs included in this category are prohibited by law but these drugs are still being produced secretly in many parts of the world. Another reason for its common use is its low price as compare with the other drugs with same effects. Drug dealers started producing this drug illegally in hide out laboratories after the ban implemented on the drug by the US government. The street name ecstasy was given to this drug for its mind relaxing effect; by the drug dealers. MDMA gained popularity among youth during late 80’s after the discovery of psychoactive effects of the dug in 1976 and after the rise of Drug culture which made the drug most popular drug of youth of night clubs and parties. In the consecutive years the drug fixed its root in Europe and other parts of the world along with the invasion of drug culture (Morgan, p. 1).\n\nRaven Culture\n\nDuring the end of 80’s the youth of America started to suffer from a drastic cultural transition, they started to change their life styles and adopted certain ways to get rid of the broken family systems that was rising in American society during that era. Late night parties and excess of younger teens into the night clubs opened the gates of many social crimes and malevolent activities for the teens; open use of all kind of drugs become common in these late night parties of the teens which resulted into illegal sexual relations and aggression and intolerance among the teens. This whole new trend of absurd activities was named as raven culture or hippie culture. This culture had not only sabotaged the American youth but it also started to spin the web around the countries with similar family systems. The raven culture is called the nursing home of the ecstasy; where it was nurtured and become full grown up evil for the entire world.\n\nUse of Ecstasy among Teens\n\nAccording to a research published in the journal of Adolescent Health, 2002; the use of ecstasy among the teens was 2.8 to 4.7 percent during the period of two consecutive years that is 97 to 99, this increase of users of teen ecstasy users is 6 percent more from the previously recorded figures. The students of all categories were chosen as a subject of the study. it included the students from 12 to 20 years of age.\n\nMost of the ecstasy users were found already addict of marijuana, drinking and smoking, among them many were found; having sexual relationship with many partners. These kids were kind of party animals.they like to spend more time out of their homes away from the parental restrictions. Religion has no place in their lives. These habits of becoming more socialize increased the interaction of these students with wrong people and they were hunted by the lustrous network of the drug mafia. Another observation was made by the researchers about these kids was their academic performance. They noticed that the students using ecstasy have no effect on their academic performances. Their academic participation and progression was found completely satisfactory. The use of ecstasy is increasing day by day due to the tendency of these people to be attracted towards the lustrous and daring things; no matter how dangerous they could be for them. Violent behavior has been observed among the teens due to the adverse effects of the drug and they are involving in more social crimes. It is also reported that about 8 deaths occur every year due the use of ecstasy (SAE, p. 1).\n\nLaws and Acts against Ecstasy Dealing\n\nMDMA is a white powder; used in the form of pills, injection, sniffing powder and rarely in the form of suppositories. The sentence for ecstasy possession is different ; according to amount of drug carried but selling more than 200gm of the drug can be sentenced 5 five years of prison or more. The sentence can be varied with the possession or sell of the drug. In most of the developed countries of the world like china, England, Australia as well as united states; ecstasy is banned. The United States Sentencing Commission has gathered important information by conducting a thorough investigation on the transportation of the drug to explain a proper penalty. The Commission discovered the fact that the pills are so small that they could be carried in a larger amount by using different deceptive techniques. These pills can be transported by strapping them on the body or by making invisible recesses in the luggage; nearly about 10,000 to 50,000 pills can be transported in this way. Illegal import and export of this drug is continued by using several methods by the drug dealers (USSC, p. 16).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe purpose of producing the drug was human friendly but some how the discovery of its abusive use inflected its purpose and it started to be used as street drug. The drug mafia is controlling the illegal production of ecstasy in substandard laboratories with the strong net work of its export within the country and abroad. Laws have been implemented to control this drug trafficking and consumption in the country even than the culprits are still at large. MDMA has once again got approval of being research for the good purpose.\n\nThe students of all levels; still in their teens are the primary target for the drug sale, general awareness about the adverse effect of the drug should be built among the teens to persuade them to stop the use of any such drug. Strict parental control and guidance can also be helpful for them. No matter what are the findings and what are the conclusions the thing to be done is to save our youth from the tentacles of drug mafia and drug culture\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Entrepreneurial Process: Marketing Plan Term Paper\n\nThis document provides a marketing plan for a chain of Retail Fast Food Restaurants spread across the major cities and it is suburban areas in India. The business proposes to set up a chain of fast food restaurants to provide anytime light meals including breakfast, lunch and dinner at a moderately low price catering primarily to the middle-income segment of the country. It is proposed to be operational by May 2010 at six locations across India, which include Delhi, Mumbai, Chennai, Kolkata, Bangalore, and Pune. Each centre would have at least two outlets- one in the city proper and the other just on the outskirts of the city, preferably on the highways.\n\nIndia is chosen for such an operation because it is an emerging economy and the retail fast food industry is highly underutilized in the country. The major cities of India have a predominantly middle income and low-income population. The food chains already present in the country are exorbitantly priced. Thus, it leaves a huge opening in the market. Moreover, there is very little or practically no competition from nationalized brands. The increasing desire of the youth to be attached to a nationwide brand name propels the probability of success of this plan. (Shane et al. 2004).\n\nThe marketing strategy will design in a manner that will be able to draw in more of the young customers. The form of the business would be a retailer-operated, consumer-controlled business. All the products would be attached to a single brand name called the “Hunger Crunch” which increases the consistency of the business. The promotional strategy would primarily focus on national morals and local tastes mixing the values attached to a nationwide brand name. To maximize the reach to the consumer base multiple media forms will be adopted to market the products. To increase the ease of accessibility of the products in addition to outlet sales the concept of doorstep delivery would also be introduced within the range of 10 kilometers free of delivery charges and with a low delivery cost above the specified range.\n\nThe business aims to cater to all fractions of the consumer base. The investment channels have been decided up on and the partners have agreed to dedicate a major sum of investments to marketing expenses. As the investments would be made in U.S. Dollars, the exchange rate between USD and Rupees, the national currency, would be a major advantage. At present, a total annual marketing budget has been set at $500000. This provides for a huge sum as considered in Rupees. This would be easily manageable, as most of the transactions would take place in the local currency. (Anderson & Wen-yeh 2006).\n\nThe business aims at providing high quality products at low prices catering to a huge consumer base capitalizing on the major openings in the market. The business would be set up across all the major cities in the country thus allowing the possibility of maximizing benefits. The introductory prices will be kept extremely low to attract a large number of customers. Thus for the first year the pressure of immediate sales will not be applied heavily. The first year sales target is set at $405000 for nationwide sales provided by 12 outlets spread across six cities. The business aims to instill the sense of a national brand into the minds of the customer. The primary fast food chains operating in Indian markets are international brands such as McDonald’s, KFC and Subway. The products of these brands are exorbitantly priced and they primarily cater to the premium class and to some extent the higher middle-income group. Due to reasonable pricing and incorporating local tastes, the business will be able to capture mass as well as the middle sect of the consumer base. Apart from that, proper promotion would build a strong brand value, which would attract the youth from the premium class as well.\n\nCustomer Analysis\n\nThe business aims at primarily targeting young customers whose age ranges from 15 years to 35 years. They are usually college going youth and young working professionals. Moreover, this segment consists of young parents with kids aged from five to 10 years who like to frequent fast food outlets. The rationale for choosing such a customer base comes from an in depth culture study of major cities across India. It has been found that most of the young people in the cities are constantly on the go and prefer to have light meals during working hours. They want their food to be easily accessible at a moderately low price. They prefer to save time on food breaks but at the same time stress on quality food habits. People above the age of 40 generally prefer home cooked food.\n\nThus, they would not be included in the primary customer base.\n\nTo catch the attention of the youth major forms of marketing activities would include surveys conducted at colleges and various professional companies, getting their opinion about the brand. Promotional activities would include efforts to inform them about the brand on a much more personal level. Sponsoring road shows, offering introductory benefits and ensuring that the distribution channels reach the target customer base efficiently could help in gaining the initial edge over market competitors. Multiple media forms particularly Television, Radio and the Internet would be extensively utilized for promotional initiatives. Efficient feedback networks also could be designed to gain an understanding of customer perspectives in order to adapt the business to customer needs. (Slater & Olson 2001).\n\nAnalysis of the customer culture in India reveals that they possess ideologies rooted in strong national sentiments along with preferences for local tastes. To some extent, the youth consumer base may be considered to exhibit a conservative attitude. This challenge needs to be utilized in a proper way and should be taken into consideration while designing promotional initiatives.\n\nAnother important reason for targeting the youth segment is that they form 41.05% of the total population of India and this imminent predominance in certain to last until 2050 according to various surveys. The majority of the young population in the cities economically belongs to the middle-income group or the lower-middle income sect. Thus, this segment forms the primary target consumer base.\n\nCompetitor Analysis\n\nThe top three competitors for Indian markets have been identified as KFC, McDonald’s, and Subway. All three brands are established international food chains with a considerable presence in the Indian markets.\n\nKentucky Fried Chicken popularly known as KFC started its Indian operations in India in 1995. From then onwards it has gained immense popularity across all city populations. It is one of the most popular brands under which Yum Restaurants International (YRI). It has more than 28 outlets spread allover the nation. The most important strength is its quality management efforts and strategic collaborators. It has had its own share of controversies attached to it but it has overcome those difficulties through efficient marketing strategies. However, it does not cater to the local tastes largely. It is exorbitantly priced too. It primarily focuses on chicken products and lacks quality products for the vegetarian populations. These deficiencies can be taken care of and should be utilized for the success of this business. (Eng, 2007).\n\nMacDonald’s is one of the most easily internationally recognizable brands, which started its operation way back in 1996 in India. It has gained a strong foothold in India with 160 outlets spread over the country. It is one of the leading fast food chains in the country and follows a franchise model operation. It also has strategic partnerships with a few beverage providers. Its major strength is ease of accessibility of products in the cities in which operates. It also caters to the vegetarian section of the population with a special vegetarian product line. However, the chain is not equally distributed all over the country. The brand has extensive presence in some big cities but other cities are neglected. Although, in order to attract new customers and increase its customer base it has introduced initiatives such as “Happy Price Menu”, it is too highly priced for normal products.\n\nSubway restaurants are also an international sandwich franchise, which started its operation in India in December 2001. It has more than 80 outlets spread across the country primarily serving various kinds of sandwiches. Its major strength is its quality of products and service. However, this brand does not cater to the mass segment and primarily focuses on the multiplex crowd. (Shervani & Frazier 2007).\n\nIn addition, there would be stiff competition from local fast food shops and roadside fast food outlets, which are quite naturally occurring and have immense popularity among the mass.\n\nCompany Analysis\n\nThe business is set to operate under a single brand name called “Hunger Crunch” all across India. After analyzing the customer needs, demands, attitudes and trends it has been observed that the customers vary in some respects but are similar in numerous facets. They require good quality products at an affordable price. They prefer to enjoy their meals and family outings incorporate a major role for food. Awareness about health in the target population is also a factor, which needs to be considered when creating a brand image for the business. India is a country with diverse cultures and food habits. Some religions practiced in India also restrict the consumption of non-vegetarian food. It also has been evaluated that for regular food consumption customers generally stick to local tastes but are also liberal at times towards different preparations. Thus, the brand wants to project an image, which utilizes the national sentiments, which unites the nation and instills a sense that this is a brand, which is closer to the home and to the heart. (Pressey & Selassie 2007).\n\nPromotional activities would be designed to create such a brand image and the reach to the customers would be on a much more personal level. Marketing initiatives would be carefully designed to meet the requirement and demands of the customer.\n\nCommunity/Climate Analysis\n\nApart from competitors, there are different aspects of the community, which need special attention for smooth operations of the business. First proper licensing issues must be sorted out from legal organizations. Adequate suppliers must be identified and ethical considerations must be made. Poultry suppliers and animal rearing facilities from which raw materials would be purchased should be meeting all required norms. A healthy relationship must be fostered with society by taking charitable initiatives for the betterment of society. Supplier channels must be properly screened and collaborators should be identified. Major reputed beverage suppliers could be approached for collaborations in order to provide a complete food experience to the customers.\n\nOverall, the message that the business meets all legal and ethical standards must be conveyed to the society to keep away from controversies faced by other similar brands in the market. (Katsikeas & Theodosiou 2006).\n\nMarketing Mix\n\nProduct\n\nThe product line offered by the business will offer huge variety in order to cater to the different tastes of each segment of the diversely cultured population of the target consumer base. It has been identified that the average Indian youth prefers to stick to local tastes on a daily basis but also visits fast food restaurants for a change of taste. Thus to cater to the daily needs as well as the change of taste needs of the customer a range of delicacies from all over the country would be included in the product line. Innovative chefs would be hired to incorporate new and original recipes into the menu list. Further, the taste trends created by competitors such as MacDonald’s, KFC, Subway etc will also be taken care of and internationalized snacks like burgers, sandwiches etc would also provide to the customer.\n\nThe product lines would be designed so that it has something in it for every one. It would cater separately to the needs of both the vegetarian as well as non-vegetarian customers. A special low-fat category would be introduced for the health conscious customer. However, all products would be rich in nutrition as well as taste. (Pressey & Selassie 2007).\n\nPrice\n\nThe pricing strategy adopted initially would specifically keep the economic conditions of the common person in mind. Introductory discounts, benefits and offers would be initiated on a wide range of products. The general pricing of products would be much less than the primary competitors to break into the market successfully and to draw customers.\n\nThe profit margins are not kept too high, as it would result in increased prices. However, no compromise on quality would be made. The products would be priced at appropriate costs with practically very little gains. Packages would be designed according to the tastes of the customer and substantial discounts would be offered on packages.\n\nA dual pricing strategy may also be introduced some time following the launch of the products. After assessing the success of the products, a cheaper variant of the most popular product may be launched. This would increase sales as well as enhance the popularity of the product.\n\nPlace\n\nThere will be 12 outlets set up initially for primary distribution across major cities in India. The major cities selected for primary set up are Delhi, Mumbai, Kolkata, Chennai, Bangalore and Pune. There will be two outlets in each city. The first outlet will be located at the heart of the city so that it could be used to cater to customers from all corners of the city. A strategic location will be chosen which has at least one college, various multinational corporate offices and recreational centers all at reachable distances. The location for the second outlet will be selected just outside the city limits and preferably on a highway. This outlet will be able to cater to the customers belonging to the suburban areas. In addition, this outlet will also serve to the people diving out of or into the city.\n\nSpecial services such as doorstep delivery would be introduced to ease the accessibility of the product and orders would be taken over the telephone or the internet. Such facilities would be provided free of cost for 10 kilometers and with a minimal carrying cost for a range over that. This will further increase the popularity of the brand. (Pettijohn 2001).\n\nPromotion\n\nWhen looking at the promotional aspect of the business the target audience must be first identified and then acted up on. The target audience for the promotional activities in this business is identified as city and suburban population aged between 15 to 35 years. Promotional activities would aim at generating informed brand awareness and a strong brand value. The cultural attitudes, national sentiments, and local tastes must be considered while creating promotional initiatives. The promotional message should be clear, understandable, and comprehensive. It would be advisable to inform the potential customers that this brand is completely ethical, legal and will take care of their needs and demands. It should be so designed that the reach and brand retention are maximized. The primary means of promotion would be television, radio and the Internet. The brand would have its own centralized website with information about products, restaurant locators, contacting information and order receiving capabilities. Television and radio programs to be sponsored should be carefully selected. Television/Radio channels and programs popular among the youth would be approached. The print media would also be employed to some extent. The magazines and daily segments of the newspapers intended for use by the younger generation would be utilized. Apart from these conventional modes of promotion, sponsorship deals in terms of college festivals, youth music festivals, road shows could also be undertaken to expand the reach of the brand. The budgetary plans for the promotional programs should be efficiently managed. It should fit in comfortably as a part of the entire marketing budget. (Katsikeas & Theodosiou 2006).\n\nBudget and Controls\n\nThe annual marketing budget decided for the first year is $500000. The marketing operations will be carried out in three phases. The first phase would last for three months. This phase will commence just prior to the launch of the brand. Promotional activities will be stressed upon in the initial period to generate brand awareness. Customer attitudes, trends, demands and requirements would be assessed in this phase. Feedback networks including surveys, onsite feedback gathering etc. will be emphasized on. In the second phase, during the next six months, promotional initiatives will be stepped up. Extensive brand promotion would be carried out to build up a brand value. At the same time, feedback networks would carry on as per set standards. In the third and final phase, lasting for the final three months, promotional costs will be cut down to increase the profit margins. In this phase, customer response, sales and effectiveness of various channels of distribution, promotion and supplies would be analyzed.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe objectives of gathering feedback are multifold. It feedback forms, online reporting mechanism and survey questionnaires will be designed very carefully so that the analysis of these forms reveals the extent of customer satisfaction, perception of product quality, thoughts about pricing. The results should also indicate the effectiveness of promotional and distributive networks. Internal inspection would also be carried out to assess performance standards. Key Performance Indicators such as sales figures, results obtained from onsite feedback, Internet Polls and various other surveys will be analyzed at regular intervals. Dissatisfactory results would call for immediate attention and issues would be reviewed by the board of directors and marketing experts. (Pettijohn 2001).\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Physician Assisted Suicide – State Laws Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. State of California\n 2. State of Oregon\n 3. State of Alabama\n 4. References\n\nState of California\n\nThe state of California has recently passed a bill that allows doctors and nurses to assist the death of patients by unconscious dehydration. The bill also allows the family members of a mentally disabled person where the nurse is of the view that the person would not live more than a year, to authorize total sedation. The sedation would leave the mentally ill person without nutrition and hydration and the death would occur within the next four or five days. This authorization may be given by the family members to the medical personnel irrespective of the fact that whether the death is imminent or not within the stipulated period of one year. Total sedation is the process allowed by the bill which is an irreversible procedure normally used when the death of a patient is imminent. The assisted suicide bill has failed three times in the Assembly and this time the bill was tabled with a modification that the physician would use total sedation instead of lethal injection for assisting the patient to die (LifesiteNews.com, 2008).\n\nState of Oregon\n\nThe bill passed by California allowing assisted suicide can be compared with the legislation adopted by Oregon State in this connection. Oregon passed the Death with Dignity Act in the year 1997. The purpose of the Act passed by Oregon is to enable terminally-ill patients to take their end-of-life decisions. According to the Act the terminally-ill patients can request for ending their lives through voluntary self-administration of lethal prescriptions. The physicians are allowed to prescribe lethal injections and drugs to end the lives of terminally-ill patients. Unlike the Californian law, the Oregon Act prescribes certain conditions to be met by the patients for enabling them to get assistance from the physicians to die. The patients meeting the criteria under the Act must make two oral requests to the attending physicians. These two requests must be separated by at least 15 days. To get permission to get assistance from the physician, the patient must be of 18 years or older and must be a resident of Oregon. The patient should possess a sound mind to take the healthcare decisions of his/her own will and be able to able to inform others about such decisions. The patient should suffer from some illness that will bring death imminently to the patient within six months. The attending physician has to decide whether the patient is eligible to decide about the end of his/her life. The patient must provide a written request to the physician attending on him/her. The request has to be witnessed by at least two persons and one of the witnesses should not be a relative of the patient. The Californian law on assisted suicide does not seem to contain such elaborate procedures (Oregon.gov, 2007).\n\nState of Alabama\n\nIn contrast to California and Oregon, the State of Alabama has prohibited assisted suicide specifically. Physician-assisted suicide or euthanasia is prohibited under the general homicide laws as a criminal offense punishable by Alabama. There is also the provision to prosecute an extreme case of euthanasia as manslaughter under the applicable laws. The proposals to legalize euthanasia through legislation have met with failure on two occasions in the year 2000 and 2001. No other attempts in this direction have been made after 2001. Almost all other states except California and Oregon have decided against assisted suicide. In some states, there is an express prohibition of the act treating it as a criminal offense. Proposals in several States to legalize euthanasia have been opposed and the States could not bring any statute authorizing euthanasia.\n\nReferences\n\nLifesiteNews.com. (2008).

      "Heroines’ Analysis in Frankétienne’s “Dézafi” Essay\n\nFrankétienne’s Dézafi offers unique insights into Haitian society due to its examination of the complex relations between various community sections. One such issue discussed in the novel is women’s role in changing the trajectory of a group’s history (Lacet 47). Two female characters in the story, Rita and Sintila, cause such changes in their towns, but their motivations are different. Due to this, Rita is the heroine in the story as she embodies the spirit of endurance in the face of seemingly unending social problems.\n\nRita is a young girl who has to work due to the poverty her family lives in. When the readers first encounter Rita, she is a hardworking housemaid in her uncle’s house in Port-Au-Prince (Frankétienne 25). Despite being a meticulous person in her endeavors, her uncle Jédéyon does not appreciate her efforts. She cooks, cleans, and ensures that Jédéyon has a comfortable life. However, the latter is ungrateful and does not acknowledge Rita’s dedication to serving him well (Frankétienne 30). Moreover, he continuously berates her for referring to him as an uncle, which is a courteous term. Thus, Rita persevered the poor treatment to help feed her family.\n\nDespite never having received any formal education, Rita is determined to learn. Since she worked when her peers went to school, she missed the chance to be enrolled in a learning facility (McFee 380). It is due to this reason that she is unable to read and write. However, her illiteracy does not dampen her willingness to attempt reading any word that comes across her way (Frankétienne 30). One such instance is when Rita stops by a poster on her way to the market to decipher what the words meant. This admirable effort clearly shows how Rita still had the dream to overcome her illiteracy.\n\nBesides an undying will to be literate, Rita also mourns for her lost childhood. To provide for her family in their poverty-ridden village, she starts working to earn some money. She searches for a job and eventually gets one at uncle Jédéyon’s house. After that, the girl tries her best to satisfy the strict demands of the seemingly bitter man. While working, Rita does not get the time to play as her peers (Frankétienne 30). In one instance, while going for an errand to the market, she nostalgically looks at children having fun. Even at her young age, Rita realized that having no normal childhood is a sacrifice she was willing to make.\n\nThe village of Bouanef is terrorized by their priest, Sintil. The voodoo priest gives the villagers sleepless nights because he can utilize spells to control the community members. Through his attacks, Sintil can make people subservient to him (Gottin 73). The priest has a daughter called Sultana, who helps him manage his plantation. Besides, a character named Zofe closely watches the plantation workers for any misconduct. Outside his home, Sintil has a reputation for being a womanizer, and the villagers fear him for his spells.\n\nSintil uses his magic spells to attain workers for his plantation. Since he is a voodoo priest, Sintil has magical powers that enable him to zombify dead bodies (Gardner 83). Consequently, he sneaks into the cemeteries at night and digs up recently buried bodies (Frankétienne 147). Thereafter, he casts a spell on them that brings them back to life. However, the spells do not offer the bodies full functionality but give them enough cognitive power to cultivate the plantation (Daniels 210). As a result, Sintil always has enough workers on his farm due to his ability to transform corpses into zombies.\n\nHowever, the zombies have to be kept in their stuporous state by denying them salt to subjugate them. Siltana is responsible for making food for the zombies. Her father repeatedly warns her against putting salt in the diet of the farmworkers. He claims that salt will open their eyes to their desperate state and cause instability on the farm (Frankétienne 148). She follows her father’s specifications and is a generally dutiful daughter. Additionally, Zofe threatens the zombies with painful beatings and starvation to quell any rebellion among them. The lack of salt in the diet and the harsh working environment ensure the farmworkers’ continued repression.\n\nThe plantation undergoes a transformation when Klodonis is brought to work the fields. The confident young man irks Sintil, who hatches plans to make him a zombie. This motive is because Sintil abhors educated men who he sees are a threat to his continued domination of the villagers (Frankétienne 152). Subsequently, Klodonis is poisoned during a visit to Fabi’s shack. He dies a few days later, after which Sintil turns him into a zombie to work on his farm. The addition of an honorable young lad to the farm laborers plants the seeds for the eventual fall of Sintil.\n\nSiltana is attracted to Klodonis’ traits and even starts to like him. When he arrives on the farm, he proves himself to be different in the way he carries himself. He works meticulously and still portrays some skills outside of his usual work requirements (Clocksin 54). This attracts the attention of Siltana, who eventually falls in love with him (Frankétienne 147). However, due to his state, Klodonis fails to reciprocate Siltana’s feelings towards him. Siltana tries to persuade Klodonis to run away together, but this falls to deaf ears. Klodonis only responds with the usually incomprehensible mumbling of zombies. In short, Siltana grows to like Klodonis while working the farm because of his personality and wishes to elope with him.\n\nIn an act of desperation, Siltana gives Klodonis salt to escape her father’s farm with him. Siltana is alone with Klodonis one night since Sintil had gone to the cockfighting competition – the Dezafi. However, Zofu was out drinking alcohol and only came home later in the night while drunk. He encounters Siltana and attempts to touch her breasts without her consent. When Siltana threatens to report the incident to her father, Zofu tells her that he will inform her father of her love for Klodonis (Frankétienne 151). Afterward, Klodonis wrestles with Siltana to gain access to the house. She hits him with a pestle and leaves him unconscious. After that, she quickly gives Klodonis salt to make him regain his senses.\n\nIn a final turn of events, Klodonis leads the villagers in a rebellion that uninstalls Sintil as the village priest. After Siltana gives salt to Klodonis, he wakes up from his zombie-like state after a slight fever and some abdominal pain (Frankétienne 151). However, Klodonis is not as agreeable as she hoped he would be and is violent. He physically assaults her and promptly gives the other zombies salt (Flaugh and Christian 45). Consequently, the hitherto meek slaves of Sintil turn into an uncontrollable destructive mob. Led by Klodonis, they start destroying the property on the farm and kill Zofe. Afterward, the former zombies, accompanied by the villagers, murder Sintil in the Dezafi grounds.\n\nBetween the two characters of Rita and Siltana, I choose Rita to be the heroine in the story. This is because she is faced with poverty and diligently works hard to make ends meet. On top of that, she stoically endures her grumpy employer, who finds fault in every task Rita does in the house. Additionally, she still has dreams to teach herself how to read despite her circumstances. On the other hand, Siltana’s desperate action of giving salt to her love interest, Klodonis, leads directly to the collapse of Sintil’s tyranny in the village. However, this is not a heroic act as her goal was to escape with Klodonis and not put an end to her father’s reign of terror. Thus, Rita’s sheer determination to improve her living conditions in the face of difficult circumstances makes her the story’s heroine.\n\nIn conclusion, both Siltana and Rita are faced with important decisions in Frankétienne’s Dézafi . Rita dutifully works to alleviate her family from suffering despite sacrificing her chance to be literate and enjoy her childhood. Similarly, Siltana is in a dilemma of whether to elope with her father’s work or not. But unlike Rita, Siltana’s choice has a selfish motive. This leaves Rita as the heroine of the story and an important source of inspiration.\n\nReferences\n\nClocksin, Jeana.

This is explained by the fact that a variety of working positions will be created (Khapoya, 2010). African people are mostly employed in the agricultural sector, but with economical expansion, working positions might be established in industrial areas. This will become a very positive outcome for the African population because industrially based jobs offer higher levels of payment. In addition, such jobs have a permanent basis, but not a seasonal one (Eberstadt, 2010). Therefore, due to economic expansion, the population will receive a chance to be employed throughout the year.\n\nThe Impact of the Economy Growth Rate on Food Prices\n\nThe impact of the economic growth rate on food prices is very positive as under the influence of economic growth, more products and goods are produced, competition levels among enterprises are raised, and thus, the food prices go down to attract customers (Eberstadt, 2010). In addition, the prices for certain goods, which were artificially high due to their deficit, will become reasonable (Khapoya, 2010).\n\nThe Impact of the Economy Growth Rate on Country Security\n\nThe level of country security in Africa will become higher due to economic growth. This is explained by the fact that economic stability causes political stability. If authority is firmly established in the hands of strong, confident, and stable leaders, the level of country security raises. Citizens come to be better protected in such important areas as political stability, health care services, and educational services. In addition, economic stability results in lowering the level of organized crime (Binns, Dixon & Nel, 2012). The examples of many poor African countries show that due to economical instability, people there are pushed to engage in serious crimes such as piracy and kidnapping. On the contrary, if the local population in an African country enjoys economic stability, employment, and confidence in the future, the level of crime in it is insignificant compared to poor African countries (Mwabu & Thorbecke, 2004).\n\nThe Impact of the Economy Growth Rate on Agriculture Industry\n\nThe impact of economic growth on agriculture is ambivalent. On one side, economical growth will cause growth in the agricultural industry, on the other side, economical growth usually results in the development of industrial areas of production.\n\nPositive Outcomes for Groups in Society\n\nA decrease in poverty among the representatives of different social groups will take place as a result of economic growth, and its outcomes include the growth of employment rates, a fall in prices, and country security. The poorest and socially unprotected people will acquire a better level of social payments from governments as national budgets will become enough financed for this. In addition, due to the creation of new jobs, people from all social layers and groups will have an opportunity to find jobs or to change their former jobs for jobs with a better level of payment. Besides, the representatives from all social groups will benefit as a result of improving the level of national security as political stability will result in lessening the levels of crimes and improving the quality of the state services such as healthcare and education. Thus, a conclusion can be made that economic growth in Africa will result in the social stability of the local population.\n\nReferences\n\nBinns, T., Dixon, A., & Nel, E. (2012).

      "Analysis of Future Tourism in Paris Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. General Economic Background\n 2. Accessibility\n 3. Competitiveness\n 4. Safety and Security Issues\n 5. The environmental situation\n 6. Architectural deterioration\n 7. References\n\nGeneral Economic Background\n\nIn the nearest future, the touristic industry will experience considerable decline in general due to the complicated economic and political situation in the world ( Discussing the future of tourism , 2009). The global analysts claim that this state of affairs will affect the European market to the greatest degree since it is characterized by high prices and underdeveloped infrastructure (Free, 2010). In this vein, the shift in popularity is observed in the direction of Asian resorts as they offer moderate charges in combination with grate service. Thus, there are reasons to expect the fallen rates of popularity of Paris as a famous tourist stronghold.\n\nAccessibility\n\nAnother reason to expect negative phenomena in touristic industry in Paris is accessibility of the city and its popular tourist destinations. The transportation infrastructure both in Paris and France needs allocation of considerable funds for modernization ( Connected World Transforming Travel, Transportation and Supply Chains , 2013; International task force on sustainable tourism development , n. d.). The poor prognosis in the field of transportation accessibility explains why the general touristic perspectives of the city in 2025 are negative ( Insight into the future of tourism , 2012; Swayne & Dodds, 2011).\n\nCompetitiveness\n\nIn the latest period of time, there have been observed significant decline in the level of the competitiveness of French touristic destinations including Paris (Dung & Reijnders, 2013). Such situation is explained by the fact that the new leaders in the industry have occupied the most advantageous positions at the market. Traditionally, Paris is seen as the best option for romantic trips, honeymoons, etc. However, today these sectors are successfully occupied by Vietnamese and Philippine resorts due to better pricing policy and the welcoming exotics ( Tourism leaders plan future , 2012).\n\nSafety and Security Issues\n\nAccording to Free (2010), safety and security is one of the most important variables that affect consumers’ choices in the area of tourism. In Paris, the level of protection leaves much to desire. People are concerned on the reason of growing criminality. The areas of special concern are the growing rates of thefts and robbery, racket, and frauds of varied kinds. The situation is estimated to become even worse in the future decade since the population of France along with its numerous immigrants experiences huge economic problems.\n\nThe environmental situation\n\nThe worsening environmental situation is Paris is the cause of more problems in the industry of tourism in the city. A special reason for concern is the condition of water in the local rivers. The water is being extremely polluted, which harms the general atmosphere in the city including the quality of air. Tourists visiting Paris in the latest period admit that this unwanted circumstance nullifies all the pleasant experiences of travelling around the city. The environmental specialists claim that the condition of water in the Seine River will only deteriorate in the nearest decade (Dung & Reijnders, 2013).\n\nArchitectural deterioration\n\nThe problem of ruining the architectural sites in Paris is one of the central anxieties of the city authorities. The scale of the situation is so big that the state budget is not able to finance the annual program of monuments and buildings renovation. Thus, Paris loses its most attractive characteristics, which will undeniably lessen the future flow of tourists ( Consumer-generated web-based tourism marketing, 2008; Insight into the future of tourism , 2012).\n\nReferences\n\nConnected World Transforming Travel, Transportation and Supply Chains .

      "Crisis in the United States: Education and Assessment Report\n\nThe United States has always been striving to have the highest standards in the area of education in order to maximize the achievements of the students who will be responsible for the future well-being of the country. However, the current crisis in America with regards to education and assessment can be described as acquiring more and more complications nowadays. Varied educational establishments have showed lower results compared to the abundance of the other countries in the world, and the educational curriculum has narrowed since the act No Child Left Behind. The causes of this crisis may be connected to the absence of unified system of education approved in each state, lack of sufficiently trained specialists in the area of education and the omissions in curriculum.\n\nDiscussing the above mentioned reasons, it is evident that they are all connected to each other and need a systemized plan on solving them. First of all, with regards to the absence of unified system of education for each state of the country, it should be said that such drawback seriously affects the quality of provided education in the country. It appears that some states offer the highest in the world level of quality in the area of education whereas there exist some states with the lowest level of education quality provided which can be compared to the one existing in the third world countries. In order to overcome the current crisis in the system of education in the United States it is important to unify all the requirements for quality of curriculum programs. Secondly, the lack of sufficiently trained teachers can be also mentioned as a serious reason for crisis in education: teachers in the United States get less money than in the countries where education is on higher level. Thus, the occupation is not popular among young specialists, and having no well-trained and energetic specialists who would work on solving issues connected to the improvement of quality of education it is difficult to solve it. In addition, after the act No Child Left Behind the teachers seem to demonstrate lower level of professional moral. This sad fact adds to the seriousness of crisis in the system of education in America. Finally, the omissions in curriculum are rather significant. The biggest problem can be observed in the whole idea of organization of studies. Pupils study difficult subjects, fractions, for example, in separated blocks which may be planned within few years, whereas in the other countries the curriculum is organized around the other principle. This principle assumes that particular considerable subject is to be studied during a long period of time which is required for its complete understanding. If to remember the illustration with fractions they are to be studied for a semester. Thus, speaking about the possible implications behind the problems leading to the crisis in the system of education in the United States, it should be mentioned they are rather significant and require a well-planned and proper strategy of interference. More than this, it seems that poverty and lack of sufficient financing is the very implication behind the problems in the area of education.\n\nConcluding on all the information mentioned above, it should be stated that there exist serious problems connected to American school curriculum and the lack of qualified performers in the area. These problems cause the crisis in the United Sates with regards to education and assessment.\n",
      "Childhood Sexual Abuse and HIV Risk in San Salvador Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is hard to deny that women of contemporary society undergo much more stress than any other century’s ladies. Moreover, today we observe crucial circumstances of women experiencing dreadful treatment at the workplace, home, and within social conditions overall. It is important to understand the outcomes of such attitudes towards young girls. (Ullman, 2003). Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is sometimes a direct reason for later HIV risk. This paper will focus on the article called Childhood Sexual Abuse and HIV Risk among Crack-Using Commercial Sex Workers in San Salvador, El Salvador. Further on the paper will reveal its significance from a social worker’s perspective. This article has made a significant impact on the studies of the HIV/AIDS field and most likely this work will give enough information to social authorities to level up social workers’ knowledge and education level on the topic. Hopefully, the article can prevent cases of CSA to stop further devastating outcomes since the work summarizes the reasons, such as living in poverty, absence of education, etc. It means that the HIV risks can be prevented via sociological, political, and economical developments and improvements.\n\nConnection to Prior Research/Underlying Etiological Theories\n\nThe problem discussed within the article is HIV/AIDS. The entire study was initiated by another research that has been made previously. To be more exact, the opinions of HIV/AIDS infected women were gathered through questioning and polls. (The article has its investigation based on interviews of forty women). So, ‘Since the beginning of 2002, 1.2 million women have died from AIDS’ , ‘… in 2002, two million (47.6 percent) adults newly infected with HIV and 19.2 million (50 percent) of adults living with HIV/AIDS’ – this is the crucial data gathered before starting the research on the connection of CSA with drug addiction as the future outcome (Gomez-Dickson, 2006, p. 547). It was mentioned that crack cocaine use was associated with HIV risks, which pushed researchers to look for reasons for drug abuse. Therefore, these were the etiological theories underlying the currently discussed article.\n\nAdvancing the Understanding of Article\n\nAfter reading this article the understanding of drug use and HIV/AIDS connections became clearer. Now it is perfectly visible that once the poor living conditions make people go out in the streets and acquire sex jobs nothing good is going to happen; moreover, many women were taking drugs to undergo unwanted sexual relations to earn money. First of all, a person gets infected with HIV/AIDS through heterosexual intercourse (Shedlin, 2000). And to understand why a person goes out in the streets in search of drugs and sex work, the article offers interviews with women. Being hopeless they experience psychological problems because of being abused during their childhood, which makes them think that the overall life is meaningless and there is no opportunity to get out of this because they have no education, no money, and no prospects.\n\nThe usefulness of the findings for solving or reducing the problem\n\nThe article is one of those wonderful sources that help social workers understand people under rehabilitation better. It is essential to understand that women going through rehabilitation procedures need to be medically approached. However, sometimes the psychological treatment is much more effective. Once you understand why women were merely forced to take drugs, you get to sympathize and experience their problems more profoundly. Furthermore, not only it is a mere sympathy and mutual understanding that helps women recover, as a psychologist the social worker will find ways to show that life is filled up with opportunities and slight failures are not anymore the reason for breakdowns. Doing this, the social worker needs to know that the women saw ‘reliance on drug use as a method of coping with the sexual abuse experience’ (Molnar, 2001).\n\nCritique of the Design and Methodology\n\nThe overall research was based on the theoretical framework that included a larger social context. It was a very good approach that made it possible to talk to many different women interviewed at different places. The main characteristic that the methodology of the research makes clear is the social context in which interviewed women lived. The research organizers took crack users from treatment centers and shelters. Moreover, there was an eligibility estimate: women recruited were 18 years old and more and they had to have consumed crack within the last 60 days. Since the entire research was carried out to find reasons and solutions to stop HIV/AIDS infection process in society, the ‘fresh’ crackers made it extremely relevant and similar to the situation the social workers face.\n\nLimitations of the Research\n\nUnfortunately, there were some limitations of the research methodology. First of all, it is impossible to question all the HIV women across San Salvador, hence this makes the research a bit imprecise. The organizers could not fix all the depth of psychological problems of every woman. Moreover, it is not necessarily guarantee that all women were telling truth.\n\nThe Persuasiveness of the Reading\n\nStill, the women interviewed presented a peculiar layer of the society that made it possible to understand the clear connection of the CSA to HIV/AIDS and drug addictions (Parillo, 2001). The reading was persuasive enough because it offered many criteria for rating a woman as stigmatized. Moreover, the research was carried out as profoundly as possible taking into consideration the cultural analysis of Latino women, for example. I got to know that Latino sexual behavior upbringing states that women cannot get satisfaction unlike men – this is their prerogative. I was persuaded that women who have problems with drug addiction now have been abused during their childhood for sure. At least a larger part of them was. The article states that the location and, hence, living conditions play a great role in all further complications.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe article Childhood Sexual Abuse and HIV Risk among Crack-Using Commercial Sex Workers in San Salvador, El Salvador gives a precise understanding that CSA is a result of crack use in most of the cases, although the actual mediations are not yet discovered entirely. The social workers have been provided with substantial information on why and what forces women to take drugs and experience re-victimization. Moreover, the results of this research have significantly impacted current HIV research/inventions. Women’s harsh living conditions and exposure to sexual abuse make them lead miserable lives and have no way out of this. The article has been a real breakthrough in the field of HIV/AIDS studies. The most efficient result is the realization by social workers of the psychological context to adhere to. Comprehending the locations of living and socio-cultural background made it possible to have tolerable attitudes and place oneself next to the person whose life turned out to depend upon social conditions.\n\nReference List\n\n 1.

      "Fast Food Nation in the “Omnivore’s Dilemma” by M. Pollan Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Discussion\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nEating is no longer a practice done just for the sake of it. With many processed food available, it has become a nightmare for most people who say that they are diet conscious. For these people, they tend to scrutinize a product before they buy it but little do they know that the same ingredients they could be avoiding are exactly what they are going to get.\n\nThe thesis tries to analyze ideas presented in Michael Pollan’s book “omnivore’s dilemma” and establish the viability of his ideas concerning the arguments he presents (Kuypers, p13). The threads of ideas as presented by Pollan in the first chapter of the book are scrutinized to establish the truth in it.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThis book tries to examine how this happens by explaining to the reader how the food chain works and its relationships with almost everything present in the environment.\n\nThough most people try to choose what it is they eat hence the question, what shall eat for dinner? many still don’t understand that it is difficult to accomplish that question because all food is linked in one way or the other therefore one cannot choose what to eat and what not to eat. If you enter a supermarket, for instance, the various products displayed could only be attributed to the two main sources plants and animals. “Except for the salt and a handful of synthetic food additives every edible item in the supermarket is a link in a food chain that begins with a particular plant growing ….”\n\nThe author claims that most people feel satisfied eating at the bottom of the food chain without considering any repercussions their habits might upset the chain, such people he says should not have any business with this book. His main targets are people who want to eat in the know. The author’s main objective is to get people to understand that it is important to know what is it you eat because as he puts it …. “You are what you eat….so that is, us as processed corn walking” he further demonstrates that even though most people will not notice corn is the main ingredient of what people eat today. From what animals like chicken, turkeys feed on, ingredients of most foods e.g. milk, eggs, and most drinks so in essence what we eat is just corn.\n\nThe author’s main purpose in writing this text could be summarized as a plea to food-conscious people that there is more to what they don’t know about the food they eat. He looks to admonish people against falling into the trap set by big marketing companies and fast food outlets (Nestle, p358). He therefore critically analyses the food chain using corn to demonstrate that indeed all food originates from one source even though they may appear not related in any way.\n\nThis text depicts an environment where people have been confused by so many types of food making them unable to decide as to what is good or not good to be eaten. This is precisely the audience the author is trying to address by explaining to them the chains of food and how all of them are related to the other. He says that if you start from one point of the system you will find yourself at the end at the same point you started.\n\nThe author mentions that the dilemma faced by people especially the omnivores gave rise to this text. His main agenda was to explain how the food chains worked and their inter-relationships with each other.\n\nThe circumstance surrounding this text is pure consumption of healthy food by all people. The author’s point of view seems to be how to make people understand that it is not necessary to process all food as some could be eaten in their natural form. He seems to argue that the more the food is processed and ingredients added, the more the chances of it bringing complications when selecting what to eat and what not to.\n\nThis text’s background dates back to the ancient times of hunting and gathering when human beings survived by merely picking what is available in the surroundings which were not necessarily processed and run up to date where almost all foodstuffs are a result of processing and mixing different substances. The author argues that the destruction of the environment by the hunters and gatherers has resulted in the food chain disaster we are currently experiencing.\n\nIn this chapter, plant, the author tries to explain how corn though thought to be harmful is the center of all the food chain. He examines the corn plant which is an ancient plant with its origin dating back to a very long time ago and concludes that indeed the plant plays a major role in the food chain. With his arguments, it becomes clear that all revolve around the plant with almost 90% of all products containing corn or an ingredient made of corn….”corn is what feeds the steer that becomes steak. Corn feeds the chicken and the pig, the turkey and the lamb…..the eggs are made of corn…”\n\nThe author arranges the text in a manner that takes the reader from one point to the other without much struggle. He starts by examining the importance of corn in the form of an experience in the supermarket and how almost everything displayed contains corn. He goes further and explains the concept of corn walking which he says is due to the consumption of corn in almost all food we consume. The third part explains the rise of maize or Zea Mays, also related to corn, which eventually adapted itself to the climatic conditions of North America and hence became the staple food in the region. It further describes the dependence of the plant by man hence guaranteeing its existence. The text has been written in a manner that flows naturally and is easy to follow.\n\nConclusion\n\nWith the knowledge of the food chain and how it could affect the ecological system, reading this text in a way will change peoples’ attitude towards certain foods and help them understand what goes on in it, therefore, answer the question that is often difficult to answer; what shall we eat for dinner? (Brock & Scott, p320)\n\nMost people do not even know whether they are vegetarians or not, others call themselves “strict” vegetarians but do they really know if indeed they are strict? How will they know if almost all the food comes from a common source that is from plants and animals? These plants and animals largely depend on one another, so is there any form of strictness? Well according to Michael Pollan the answer to this question greatly depends on one’s understanding of the food chain.\n\nWorks cited\n\nBrock, Bernard L & Robert Lee Scott.

      "Triumvirate Leadership in Terms of the Google Corporation Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The case of Google\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nManagement is an essential part of the maintenance of manufacturing and services; it is important to develop leadership competencies with managers because these people are responsible for dealing with the rest of the employees. Managers can establish and introduce different strategies which can be useful in terms of further employees’ satisfaction and effective work. Strategies and measures introduced to increase productivity and get feedback from the employees in terms of efficiency facilitate the development of relations between the management and employees. As suggested by Kaplan & Norton (2007), translating the vision, communicating and linking, business planning, and getting feedback and learning are basic elements of the management performance strategy. In this respect, everyone wonders how the Google corporation has managed to introduce triumvirate leadership in terms of management and potential of every separate person (Nelson & Quick, 2008, pp.432-433).\n\nThe case of Google\n\nThe triumvirate approach has been chosen eventually when two founders of Google Sergey Brin and Larry Page had recruited Eric Schmidt as none of them was able to fulfill duties of the chief executive officer introducing leadership approach, training, and other issues which make the management so important for everyday maintenance. Though the management was concentrated in hands of one person in terms of common management strategies, suchlike development of leadership competencies and ensuring a healthy work environment, it is necessary to mention that the founders of Google were engaged in engineering, product development, and technological issues. As Google grew strong it required profound management. Turk (2007) argues about the role of a manager in the company with regard to the inborn abilities and leadership. Consequently, Google has three leaders that perform the roles of three managers where Page is responsible for products, Brin deals with technological aspects and advertising, and Schmidt contributes to the day-to-day work of the company and establishes relations with news media (Nelson & Quick, 2008, pp.432). The division of responsibilities can be considered one of the main reasons for successful maintenance and management of Google; triumvirate leadership is the source of success and power because no party interferes with the area of activities of other parties, though their actions are aimed at reaching a common goal.\n\nAnother peculiar feature of Google’s success is the time allocation which presupposes that employees should divide their working hours into three parts in certain proportion where seventy percent should be spent on advertising and search, twenty percent should be allocated to other core businesses, and ten percent should be devoted to the development of ideas which can benefit the company in remote future (Nelson & Quick, 2008, pp.432). Naturally, Google is effective about both management performance and effectiveness work including efforts of all staff members and management.\n\nRewards and awards make the Google employees spent their time and efforts on this company only as the management encourages and motivates the talented people that can contribute to the overall success of the company. Moreover, individual ventures are not typical of Google employees because they have sufficient motivation levels in terms of benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nPlanning is one of the most important parts of the management process as it presupposes establishing and introducing different strategies targeted at attaining certain goals. Triumvirate leadership can be considered a successful approach in terms of division of efforts and covering of certain strategic elements, suchlike technology, advertising, and development of leadership competencies.\n\nReference\n\nKaplan, R.

      "Music Therapy: The Impact on Older Adults Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe purpose of this research paper is to investigate the long-term effects of music therapy on older residents’ agitation manifested with Alzheimer’s disease, dementia and other old age medical complications. Towards this end, this research paper will also take a comparative analysis of the evaluation of studies on music therapy on older residents. The purpose of this study is to compare research studies on music therapy as an intervention to medical complications experienced by older residents brought about by dementia and Alzheimer’s. In brief, this research paper seeks to conduct a comparative analysis, or systematic review of effects of music therapy in older adults to assess the quality of the evaluation of research studies in this area.\n\nThe research problem\n\nAgitation leads to severe disturbances in the quality of life of people with Alzheimer’s disease and their carers (Lawlor, 1995). It is well known that the incidences of dementia and older people’s medical complications are steadily rising due to the partial increase in the average life expectancy observed over the past century (Miller, 2008). During the recent past, different research articles abide to the fact that there is need to adequately meet the physical, psychological and social needs of the older people. Research evidence, heath care givers, affected family members and a number of medical reports point to one fact that music and music therapy may have a unique effect on people with dementia, and more specifically on those with probable diagnosis of dementia of the Alzheimer’s type (DAT) (Wigram, Pedersen & Ole Bonde, 2002).\n\nWhile most research articles abide to one fact that music therapy remains an effective intervention technique in handling the symptoms of dementia, the qualitative nature of the reviewed and methodological approaches observed in the analysis of the studies failed to effectively provide a conclusion on the most effective form of music and therapy practices. There is therefore the need to focus more energy to aid more understating on the role of music therapy on older residents.\n\nLiterature review\n\n“The recent qualitative review of literature in the area of music and music therapy and dementia published on this topic suggest that music and music therapy is an effective intervention for maintaining and improving active involvement, social, emotional, and cognitive skills” (Lehrer, Woolfolk & Sime, 2007). In addition to the above, music and music therapy are also effective in the reduction of behavioral problems in individuals with dementias (National Association for Music Therapy, 2007). The role of these present qualitative analysis on this topic have been done with the view of understanding the quality of these studies and carry out a deep analysis on how their methodological approaches influenced the effectiveness of the therapy.\n\nA number of literature on this topic have concurred in one conclusion on the fact that this approach in reducing the level of pain and anxiety in older resident with Dementia remain effective to date. This is because people with Dementia demonstrate different forms of symptoms. According to Lehrer, Woolfolk & Sime (2007), People with Alzheimer’s disease show a range of agitated behaviors, including repetitive acts, behaviors inappropriate to social norms, and aggressive behaviors towards self or others. Furthermore, Grocke & Wigram (2007) illustrates that music therapy is one intervention which aims to create secure, stimulating environments, to meet social and emotional needs, and to reduce agitation displayed by people with Alzheimer’s disease and other types of dementia.\n\nOlder people demonstrate high levels of agitation and anxiety often manifested in a lot stress and lack of self control. The explanations provided by a number of research articles towards the effective role of music and music therapy include the effect of music on attention. Familiar music may serve to regulate a person’s arousal to a moderate level (Michel, 1976) or redirect a person’s attention from misleading or confusing stimuli (Michel, 1976).\n\nHicks-Moore (2005), in his study has successfully presented a comprehensive and relevant academic, theoretical as well as empirical review of literature in his study. In the analysis of the background to the study, Hicks-Moore (2005) has first presented early studies as well as more recent information that are coherent with this article. A literature search was carried out on observations, role of different types of music and ‘phenomenology research methods’. Another well documented article on the role of music and well being of people with dementia is by Sixsmith and Gibson (2007). These authors concur with other researchers on this topic. The authors began by demonstrating the need to incorporate the element of a phenomenological approach to the study that could have an in-depth exploration of problems to be addressed in what he termed as “Seeing things up close’ – using the philosophy of Husserl as a base.\n\nRelevant demonstrative capacity and in-depth analysis on this topic is manifested by Sixsmith and Gibson (2007) to demonstrate connections to other academic works on the topic. In this endeavor, they have achieved the relevance of this study to the current demands in understanding the problems older people with Dementia go through due to the complications of this medical problem always presented in the form of agitation and anxiety. Recent studies have focused on the need to exploring strategies aimed at reducing the effect of Dementia and Alzheimer’s on older residents through the application of music and music therapy.\n\nIn this line, Sung and Chang (2005) “Use of preferred music to decrease agitated behaviors in older people with dementia: a review of the literature” explore vast number of resources on this topic. This extensive review of the literature conducted by Sung and Chang (2005), in the area of music and music therapy, grouped, categorized, systematically coded and presented the outcomes of the research in the one of the best formats. “We use meta-analytic which aggregate effect sizes across studies in order to assess the overall relationship between variables” (Sung and Chang, 2005). Success in singing, playing instruments, moving to music, or sharing memories or views related to music, may also meet a person’s un-met needs for self-expression, achievement, and meaning in life (Schmidt -Peters, 2001). Another very effective article towards the understanding of this topic by is Choi , Lee , Cheong and Lee (2009) on “Effects of group music intervention on behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia: a pilot-controlled trial” seeks to avail the details of the comparison made among studies conducted by trained music therapists and other professionals on the interventions requiring active participation in activities like singing and playing instruments or games. When the above are analyzed comparatively to passive involvement such as listening to music, studies using live versus, taped music and an assessment of behavioral, cognitive or social variables, valid deductions can be made. While Choi, Lee , Cheong and Lee (2009), appreciate the role of music in reducing agitation and anxiety on older people with Dementia and Alzheimer’s, the need to understand the role of both active and passive music involvement is well demonstrated. It is therefore prudent enough to confidently state that the aim of these research articles, the research questions and research problems are comprehensively addressed and all literature evaluated in this research paper relevant.\n\nThe framework\n\nConcept of intervention(s)\n\n“Music therapy has been defined as ’an interpersonal process in which the therapist uses music and all of its facets to help patients to improve, restore or maintain health’ (Schmidt -Peters, 2001). Music therapy allover the globe has their roots from different traditions such as behavioral, psychoanalytic, educational or humanistic models of therapy. While techniques used in music therapy are also diverse, they can be broadly categorized as ’Active’, in which people re-create, improvise or compose music, and ’Receptive’, in which they listen to music (Schmidt -Peters, 2001). While the United States makes wide application of the receptive and combined approaches, the European countries lean more towards the application of the active approach.\n\nThe underlying fact under these studies is that different forms and types of music have the ability to stimulate emotional and physical changes in the body. “The receptive forms of music are more likely to be influenced by cognitive-behavioral or humanistic traditions and may involve an adjunctive activity performed while listening to live or recorded music, such as relaxation, meditation, movement, drawing or reminiscing”. (Schmidt -Peters, 2001). According to (Schmidt -Peters, 2001), it has been suggested that this form of music therapy can help reduce stress, sooth pain, and energize the body. The most training on this type of music and music therapy are done at the bachelor’s level after which one can proceed to practice professionally after attaining the Board Certification and after going through a specific number of hours in clinical practice.\n\nIn the application of active approaches, techniques to stimulate active involvement of the patient, the therapist uses clinical improvisation techniques to stimulate or guide or respond to the patient who may use his/her voice or any musical instrument of choice within his/her capability (such as percussion) (Darnley-Smith & Patey, 2003). This may involve the patients coming with their own written songs that they will sing with the music therapist. These are the models that are referred to as improvisational. They are different from the other techniques because most of them are psycho-analytically informed.\n\nThe putative mechanism that makes this technique effective is that mutually and musically developed relationship between the patient and the therapist motivates the patient to experience a different feeling of himself or herself and gain an insight into his or her relational and emotional problems through talking about the musical dialogue (Darnley-Smith & Patey, 2003). Most of these programmes are in the Masters level or more extended in-depth in the undergraduate levels. In the recent past, specialisms have evolved in particular areas, for example Neurologic Music Therapy is the specific application of music to cognitive, sensory and motor dysfunctions in neurological rehabilitation (Darnley-Smith and Patey, 2003). Most music therapeutic approaches always involve a combination of two or more approaches. The choice of approach tends to be based upon the person’s needs, the therapist’s training and the context (Miller, 2008).The delivery of music therapy takes different time periods that range from few weeks to a number of years and their intensities also varies with time. Another aspect of this technique is that it may be delivered individually or in group depending on the needs of the patient.\n\nParadigms in social interventions\n\nParadigms form basic images construed within the subject under study suggested by a researcher or prototype. (Miller, 2008), defined paradigm as a set of practices that define a scientific discipline during a particular period. Paradigms in social interventions assist researchers to understand the underlying problems in instances where other forms of paradigm cannot be used to explain certain events, anomalies, and crises. According to Michel (1976), “the social network paradigm is a construct for analysis of social relationships developed in social anthropology”. However, in its analysis and concepts, this paradigm has gone under various forms of transition and development in review of a number of researches and practice in the clinical field. It forms the fundamental basis on which basic research questions that demand further analysis are presented.\n\nWhen there is a conflict between the available types of paradigms in the analysis of an effective approach to addressing research questions, a new paradigm is created. According to Michel (1976), there are three types of social paradigms which all have with them very different analytic view and expressions in reference to the society. These paradigms include the three paradigms; the structural functionalism, the social-conflict, and the symbolic integrationist. All the three types of social paradigm abide by one fact that the family forms the most fundamental unit in any type of social interaction. According to (Michel, 1976), “The primary role of the family is the socialization of children to that they can truly become members of the society into which they have been born.”\n\nAn analysis of the social interventions of the disciplinary matrix reveals six core elements. These include image, practice, theory, interest, research methodology, cognitive and exemplar. The elements of image , cognitive and exemplar are referred to as genotypic elements in that unlike the other three core elements of theory, research methodology, and practice, they generate paradigm and are explicit.\n\nIn this research paper, cognitive element will be of more focus in social paradigm intervention because of the fact that cognitive behavior therapy forms a very effective technique of handling Dementia. “Cognitive Behavior Therapy methods were initially developed for depression and anxiety disorders (Michel, 1976) and later they were modified for many other conditions, including personality disorders, eating disorders, and substance abuse. Furthermore, “they have also been adapted for use as an adjunct to medication in the management of schizophrenia and bipolar disorder” (Michel, 1976). Basic cognitive model indicate the effect of CBT on behavior and emotion of Dementia patients.\n\nLearning Cognitive-Behavior Therapy: An Illustrated Guide\n\nBased on the above model, music plays a very fundamental role in affecting the behavior and emotion of older residents. A combination of music therapy and cognitive behavior therapy remains effective in the reduction of pain and anxiety.\n\nEvaluation models\n\n“Evaluation is the systematic acquisition and assessment of information to provide useful feedback about some object” (Lehrer, Woolfolk & Sime, 2007). Evaluation that will be adopted in this research paper will be a scientific experimental model. This is mainly because it undertakes both the scientific and social concepts of the study. The empirically driven feedback can then be achieved. Evaluation as a research process cannot be done in a single phase but involves a continuous activity in the process of undertaking an evaluation of a project. There is need to understand the different interests to be served by the evaluation and that there is a chance of these interests conflicting with one another.\n\nThis continuous evaluation requires a model which consists of a series of components and statements on the systemic relationship among various factors referred to the interventions; such as the cost, internal and external factors. The goal is one criterion only. It takes into account all systemic variables that affect the result. The impact model displays three hypotheses. The first is the causal hypothesis, the second is the intervention hypothesis and the third is the action hypothesis. The action hypothesis is used as the evaluative criteria because it tests if the intervention is the causal factor. This model comes from the positivistic paradigm due to the element of causality. The goal free model involves the evaluation of the intervention. This model can be from any of the paradigms.\n\nQualitative model whose purpose is to derive the meaning of the intervention according to how it is perceived by those who receive it stems from the interpretive paradigm.The paper also employs critical model. This model is used when the intervention is done as praxis and the purpose is empowerment and emancipation. The population is the clientele who are described by their needs, their interpretation and social structures. It stems from the critical paradigm.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe objective of this research paper is to carry out an analysis of the relevance and effectiveness of five peer reviewed articles on the effect of music therapy on older people. Towards this, the most effective research model (inductive model) of research was to be applied to generate generalizations. In this chapter, the research philosophy and the research strategy have been provided. The choice of the methodology approaches that have been selected and followed and have been well explained and justified.\n\nTwo views about the research process dominate literature, that is, positivism and phenomenology. The positive approach was based on the scientific discoveries made in the 18 th and 19 th century. It was a body of knowledge that existed independently of whether people knew it or not, and the scientists had to find the truth. The believe was that there were laws that governed the operation of the social world and that these could be discovered through social behavior that was seen as a result of external pressure acting on relatively passive people (Lehrer, Woolfolk & Sime, 2007). This traditional research approach leads to the development of methods that concentrated on producing supposedly objective data in the form of statistics.\n\nPhenomenologists disagree with positivists in that human beings can be studied using the same physical objects or other animals. They assert that there is a difference between the subject matter of sociology and natural science (Saunders et.al, 2000). Humans are conscious, active and very capable of making choices unlike animals or objects. In order to analyze the effectiveness of music therapy on older residents with Dementia, the phenomenology approach will be adopted. This is because the social world of business management and organization is too complex to be theorized by definite laws.\n\nAbstracts of each evaluation report\n\n“A non-randomized experimental design was employed with one group receiving weekly music therapy (n¼26) and another group receiving standard nursing home care (n¼19). The levels of agitation were measured five times over one year using the Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Cohen-Mansfield, J. (1989). The authors noted that an analysis of this techniques revealed that even though music therapy participants showed short-term reductions in agitation, there were no significant differences between the groups in the range, frequency, and severity of agitated behaviors manifested over time. They summarize the article by stating that there is need for more research on the topic and that multiple measures of treatment efficacy are necessary to better understand the long-term effects music therapy programs have on this population”.\n\nAgitation in individuals with severe cognitive impairment is a significant problem that affects care and overall quality of life. Building on research conducted by Goddaer and Abraham (1994), this quasi-experimental study proposed that relaxing music played during meals would exert a calming effect and decrease agitated behaviors among nursing home residents with dementia. It involved a study of thirty residents residing in a Special Care Unit participated in the 4-week study. The Cohen-Mansfield Agitation Inventory (Cohen-Mansfield, Marx, & Rosenthal, 1989) was used to gather data. Baseline data was obtained in Week 1 (no music). Music was introduced in Week 2, removed in Week 3, and reintroduced in Week 4. At the end of the 4-week study, overall reductions in the cumulative incidence of total agitated behaviors were observed. Reductions in absolute numbers of agitated behaviors were achieved during the weeks with music and a distinct pattern was observed.\n\nWhile therapeutic interventions involving music have been shown to have benefits for people with dementia, little research has examined the role of music and music-related activities in their everyday lives. This paper presents the results of qualitative research that explored this role in terms of the meaning and importance of music in everyday life; the benefits derived from participation in music-related activities; and the problems of engaging with music. Data were collected during in-depth interviews with 26 people with dementia and their carers, who lived either in their own homes or in residential care in different parts of England. The paper illustrates the many different ways in which people with dementia experience music. As well as being enjoyed in its own right, music can enable people to participate in activities that are enjoyable and personally meaningful. It is an important source of social cohesion and social contact, supports participation in various activities within and outside the household, and provides a degree of empowerment and control over their everyday situations. The practical implications for the provision of care and support for people with dementia are discussed. The scope and implications for technological development to promote access to music are also explored.\n\nBackground\n\nMusic has been suggested as a feasible and less costly intervention to manage agitated behaviors in older people with dementia. However, no review of the literature focusing on study findings of preferred music on agitated behaviors in older people with dementia had been reported. Methods: A review was undertaken using electronic databases with specified search terms for the period of 1993–2005. The references listed in the publications selected were also searched for additional studies Sung & Chang (2005). Results: Eight research-based articles met the inclusion criteria and were included in the review. The preferred music intervention demonstrated positive outcomes in reducing the occurrence of some types of agitated behaviors in older people with dementia. The findings from these studies were relatively consistent in finding improvement in agitated behaviors although the findings in one study did not reach statistical significance. The small sample sizes and some variations in the application of the preferred music intervention mean that caution is needed in drawing conclusions from these studies. Conclusions: This review highlights that preferred music has positive effects on decreasing agitated behaviors in older people with dementia; however, the methodological limitations indicate the need for further research. Relevance to clinical practice: Findings from the review highlight the beneficial outcomes of preferred music in reducing agitated behaviors for older people with dementia. The incorporation of preferred music has the potential to provide a therapeutic approach to the care of older people with dementia.\n\nWe investigated the effects of group music intervention on behavioral and psychological symptoms in patients with dementia. Twenty patients were none randomly allocated to either a music-intervention group, or an usual care group. The music-intervention group received 50 minutes of music intervention 3 times per week for 5 consecutive weeks. After 15 sessions, the music-intervention group showed significant improvement with regard to agitation, and the total scores of both patients and caregivers were lower, compared with the control group. These findings suggest that music can improve behavioral and psychological symptoms, especially in patients with dementia and their caregivers.\n\nPersons with mid-stage dementia and in special care (N = 45) were assessed in groups by a music therapy practitioner to determine the level of engagement in a 15-minute protocol that included a five-minute segment for each of three music activity types—rhythm playing, exercising with music, and singing. Activity staffs with little to no formal music training who were employed by the facility were taught to use the protocol to conduct eight subsequent activity sessions for small groups from which activity engagement data were collected for each subject. Results indicated the protocol was accessible and successful for indigenous activity staffs, initial assessments were strong predictors of subsequent engagement, and participation levels were stable over time and across each of the three activities.\n\nIntervention analysis\n\nStudy                                        Number of Participants  Sex              Age           Country    History                                                     \nLedger.A.J, & Baker, A.F.

Ledge & Baker (2006) took an analysis of 45 elderly patients of both sexes while Hicks-Moore (2005) undertook a research with 30 participants of both sexes. The ages of the participants in both studies were above 65 years. The studies undertook in this analysis by Sixsmith & Gibson (2007) and Choi , Lee , Cheong & Lee (2009) examined the role of music in reducing the levels of agitations and anxiety on the elderly residents with Dementia and started with populations of 26 and 20 respectively. The last study in this research paper was undertaken by Clair, Mathews & Kosloski, (2005), and shad a total population of 45 individuals consisting of both sexes.\n\nThe studies had patients from both sexes that were all older residents with Dementia. All the six studies used in the analysis of this paper were done and concluded in the countries they were initiated. This was to provide relevant data on the specific population under research investigation. The history of the patients under study consisted of those within the mid stage Dementia, acute levels of agitation and those with severe cognitive impairment.\n\nConceptual Variable\n\nIn the analysis of all the six studies used in this research paper, the interventions were positivistic and interpretative paradigms. The former paradigm was manifested throughout the intervention process through the observation of the behaviors of the patients. The applied systems of interventions in the form music therapy were found to have direct relationship with the effects observed on the same patients. Each and every form of intervention carried out was the precipitating agent in the effects observed in patients with Dementia. It is therefore true that the interventions formed the driving factors that shaped the observed results in the patients.\n\nIn this sense, this formed the independent variables while the latter formed the dependent variables. Music therapy interventions techniques were applied to reduce the levels of agitation and anxiety on Dementia patients. The intervention process was undertaken in a process designed to effectively monitor the changes in the levels of agitation and anxiety on the patients. Data collection and analyses were critical in these studies. The theme of music therapy intervention is to understand its effect on patients with Dementia. While most of the studies took the positivistic form of paradigm, some studies revealed the application of interpretative form of paradigm.\n\nIn this music therapy intervention, treatment design was similar in all the six research studies with minimal variation in design, implementation and the duration of treatment. Ledger & Baker (2006), used a non-randomized experimental design where one group received weekly music therapy (n¼26) and another group received standard nursing home care (n¼19). Hicks-Moore (2005) and Sixsmith & Gibson (2007) used relaxing music during meal time in nursing homes and conducted interviews on the effect music of in every day life among the patients with Dementia respectively. On the other hand, Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee (2009), used group music intervention on the behavior of people with Dementia. Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005), analyzed the active participation of patients under the study while Sung & Chang (2005), carried out an in depth analysis of eight of research articles. In this music therapy intervention, the goal model was used in evaluation of the results.\n\nImplementation Variable\n\nIn these research studies undertaken on music therapy on patients with Dementia, three studies were carried out in hospital. These were; Hicks-Moore (2005), Sung & Chang (2005) and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005) while Ledger & Baker (2006), used both home and hospital set up during the implementation of their music therapy intervention. Sixsmith &Gibson (2007), used home set up to carry out the study of music therapy on agitated dementia patients.\n\nThis music therapy intervention was both carried out in hospital and home. The people who were involved in this task were social workers and music therapists. The social workers were home care takers of the Dementia patients while the music therapists were stationed at the hospital.\n\nA comparative analysis of the study of the application of music therapy in the reduction of pain and anxiety and agitation on elderly patients with dementia points to one fact that cognitive theories were vast in the studies undertaken. As earlier indicated, the forms of paradigms witnessed across all these studies were interpretative and positivistic. The analysis of the study revealed that their objectives were coherent in that they aimed at analyzing and coming up with valid conclusions on the effectiveness of music therapy on older patients with dementia. To achieve this central objective of this study, a number of activities were undertaken.These included rhythm playing, exercising with music and singing.\n\nAssessment of Methodology\n\nCriteria for Methodological Assessment\n\nThis study employed a combination of content and hermeneutic analysis in the comparative assessments of the methodologies used. Content analysis is quantities assessment showing what is expressed as well as depicted in the text. Hermeneutic assessment on the other hand highlights the meaning of the text and its totality. The main aim of using criteria in this methodological assessment was to determine the validity and soundness of each music therapeutic implementation to the patients with dementia.\n\nThis music therapeutic study on patient with dementia was analyzed on methodological variables: the research problem formulation, the research study design and data collection, data analysis and interpretation.\n\nThe methodological analysis\n\nScale tested all the variables. The assessment scale involved a combination of four criterions: explicitness, appropriateness, clarity and completeness. In this study, the paradigm was assessed without explicitness because the paradigm is implicit.\n\nFour criteria were used to rate elements of methodology:\n\n 1. poor\n 2. Good\n 3. Very good\n 4. Excellent.\n\nThe rating ranges from between one and four with one being the lowest and four being the highest. The scores of each patient were added to obtain a numerical ranking. The data on the score for criteria were then ranked into poor, good and excellent.\n\nMethodological Assessment Scale\n\n4          Highly clear, explicit, specific              Most appropriate match of elements                             Precise, highly intelligible                  Complete, highly comprehensible                    \nExcellent                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n3          Information understandable                    Valid, appropriate match between design/theory/analysis        Clear, lucid                                  Explicable                                         \nVery good                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                                      Information difficult to comprehend, some omissions\n                                                                                                                                                                      TOTALS                                             \n2          Somewhat ambiguous                            Somewhat suitable match between design/ theory/analysis        Information must be inferred, little clarity  Poor = 26                                          \nGood                                                                                                                                                                  Good=60-90                                         \n                                                                                                                                                                      Excellent = 50                                     \n                                                                                                                                                                      Superior = 13-16                                   \n1          No discernible information, highly ambiguous  Inappropriate or invalid match between design/theory/analysis  Very unclear, vague                           Several omissions                                  \nPoor                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nCriterion  Explicitness                                  Appropriateness                                                Clarity                                       Completeness                                       \n\n\nComparative Analysis: Methodology\n\nResearch problem formulation:\n\nObjective                               Excellent                          Excellent              Excellent                    Excellent                \nLiterature                              Excellent                          good                   Good                         Excellent                \nReview                                                                                                                                                  \nResearch Problem FormulationHypothesis  Poor                               Poor                   Poor                         poor                     \nDependent Variable                      Good                               Excellent              Good                         Excellent                \nIndependent                                                                                                                                             \n                                        Good                               Excellent              Good                         Excellent                \nVariable                                                                                                                                                \n                                                                                                                                                        \nTheory                                  Excellent                          Excellent              Good                         Excellent                \nParadigm                                Good                               Good                   Good                         Good                     \nStudy                                   Ledger.A.J, & Baker, A.F.

These included: paradigm, theory, independent variable, dependent variable, hypothesis, literature review, and objective.\n\nParadigm\n\nAll the studies had implicitly stated paradigms with positivistic and interpretative frameworks clearly spelt out. The first four studies by Ledger & Baker (2006), Hicks-Moore (2005), Sixsmith & Gibson (2007), and Sung & Chang (2005), were dominantly in the application of interpretative paradigm while the last two studies by Choi, Lee, Cheong &Lee (2009) and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005) employed the positivistic paradigm. The theories advanced by the studies applied a mixture of matched and unmatched design and analysis of the intervention. Ledger & Baker (2006), Hicks-Moore (2005) and Sixsmith & Gibson (2007),achieved higher ratings on the explanations of the theories applied in their studies while the rest of the studies consisting of Sung & Chang (2005), Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee JS (2009) and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005), received fair or poor ratings in the explanations of their theories. From the matrix, it can be observed that that first three had good ratings while the last three had fair ratings.\n\nIndependent and Dependent Variables\n\nStudies undertaken by Hicks-Moore (2005), Sung & Chang (2005) and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005), reported excellent demonstration in both Independent and dependent Variables while the other studies had fair demonstration on the same. The first three studies clearly explained various parts of the interventions in vivid terms that were clear to understand. Good examples in this area were done by Hicks-Moore (2005), Sung & Chang (2005), by incorporating different modules in the analysis of both independent and dependent Variables. The incorporations of these modules are effective in the provision of data on the development of the effectiveness of the music therapy. The rest of other studies were specific in the application of the two variables thereby receiving fair grade in this category.\n\nHypotheses\n\nIt is not encouraging because none of the studies clearly stated their hypothesis. All the studies thus scored poor ratings in the development of their hypotheses. This is due to lack of ability to specifically address the information that can be deciphered. The studies by Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee JS (2009) and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005), portrayed more poor levels of hypotheses presentation. Even though the authors of all the studies suggested that music therapy is an effective treatment technique, they failed to demonstrate this connection to their hypotheses.\n\nLiterature review\n\nThe literature reviews by Sung & Chang (2005), was an analysis of various research articles on the effect of music therapy on older residents with Dementia. Studies undertaken by Ledger & Baker (2006), Sung and Chang (2005).and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005), demonstrated excellent review of literature on the purpose of the research. The rest of the studies failed to achieve higher degrees in the review of their literature and as such received fair ratings.\n\nObjectives\n\nAll the six studies were excellent in their goal statement. Their goals were succinctly stated. All the studies assessed the effect of music therapy in elderly residents with dementia.\n\nDesign and data collection\n\nTime Observed                          Good                               Good                   Poor                         poor                     \nValidity                               Good                               Good                   Poor                         Good                     \nDesign and Data CollectionReliability  Good                               Good                   Poor                         Good                     \nInstrument                             Excellent                          Poor                   Poor                         Excellent                \nSample                                 Excellent                          Excellent              Excellent                    Good                     \nDesign                                 Excellent                          Good                   Good                         Excellent                \nStudy                                  Ledger.A.J, & Baker, A.F.

Its variables were precise. The study done by Hicks-Moore (2005) applied a descriptive research design. This form of design gathers data only after the implementation of the intervention thereby making it difficult to determine causality.\n\nSample\n\nEach of the six studies included elderly residents with Dementia. Five of the six scored excellent ratings due to the fact that used good samples of participants in terms of number, sex, and age. One of the research analysis by Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee (2009) involved unspecified number of participants in its study that gave it good ratings.\n\nInstruments\n\nThe analysis of the six studies revealed that three of them received excellent ratings as a result of instruments used in data collection. Ledger & Baker (2006) and Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005) were the best in the application of instruments in data collection. These included the use of relevant questions with some of them having the elements of choice. Studies documented by Choi, Lee, Cheong and Lee (2009), scored average in the application of instruments in that their instruments lacked the aspect of clarity.\n\nReliability and validity\n\nFour of the six studies scored fair ratings while two of the studies by Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005) and Sixsmith & Gibson (2007) scored substandard ratings due to their inability to articulate the reliability and validity of their studies.\n\nTime observed\n\nClair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005) and Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee (2009), received the best ratings in this category. These two studies had with them the components of definite lengths of intervention periods as well as the analysis of the intervention process.

Each and every study focused on achieving high ability to effectively demonstrate the balance that exists between the depth of analysis and the purpose of their studies. Most of the studies were able to turn questionnaire responses from the patients themselves into quantitative data that were later analyzed to provide the qualitative component of the data.\n\nThis was the effective tool in assessing the effectiveness of music therapy in the patients under study. A total of three studies done by Clair, Mathews & Kosloski (2005) and Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee (2009), were able to demonstrate higher levels of data analysis that took step by step approach. Furthermore, they were able to portray the existing link between the data and the methodological approaches adopted. This remained fundamental in consideration to the types of study these authors were undertaking.\n\nInterpretation and Conclusion\n\nThe studies received fair ratings in the interpretation and conclusion. They were able to moderately interpret analyzed data into understandable criteria. This was achieved through a thorough discussion of the methodologies, interventions, and the results achieved after data analyses. The limitations of their studies were well documented and a number of relevant factors and risks associated with these studies well pointed out. Due to the nature of the studies, all the studies pointed at the social impact on their results. They were written logically and clearly to enable easier understanding of the social impact of the results obtained.\n\nReports Quality\n\nSung & Chang (2005) and Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee (2009), demonstrated excellence ratings in quality reporting due to comprehensible and concise reporting techniques. The authors analyzed the studies and focused on organized, presentable and easily understood report formatting. The implications of the research studies on future research endeavors on the same topic were well illustrated.\n\nConclusion\n\nKnowledge Development\n\nThe purpose of the comparative analysis is to use inductive research and seek to arrive at generalizations pertaining to the effect of music on older adults. The research can affect knowledge development on the following levels: factual, concepts, hypotheses, empirical generalizations, theoretical generalizations, and paradigms. The knowledge development based upon an analysis of the studies can help to the general life of older adults and prevent medical complications associated with Dementia and Alzheimer’s.\n\nAll of the studies contribute to knowledge development on a factual level. Sung & Chang (2005) and Choi, Lee, Cheong & Lee (2009), have used assessments to evaluate the role of music in reducing the levels of pain and anxiety on older residents. Scores received on the preliminary assessment were then compared to post-test results after the intervention had been implemented. The knowledge availed to the field of medical care for the older residents by these articles have contributed significantly to knowledge development and the need for further research.\n\nReferences\n\nChoi, A.N., Lee., M.S., Cheong, K.J. and Lee, J.S.

      "Physicalism as a Philosophical Approach Essay\n\nPhysicalism is one of the philosophical approaches that explain the world as a physical property. Is arguable that the answer to this question should come primarily from physics, i.e. physics conceived as a special science? Some precedent for this can be found in Aristotle’s physicalism and more specifically in the elementalism that is its physical basis. Of course, the intellectual activity that is the ultimate form of which all other forms are a lower manifestation is conceived by him as eternal, and hence as coeval with the basic kinds of stuff. Therefore the latter never would exist on their own without the existence of the former to which to conform. Nevertheless in themselves, they are, as we have noted, spatially and quantitatively indeterminate. Their only intrinsic distinguishing features are purely qualitative.\n\nPhilosophers suppose that matter as a composite of subatomic particles is, while unobserved, in that sort of probabilistic state that is mathematically represented by a wave function, and this state is further conceived as spatially indeterminate — as a distribution of alternative locations. Indeed, even a system that includes such particles and an observer who observes them is, in estimation, similarly indeterminate while unobserved by further observers, i.e. about these further observers (Heil 43). However, in any system taken as a whole, the wavelike quantum superposition of its subatomic particles, which the wave function represents, is collapsed or reduced to a determinate reality through interaction with the mental activities of that system’s observer. In this, the status of the mind’s own thing does not appear as problematic. For him, it would seem, an accomplishment of contemporary physics has been to update Descartes just by offering a more radical conception of what the effect of the mind’s intervention must be. On this view, in addition to affecting the motion and rest of the physical world, the mind imbues that realm with the phenomenological definiteness that it observes therein (Heil 41).\n\nThe physicalism of this sort is, however, transposable into one that is physical. The order of explanation can just be reversed. Thanks to the Modal Identity Thesis, instead of attributing the introduction of determinate physical characteristics to the intervention of the mind, we can identify the mind or its activities with the introduction of a certain degree of determinacy (Heil 22). The claim must be that in certain parts of the cosmos the quantum-mechanically determined particles aggregate over time into physical ensembles of a distinctive kind. These ensembles constitute a form of emergent composition whereby the wave functions of their components collapse progressively and conjointly into determinacy. the probability distributions are channeled into divergent branches of equally possible determinate alternatives any one of which may serve as a node for the divergent branching of further channels. This, no doubt still makes a mystery of what the cosmos is like when none of the required types of ensemble happen to exist. But that is a mystery to which contemporary physicists are for the most part resigned (Heil 173).\n\nPhysicalism has set out to explain how a reality that instantiates determinate characteristics in an indeterminate way can come to instantiate these characteristics determinately. What my form of physicalism has set out to determine is which of all the determinate instantiations of determinate characteristics are instantiations by non-arbitrarily individuated things. Accordingly, what it more directly suggests is that without us or beings like us reality would be more like what it currently is than physicalism properties are commonly supposed to permit. The one crucial difference would be that in their existence no localized or limited particulars could any longer be non-arbitrary. There are items classifiable indifferently as vertical fixtures with seats in front and desk-top behind or desk-consoles with the seat behind and desk-top in front — their existence would be indeterminate in status, only more so (Heil 43).\n\nIt is prudent at this late stage to leave the status of secondary qualities such as color, sound, taste, smell, and certain tactual qualities somewhat in qualia. Not to be completely craven I suggest that they are to be included among the body-centered phenomena through which our abilities intimate themselves as ours. But if we set that issue aside, then in the psychically bereft universe now being imagined or conceived it would not be as if some Kantian veil of appearances were suddenly to disperse leaving things in themselves by themselves in some state of austere incomprehensibility. All that would happen is that by themselves they would no longer be individuated as things in themselves, at least if we forget what they would owe to their history if any. They would merely be arbitrarily distinguishable parts of the whole (Heil 173).\n\nWith the elimination of the primary powers upon which the psychometric structure of the universe is ultimately dependent, there could no longer be any of the real in-the-actual-world causal possibilities that give the counterfactual implications essential to any actual causal relationships their ontological point. In stating what would happen given causal antecedents other than the actual causal antecedents in any situation, one would merely be stating what would happen in another logically possible world if it were sufficiently like the actual world. One would not be stating what would be happening in this world. In short, causal laws would be very like what on physical accounts they are generalizations about actual past, present, and future conjunctions — with their counterfactual nature attributable mainly to their purpose and the limitations to human knowledge to which such extrapolations pander. It has sometimes been alleged that no form of physicalism can be comfortable with the relatively late emergence within the cosmos of the sort of life and intelligence by which any such form supposes the cosmos to be structured. To this line of criticism may seem as vulnerable as any idealistic kind given the devastating consequences adduced above (Heil 201).\n\nAccordingly, the devastating consequences of our absence at any time from the universe would only prevail in a universe in which we had at no time been and at no time will be — though, given the dependence of time upon us, that is a rather Irish way of making the point. More importantly, however, radical though these consequences are, they bear out my earlier claim. They merely relate to the structure of reality as a whole, i.e. to the non-arbitrary individuation and ordering of its parts. There is nothing in my version of the psychometric hypothesis to indicate that the determinateness of reality would be impaired by the absence of things such as ourselves. On hypothesis presumably, that absence would abolish the openness of the future, and to that extent make reality more homogeneously determinate. It seems to concede to reality in our absence some measure of the sort of structure that on the supposedly more general theory is due to our presence (Heil 174). The non-emergence of the emergent composition that would constitute that presence would seem to be a non-emergency in a non-arbitrarily constructed time. Likewise, the non-composition would seem to be a non-composition of non-arbitrarily individuated particles with certain secondary causal powers, even if the nature of these particles and their powers are of a somewhat indeterminate kind. Notice as well that Aristotle’s form of dualism is exempt from certain objections to Descartes’. As critics have pointed out, Descartes’ Cogito gives no guarantee that one exists as an enduring substance other than when thinking, or as the same substance at any one such time as at any other. Nor on an assumption it seems willing to allow, viz. that the mental activity impinging on two different bodies could be qualitatively identical, can it find any basis for distinguishing the mind conjoined to the one body from the mind conjoined to the other. For Aristotle’s transcendent Cogito, i.e. the Prime Mover, there are no such embarrassments. What it reifies is intended both as eternal and as absolutely unique (Heil 37).\n\nIn sum, when first philosophers reach the point of contemplating the essence of things, they transcend themselves. Hence that their identities should be distinct when they contemplate the same essences, and that they should retain their identity through successive acts of contemplation, need not be essential. Descartes’ Cogito has quite commonly been taken as an inference to the existence of the subject of thought from the self-intimation of the thinking. These structural features would seem to be more than merely retrospective, i.e. introduced retroactively by the “emergence” of intelligent beings. On the contrary, the intelligibility of the transposition seems to depend upon their being intrinsic. In contrast to dualism, the physical reality is differentiated non-arbitrarily into temporally separate or separable parts. The phenomena of quantum mechanics are then to be interpreted as due to certain recalcitrance on the part of reality as a whole to decomposition beyond a certain level. In other words, beneath a certain quantitative threshold, the parts of the total structure do not submit to determinate non-arbitrary individuation as bearers of secondary causal powers.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHeil, John.

      "Julian Birkinshaw: The Critical Need to Reinvent Management Essay (Article Review)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Thesis Statement\n 3. Major Points\n 4. Critical Assessment\n 5. Personal Reaction\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn her article, “They need to reinvent management,” the author Julian Birkinshaw highlights the importance of the manager in the workplace and the different roles that they hold. The manager’s importance is contrasted to that of the leader of an organization. The two centers of authority are like two horses drawing one cart. The author goes on to continue with her analysis of the manager as the person responsible for the day-to-day administration of any institution. The rise of the manager is attributed to the rise of the industrial age which happened around early 1900, whereby some companies needed more staff and this eventually led to the need for a manager to oversee all the tasks being done by the employees (Birkinshaw 70). However, the role and definition of the manager have changed over time as we have seen tasks and responsibilities being watered down and being assumed as ordinary roles that can be performed by anyone.\n\nThe author introduces two firms and she clinically analyses the cause of their downfall. The firms are Lehman Brothers and General Motors. Both firms credit their earlier forms or managerial styles to them being giants in the fields that they dominated, but it is also their management styles that are being credited with their downfall. It is the rapid change of the economic dynamics that have forced the two organizations to refocus back their attention towards a better management model.\n\nWe can only say that the author’s purpose is to demonstrate the need for organizations both in the present and the future to strategize on their needs by looking keenly and addressing the issues that may be afflicting the Management model that they may be subscribing to (Birkinshaw 73).\n\nThesis Statement\n\nBirkinshaw’s thesis is founded on the following hypothesis (espoused by Birkinshaw): There has to be a unifying vision that ties the organization together and the vision should be able to drive the staff to achieve greater achievements. This achievement however should not be celebrated on an individual basis but rather the achievement should be based on the hard work and sweat of the common team. The author manages to explicitly explain and detail the lack of having a unifying vision and she uses the Lehman brothers as an organization where greed was the drive that motivated the staff and employees of the firm. The author also assumes that for any organization to succeed, it must be able to adapt fast as the competition is getting stiffer and stiffer by the day. The author also uses General Motors as one of the firms that were very slow to adapt and still relied on its management that worked in the past but still failed when new variables such as the competition from other automakers increased. General Motors was credited as part of the American Heritage due to its influence in employing a large population all across America.\n\nMajor Points\n\nThe author explores the subject of an effective management model. She describes a management model as a group of options that we have to make for work to be done in any organization (Bikkinshaw 69). For the running of any organization, there needs to be a clear direct structure of administration of how work is to be carried out and the results that are expected. How the staff is given incentives for desired results and how the staff treats each other is the heart of any management model. Dealing with the staff is difficult considering that each person bears their character traits and comes from different backgrounds hence it is the role of management to harmonize the workplace and extract each and everyone’s potential while working for the organization. An environment where there is no free exchange of ideas between the staff and the management fosters a hostile environment that for sure will impact the workplace negatively. The author mentions the way, communication between the staff and management at GM was discarded and this brought about bureaucracy within the organization. The same formula that brought about the rise of GM is also credited to its demise. Lehman’s degeneration from being an International company is also blamed on the lack of a practical management model. It is said of how the staff took risks with shareholders and customers money so that they could benefit through increases in bonuses. These actions later unraveled and led to the implosion and subsequent downfall of the organization (Growers 23).\n\nThe author also dissects the issue of what led to the fall of the manager. The discipline of management as both a profession and as a discipline is quickly coming under increased pressure. In a recent survey, people said that they did not trust and respect. It is with this in mind that the author was seeking to know the reasons for the tarnished image that managers continue to hold. In a recent Gallup poll, managers were reported to be individuals of low integrity within the society. This was attributed to the bureaucracy and hierarchy that were reported within the organizations. This lack of integrity is seen as to cut across the board as it is seen as brought about by failure on a personal level by the managers.\n\nCritical Assessment\n\nThe discipline of the management is seen as to have changed with time and become tainted. This corruption is blamed on the misconception of the roles and tasks of leadership and management within the organization. A common misconception that has been allowed to foster is that both authorities serve different results but in fact, both leaders and managers have the same duty to ensure that the organization can reach its target. The author puts this right by mentioning the cliché, “Leaders and managers are like horses drawing the same cart.” Although some of their responsibilities may different they both subscribe to the same school of thought. In the past managers were seen to be less relevant when compared to the leaders of the firm. This led to a narrow definition of the roles of the manager (Growers 2). A different principle was applied to them and this is credited as being one of the reasons why there are few alternatives to the existing management models.\n\nPersonal Reaction\n\nBirkinshaw’s arguments are very easy to comprehend as she can articulate why we need to learn from both Lehman Brothers and General Motors on the importance of management and how we don’t need to invent the wheel when it comes to reinventing management. Modern companies do not need to come up with newer management systems; they should just look at the common problems that may be afflicting the organization at present. Just as each organization is unique with its different problems and issues, all organizations can ensure that certain actions are taken and these actions will ensure that the discipline of management stays relevant to the needs of the firm. The first action that the firm can commit to understanding the management model that one is going to implement or is being implemented currently. By doing this ensures that the driving force is ingrained in the hearts and minds of the staff and this will produce selfless commitment from the staff. The second action is to evaluate the current model and whether it can match the needs of the firm. Is the model able to counter the risks that are brought about by the model itself? These are just a few of the questions that management needs to sit down and answer before the process of reinventing takes place. Last but not least the management needs to envision the way they want the organization to be. An ideal situation or environment would be where the management works hand in hand with other stakeholders such as staff, leaders, and customers in increasing the value of service rendered to each. The process of reinventing takes time and should not be implemented in a blanket manner. There are no definite steps as to how to redefine management but it is only through experimentation of the different models that a firm can be able to get the right system that works for them (Growers 10).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBirkinshaw, Julian (2010). “The Critical Need To Reinvent Management .” London Business School Business: Strategy Review Spring. 2010: 69-95.

      "The African Burial Ground Project Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. DNA research\n 3. Number of people who worked on the project\n 4. Unique study cases\n 5. Addressing human rights\n 6. Emotional effect\n 7. Work Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe African Burial Ground project commenced in 1991 under the funding of the General Services Agency (GSA). This occurred when the employees with an assignment of commissioning an excavation meant for a new structure (federal office building) exposed the skeletal remains of the first of the more than 400 children, men and women. Another study established that there was the mass burying of enslaved Africans (in the the17th and 18th centuries) in lower Manhattan and this took place in a piece of land sized 6.6 acres. The cemetery remained covered with landfills over the decades (Hansen & McGowan, 1998).\n\nThrough the proper management of the General Service Agency, this project has emerged as a clear testimony of both the positive as well as the collaborative partnership witnessed between the diverse parties that were involved including the African American community, Howard University among others.\n\nCurrently, the site is a national monument that features a unique memorial that commemorates and communicates the story behind African Burial Ground which is the only historic urban archeological project that has been undertaken in the US. The site has continued to attract many people who seek to dig the history attached to this national monument (Hansen & McGowan, 1998).\n\nDNA research\n\nThis was carried out by combining DNA with the available historical data, the morphology as well as the cranial metrics in an effort of establishing the true origin of these people. In order to carry out research that was more accurate and approximate, the need to apply more comparative data particularly from Central Africa was inevitable. Though the study had limited funds the researchers managed to move forward with the DNA pilot study. The analysis that was done was more sophisticated as compared to those done in a similar bio-archeological research situation. More stories concerning Africans were told a thing that was very instrumental in the restoring of the cemetery into a sacred field (Kris, 2005).\n\nNumber of people who worked on the project\n\nResearchers have never agreed on the actual number of employees who worked on this project. It is approximated that there could have been 70-80 people that worked in the Howard Skeletal Biology lab at one time or the other and the part-time students that participated actively in the project. There were also those people who did the excavation at the site. The project took in many undergraduate or graduates, who worked on the Burial Ground, some have finished their Ph. Ds while holding positions in this project with others compiling reports on the same project. The researchers who started at the undergraduate level or the graduate level had the responsibilities of doing the technical tasks like piecing bone fragments together and later on were involved in writing statistics. Some of the students decided to pursue African-American archeology due to the exposure they had at the burial ground ( Hansen & McGowan, 1998).\n\nUnique study cases\n\nThere were unique cases in a study like the 101s case that was believed to be a man who should have been between 26 and 35 years of age with the skull shape suggesting that he could have been from West Africa. But there was a contradiction in his chemical data. Strontium was one of the examined chemicals with the results directing to an African birth. Also, the researchers found Lead to be somewhere between New York City in the United States and West Africa (i.e. it was not clear whether 101 was really from West Africa or New York). This made it very difficult to ascertain the place where 101 had been raised as a child. The treponemal disease was also evident, implying that 101 had lived in dangers of deadly tropical diseases. 101 must have been a very hardworking man, a thing that was evidenced by some healed fractures (in the spine). Further evidence revealed that 101 had the most delicate and pleasingly filed teeth. Close-up and magnified photos indicated that the filing of teeth was deliberately done (Leech, 2008).\n\nThe lid of the coffin containing the remains of 101 had the shape of a heart, an important symbol to the populace. It was discovered after an investigation that it was a version of a symbol called sankata. The sankata symbol is thought to be very perfect and resonates with the African Burial Ground. According to the interpretation from various researchers, the symbol was based on the idea that one needs to take a step of searching the past and ensuring that the past becomes a guide to him/her. This translates that the symbol made a connection between the present and the past. The African Burial Ground has played an instrumental role in spreading knowledge regarding the symbol (Leech, 2008).\n\nAddressing human rights\n\nThere has been a discussion at the UN about people having the right to get certain information. The descendants of the slaves who are in different parts of the world have the right to know about the condition that their ancestors went through, and this helps in making sure that the miseries that they went through are not repeated. The project was very important in digging and exposing the truth. Through the study, the researchers involved got the understanding that history carries the political insinuation of both empowering as well as disempowering. This is in line with the theory that in addition to discovering, history should be re-discovered and should always remain subject to change. This confirms that African-American history has been greatly altered. Some omissions have always been made (on the African-American history) aimed at establishing as well as painting a positive image to that identity of the white and the national view in general. Through the application of skeletal biology and archeology, the project’s target was in unearthing useful information believed to have been out of reach for the population. This touches on the people involved in the struggle. The study made the researchers find themselves intermingling with a community that had a desire of knowing things that had been hidden from them, on how their people were buried and about whom they were and what the society was before (Frohne, 2001).\n\nEmotional effect\n\nThere were a lot of emotions at the Burial Ground when people learned of the high childhood mortality rates that had to take place as the research from the site had revealed. This brought the realization that something is compelling about human remains, that they are disturbing to many people. There was also the realization from the 3 studies that science in the right context gives the public a chance of getting close to these people. The remains stirred different feelings in the people (Leech, 2008).\n\nWork Cited\n\nAdam Leech, More Bodies Unearthed at African Burying Ground 2008.

      "“A History of the World in 6 Glasses” by Tom Standage Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nA History of the World in 6 Glasses by Tom Standage is the story of humanity beginning from the Stone Age up to the twenty-first century in the light of types of spirits and soft drinks consumed by people. The author chooses six kinds of drinks that had the most crucial importance for the human history. Standage also tries to connect the drink’s emergence with great historical process that appeared through the World History. Each spirit or beverage depicted in the book pertains to a certain cultural period.\n\nIn his book, the writer begins with an important thesis that each epoch has its own leading beverage. Standage explains that even the smallest detail, such as drink preferences, could be viewed in a larger economic and cultural context. Regarding this, the book proposes bear, wine, spirits, coffee, tea, and cola being the leading beverages that significantly influenced the history of humanity. Those new drinks served as an honorable substitution to the polluted water; they might be used in the traditions or as the sources of philosophical inspiration. According to the book, bear production was predetermined by the transition from hunting to farming. It was the most valuable drink in Mesopotamia and Egypt and was even used as the method to pay wages to people. Wine became the major product of trade and at the same time, it fostered the expansion of Greek culture abroad. The Arab world is known for coffee production; it was quickly spread to Europe thus becoming the “intellectual contribution to the geographical expansion in the Age of Exploration” (Standage 134). Such spirits as brandy and rum also dominated at this historic period. The introduction of coffee to the European culture facilitated the financial and industrial rise. The European coffeehouse embodied the rise of scientific and intellectual thought. The vivid intervention of tea on the world arena made the signature beverage of the elevated classes. Finally, the Coca-Cola production is identified with the globalization process, as it became the most mass-produced commodity.\n\nThe book is an interesting guide to the history of beverage habits of each people; it is an exciting trip to world history where author traces civilization formation through the drinking habits. The writer devotes two chapters for the description of each historical beverage showing its significance. The drinks are described according to the date of its invention: from the emergence of beer to the mass production of Coca-Cola. The author intends to emphasize that each ancient beverage has its own prominent value for the mankind.\n\nThe author makes a successful use of sources where he manages to single out the dependence of world formation on beverages and vice versa. Numerous sources render this evident connection between two historic events but the research does not provide an in-depth investigation of the civilization flow. Instead, the writer utilizes only certain handbooks that directly relate to beverage invention and exploration. Nonetheless, many other historians and researchers in this field prove the facts revealed in the work. Standage refers to the reliable historical records of the outstanding explorers and modern journals that contain updated information about beverages and its utilization in different countries. In the book, he tries to trace the development of each drink outsourcing fact from the veritable sources. The main advantage of this work is that Standage makes use of some both historical publications and scientific papers and works that highlight other domains of human activities throughout history.\n\nThe author managed to display prominent historic events such as Colonialism, Revolution, the emergence of British Empire, and the start of the era of Enlightenment. Moreover, it also reveals the formation of new processes both historic and modern thus influencing human behavior; Standage tucks some significant details –, the Mecca’s coffee trials in 1511, the healing qualities of tea, the vineyards destruction during Visigoth penalties.\n\nIn his research, the author tries to analyze the symbolic meaning of the presented beverages. Hence, he empowers each drink with some social and cultural meaning that is usually omitted in our current life. Standage also afflicts some religious importance to some drinks that became the part of some religious rites and traditions. In that regard, the writer identifies tea with some important periods of human development. He testifies the interconnection of tea with Buddhist religion in India and China and it interfered into the cultural life of England during the colonist period where there occurred the reevaluation of these beverages through social acceptance.\n\nAs it could be viewed, the work impresses by the way the author manages to identify the emergence of a drink with certain historic personages. To begin with, beer reveals the outlook on the life of Egypt and Mesopotamia thus establishing the main features of culture of that period. Standage also associates beer with the falls and rises of civilizations; he mentions that beer did not lose his symbolism being the drink of the working class. Next, wine closely relates to the democratic processes in Greece; according to the quality of wine, it was easy to afflict a person to a certain social class. Moreover, wine is often associated with social elite and religious processes so this wine was also identifies with snobbery. Hence, wine considerably affected economic development and cultural expansion. The emergence of such commodities as tea in England importing from China and India fostered such processes as industrialization and commerce. As for the coffee, it quickly became the beverage of intellect replacing taverns by the coffeehouses thus leading to the establishment of scientific centers and the emergence of revolutionary mind.\n\nFinally, the current society witnesses the introduction of such processes as integration and globalization that are mostly predetermined by introduction of Cola at the international market. In the book, we can find interesting reflections of the author on Cola as “globalization in a bottle” (Standage 150).\n\nAfter a thorough analysis of the book, it should be stressed that Standage provides an unconventional vision on the history of the world through the six popular beverages. He also manages to throw light on civilization development by considering the drinking habits of different peoples. Besides, Standage also proved that commodities play a crucial role in the different political and economic processes that occurred in history. The book shows that each drink triggered the development culture and demonstrated various civilizations. Each passage of the work is rather general with the note of specific details that makes reading exciting and captivating. Nonetheless, despite the ambiguity of the book in terms of history, the author manages to cover a vast historic period and to describe all important historic achievements.\n\nCertainly, Standage’s work greatly contributed to the depiction of the story from the unusual angle. Considering the above, it is obvious that that book will be interesting for those who want to learn the history of the drinks penetrating into our modern life. It would also be useful for those who want to understand the drinks as part of our culture and social life. The book will also be significant for the readers to recognize a deeper meaning of the beverage. This may be regarded as another definition for the social and cultural processes.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nStandage, Nom. A History of the World in Six Glasses. US: Walker & Company, 2006.\n",
      "Measurement and Scaling Concepts Research Paper\n\nScaling involves assigning numbers to objects in accordance with a specific rule. The objects include text statements—normally statements that tell about respondents’ attitudes or opinions. Scaling is different from a response scale in one distinct way. Scaling is a process that entails the assigning of values to variables whereas a response scale is an instrument used to give values to responses collected from respondents (Creswell, 2009). An example of a response scale is a dichotomous scale that has agree/disagree options or an interval scale that has options ranging from 0 to 5. In both scales, the respondent chooses the option which best suits his or her response to the question asked by the researcher. Scaling entails the entire process of developing the response scales that best suit the questions that will be asked as well as the methods that will be used to analyze the values provided in the response scales (Trochim and Donnelly, 2008).\n\nIt is important to note that even though a scale is a tool that can be used independently, it is usually incorporated into a bigger and composite instrument, for instance, a survey. The majority of the surveys are created to evaluate numerous issues of interest and to gather the information that makes it possible for the researcher to identify the correlations between such issues. When the information is gathered, the scores of the different scales used in the survey are computed and inferences are then made from the data analysis.\n\nIn research, scaling is done for a number of reasons. The first reason is to test the hypotheses of the study. The researcher carries out scaling so as to know which variables are best constructed as one-dimensional and multi-dimensional. A one-dimensional variable is one that carries only one score. Examples of one-dimensional variables include height, weight, and age. Examples of multi-dimensional variables include intelligence which can be measured using mathematical and verbal skills. The second reason for conducting scaling is that it enables the researcher to identify what dimensions are best suited to a range of ratings. For example, if a researcher develops a range of queries for his/her study, he/she can use scaling to know how suitable the questions are to the study’s objectives and if the questions can measure one variable or multiple variables. The third reason for scaling is to represent a response using a single value. When a respondent responds to a range of questions, the researcher can assign a single value that best represents the respondent’s general opinion and mindset (Trochim and Donnelly, 2008).\n\nScales are commonly used with complex variables that cannot be easily measured using a single score or single indicator. These variables include mostly qualitative variables. Quantitative variables such as the age of the respondent and the number of children of the respondent can easily be measured without the use of a scale. However, qualitative variables such as a participant’s belief concerning a particular issue cannot be easily measured. Scaling is therefore used to assign a quantifiable value to qualitative responses to make it possible for the researcher to carry out data analysis (Cozby, 2009). The scales used in research studies are chosen and created according to the researcher’s preferences. However, it is important for the researcher to make the scale broad enough, for instance, to use a scale of 0-9 rather than a scale of 0-3 so as to accommodate all the possible responses from the respondents (Wimmer and Dominick, 2005).\n\nReferences\n\nCozby, P.

      "The Biting Nails Habit: Behavior Modification Research Paper\n\nThe habit of biting one’s nails is common in many people of different ages. This kind of habit can be caused by many things but the main cause is stress or anxiety. Different people find different ways to deal with daily life stress. Some prefer to shop, others eat comfort foods like chocolates and ice cream and others will find themselves biting their nails. There are so many ways one can use to stop the nail biting habit some of them being using substances that have bitter tastes, using hypnosis or just taking good care of your nails such that you will feel a loss if you bite them.\n\nThe successful stopping of biting fingernails is possible and the person who is successful will not only ensure healthy fingernails but they will have succeeded in kicking off a very bad habit. In addition to that, the person will feel encouraged to keep their nails in a better state and will feel more confident with their nails in the case of those that are embarrassed by them. The following is a program I came up with to help myself and others who have the same habit of nail biting to stop this destructive behavior.\n\nStep I. Find out the root cause of the habit : The first step one has to do in order to stop biting their nails is to find the root cause of the problem. This is because such behaviors are normally as a result of oral fixation mainly brought about by stress, anxiety, boredom, nervousness or even hunger.\n\nStep II. Find an alternative way to relieve your stress: try to look for something else to do when you are feeling stressed. This could be pressing a stress ball or doing one of your hobbies like drawing or playing games. Whichever activity you choose to replace nail biting with, make sure it is not another self destructing one.\n\nStep III. Set records for yourself and beat them: you can start by setting a target of not biting your nails for a day or not biting a certain fingernail for a day. Once you succeed in doing this you can extend it for two days and so on. Progressively, you will find yourself not biting your nails for a week, then a month and finally never doing it again.\n\nStep IV. Trim your nails: keeping your nails short and regularly filing them could help you to stop biting them since there will not be much surface to bite. Whenever you find yourself starting to bite your nails, stop and trim them then file the ragged parts away neatly and you will find yourself stopping the habit soon enough.\n\nStep V. Go for regular manicures: manicuring your nails will ensure that your nails look neat and pretty. Manicurists always make sure that they cut all the dead skin on the cuticles away. They then apply nail polish which is most of the time bitter to taste and you might not like biting nails with such polish. These kinds of nail polish act as reminders not to bite your nails especially when you find yourself doing it unconsciously.\n\nStep VI. Put on nail jewellery: nail jewelleries can also help one to stop the nail biting habit. These jewelleries can come off when bit and can even choke you. This might scare you enough to make you stop biting your nails.\n\nStep VII. Have a vision of beautiful nails: It will help you to have a vision of clean, neat and beautiful nails because you will be focused on maintaining their status. Since nail biting makes them look really bad, you might not want to do it anymore.\n\nStep VIII. Show off to others: being a show off can at times be advantageous if used effectively. Make sure you show off your nails occasionally in order to find some pride in them. When your friends or even family praises you on the condition of your nails you will find yourself trying to maintain their status. That is the effect of positive reinforcement.\n\nStep IX. Patience pays: do not be in too much a hurry to stop the habit because it will not disappear overnight. Sometimes you can try protecting one nail at a time from your nail biting habit. If you can successfully stay away from it then you move to a second one. Finally you will find yourself not biting any of your nails at all. If you find yourself relapsing, just encourage yourself to do it again and do not give up.\n\nIf effectively followed to the latter, this program can work perfectly. The person with the nail biting habit needs to be patient and attentive at the same time in addition to being dedicated totally to this program in order for it to be successful. The person will risk a relapse if they give up somewhere along the way and do not follow the advice carefully.\n",
      "Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc.’s Analysis Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Company Background\n 3. Identified Issues\n 4. Analysis\n 5. Recommendations\n 6. Implementation Plan\n 7. Concluding Remarks\n 8. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe following business report analyzes the company Anheuser Busch to identify the issues that it is facing pertaining to its strategic position as the market leader. For this purpose the report provides a brief overview of the company, its mission and vision. The issues that are faced by the company have been identified. Recommendations and an associated implementation plan has been proposed to enable the Anheuser Busch to counter and resolve the issues that are threatening the leadership position of the country in the market.\n\nCompany Background\n\nThe Anheuser-Busch company has been the industry leader in the international market for the brewing industry. The company has its main operations based in the United States and holds the major shared of the market for beverage based products all over the world. The largest market for beverages exists in Europe and the Anheuser-Busch company has a strong presence as well as a leadership in the European market even though other strong local players are present in the local European market. The primary focus of the company in terms market is the United States where the company dominates the beer segment of the market.\n\nThe mission of the company has been to be leading beer company in the world that is present to satisfy and entertain the global target market while bearing profitable returns for its shareholders.\n\nThe claim to fame that Anheuser-Busch has had for its operations and success resulting in the current leadership position that they have in the market pertains to the innovation and the technology that they have employed for the manufacturing, storage and processing of their beverages\n\nIdentified Issues\n\nAn analysis of the company has provided that the company has been facing increasing sales revenue in the local and the international markets however the market targeted by the company is shrinking. The consumer perceptions about alcohol consumption have considerably contributed to the change in the preferences of the customers as alcohol beverages along with the lifestyle choices that they make.\n\nIt has been identified that the company is highly dependent on its local/ domestic beer division for driving its revenue and profits for the operations. The company is well established in the international markets, however around 70 percent of the company’s sales are made within the United States only. Aside form this company is also highly dependent wholesaler for its beer sales in the face of a lacking retailing solution.\n\nOther threats that have been identified which hamper the business for Anheuser Busch pertain to prohibition of widespread marketing of alcoholic beverages in the mass media, the governmental regulations, and trade barriers between that prevent the company from attaining a higher market share in its international operations.\n\nAnalysis\n\nIn order to determine how the business can overcome the issues that have been highlighted to through an in depth analysis of the company and its operations would be taken. This analysis would take the form of a financial analysis of the business over a period of five years to determine how the business has been able to establish itself in the market amongst its competitors. An industry analysis would also be undertaken to compare and contrast the performance of Anheuser Busch with its competitors.\n\nThe market analysis of the Anheuser Busch for its sales has depicted that the company sells more than 70 percent of its beer based products within the United States only. “During the fiscal year ending 2006, company generated approximately 74.8% of its total revenue from the domestic beer segment. In contrast the other three segments accounted for only 25.2 % of the total revenue during the same period. Strong dependence on a particular segment increases the business risk of the company thereby putting it in a competitive disadvantage.” (‘Anheuser-Busch Companies Inc.’, 2007) This is depicted in the following graph.\n\nThe consolidated financial statements for Anheuser Busch have shown that the financial indicators for the company in the past five years from 2003 to 2007 pertained to return on equity of 64.0 percent and a return on assets of 12.9 percent. The overall sales for the company has grown as depicted by the increasing revenue from sale, however the costs of operations for the company have also grown resulting decreasing performance of the company in the market. The marked reduction in the ROE and the ROA in 2007 as compared to previous years is an indicator of this.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe strengths of the Anheuser Busch Company pertain to its well established network for beverage distribution, storage and transportation to wholesalers and retailers, and the prestigious and premium brand names that are owned by the company under the umbrella of Anheuser Busch. This gives the company a leadership position in the market right now increasing the chances of the company getting financial leverage and support from financial institutions based on its goodwill. The diverse range of breweries owned by the company in the international markets also provides it with the opportunity to divulge into diverse beverage based markets in the home front as well as in the international regions of its operations.\n\nTherefore in order to make use of the resources and strengths that it has the Anheuser Busch Company should diversify into other markets aside form beer and beer based products/ beverages.\n\nThe company should diversify its sales to different markets as well targeting different segments of the market within the United States.\n\nThe company should attempt to analyze the profitability of its entertainment ventures and theme parks, closing down those that are slowly loosing customers and showing a decreasing trend towards customer attraction/retention.\n\nThe company should diversify not just its operations as well as its product line and services in its international regions of operations to take advantage of the increased market that would be exposed to the company through this.\n\nImplementation Plan\n\nThe following presents the implementation plan for the recommendations that have been highlighted above.\n\nIn order to diversify into other product lines and beverages that do not include alcohol or beer, the company will have to invest in supporting infrastructure and the set up of facilities and plans in the US to cater to the non alcoholic beverage drinking market. Moreover the company can also use the plants and infrastructure that is owned by it through mergers, consolidations and joint ventures in the international markets to manufacture the products and ship them to the United States.\n\nThe same strategy can be applied to target the markets in the international beverage industry as well. The company can use the existing resources pertaining to beverage manufacturing plants, and logistics supports to provide wine products and healthier beverage drinks in the international markets along with its signature beer brands to increase the percentage of revenue that the company can make from its international operations. This would also help in decreasing its concentration and focus in the US only enabling it to have contingency markets to fall back when alcohol and beer consumption reduces in the US.\n\nConcluding Remarks\n\n  * Signage\n  * Employee uniform\n\nThe best strategy that can be employed by Anheuser Busch to alleviate the issues that it is facing and work around the threats that have been highlighted above is to diversify its target market from a concentrated US market to a global beverage market. The company can provide its line of signature premium brands of beer as well as non alcoholic drinks and fruit based beverages to cater to the different demands of the international markets in its regions of operations. This will help increase the profitability of the company further while enabling it to sustain its strategic advantage of being the industry leader.\n\nReferences\n\n(2006), Anheuser-Busch Annual Report, Official Anheuser-Busch Company. 2009.

      "US Economy During Industrial and Information Revolutions Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nAt the time of independence in 1776, the U.S was primarily an agrarian society, with farmers and artisans tilling land and conducting their businesses from home or small local shops. However, the industrial revolution brought tremendous and everlasting changes to the U.S economy and society; with major changes taking place in the agricultural, industrial as well as communication sectors. These changes have continued to take place within the U.S society over the centuries, giving rise to an information revolution that has helped to bring tremendous change to the way American people think and conduct their businesses (Brezina 8-9).\n\nHow the industrial revolution changed the U.S economy\n\nIn the years following the American Civil War, industries and modern businesses grew enormously. The U.S was among other global economies that were transformed from agrarian societies into modern economies driven by industry and the manufacture of goods. Machinery replaced manual and animal labor in agriculture and other sectors and various innovations produced better methods of manufacturing goods from the vast wealth of natural resources.\n\nFrom the setting up of America’s first factory in 1790 to the production of the first average American’s car by Henry Ford in 1908, the U.S.A had experienced tremendous changes which transformed the country from a very sparsely populated agrarian society into a highly industrialized and urbanized nation (Hillstrom 37-38; Brezina 5-6).\n\nThe new industrialized society saw a tremendous growth in the number of factories and industries which in turn attracted jobless artisans and farmers into the new industrial centers to provide much needed labor. Massive movement of people from rural areas led to urbanization as existing urban centers expanded to accommodate the growing immigrant populations. Goods were produced in large quantities and growing populations provided ready markets for the goods; leading to a remarkable growth of the manufacturing sector.\n\nIndustrialization necessitated the growth of the transport sector to enable easier movement of people and goods between various places leading to construction of railroads, roads, canals and shipping yards. A new network of railroads helped to transport people to work in industrial cities, transport raw materials to factories; as well as in the distribution of manufactured goods. The manufacturing sector provided new jobs for the immigrant populations besides introducing them to better living standards through the supply of cheap and affordable manufactured goods (Hillstrom 22, 196; Brezina 4-10).\n\nThe industrial revolution also brought about a revolution in the communication sector with the innovation of such modes of communication as the wire telegraph, wire telephone, and radio or wireless telegraph. Better communication meant better trade because ideas could now reach business people over vast regions. Miles of telegraph wires were constructed along railroads and the later used the telegraph to improve scheduling and shipping efficiency. Steam power led to the growth of the printing industries, creating massive publishing of newspapers and books that not only reinforced the growing literacy needs among the masses but also supplied essential materials for their growing political interests. America became well connected with the outside world (Brezina 31-32, 34; Hillstrom 39-41, 89).\n\nHow the information revolution continues to change the U.S economy\n\nWhile the U.S and other world economies have continued to experience tremendous industrial growth since the industrial revolution, the last few decades have witnessed an unprecedented progress of communications and computer technology in U.S society. Economic growth and output as well as the employment sector are now highly dependant on the information sector; replacing the role that capital, land, labor and transportation played in determining production in the industrial society.\n\nAmerican industries, businesses and homes have been undergoing rapid computerization and networking in what is popularly referred to as the microprocessor revolution. The growth of the computer and telecommunications industries have given rise to the information technology (IT) industry and led to the development of an information age (United States Department of Labor 60-63).\n\nBeginning from the 1950s, large computer companies such as IBM, Univac, Honeywell and RCA initiated the growth of a new computer industry that has led to the creation of millions of newer jobs. Computers have also improved communication by connecting people in different locations through networks. Through the internet, millions of Americans are able to communicate and in 1998 for example, revenue generated through the internet was estimated at $300 billion.\n\nIn the manufacturing sector, computerization has enabled the operation of machinery by very few technicians through the robotic systems while at the same time enhancing production. Businesses are able to meet consumers’ demands in a more efficient manner through closer monitoring of inventories which helps to reduce the time spent in delivery of goods as well as reduce the inventories. Computers now provide better link between manufacturers, their suppliers and the consumers respectively. Products can also be located in much more easily through networking (Hillstrom 89-90; United States Department of Labor 63-66).\n\nPersonal computers, telephones, mobile telephones, e-mail and internet have helped to reduce traditional time and office space requirements so that enormous business transactions can be carried out in very short time and limited space. Information for businesses and workers is also more easily accessible and commuting expenses have been reduced. Internet and telecommunication technologies have also led to increased communication between the U.S and other nations of the world; opening up foreign markets for U.S products and therefore improving her economic performance globally. Globalization has been on the increase in the information age; creating new opportunities for the U.S in international trade and subsequently leading to the growth of the export sector and creation of more jobs to service this sector (United States Department of Labor 67-73).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe innovations of the industrial revolution paved way for the information revolution that has brought tremendous changes to the U.S economy. Various modes of communication developed during the industrial revolution have improved over the years to give rise to the more advanced information technology we have today. Modern information systems therefore credit the industrial revolution for laying the foundation upon which they have been established.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBrezina, Corona.

      "How Overpopulation Affects Our Economy Report\n\nAbstract\n\nThe report is about to prepare a comparative study of How overpopulation affects our Economy. The population is a mandatory part of the Economic activities. For sound economic growth, it is necessary to keep the population at an optimum level. Population more than an optimum level is called overpopulation. Overpopulation causes an increase in consumption, increasing consumption causes a decrease in saving, and decreasing savings results in decreased investment. Reduced investment results reduced employment opportunity and create unemployment. As a result whole GDP goes down. Thus, the economy always demands and optimum population.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe world population has increased dramatically in recent years. According to the United Nations, it reached one billion at the start of the nineteenth century. By 1950, there were over 2.5 billion people on the planet. Since then the total has been doubled, to 5.6 billion this year. Long-term projection suggests that the number will carry on growing until after 2200 when the population will stabilize at around 11.6 billion – more than twice as many as there are now.\n\nDespite the rapid growth of the world population, not all countries have experienced rapid growth of population. In particular, it is the world’s poorer countries, which have experienced the greatest growth of population.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor evaluating the comparative study several topics have been choosing. These are: population dynamics and the demographic concept, reasons for the increase in the size of the population, effects of overpopulation in the economy, food production per capita index, lower national income, increasing burden on working population, the balance of payments difficulties, overpopulation illustration of Malthus and growth of population in united states has been presented to evaluate the effects on overpopulation. This report would enquire the relation between population and economic growth. This has been done with a review of existing theoretical presentation and imperial analysis. The focus has been drawn on fertility, consumption, and investment.\n\nPopulation Dynamics and the Demographic Concepts\n\nThe developed countries such as the United States are very strict about birth control resulting in lower birth rates. Besides, later ages of marriage and the desire of many women to look forward to their careers, etc. lead to steady growth in the birth rates. An increase in the birth rate occurred mainly in third world countries, due to a decrease in infant mortality rate. This has been made possible due to medical improvements, the availability of more hospitals, etc. Lack of family planning and health education in communities resulted in higher birth rates. Besides, if the number of women of childbearing age is more in an economy, there is the likelihood that there will be a higher birth rate. However, initiatives of government could make it possible to control birth rates.\n\nIn the United States, the death rate has continued to decline throughout the twentieth century. The decline in the death rate has been a major contributory factor in the increase in the population. Factors that have tended to decrease the death rate in the US and other developed countries include improvements in the standard of living, improved working conditions, development of welfare state and improved medical techniques, better public health, and sanitation, better-educated population, and so on.\n\nRapid traditional immigration has taken place mainly in the USA, Canada, and Australia. There has been a new trend of immigration as people from India, Pakistan, African countries, and West Indies, come to these countries. An increase in net immigration has a great impact on the overpopulating USA and other developed countries. However, the US government is taking measures to restrict immigration.\n\nEffects of Overpopulation in the Economy\n\nWhere a country has chronically overpopulated an increase in population may mean severe hardship poverty, malnutrition, and high death rates. An increase in the death rate will put a great strain on a country’s social, health, and educational facilities. Lack of pure water supply will result in rapid transmission of diseases. There may be overcrowding in houses, shortages of doctors, shortages of medicine, shortages of schools and teachers, and food shortages.\n\nFood Production per Capita Index\n\nDue to overpopulation, the per capita index of food production seriously hamper and brings a negative effect on the national economy. US government is much more aware in this regard.\n\nAfrican countries like Sudan, Ethiopia, Congo as well as some of the South Asian countries are already suffering from these problems. According to United Nations, more and more people are going to starve in poorer nations.\n\nLower National Income\n\nThe optimum population is the level of the population where national income per head of the population is maximized. This means that the population is at its best size and is achieving a level of national income (or output) that is at its best given to that level of population. GDP per head is the most frequent indicator used to calculate the economic growth and living standards in different countries. If a country is overpopulated, it means that there are too many people with few resources to provide a level of national income, which maximizes national income per head. If the increase in the population exceeds its optimum size then there will be too many people in the country. National income per head will be lower than it should be because there are not enough resources available.\n\nIncreasing Burden on Working Population\n\nPeople over the age of 65 are part of the dependent population. If the increase in population is mainly on dependent age groups, the burden overworking population will be increased. This means that they will rely on the working population to produce goods and services they require and to pay taxes to finance old people’s homes and old-age pensions. Thus an aging population puts an increased burden on the working population. Of course, the working population could be increased by lowering the school leaving age and by raising the age of retirement to above 65 years. 5 However, both these developments are extremely unlikely for social and political reasons (for example, unemployment would be increased). The table below shows the percentage of working and dependent age groups in the US from 1901 to 2000:\n\nImmobility of Labor\n\nAn increase in population on dependent age groups will create immobility of labor. As people become older, they become less geographically and occupationally mobile. This may have a bad effect on the economy, as the new expanding industries will find it difficult to recruit suitable workers whereas the declining industries will make people unemployed who then do not move to another job or another area. Besides, increasing growth of population than that of the industries may result in both unemployment and underemployment. In 2000, the population of the United States was 282 million, out of which 81 million people were under the age of 17, and 35 million people were of age 65 and above 65. So, there were about 116 million dependents out of 282 million, assuming that the rest 166 million were working population. Now, United States is facing severe shortages and immobility of the labor force.\n\nBalance Of Payments Difficulties\n\nAn increase in population will have an enormous increase in the rate of consumption, resulting in more investment and fewer savings. A country may have a balance of payments difficulties because it may have to import more food and raw materials to satisfy the needs of its increasing population and industries than that of the exports. If the productivity of the economy is low due to the aging population, immobility of labor, and so on, then the visible import value may exceed the visible export value.\n\nOverpopulation illustration of Malthus\n\nOne of the earliest writers on population was Reverend Thomas Malthus. In his Essay on Population , which was published in 1798, Malthus suggested a theory of population growth. Malthus’ theory was that the growth of population was limited by the means of subsistence. In other words, he believed that population growth was limited by the ability of the population to provide food, clothing, shelter, and so on for itself. He was concerned mainly with population growth in the UK and argued that population growth had a tendency to outstrip the growth of the means of subsistence. He expected that the production of food and the other means of subsistence would not keep pace with the growth of the population. In these circumstances, an increase in population would reduce the amount of food and shelter available per head. Continued population growth would therefore lead to poorer diets and event starvation for some people. The Spread of disease, famine, and death provided what Malthus called positive checks on the population growth. He believed that the existence of these positive checks would ultimately limit the growth of an economy’s population.\n\nCleary Malthus’ predictions have not proved to be correct for the developed world. The main reason for this is that the means of subsistence have in fact increased faster than population growth. In particular, Malthus believed that food production would not keep pace with population growth because as the population increased, land which was less and less fertile would be drawn into use and would yield a smaller and smaller increase in the output of food. In other words, Malthus felt that the law of diminishing returns would apply to the use of extra acres of agricultural land. In fact, in the developed countries there has been widespread and increasing use of fertilizers and pesticides,.and the adoption of highly mechanized means of production. Both these trends have raised the output per acre of agricultural land so much; so that the increase in the output of agricultural land has exceeded the needs of the increase in population.\n\nHowever, the same is not true in the case of many of the world’s developing countries. Here, population growth has sometimes been at such a rate that Malthus’ predictions have unfortunately come true. Famine occurred in areas such as Ethiopia and Sudan. The relatively high death rates that characterize many developing countries are often due to the effects of poor diet. The lack of food and unbalanced nature of the diet in turn stems from the population growing faster than the means of subsistence.\n\nGrowth of Population in the United States\n\nDuring 1994, nearly 2.0 million people were added to the total population of the United States. This was due to a decline. It is projected that at least 1.0 million people from these were immigrants. It is estimated that if the population continues to grow in such a way in the United States, it is going to reach 570,954,000 by 2100.\n\nDue to the decline in death rates, the US economy may suffer from the curse of the aging population. Difficulties like the increasing burden on the working population and immobility of labor are going to decrease the productivity of industries. Thus, the US government may have to import more than that of the exports, resulting in a balance of payments difficulties. However, the government is taking measures to slow down the rate of immigration, which may have a positive impact on the economy.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rapid growth of population causes Overpopulation. Overpopulation has a negative effect on economic growth in consideration to food production per capita index, lower national income, consumption and investment conflict, and increasing burden on working population and balance of payments difficulties. Thus for economic policymakers, it is most important to keep the population at an optimum level.\n\nBibliography\n\nBurki, S. J.

      "Elitism and Democracy Relations Essay\n\nThe elite theory of democracy is a theory that explains the extent of the influence of power in the present society in running the affairs of the state. Essentially the crux of the theory emphasizes the influence and role of a small elite percentage of the total population of a country in holding immense power in running the affairs of that state irrespective of the results of the elections in a democratic set up. This influence is primarily the result of the financial support of various foundations and political funding of different political parties by these elite individuals or corporate houses which renders them with lot of authority and say in the political, economic and policy matters of the government in power. In this way these elitist groups are able to exercise immense power over decisions made by the government and corporations (BottomoreT, 1993). The elitist theory of democracy is opposed to the concept of pluralism and theory of state autonomy because such theorists believe that democracy is primarily in the nature of going as per utopian ideals.\n\nThe classical elite theory is the aristocratic version of elite theory in that it advocates that in important political and economic institutions people in authority enjoy maximum power, and that the basic factor differentiating this theory from the others is the fact of immense personal resources of the elitists who hold the power. Amongst the theorists of this theory, Pareto explained the concept by theorizing that such elites were those in any given society who were very competent and had accomplished in extraordinary terms than others, which render them with the elitist powers. According to Mosca, it is the organized group of people in any society who are able to wield the maximum power as elitists due to the propensity of majority of the people to remain unorganized. He had classified the world in two distinct groups; those that ruled, and those that are ruled, and that the elitists in any society are superior due to their high moral, intellectual and wealth capabilities and positions. A noted economist, Robert Michels has advocated the Iron Law of Oligarchy whereby elite groups run political and social institutions, and that organizations play a very important role in facilitating the bureaucratic structures in political organizations.\n\nAmongst the modern elite theorists, C Wright Mills came out with a different perspective on power systems by identifying that it were the elite power groups in the economic, political and military set ups in the country who command the maximum authority and power in making decisions as per their reasoning and consensus in most cases. His book ‘The Power Elite’ was very specific in explaining the evolvement of the concept of an elite democracy due to the gradual generation by way of rationalization of the industrial societies so that the mechanics of power enabled its concentration in a few hands, which came to be called the elite group. He described such developments as the degradation of democratic practices in advanced countries since the power and authority mostly lies with people who are not elected representatives of the people, thus jeopardizing the purpose of a democracy. Floyd Hunter did similar studies but on a micro scale whereby he thoroughly studied the patterns of power relationships in a regional city in search for the actual holders of power in running the administration in the city. By mapping the different hierarchies and the administrative working in the city he adopted a cross functional approach in concluding that there was no concept of a truly democratic framework operating in the city and instead it was a system of representative democracy in which the politicians, businessmen and clergy held the strings of power. The noted theorist M Schwarz used a similar strategy to examine the power structure comprising of the corporate elite in a democratic set up. James Burnham wrote a book The Managerial Revolution in which he stressed the importance of managers in having most functional powers in their hands instead of the businessmen and politicians. Robert D Putnam conveyed that it was the technological expertise and knowledge of administrators that enabled them to form specialist groups so that they wield maximum power in making strategic decisions (Berry J, 1999).\n\nIn view of the foregoing narration it is clear in the combination of different insights from the point of view of theories pertaining to different classes and organizations, that the economies of capitalist countries derive most of their strength from corporate communities. Capitalism has a strong role in the creation of a class of ownership, which wields immense political power and economic resources. This class has great influence in generating conflicts relating to government regulations, taxes, wages and working rules. In due course the capitalist class has been able to form several organizations, which give them the leverage to legitimize their class positions and thus have hold over conflicts amongst different classes. It is the consequent accrual of indispensable roles for this class that enables them to dominate the functioning of the government institutions as also of the business organizations (Mills C W, 1956). In this light it is correct to say that elite rule is inevitable in most democracies.\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Berry J. The New Liberalism, 1999, Washington: Brookings Institution Press.\n 2.

      "Antwone Fisher’s Developmental Life Stages Essay\n\nAntwone Fisher was a victim of circumstances. He believed that he had every right to be angry at the world because of what happened to him during his childhood and his teenage years. His escape to the U.S. Navy made him more prone to violent outbursts. It was not until he met a naval psychiatrist Davenport that he began to understand that he needed to stop thinking that he is a victim. But the psychiatrist, played by Denzel Washington in the movie, made him took another step forward and encouraged Antwone Fisher to reconcile with his biological parents as well as with his former foster parents. Antwone Fisher’s life story could also be understood using the principles gleaned from the study of Erik Erikson’s stages of psychosocial development.\n\nBackground\n\nAntwone Fisher was a desperate man. He is drowning from emotional as well as psychological problems that needed resolution. But ever since he was little, there was no one to take care of him and guide him. His father died while he was little and he was born in prison. His mother was a convict and therefore not in a position to take care of her little baby. Antwone Fisher was then placed in a foster home. It did not take long before he was transferred to another foster home. In his new home, the black woman who agreed to take care of him and three more foster kids seemed to be a decent person but this affirmative assessment quickly changed to the negative. Ms. Tate subjected Antwone Fisher to physical and emotional abuse.\n\nThe emotional and physical abuse came in the form of beatings, abusive language, deprivation, and humiliation. There were two scenes in the movie that vividly illustrated the sick mind of Ms. Tate. In the first scene, Ms. Tate punished Antwone and his foster brother down in the basement. Ms. Tate used a wet rag as a tool to break down Antwone’s spirit. The second scene showed Antwone accused of stealing. In this same scene, Ms. Tate humiliated him even when Antwone tried to explain the source of the funds. She succeeded in her goal to break Antwone’s spirit and this forced him to run away from home. In his desperation, Antwone enlisted into the U.S. Navy. Little did he know that he had taken the first step to heal and freedom.\n\nErik Erikson\n\nSigmund Freud is well-known all over the globe because he had contributed much in the field of human psychology. The same can be said of Erik Erikson who formulated a theory of psychosocial development that still is being discussed, analyzed, and used as the basis for numerous experiments. Erikson believed that a child develops in a predetermined order much like the life stages in a growth cycle of organisms – such as infancy, childhood, young adulthood, etc. (Heffner, 2001). Instead of focusing on the cognitive Erikson wanted to understand the impact of socialization when it comes to the development of individuals (Heffner, 2001). In the process, Erikson developed his famous stages of psychosocial development.\n\nThe different stages are listed as follows:\n\n  * Trust vs Mistrust (birth to one year )\n  * Autonomy vs. Shame and Doubt (one year to three years old)\n  * Initiative vs. Guilt (age three to age six)\n  * Industry vs. Inferiority (age six to puberty)\n  * Identity vs Role Confusion (age 13 to 21)\n  * Intimacy vs. Isolation (young adulthood)\n  * Generativity vs. Stagnation (age 40 to 60)\n  * Ego Integrity vs. Despair (60 years to death)\n\nFor the sake of this study, the discussion will focus on stage 6 (Intimacy vs. Isolation). By intimacy, Erikson meant that the well-adjusted person will be able to form close relationships and love another person. In fact, there are experts who interpreted Erikson’s stage 6 as the capacity to honor commitments even if it requires sacrifice (Sadock, 2007). Moreover, the indicator that an individual has successfully negotiated this stage is apparent when he or she can “…tolerate the fear of ego loss arising out of experiences of self-abandonment (e.g. sexual orgasm, moments of intensity in friendship, and aggression)” but if this stage is not successfully handled then the person is “…apt to become deeply isolated and self-absorbed” (Sadock, 2007). Thus, there are two possible consequences in each stage of development.\n\nIf the individual has successfully negotiated this sixth stage then he or she has the capacity to love and work. As mentioned above the meaning of love here is more than sexual intercourse, in fact, the person would have shown maturity if he or she is not carried away by emotions with regards to sex. If the individual failed to negotiate this stage then according to Erikson he or she will demonstrate distantiation [sic] which is interpreted as “…the readiness to repudiate, isolate, and if necessary destroy those forces and persons whose essence seems dangerous to one’s own” (Sadock, 2007). This is the reason why Antwone could not control his temper, could not establish good relations with the opposite sex, and could not relate well with people in authority.\n\nNegotiating Erikson’s Stages of Development\n\nAntwone Fisher is the best example of what could happen to a man unable to hurdle the sixth stage of development. He was unable to establish intimate relations with friends, loved ones, and even with the opposite sex. He was also unable to focus on his work in the U.S. Navy. The reason for his problem can be explained by distantiation [sic] and isolation. The girl in the movie, played by Ms. Bryant, had repeatedly given him signs that she was interested and at least ready to be close friends with Antwone but the young Mr. Fisher did not have the capacity for intimate relationships and so he repudiated her.\n\nWhile working in the U.S. Navy Antwone believed that he was justified in his emotional outbursts. It was a macho environment and men are trying to be men with ego oozing from their pores. He did not channel his anger and for many years he did not ask for help. He thought that it was just natural for him to feel that way. With very little provocation Antwone could be easily drawn to a fight like a moth to a flame and he had no control over this area of his life.\n\nIt was at this stage in his young adult life that he cried for help. Fortunately for him, his supplication was heard by Dr. Davenport who gave him the chance to pour out his heart and then guided him towards healing and forgiveness. Unknown to Antwone Fisher his love interest in the movie was also helping him to the path of healing and recovery. Dr. Davenport was like a father to him and he helped Antwone understand the impact of his past the reason why he is prone to outburst of anger.\n\nSupport and Hindrance\n\nThe odds were against him. A casual review of Erikson’s life stages will lead to the conclusion that Antwone Fisher was unable to negotiate each stage successfully. If this is true then it means that he could not trust people. It also means that he is plagued with self-doubt and shame making it impossible for him to develop close ties with others. He will forever feel inferior and to top it all there was no indication that he knew where he was going and what he will do with his life. This prompted him in one scene to cry out that he is lost and he had no idea how to continue living.\n\nThe only good thing that happened to him was that he enlisted in the U.S. Navy. This was not emphasized enough in the movie but if he was unable to join the navy then he would not have met two of the most important persons in his life. He would not have access to psychiatric help provided by the highly proficient Dr. Davenport and he would not have experienced the unconditional love of his girlfriend, the type of love he was unable to experience growing up.\n\nLife stages of the Therapist\n\nAntwone was fortunate that his therapist was highly competent. He was also fortunate that his psychiatrist is an African-American like him. So aside from giving expert help to Antwone, Dr. Davenport was also able to peer into his soul because just like Antwone, the good doctor knew fully well what it was like to grow up as a black man in America.\n\nBut instead of blaming the whites and racism as the main cause of Antwone’s problems, Dr. Davenport also pointed out that the “slave community” is partial to be blamed for not realizing that they inherited the sins of the past. According to Davenport, their ancestors assimilated the evil practices they have witnessed in the master-slave dynamic and then passed it on to their children. The scene where Ms. Tate applied excessive punishment to Antwone and his foster brothers is an example of this.\n\nCode of Ethics\n\nDr. Davenport exhibited competence as well as his ability to observe ethical standards that govern the client-therapist relationship. He was firm when he needed to but the use of discipline contrast significantly with the methods used by Ms. Tate. Dr. Davenport did not terrorize his patient and he did not look down on them. He always made Antwone Fisher feel that he is a person worthy of his time and effort.\n\nDr. Davenport strived hard to make Antwone feel that he is valued as a person. He also wanted Antwone to look into the future and be motivated by the desire to have a better life for himself and his future family. Aside from his competence and integrity Dr. Davenport also exhibited another quality that indicated he was an exceptional psychiatrist – he offered to work with Antwone pro bono and even though he was swamped with many patients he found the time to connect with Antwone and guided him out of the darkness of his soul.\n\nImpact of the Environment and other Social Factors\n\nIt is difficult to miss the impact of the environment and other social factors when it comes to Antwone Fisher’s maladaptive behavior. First of all, he had no parents. Erikson’s life stages were built on the premise that maladaptive behavior is possible if the child failed to experience love and care from his or her parents. One could just imagine what could happen to a child orphaned at a very young age. But in the case of Antwone, he did not only lost his parents to crime but was also assigned to a foster home that made his life hell. These factors help explain the maladaptive behavior of Antwone Fisher.\n\nAside from that Antwone lived in a foster home where his foster parent made it clear to him that he was not important. That was a major psychological impact on him. One could just imagine the feeling of not being wanted by anyone, not even by foster parents. This was exacerbated by the fact that the second foster parent that he was assigned to loved the idea of playing the brutal taskmaster. It is certain that Ms. Tate had issues to deal with but at that time she was confident that her child-rearing techniques were acceptable to God and man. She was wrong of course but no one could correct her. So Antwone ran away.\n\nWhen Antwone ran away he quickly realized that the outside world is as brutal as the foster home. There was no love and tenderness there but more than that he saw that black people are not exactly the most favored group in American society. It was pointed out earlier that the U.S. Navy was his salvation but without a doubt, Antwone did not see it that way. For him, the navy was his only available option and he was forced to go there. If he had a choice it was doubtful if he would still prefer to enlist. After all, there were hundreds of thousands of American kids who had the chance to go to college and not go through navy life.\n\nPoverty was like quicksand for Antwone, once he was on it, the more he struggled the more he would sink. At this stage, he felt that there was no hope for him. In the navy the people were indifferent and when he first met Dr. Davenport he felt that he was letting him down too. Antwone believed that Dr. Davenport was just like the rest of the people that he met in his life – they were mindful only of their own business and did not care at all what will happen to the guy next to them.\n\nAntwone’s deep feelings of mistrust, shame, doubt, and insecurity were overwhelming him and he had to express himself in violent terms so that people will take notice and at the same time allow himself to create a wall where no one can enter. It was a good thing that Dr. Davenport did not give up on him and worked hard to gain his confidence. It was also a good thing that Dr. Davenport was competent enough to know precisely what to do with Antwone Fisher.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe life story of Antwone Fisher was a perfect example of what will happen to a person if unable to negotiate the different stages of psychosocial development as prescribed by Erikson. His problems were very much illustrative of the sixth stage of development where a person either learns the beauty of love and the satisfaction of work or to the contrary learns isolation and creates an impenetrable wall that will exclude everyone.\n\nIt is a good thing that he enlisted in the navy and then got the chance to work with Dr. Davenport. He was also fortunate to have the chance to learn love from a friend. Dr. Davenport recognized the wall that Antwone was trying to erect around him and the good psychiatrist was patient, caring, and skilled enough to demolish the wall brick by brick. In the end, he was able to guide Antwone out of the dark woods and into the light.\n\nImpact on the Social Worker\n\nI was surprised by the fact that someone was able to fully understand the life stages each person has to go through in their life journey. It was a testament to the genius of Erik Erikson. His insight into human psychology is simply amazing and the world of psychology will be forever indebted to him. It does not require one to be a psychologist or a psychiatrist to fully appreciate what he has done. Even a social worker or a guidance counselor can learn much from studying his principles of psychosocial development.\n\nThe sixth stage (Intimacy vs. Isolation) is one of the most important of Erikson’s developmental stages because this is a tool that can help counselors and social workers deal with the most problematic stage of a person’s life. It gave me the ability to see the importance of being a young adult and the tremendous pressure felt by those who are negotiating this stage. This is the time when a young man or woman decides on a career and in many cases, this is also the stage where people seriously consider marriage or get seriously engaged with someone. There is no need t elaborate on what will happen if they will fail to negotiate this stage of the development process.\n\nA correct understanding of this life stage coupled with a mastery of the ethical standards guiding the therapist-client relationship will help the social worker change a person from being a nuisance to society to a productive citizen. A clear understanding of Erikson’s life stages will equip the social worker with the necessary background knowledge that will help him or she encourages the patient to open up. In the movie, the breakthrough came when Dr. Davenport was skilled enough to ask the right questions.\n\nReferences\n\nHeffner, C.

      "The American Association of Retired Persons Essay\n\nThe American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) is a non-profit organization that assists individuals aged 50 years and older in augmenting the quality of life by assisting them in achieving financial freedom and in maintaining health (Bethell, 2007). The services of the AARP are available all around the United States, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. It currently serves approximately 38 million members in terms of health care provision and insurance services. The AARP is committed to providing guidance, information, advocacy, and service to its members for them to feel a positive social change as they grow older. The AARP Foundation is an associated charity institution that offers protection, security, and empowerment to the elderly through the assistance of its volunteers, donors, and sponsors.\n\nThe AARP follows its health care model that aims to improve the quality and efficiency of health care assistance, to increase the accessibility to health care services for various populations, to increase the price and quality transparency, and to ascertain accountability for all services received. To achieve these goals, the AARP has linked with Aetna and United Healthcare, which improves both benefits and the marketing of the health insurance industry. The AARP is thus a strong organization, mainly due to the size of its membership, hence any linkage with other insurance companies can be maintained and even strengthened more.\n\nOne policy of the AARP involves the improvement of the quality and efficiency of health care for its members (Barry and Basler, 2007). This policy feature is associated with routine measurement of the performance of its plans. It also encourages highly efficient health care options to its members, as well as the application of information technologies in keeping and maintaining patient health records. The use of prescribing medications electronically is also presented, which helps in keeping the patients safe from errors of drug consumption, as well as duplication of services, which are deemed to be wasteful in terms of money, time and effort. Such improvement may also advance the mode of access to health test results and other information.\n\nAnother policy being promoted by the AARP involves the availability of health care services to varied populations at reasonable prices. Such feature concentrates on outreach programs that provide materials and services to different communities using other languages that apply to specific ethnic groups. This element may be a valuable feature in interacting with its members, so that the patients may freely express their needs and concerns regarding health care and its associated services. It is also very useful in making its non-English speaking members understand what has been assessed or what is needed to help them in their health maintenance, including chronic care and disease management. The use of the multi-language approach also prevents miscommunications and misunderstandings between the AARP and its members. The benefits of such effort will include a greater chance for its members to understand any information that is provided to them, including the quality, effectiveness, and costs of the health care services. It also allows the members to make their own decisions about their health care plans because they are empowered to interact and ask questions about aspects that concern their health.\n\nThe AARP health policy also includes the regular monitoring and assessment of its health plan and its subsequent dissemination of information to its members (Gearon, 2006). Such a feature is valuable in terms of the AARP’s goal in continuously improving the health care performance and efficiency of its plans. And it is also known that the most reliable way of improving any health care plan is by gathering the comments and suggestions of the end-users, which are the members themselves, who directly apply such health care plans to their daily lives. The AARP has developed several instruments that facilitate their evaluation of their health care policy. The Health Plan Employer Data Information Set (HEDIS) allows the AARP to quantitatively describe the health care policy’s feature according to the rules and guidelines set by the National Committee for Quality Assurance. Another measurement tool is the Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS), which is a standard test that determines the member’s evaluation of the policy plan. A third measurement tool is the eValue8, which is an analytical measurement test that is run by employers and other employer-based organizations to appraise the features of the healthcare plan.\n\nThe AARP appraises its healthcare policy and features every year and comparatively assesses the results of the last 7 years of performance. Such a comprehensive review of the policy oftentimes leads to points of improvement. These are then actively considered and incorporated into the working health policy and its members are likewise advised of the new changes. Any other comments or suggestions are freely expressed by its members, and the AARP at the same time welcomes such constructive criticisms. Using such a scenario for the implementation of its health policy, the AARP is a very strong and effective health care provider. The AARP is also unique in its target beneficiary of serving members of 50 years of age and older.\n\nReferences\n\nBarry P and Basler B (2007): Healing our system. AARP Bulletin.

      "Owning & Operating a Family Business Essay\n\nA unique feature of family business is its inherent multiple and interdependent roles. The uniqueness of family business is that members of family are affected by an overlap of family, business, and ownership subsystems, with owners playing simultaneous roles among these three subsystems. These roles can be complementary, but they can also lead to confusion and create role conflict owing to differences in values between the family and business subsystems. Moreover, overlap between family and business can impede effective role performance and decision-making because of difficulties separating business decisions from family objectives.\n\nIn general, family business is defined as a company (business enterprise) managed and controlled by one family. For instance, in the United States, family firms are less likely to be engaged in manufacturing and business services. A larger proportion of service businesses are family companies in the United Kingdom. More recently, family businesses are more likely to be over-represented in such industries as agriculture, distribution, hotels and catering. Family’s businesses are, however, under-represented in the banking, financing, insurance and business services sectors (Irving and Sharma, 2005). Because of their numerical importance, the performance of family businesses is of critical importance to the development of an economy. The key difference is that, in the family business all stages of the process are likely to be influenced by family values, goals and relations. Moreover, the close inter-relationship between family and business often leads to a mix up of issues from the different contexts (Longenecker et al, 2006). The remarkable feature of family business is that it joins three elements: the family, the ownership and the business. “The combination of patient financial capital, social networks, and human capital provided by these members increases the probability of survival of new ventures and helps to sustain the business during poor economic times” (Irving and Sharma, 2005, p. 13).\n\nThe main advantages of family business involve common values and traditions, strong commitment and loyalty, stability and decreased costs. Family values remain extremely important in the small family business, where a working family life seems to be a condition for business creation and development. The creation and development of a family business is one of major motivators for entrepreneurs (beside the need to create and compete). In the family business, family concerns blend with entrepreneurial forces and managerial technologies. Research into family business also recognizes the tensions between family life and business life, entrepreneurship, management, and family concerns are all aspects of organized (economic) life and therefore important to every family business (Longenecker et al, 2006). Their co-existence becomes especially obvious in medium-sized firms that have experienced an inter-generational succession. The interfaces between the three systems ‘family’, ‘ownership’, and ‘management’ determine the outcome of the succession. Entrepreneurship again is left out and use of the notion of ‘system’ signals a functionalist/consensus approach with little concern for recognizing, let alone nurturing, the tensions between proposed aspects of the family business (Irving and Sharma, 2005).\n\nThe main disadvantages of family business are family conflicts and lack of business skills and strategic vision, need to be better than non-family employees, difficult to raise liquidity, “In some family companies, daily operations are hampered by conflict; in others, the challenge is a high turnover rate among nonfamily employees” (Challenges of Managing Family Businesses, n.d.). Conflicts between the family system and the business system typically are considered to be dysfunctional from the point of view of the firm. The family system weaknesses are ‘inward-looking’ and ‘minimizing change’. Stagnant micro-firms pay a high price for independence declining both entrepreneurship and management. Many family businesses, though, import needed management technology through their hired accountants and absorb ideas about renewal through peer exchange (Longenecker et al, 2006).\n\nTo succeed and remain competitive, family business should have a clear vision of its strategic developments and “a clear mission, a statement of purpose and goals” (Challenges of Managing Family Businesses, n.d.). Successful medium-sized family businesses materialize continued entrepreneurship. The organizations all turned out to simultaneously accommodate each of the three ideologies. The ability to actively exploit tensions between different strategies may be identified as the unique quality needed to energies entrepreneurial processes also under the pressure of institutionalization and a fading original entrepreneurial spirit in the multi-generation family business. Also, family members should recognize that “rights and responsibilities are different at home and at work” (Challenges of Managing Family Businesses, n.d.). A living democracy is constituted by multiple and contrasting ideologies. In this case, “the leader of the family business must not take sides with any member of the family” Challenges of Managing Family Businesses, n.d.). Owners of family businesses face challenges not only from operational business areas such as competitive markets, planning, financing, and marketing, but also from issues associated with ownership and family. Given these systems, it has been argued that family business owners require special characteristics and experiences to maintain an appropriate balance between business interests and those of the family. Family members should avoid ‘the status quo’ position which prevents business growth and profitability. In order to avoid dissatisfaction and complaints, the leader should introduce equity in distribution of resources and fair pay (benefits, salaries, fringe benefits).\n\nIn sum, family business represents a complex business enterprise influenced by strong personal values and traditions of the family. Family enterprises often involve multiple and interdependent roles, and owners in these businesses can be susceptible to greater inter-role conflict than non-family business owners.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Human Rights Violation in Kosovo Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nKosovo has been experiencing problems as a result of discrimination which was based on religion. The Serbs could not accept Islamic because of their strong Christian faith. This made them to be persecuted by the Turkish, and this increased the number of Albanians who occupied Kosovo in return. The paper has discussed the massive violation of Human Rights in Kosovo, The International Community’s reaction and actions to the Kosovo crisis, and i have given my suggestions to the community on regard to Kosovo crisis.\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to reports with regard to Kosovo, the Human Rights are extensively violated in the region. Before the 19 th century the Albanians were under Ottoman Empire, and they fought war to get freedom. Later in the century, the region was given over to Serbia, the subsequently vacated their land, and joined Turkey, leaving Serbia to occupy their land.\n\nHuman right violation\n\nThe Kosovo human rights were violated in very many aspects. The violation did not spare the children’s rights, instead the Kosovo Albanian children are denied the publicized rights. The right holds a lot for the people, and in this case we will consider the violations systematically. Despite the fact that regular investigations were carried out in Kosovo regarding human rights violation by the international communities and and other individuals the Miloservic-the ruling power , he was only given a fake warning. Although the International Community, visited Kosovo they did not visit the Albanians and so they they got little information regarding the violations.\n\nAlthough Kosovo has most fertile land in Balkans, and with variety of mineral resources, the people in the region had the poorest living standards. The farm products and minerals such as nickel, coal, goal, lead, and gold among others were barely used as raw material for the Serbia industries. When the Ethnic Albanians tried to raise their grievances, they were arrested and the prison term that was usually given was not considerable, because the minimum years one could take was six years and in some cases one can be put in prison for even twenty years. The individual were also subjected to massive convictions and trials which shows the discrimination that existed in the region.\n\nThe Serbia parliament dissolved the Kosovo government, assembly and canceled the regions autonomy. This was achieved through army forces and police involvement, and the cancellation had subsequent effects to the Albanians. (Dagmar 2003, pp. 107).Their access to current information was limited by banning the daily newspaper that existed, and stopping the radio and TV broadcasting in the region. This was followed by restricting the Albanians from accessing national and the universities libraries, and abolishment of all scientific institutions. All learning institutions as well as other social facilities were overtaken by Serbs. This was achieved by sacking all Albanians who were working in the institutions and dismissing of all individuals who were suspected to have nationalist sympathy from their workplace, and replacing them with the Serbs. The Albanians living was threatened, and many of them were thrown out of their living places, to the streets. According to the rights, the Albanians had the right to live in state apartments, but due to the violations, they were forced out of the apartments, and their houses in the apartments were occupied by the Serbs.\n\nBetween 1990 and 1995, many Kosovos lost their jobs and were forced to migrate from Kosovo to other countries and mostly in western Europe. In cases where the foreign countries tries to send them back or hesitates to offer asylum, the Serb authorities never accepts them back. Once the Albanians have moved out of the Kosovo, the Serbs take total advantage and control over the left property and space to an extent they holding these people at the airport for very long time without caring, and after the duration in airport the Serbs just chase them back to the countries that had sent them back to their original country. In most cases they are not merely held in the airport, rather, they are under arrest, and this means that any other Kosovo prison can be used leave alone the airport. In few cases when these people are allowed back in Kosovo, the people are continually subjected to worse discrimination and intimidation. The acceptance is usually minimal such that even dead bodies of the former Kosovo people are not allowed to be buried in Kosovo. Despite all the above mistreatment of the Kosovo, and their efforts to inform the International community during their frequent visits they were not given a chance, leaving the community ignorant.\n\nInternational community reaction on Kosovo Human Rights Violation\n\nThe international community’s attitude is not clearly defined, thus hard to differentiate human rights and national rights. The interest of the international community in Kosovo are based on institutional ambitions, great power Internet and media attention. The community basis its consideration on government competition thus producing exaggerated and biased arguments. The international community views the massive violation of human rights as a matter that requires the international concern (HRFDC 1992).The international concern expressed by the international community has raised a number of rules networks and institution in the various organizational levels, but the international community attention was not adequate and this led to further violation of the rights. The humanitarian and refugees law’s principles were further breached. The Kosovo massive human rights violation took long to be addressed reducing the acquisition of the cause and effect of the Kosovo crisis.\n\nThe international community took the Serbs side. The community which is led by the United States opposes the Kosovo independence, and also opposed to disarm the violent secessionist in Kosovo by opposing Belgrade force (Johnstone 2000). Although the community has no independent stand in the issue and this has not helped Kosovo because secessionist continue to use arms, fearing Serbs on the blame. This has been evidenced in the case where the Kosovo population united and participated against Germans to achieve liberation, in accordance to the promises which had been made to them concerning self determination especially after the second world war, the promise was broken, and the Kosovo people were subjected to twenty one years of neglect, despite the fact that they had won, and their rights were consequently violated. There was a period of weapon collection which was carried out to the ethnic Albanians between 1954 and 1957, an activity which coerced about one hundred and ninety five thousand of the Kosovo Albanian population to emigrate to Turkey. The ethnic Albanian went into riot which made the region to be declared autonomous. Although the ethnic Albanian have been demanding international intervention and the international community argue to be on their side. This has brought contradictions because the Serbs also argue that the community is on their side.\n\nMy suggestions\n\nThe humanitarian and political causes of the human rights violation in Kosovo need to be determined, and the Yugoslavian federal republic should be reconstructed not on the basis of other issues but basically on the human rights. This should be achieved by a governance that is effective and efficient not only on its rules and mandates but all aspects that are likely to involve legal protection of human rights and enhance freedom in the region. The rights should not discriminate any individual regardless of religion, race or ethnic identity. This means that the Albanians and Serbs should have equal consideration. Unlike in the past where the international communities monitored the human rights on Serbs perspectives, the communities should access the entire Kosovo as well as other Yugoslavia regions.\n\nLong term peace can only be achieved by understanding considering and protecting all people, especially the displaced and refugees. This understanding should not be limited to the rights adherence, but should also enable the asylum seekers and other displaced individuals to freely return to their original country without.\n\nThe international community should enhance compensation of the victims to enable them recover their property. The community need to come up with better mechanisms that readily. The refugees should be provided with security that guarantees them safety and dignity.\n\nThe international community need to take one side and mainly target at helping in adherence of human right law for the sake of the Kosovo people, because as long as their position is ambiguous, the violation continues and the Kosovo people continue to suffer.\n\nThe International community need to base their international relations free from use of force and threat in political independence of state or its territorial integrity, and should developed international law to handle, the human rights violations that are as massive as the Kosovos. These international law should be set in a way that will enable states to respond to the crisis using a wide range of peaceful responses whether individually collectively or by engaging in international organizations. The law should take non threatening counter measures which are free from aimed forces.\n\nReferences\n\nDagmar, Skrpec. ”American and European’s reaction to Kosovo.” SAIS Review 23 (2003): 93-111.\n\nHuman Rights and Freedom defense council. ”Knocking on Europe’s Conscience”.

      "Space and Aeronautics Market in Saudi Arabia Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Political and Economic Development Context\n 3. Market Needs and Information\n 4. Space Needs\n 5. Conclusions\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nSpace and aeronautics constitute one of the most perspective fields of manufacturing and research in the transportation industry. The world’s growing economy requires more planes, components, and systems to navigate around the world while reducing the costs and times of ferrying goods across the continents. Aviation market in Saudi Arabia is growing rapidly, following the liberalization of economics in the commercial flight sector. The growth rates for the country exceeded 8% in 2017, which is expected to increase further in the following years. It also represents the largest aerospace market in the Middle East, with nearly 30% of all commercial and military airplanes registered in the kingdom (“Connecting the Aviation”). The purpose of this paper is to analyze and outline the market needs for space and aeronautics technology in Saudi Arabia.\n\nPolitical and Economic Development Context\n\nIn 2017, Saudi Arabia adopted the Saudi 2030 vision program, which suggested large-scale investments meant to diversify the economy and provide additional sources of revenue. This strategy is meant to reduce the dependence on oil prices and transform the kingdom into a global transportation hub between Europe, Africa, and Asia, taking advantage of the strategic positioning in between the continents. Between 2017 and 2018, the Saudi government increased the investment spending into space and aeronautics to 293 million USD, with expectations of generating revenue of 77 million dollars (“Connecting the Aviation”).\n\nAviation is an important position in the diversification and expansion of the Saudi economy. The country took a lesson from the UAE that invested heavily in its aviation sector in Dubai, which provides between 27% and 35% of the city’s entire revenue flow (“Connecting the Aviation”). According to the development plans, aviation will be an important catalyst that would propel the Saudi economy forward by helping establish new airports and promote the expansion of existing facilities. The country hopes to attract additional investors, entrepreneurs, and participants to the project.\n\nMarket Needs and Information\n\nSaudi Arabia has a well-developed infrastructure to support the burgeoning aerospace industry, with 27 airports dotting the kingdom (“Connecting the Aviation”). Out of them, six handle international flights, eight provide support for regional transportation, and 13 are dedicated to domestic, commercial hauls. However, one of the primary market needs in this area revolves around the upgrading of existing airports and the construction of new ones. These trends are justified by financial and market forecasts, which anticipate significant growth in the number of passengers traveling to or through the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, following the growth of the tourism industry. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) estimates an increase in passenger demand from 3.8 billion in 2016 to 7.8 billion air travelers a year by 2035 (“Connecting the Aviation”).\n\nThe major aircraft producers and operators are already preparing for this eventuality, as evidenced by the Global Market Forecast of 2017-2036, provided by Airbus, which claims that the Middle Eastern region will add substantial capacity to the market (“Global Market Forecast”). Boeing’s Current Market Outlook 2017-2036 estimates that between 5,000 to 6,000 new aircraft will be delivered to the Middle East in the next 20 years, roughly split between the major producers and competitors (“Current Market Outlook”). Smaller companies are also preparing to meet the needs and demands of the region. With Saudi Arabia constituting around 30% of the entire market, the needs of the region by 2035 are estimated at around 2,000 airships; This makes the Kingdom a very desired investment target in the future as well as a competitive platform for numerous aircraft producers.\n\nSpace Needs\n\nWhile the majority of the country’s aerospace needs are revolving around aviation, Saudi Arabia also has a developing space industry. The recently-created Saudi Arabia space agency is already addressing the country’s needs for space exploration by acquiring over 1 billion dollars in yearly investments. This agency addresses the primary demand in Saudi Arabia, which includes space satellites to be used for commercial and military purposes. The primary needs of the local companies and agencies include geolocation, weather prediction and control, satellite TV and the Internet, as well as various military purposes. The latter is understandable, as Saudi Arabia and the countries of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) remain some of the only stable governments in the region. Saudi Arabia is also engaged in localized conflicts with Yemeni religious rebels, further increasing the need for independent satellite reconnaissance. Saudi Arabia is cooperating with NASA and Roscosmos in order to get these satellites to orbit.\n\nConclusions\n\nSaudi Arabia’s market needs for avionics and aerospace products is already large and is expected to grow considerably in the next 20 years. The industry attracts significant investments from all over the world in order to ensure the upgrading of the local infrastructure, the provision of over 2,000 planes, and the creation of various satellites to be launched into orbit. The country’s market needs are estimated to grow even higher, as motivated by the increase in population numbers as well as the overall tourism activity around the world.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“Connecting the Aviation and Aerospace Industry to Saudi Arabia.” Saudi Airshow, 2019, Web.\n\n“Current Market Outlook 20117-2036.” Boeing, 2017, Web.\n\n“Global Market Forecast 2018-2037.” Airbus, 2018, Web.\n",
      "Social Aspect of Music: The Flairs Band Essay\n\nSocial aspect in any music enables the music to have meaning and to be more enjoyable to the audience and also the performers.\n\nThere are a variety of social dynamics of musical groups that can be drawn from these projects. These social dynamics are expressed as a result of variation in volume of sound. Socially, this variation of sounds creates difference acceptance of music by audience. In the group of jazz music, social dynamics portrayed how the group related with audience. Jazz is mainly played by young people who do not think about the audience response to the dynamic of music and therefore they played as fast possible without minding about the audience. According to jazz members they play for audience when they are listening and if they are not listening they just play for themselves without minding whether they are entertaining any group or not. Jazz believes in active participation by audience and that when they play their best.\n\nAccording to Flairs, the group was mainly composed of social fun loving members who wanted to enjoy themselves, therefore these members produced dynamic music for they use different voices such as bass, tenor and baritone. Their music ranged from popular chart to classic which was liked and attracted many audience (Enrlich, 2000).\n\nThe University of Michigan symphony band had a wonderful social dynamic in attracting its audience since it had a ‘kick it up a watch’ when playing for a full house. Since there were many people watching, this encouraged musicians to improve their ability and share music. Performers are less motivated to play for fewer audiences.\n\nThere are some sociological differences among the group based on the music that they perform. In the case of jazz group, it does not seem to care about the audience in any way since they play their music fast and when playing, if audiences are not attentive they do not take caution but instead they just play for themselves.\n\nIn Flairs, their interest is basically based on attracting their audience to the best of their ability. This starts from the way they introduce their performance and their tone set up also takes care of the interest of the audience. Also they do much of entertainment through their dancing, singing and stage presentation which makes their performance livelier and attracts more audience.\n\nAlso, the range of their songs from popular chart to classical music makes it different from others. Socially, this group staged their performance in such as way that it will suit its audience which encompassed on humorous twist of some songs to fit the campus life.\n\nThe symphony band used its personal relationship with conductor and this enabled them to work well with people. This music was created mainly through gestures and therefore it did not attract much audience since most of them in campus are young and could mostly prefer when the music is presented in speech form (Bose, 1934).\n\nThe Flairs had the best sociological analysis since they socially struggled to do anything it took to win the attention of audience and to ensure that they are fully contented with the kind of music they played.\n\nTheir project ensured that the group of audience which was basically campus students was met by giving their music different dynamics. There performance from rehearsal to stage presentation had all the aspects met since their main aim was to build a vocal octet which could produce a divine harmony.\n\nThe main project which best portrays sociological analysis is production and presentation of music. This project missed out some of sociological insights especially in jazz and University of Michigan symphony band.\n\nSome of them include:\n\n  * Failure to produce dynamics which could attract more audience.\n  * Ignorance during presentation by not considering the group they are performing for. For example, old people’s music cannot be presented the same way as that of youths.\n  * They failed to understand the reasons for their presentation by not bothering a lot with audience interest.\n\nThese factors if well incorporated in music can produce quality music which will meet the social insight of the music.\n\nSome of the issues that jazz need to take into consideration are means of overcoming the stigma being faced by musicians and understand that every profession had its stigmatizing factor (Thomas, 1974). They should not allow themselves to be looked down upon but instead they are supposed to prove their profession by producing quality music which meets all the challenges stated.\n\nFor Flairs, they should pose questions to their groups such as:\n\n  * Have we met the goal of building an octet to produce harmony band?\n  * What challenges are we facing during production and presentation of our music?\n\nTherefore, social dynamics in music helps the audience to appreciate the music being played.\n\nReference:\n\nThomas V.

      "School Employee Training Reporting Scheme Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nReporting Scheme\n\nThe introduction of a Blackboard learning management system (LMS) into a school setting would require extensive training of all teachers involved. It would enable them to use the system effectively as part of their daily routines and allow them to teach the students to use it as well (Nyabawa, 2016). The proposed reporting scheme would a four-level setup, including the following evaluation criteria:\n\n  * Level 1. Participant reaction. This part of the reporting scheme is required in order to grade the participant’s reaction to the proposed innovation and change. Gathering this data would help guide the change management and leadership process by gauging how willing and enthusiastic the participants are (Watt, 2014). The criteria evaluated in this level include the opinion towards Blackboard, the willingness to train, and the perceived benefits/downsides of the implementation.\n  * Level 2. Participant learning. This level will include the knowledge already possessed by the learner, the knowledge they gained over the course of training, and potential educational goals for the future (Watt, 2014). This information is required to evaluate the progress throughout the training intervention.\n  * Level 3. Knowledge transfer. This report form will evaluate how well does the participant implement the newfound knowledge at the workplace (Watt, 2014). Since the proposed intervention relates to the implementation of Blackboard in a school setting, the criteria will revolve around its use in the teaching process.\n  * Level 4. Organizational impact. The final level of the reporting scheme will concern itself with the transformation of the participant’s workplace (Frazier & Hearrington, 2017). It will evaluate the effectiveness of Blackboard as a learning management system.\n\nThis scheme addresses all of the potential variables required for guiding and evaluating the proposed organizational chain. It is based on the Monitoring, Evaluation, and Learning (MEL) framework, which is often implemented in teaching projects (Luederitz et al., 2017).\n\nImportance of Evaluating and Reporting in Training\n\nTraining employees is one of the most important HR-related processes in an organization or a company (Watt, 2014). It revolves around teaching specific skills in order to maximize the efficiency and quality of labor. Leading for-profit and non-profit organizations conduct training sessions for their workers on a regular basis, in order to maintain their competitive edge. Educating personnel is a costly venture; it requires space, instruments, educational leaders, and related software (Moldovan, 2016). In a government-funded facility, such as school, the budgetary constraints dictate the need for thrifty spending. In other words, every dollar spent on training should be paid off in increased productivity and quality of education for students.\n\nEvaluation and reporting play an important part in determining and ensuring the cost-efficiency of the process (Frazier & Hearrington, 2017). Without the means of doing so, change directors would not be able to tell whether their intervention is effective or not. As a result, the overall costs of the venture would increase, while the efficiency would fall drastically, with money being spent on potentially ineffective measures (Czaja & Sharit, 2016). Therefore, evaluation and reporting are necessary for any educational intervention.\n\nThe reporting scheme presented in the above section acknowledges different stages of evaluation that would occur during training. First, it is required to evaluate the readiness of the personnel for the prospective change in their daily routines (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). Humans are naturally resistant to the established patterns in their work and life. The value of such knowledge to managers is expressed through the ability to prepare relative change acceptance programs. For example, based on the results of opinion reports, it would be possible to gather everyone together and explain the need and the potential benefits of training. It is seen as a good way to raise morale and improve the willingness of the participants to accept new information. Proceeding with training without conducting a preliminary evaluation increases the risks of alienating the workers.\n\nThe participant learning stage of the evaluation provides valuable insights about the current progress of the program (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). Managers need to know how much their employees have learned and how well did they understand the material. This type of evaluation is important for several reasons. First, it indicates the effectiveness of teaching processes: If the results are low, something must be done to improve the scores. As a result, money and time could be saved, as without this critical data, the organization is doomed to using a potentially ineffective teaching process while being completely blind to the outcomes.\n\nReports about knowledge transfer and organization can show managers the effectiveness of training in the working environment (Kirkpatrick & Kirkpatrick, 2016). Training is dead without application, and low levels of engagement with the new-found skills and technology may indicate that the vector of innovation was chosen incorrectly. Alternatively, the employees were never on board with training in the first place. Such situations are frequent when training was forced on workers without explaining or justifying the changes to the existing working process. The information presented in this part of the evaluation process may also be used to forecast and formulate future interventions.\n\nAs it is possible to see, every part of the evaluation and reviewing process provides valuable information to managers and the organization. It does not matter if it is a bank or a school, as training is a necessary part of performance and evolution. Evaluation is an important component of the process, enabling accuracy, effectiveness, and cost-efficiency, without which time and money would be considered wasted.\n\nReferences\n\nCzaja, S.

      "Solving the Supreme Problem: 100 Years of Selection and Recruitment Essay (Article Review)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Recruitment: History and Practical Utility\n 3. Current Research and Applications\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe article “Solving the Supreme Problem: 100 Years of Selection and Recruitment at the Journal of Applied Psychology ” provides a summary of the research into recruitment and selection over the journal’s history. It goes into detail about these subjects, starting with the history of related articles published in the journal, explaining the current research in the area, and discussing relevant research and practice issues. This paper will provide a reaction to the information about recruitment contained in the article, particularly that related to today’s advances in technology and connectivity.\n\nRecruitment: History and Practical Utility\n\nRecruitment is described as a variety of activities aimed at bringing potential applicants to an organization. Early research published in the Journal of Applied Psychology established the “focus on the job and work characteristics that affect applicants’ perceptions of job attractiveness” (Ployhart, Schmitt, & Tippins, 2017, p. 293). This demonstrated to practitioners the importance of factors that ultimately attract applicants by contributing to job satisfaction. As technology developed, the Internet became a major factor in connectivity and, therefore, an important tool in recruiting, although research on its effects and methodologies tends to lag behind application significantly. In practical terms, studies into these subjects give practitioners guidelines and measures to determine effective methods of attracting and influencing prospective applicants.\n\nCurrent Research and Applications\n\nCurrent issues concerning recruitment are related to the ever-accelerating development of culture and technology. With the advent of the Internet and globalization and a general increase of competition among firms for skilled specialists, additional emphasis needed to be placed on using technology and attracting a diverse workforce. For instance, social networks now serve as both sources of data on potential applicants and a tool for companies to generate and source candidates. Research into the means of gathering and analyzing this data and subsequently using it for recruitment gives practitioners the tools to tap into previously unavailable pools of the workforce. In practice, these issues, combined, relate to the uneven distribution of skilled candidates across the world and, therefore, companies’ ability to discover, recruit, and hire specialists from abroad.\n\nCurrent trends in technology and social attitudes have increased the visibility and importance of a firm’s image and reputation. Therefore, organizations’ recruitment strategies now include creating, maintaining, and communicating their image through available channels, such as social networks. Furthermore, as in the case of large corporations, potential applicants may be recruited from among the firm’s consumers — people who may be familiar with its products or reputation or have otherwise interacted with it. Therefore, the importance of a firm’s image is highlighted, as it can affect a candidate before they even decide to start their job search. Ployhart et al. (2017) note that there are now connections between “marketing, recruitment, and organizational image” (p. 294). Consequently, research into how an organization’s public image forms and how it affects the perception of said organization has significant ramifications for practitioners’ future strategies.\n\nGiven the rapid development of technology, firms need to ensure that their recruitment practices are up-to-date and for researchers to provide a theoretical base to guide these practices. The article points out that such guidance is lacking, as practical development “is often proceeding more by trial and error than by systematic, evidence-based efforts” (Ployhart et al., 2017, p. 295). This lack of guidance is one of the possible reasons for the multitude of recent backlashes caused by companies attempting to update their image. Therefore, it is vital to consider the impact of an organization’s communications on public perception, even if they are not directly connected with the recruitment process.\n\nConclusion\n\nRecruitment has always been an essential part of an organization’s function. As the scholarly understanding of this area grows and applicable technology develops, so do the methods and strategies utilized. New social values, avenues of communication, and ease of information access cause organizations to attempt new approaches to recruitment. However, practical applications tend to be developed through trial-and-error because there is a significant delay between new technology becoming popular and rigorous research on it being published. This gap presents an interesting challenge for researchers and practitioners alike.\n\nReference\n\nPloyhart, R. E., Schmitt, N., & Tippins, N. T. (2017).

      "Astronomy: the Nature of Life Report (Assessment)\n\nArticle Analysis\n\nThe article reviewed in the scope of this paper was written by Mirko Bassen and Volker Muller and published in Extremophiles journal in 2016. The article reviews a particular type of extremophiles, namely Thermoanaerobacteraceae . The mechanisms described in this paper, however, can easily be applied to astronomy research.\n\nThe article states that thermophilic life is ancient, dating back as far as the appearance of water on the surface of Earth. Back then, water temperature varied between 55 C o (131 F) on the poles, to 95 C o (203 F) around active underwater volcanoes (Bassen and Muller 15). Thermophilic bacteria had to survive in these extreme conditions, and do so even up to this day.\n\nOne of the most interesting features of thermophilic bacteria is their ability to survive in the conditions of extreme heat. There is a potential of finding similar organisms (or signs of their existence) on planets with extreme temperatures (such as Venus or Mars). Both planets feature signs of water existing on their surfaces, meaning that thermophilic acetogenic organisms could have once inhabited them.\n\nThermophilic acetogenic organisms conserve energy through a process of acetate formations with hydrogen and carbon dioxide acting as donors and acceptors of electrodes. The earliest examples of bacteria formed their biomass from CO2 or CO and exploited various existing chemical ingredients to conserve energy (Bassen and Muller 16). Based on this article, some of the universal properties of life must include mechanisms of surviving extreme temperatures, the ability to extract energy, and the capability of utilizing elements present in the atmosphere for gaining biomass and energy.\n\nArticle Summaries\n\nThe first article, written by Christopher Brooks, analyzes some of the organisms on Earth that can survive in extreme conditions. Such creatures include red flat bark beetle, desert ants, Himalayan jumping spiders, and tardigrades, all of which survive exposure to extreme heat or cold (Brooks). I think it is amazing how complex organisms managed to adapt to these environments. Question: What microorganisms did these extremophiles evolve from?\n\nThe second article, written by Carl Zimmer, examines the possibilities of life below freezing temperature in an Antarctic lake. Examination of samples of an organic lake shows the existence of numerous microorganisms that have adapted to life below zero (Zimmer). The article suggests that the presence of warm temperatures is not a requirement for life. Question: What is the lower temperature threshold for Earth microorganisms?\n\nThe third article, written by Laura Starr, tells the readers about unique bacteria named Candidatus Desulforudis audaxviator , which lives in a hot underground sulfur lake in Africa. It is a highly-resistant bacteria, able to survive at the temperature of 60 C o (140 F) at 9.7 pHs (Starr). What I found fascinating about it is that the bacteria continue a solitary existence. Question: What other bacteria would be able to survive under these conditions?\n\nThe fourth article presented in the form of a picture slide and assembled by Clara Moskowitz tells us about amazing creatures of Earth which can survive in extreme conditions, be those high temperatures, little to no water, extreme salt saturation, sulfuric conditions, and others (Moskowitz). This assembly of creatures expands the number of potential candidates to survive on other planets. Question: Did any of these microorganisms originate from outside of Earth?\n\nThe fifth article, written by Rothschild and Mancinelli, examines the possibility of life on other planets, even in extreme conditions. The researchers suggest that, as long as there is water on or under the surface of the planet, life can exist in it (Rothschild and Mancinelli 1092). As an example, they use extremophile organisms on Earth, which can survive in virtually any environment. Question: Can microorganisms exist in vapor or ice?\n\nThe last article, written by Seth Shostak, talks about halophile organisms on Earth and in space. He explains the mechanisms of their survival, stating that they survive extremely saline environments by increasing the salinity within their bodies (Shostak). I think it is an interesting way of surviving in saline environments. Question: How did mechanisms of adaptation to extreme environments develop?\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBassen, Mirko, and Volker Muller. “Hot” Acetogenesis.” Extremophiles, vol. 21, no. 1, 2017, pp. 15-26.\n\nBrooks, Cristopher. “The Life of Extremophiles: Surviving in Hostile Habitats.” BBC . 2013, Web.\n\nMoskowitz, Clara. “Extreme Life on Earth: 8 Bizarre Creatures.” LiveScience . 2011, Web.\n\nRothschild, Lynn J., and Rocco L.

      "Feminism and the Relational Approach to Autonomy Essay\n\nWhereas both agency and autonomy are crucial for making any individual’s life choices in a free and independent way, the second feature is more desirable to have than the first one. In the healthcare industry, both of these notions play an important role. The paper will discuss these concepts as well as dwell on the problem of sexual identity and its relation to public politics.\n\nWhen analyzing autonomy, the first thing that comes to mind is that a person can make independent decisions. However, in Sherwin’s interpretation, the ability to make such choices is contingent on the existence of favorable social circumstances for the agent. Thus, Sherwin emphasizes that unlike an agency, autonomy relies on justice. However, the author does not reject the possibility of non-autonomous individuals having agency. The major difference between autonomy and agency is that the first of these concepts greatly depends on the absence of oppression. Meanwhile, the second notion, agency, can exist even in the environment where oppression is present.\n\nThe relational approach to health care, according to Sherwin, is a combination of feminist approaches to health care. Instead of renouncing the concept of non-feminism, the author admits that autonomy is significant for creating the premises of feminist ethics in the field of health care. To explain the term “relational,” Sherwin applies such concepts as “contextualized” and “socially situated.” Unlike other feminist authors, Sherwin uses the term “relational” to refer not to a narrow range of interpersonal relations but to the full range of important human relations. These connections may be both public and personal. Sherwin politicizes the concept of “relational” and draws attention to the fact that individual selfhood is formed by a collection of relations.\n\nThey discussed concepts that help to provide a better understanding of the health issues of lesbian, bisexual, and transgender-oriented people as well as the problems of practicing individuals and communities. The principle of agency is reflected in the decisions of these people since each of them makes a conscious choice of what sexual orientation they would like to have. The principle of autonomy is reflected through the need of such individuals to be understood and accepted by society and practicing communities. Unfortunately, it is frequently the case that women with non-traditional sexual orientation are deprived of the possibility for their autonomy to be accepted and appreciated.\n\nSexual identity is not only an intensely intimate matter but also a rather radical political issue. The reason for such an attitude towards sexual identity is that in all spheres of people’s communication, there exist misunderstandings caused by the inability of some people to accept the exceptional nature of others. Throughout history, women have frequently been considered as the weaker sex and as creatures unable to make decisions. With the advent of new opportunities for expressing one’s sexual identity, females changed the common state of affairs, which is hard for some men and even women to accept.\n\nThe relational approach to autonomy is a crucial aspect in the process of analyzing people’s behaviors and relations. Understanding the peculiarities of agency and autonomy is necessary to build ethical connections and avoid harming others. In particular, the principle of autonomy in health care should be observed to provide each customer with equal opportunities for self-expression. This approach plays a significant role in feminist studies.\n",
      "Gloria Anzaldua: How to Tame a Wild Tongue Essay (Article Review)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Passage Discussion\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Work Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nAuthors aim to emphasize the problems relevant to them in their works to enhance the reader’s understanding. Anzaldua discusses the connection between the language a person speaks and his or her identity. The author provides an example of her visit to a dentist as a child, which inspired Anzaldua to think about culture and its connection to the mother tongue (33). Forbidding an individual to speak their language is an oppression of the ability to express feelings and thoughts.\n\nPassage Discussion\n\nDue to Anzaldua’s origins, she was forced to learn a second language – English: and work on not having an accent. The author was taught that it was the only way to become American, which inevitably would lead to losing connection with her culture. An interesting consideration is that inhabitants of Anzaldua’s hometown developed Chicano Spanish in an attempt to adapt to the pressure of becoming Americans. Another aspect that Anzaldua considers is the difference between attitudes towards men and women in her culture (35). The significance of the text is in the firsthand experience that the author shares.\n\nConclusion\n\nAnzaldua’s work provides an understanding of the connection that language has with one’s culture and identity. In addition, the difference of attitudes towards men’s and women’s speaking is highlighted to show unfair treatment of the latter. The author’s life journey and challenges described in this passage illustrate the pressure she experienced as a Mexican growing up in the US and her viewpoint of language as a way to express one’s personality.\n\nWork Cited\n\nAnzaldua, Gloria. “How to Tame a Wild Tongue.” Fifty Great Essays , edited by Robert DiYanni, 4th ed., Pearson, 2013, pp. 33-45.\n",
      "Obesity: the Coach Approach Program Overview Essay\n\nThe Coach Approach Overview\n\nThe Coach Approach program is an ideal intervention strategy for the non-Hispanic black Okaloosa women. The program utilizes the principle of energy balance; it aims to reduce caloric intake through a healthy diet that is less in calories and burn excess body fat through increased physical activity. The program promotes a healthy lifestyle that ensures the right balance between energy intake and energy expenditure to avoid degenerative diseases attributed to obesity.\n\nCancer, stroke, cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, and diabetes are all associated with obesity. The coach approach is a “cognitive-behavioral, one-on-one exercise support program that incorporates a group-based nutrition education component for sedentary, obese women to lose weight” (National Cancer Institute, 2015, para 1). Implementing this approach will require two process measures to monitor the progress of the program, and two outcome measures to determine the impact of the program.\n\nProcess Measures\n\nThe process measures are meant to inform the coalition about the progress of activities defining the implementation process (Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, 2014). These will include:\n\nPersonal Dietary Assessment Tool\n\nThis tool will be adopted from a 24-hour recall and will be designed to obtain an idea of the typical food consumption habits of an individual (Resnicow et al., 2005). The subjects will recall all the foods and drinks consumed in the previous 24 hours from the time of recall. This tool will be used to estimate the women’s daily caloric intake for comparison with energy expenditure.\n\nPhysical Activity Assessment Tool\n\nThis tool will be adopted from the Community Healthy Activities Model Program to determine the level of physical activity and the associated energy expenditure of non-Hispanic black women (Resnicow et al., 2005). Since the program aims to promote an active lifestyle in an already obese population, social and recreational activities will be excluded. These activities include watching a movie or the TV, playing chess, singing, sitting, standing, and reading. Besides, physical activities consuming less than 30 minutes will not be included.\n\nOutcome Measures\n\nBMI Assessment Tool\n\nThis tool is meant to record the weight and height measures that will be used to determine BMI. The average BMI for the target population will be used to determine the obesity prevalence rates for comparison with previous data (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015). The BMI assessment tool is shown below.\n\nParticipant  Weight  Height  BMI\n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n                                \n\n\nBehavior Change Assessment Tool\n\nThis tool determines the feeding habits and activity levels of the non-Hispanic black women in Okaloosa. The program is meant to result in life-changing behaviors because a healthy lifestyle helps to enhance the quality of life. The behavior change assessment tool will be adopted from Queen’s University (2015) as shown below.\n\n 1. How have your eating habits changed since you began this program?\n 2. Will you manage to indulge in physical activity daily?\n 3. How have you integrated physical activity into your daily routine?\n 4. List the foods that you have avoided since you began this program.\n 5. Other than diet and exercise, what other changes have you made in your life that might influence the attainment of ideal body weight?\n\nDissemination of Results\n\nThe process results are intended to monitor progress and make necessary modifications. Thereby, in the process of implementing the program, the coalition will arrange for meetings and focus group discussions with the women to discuss the results, which will be presented using PowerPoint. The women will brainstorm on feasible ways to modify the program. The social media and community meetings will be used as ways of disseminating both process and outcome results for the entire community (National Association of County & City Health Officials, 2015).\n\nReferences\n\nAgency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

      "US Army’s Logistics Services on the Kava Island Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nA modern organization operates in a stiff business environment. This therefore demands setting up effective strategies for its survival and growth. Haddow et al (2004) argues that critical thinking and strategic approach is essential for an organization. They enable an organization to deliberate on what decision to take in order to fend existing competition among its competitors, and immediate environment. When incorporated effectively, these elements eventually assist organizations to achieve a competitive advantage.\n\nI’m working with the US army. The army intends to augment its logistics services in Kava. The army is among the many organizations that have recognized the aspiration of pioneering to new lands, and expanding its business opportunities. Kava is an island, found in the Southern Pacific region. The island has an active population, with fifty percent of the population under the age of fifteen.\n\nThe country is made up of various types of people, languages and religions. The Kava population is largely dependent on tourism, fishing and natural resources. Despite its economic stability, Kava faces a number of issues, which make it vulnerable to disasters such as terrorism- arising from within and outside the country, diseases, and the petroleum spill issues. However, Kava is fortunate to have a series of organizations which have been instrumental in helping the country deal with its disasters.\n\nThis paper explores issues present in Paradise. The paper discusses the forces present in framing a business problem in the area. Also, the paper discusses the organizational and environmental situations in the area that hamper business expansion opportunities. Finally, the paper invokes critical thinking skills in solving the problem.\n\nDescription of the Business Problem\n\nMy business expansion strategy will likely face various strategic challenges while integrating in Kava. Among the challenges is the issue of natural disasters. The natural disasters experienced include; fires, earthquakes, hurricanes and floods, among others. Similarly, man-made disasters are also common in the island. The man-made disasters include HIV/AIDS and terrorism, both existing within and outside the country. These disasters have altered businesses that have already settled in the island. Hence, the disasters will have a direct cost effect to my business expansion strategy as well.\n\nThe other challenge affecting Kava, which will impact on my expansion mission, is the diversity of its population. There are several languages spoken in Kava. Although global languages such as English and Spanish are widely spoken, the indigenous languages remain a major medium of communication. The people also have several problems ingrained in their traditional beliefs. This is pictured through local religions, Islam, Buddhism and Christianity.\n\nThe other problem present in Kava is the population. Statistics point out that majority of the population comprises young people, who are less than fifteen years. The situation is complex because most of these teenagers are not educated. The trend in population shows that Kava may face the challenge of competitive employment and dependence because of the age structure, and the level of competitive professional qualification. This will have a consequence to my business.\n\nForces that are involved in formulation of the problem\n\nAccording to Ayad (2010), forces that aid in identifying a business problem vary. Kava, presents internal and external forces which make the recognition of the problem easy. The area presents forces such as religious, population, disasters and language issues. These problems call for devising some important business decisions.\n\nOrganizational and Environmental Obstacles\n\nAdvertising and Expansion\n\nPresently, there are no logistic businesses operating in Kava. Perhaps, the cost of advertising will be affordable, as the area consists of many media outlets. However, since my organization is expanding, communication will be a challenge in achieving advertising goals. The challenge is even worse because of mixed languages spoken in the area. The area is also susceptible to natural calamities such as floods and earthquakes, to mention a few. This challenge will be complex to contain. Additionally, my organization will face a challenge in handling health hazards and coordination, during disaster response and recovery.\n\nCritical Thinking\n\nThe problem presented in Kava demands more critical thinking skills to resolve. Hence, the eventual goal of my strategic planning will help in forming and managing an efficient and elaborate system to enable my business succeeds in the island. The decision to restructure my business in Kava will encompass various stakeholders. It will include activities such as shaping the leadership, finance, human resources and physical resources among other pertinent aspects of my business.\n\nAccording to Ayad (2010), the first decision making step is defining the problem. The problems existing in Kava are diverse. They include prevalence of natural and man -made disasters, diversity, leadership and education among other factors. By embracing this strategy, I would establish a priority, based on measurable scale such as time money. This will enable me assess if I have made progress or not.\n\nRe-evaluation of a situation is critical in decision making. Re-evaluation allows a decision maker to alter his or her thinking skills after defining a given problem. By carefully reevaluating the situation, I will develop an option if the decision is worth implementing or abandoning (Ayad, 2010).\n\nHaddow (2004) argues that many business decisions are designed by gathering information. Gathering relevant information about the problem in context allows a decision maker to prudently make informed judgments (Kambil, 2007). In this case, I will use my time wisely to gather vital information, seeking advice and utilizing the available resources to ensure accurate decision is achieved.\n\nWhereas first decisions may prove useful, exploring alternatives can provide new thinking. According to Kambil (2007), being open, practical, non-judgmental, thinking ahead and keeping records of ideas provide a new dimension on already set decision. In this case, I will limit myself to options that seem reasonable. I will carefully assess the situation and keep records to enable me evaluate the ideas carefully. After analyzing options available, I will make an informed choice on the available options.\n\nImplementing a decision is not an easy task. It needs more effort. However, taking action and communicating to the rest of the stakeholders ensures a decision taken is implemented smoothly and in tandem with organization mission (Kambil, 2007). Communication for what will change and follow up strategies after implementation helps to reinforce the strategy undertaken, and guarantees organizational success.\n\nReferences List\n\nAyad, A., (2010) “Critical Thinking and Business Process Improvement”, Journal of Management Development , (29), 6, pp.556 – 564.\n\nHaddow, G. et al (2004): Introduction to Emergency Management ; Amsterdam: Butterworth-Heinemann Publishers.\n\nKambil, A., (2007) “Thinking for Breakthroughs”, Journal of Business Strategy , (28), 5, pp.47 – 49.\n",
      "The Civilization of North America Essay\n\nThe First Civilizations of North America\n\nThe first signs of development in Central America emerged in the second millennium with the emergence of Olmec culture, in swampy and hot lowlands along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, South of Veracruz. The Olmec civilization consisted of intensive cultivation besides the muddy riverbanks. The people at San Lorenzo and La Venta carved stones for monuments, tools, and ornaments.\n\nThey used rubber for manufacturing balls, footwear, and rubber bands. People at La Vanta built the largest earthen pyramid that was meant for ceremonial proposes. Olmec people structured an extensive trading network, carried on religious customs, and devised the first writing system in America (Davidson et al. 160). The Olmec were known as the first city builders who constructed unusually large plazas, and sculpted massive heads chiseled from basalt. They traded with the neighboring communities and built a relationship with them. The city had active palaces adorned with mural paintings that sheltered priests and warriors, marketplaces, schools for their siblings, and extensive suburbs for commoners (Davidson et al. 5).\n\nOld Worlds, New Worlds (1400-1600)\n\nIn 1400, people in Europe concentrated on fish farming. The sailors from the west countries moved from the North and the West towards Iceland looking for fish. From the 1480s to the 1490s, remarkably few English people tried to move to the far West in search of fish and other resources. They were lucky to find plenty of codfish and tall trees that could be used for making smart mats in Cabot’s Iceland. By the 1550s, Cabot’s Iceland attracted 400 vessels and fishermen from England, Spain, Portugal, and France. This Iceland is presently known as St. John’s Newfoundland, and it severed as an informal Hub of the North Atlantic fisheries. In the 1450s, enormous changes occurred in Europe, which includes the use of technologies like shipbuilding, advances in the art of map reading, and the use of gunpowder.\n\nSeveral things can be included in a movie if this chapter was to be put in the form of a film. However, the most intriguing thing I would include in this movie would be the migration process and the trade practiced by the ancient people. For instance, migration and trade brought about certain diseases in North America. The Eurasians were blamed by Americans to have brought diseases to society due to their involvement with animals. The Eurasians were known to adore agriculture and the domestication of animals. They adopted the idea of keeping animals, as it would help them in case a shortage of vegetables and other plants were noticed.\n\nThe domesticated animals could act as their meal. However, it reached a period when the Eurasians had to pay a high price for their idea of domestication, as they were prone to diseases like tuberculosis, however, in the end, they managed to build strong immune systems especially from childhood. However, these Native Americans had problems adapting to such lives, as they were not used to living with animals around them.\n\nTherefore, they had to rethink and invent something that could help them save their population. Putting such a scenario in a movie would be appealing especially to show how the Eurasians managed to survive terrible diseases. Most characters will have to dress in ancient ways, use several languages that can define the Ice Age civilization. In the end, the movie should be in a position to portray the different migration movements made and the adaptations involved.\n\nThe first civilization of North America can be evidenced 15000 years ago (Davidson 40). This has been evidenced by the migration of some small groups of people who began migrating through the Bering Strait and connecting to Alaska via Siberia. This life span is critical in analyzing several incidents that happened chronologically. Several events show how the people of the Ice Age marveled around and influenced each other to adapt to different situations.\n\nFor example, the migration process suggests that the Asians were the first to move to the Northern Hemisphere. These people moved around different places searching for food and shelter, as there were no fixed homes at that time. Estimating the life span used by the author can help a reader understand how people managed to adopt fire for cooking and protection. Besides, the migration process allowed other people from different cultures to mingle and learn other values and norms that they eventually adopted. The idea of architecture can be attributed to several years of innovation and invention that finally yield the fruits of painting and art. Therefore, the life span used easily explains how one technology led to the next until the world became computerized.\n\nThis chapter is not hard to understand because the situations explained can be chronologically related. The tools used by people living in the 1896 era have been advanced by the current generation. For example, the issue of trading was done by the exchange of goods for goods. As civilization enhanced, money was invented, and people started to exchange goods with money. Also, the issue of money made things easier as one could give a reasonable estimate of money to the number of goods received. In the end, both parties gained. Understanding the history of civilization may be hard for a person who did not live in that era.\n\nSome things cannot be traced currently as they vanished especially if they cannot be found in museums. Besides, a person who lived in that era could easily understand the history due to the involvement and participation incurred by that individual. For instance, the Mesoamericans who were found in the Northern Hemisphere are considered the first group of people to adopt civilization.\n\nThey intergraded into complex societies with different cultures, norms, and values depending on what one believed. This integration is what perpetuated the introduction of popular art and architecture that was made by the use of paint and wood respectively. Furthermore, agriculture encouraged to trade as people could plant different things and sell them to get non-food products. Such innovations can be understood well by people who lived in that era.\n\nThey have to strain understanding the activities that were going on during that time because it was necessary to learn to survive. Therefore, people would react differently to the history of civilization especially because the current civilization has been triggered by technological advancement. Initially, the people of the west managed to influence those of the south to adapt to agricultural modernization. The people in the arctic advanced with fishing, as it was the most preferred way of living to help them survive while those in the Great Plains and Great basin resulted in hunting and gathering. Therefore, considering these adaptations and relating them to the people in the current generation, it may be hard for those who have not been to the named places to understand the nature of survival those who lived in the ancient times underwent.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDavidson, James West, Brian DeLay, Christine Heyrman Leigh, Mark Lytle and Michael Stoff.

      "Parenting Strategies for Early Childhood Development Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nProviding opportunities for early childhood development is an essential step in creating an environment in which children will be able to acquire the skills and knowledge that will help them integrate into the community successfully. However, if the parents or the parent is neglectful, children are likely to fail to acquire the necessary abilities, thus, not only failing to gain the necessary knowledge but also developing a range of health issues, including problems with the cognitive development process (Hutchison, 2012). As the case study of a single mother, Aayla, and her children, Sasha (3 years old) and Cayley (1-year-old), shows quite graphically, there is a strong need to help the mother reconsider her parenting approach and use the strategies that will help reinforce early childhood development. Otherwise, Sasha and Cayley will be unable to acquire the necessary skills.\n\nChild 1: Sasha (3)\n\nPart I\n\n  * Completion of physical development tasks. The fact that Sasha does not copy her mother’s behavior in an attempt to develop the appropriate patterns clearly is a reason for concern. The fact that she cannot dress also shows that she needs further support from a cognitive development expert.\n  * Significant illness/disease. The cold can be viewed as a minor issue, yet the bruises on Sasha’s arms point to an obvious problem.\n  * Nutrition and exercise issues. Little to no information has been provided about the food that Sasha consumes. However, judging by the physical characteristics of the girl, i.e., her weight and height, it can be assumed that she is seriously undernourished (Marotz, 2014).\n\nPart II\n\n  * Cognitive development. Sasha’s cognitive development is currently threatened. Although her curiosity is typical for a child of her age, the lack of communication skills implies that she needs additional opportunities for cognitive development. It is important for her to create prerequisites for abstract thinking, which she may miss unless she is provided with an appropriate intervention (Hutchison, 2012).\n  * Cultural development. The lack of connection with the community may become the reason for the child to have a poor understanding of her culture and the associated needs. Therefore, it is imperative to provide her with the necessary information in a manner that will help her learn the associated information fast (e.g., games and similar types of interactions).\n  * Emotional development. The emotional development of the child leaves much to be desired. According to the description, Sasha does not receive enough emotional support from her mother. As a result, she lacks essential skills of expressing and understanding her emotions, as well as expressing empathy with the people around her (McCarthy & Barbot, 2016).\n  * Self-concept, self-esteem, and empowerment. Sasha has been showing the propensity to feel empowered since the report claimed that she had frequent conflicts with her mother. Nevertheless, the physical abuse that she suffers on a regular basis may impede the process of self-esteem and self-concept development (Kaplan, 2013).\n  * Significant Life issues/events and diversity issues. The fact that none of the community members seems to come from the same background as Sasha and her mother may become a problem when helping the child develop a sense of belonging.\n\nPart III\n\n  * Family environment. Since Aayla is a single mother, Sasha does not have a strong father figure. Furthermore, the physical abuse and the emotional mistreatment that she receives from her mother aggravates the situation.\n  * Social institutions. Despite the fact that there is a free preschool facility in the neighborhood, the fact that Sasha’s mother is unaware of it makes it inaccessible to the child.\n  * Spirituality. Since there is no church in the area, there is no opportunity for Aayla to promote spirituality to Sasha.\n  * Community and social network. Seeing that the neighborhood is far from being friendly, the local residents cannot be viewed as the possible source of support for Sasha. Furthermore, communicating with the members of the neighborhood directly poses a significant threat to her wellbeing as most of them are likely to be perfect strangers to her and her mother (Lytle, London, & Bruck, 2015).\n  * Discrimination/oppression and economic factors. The fact that the child comes from an extremely poor background with a single mother and no child support money from her father, she might be bullied by some of the local children. However, given the fact that the community is very poor, the possibility of other children having greater financial support is rather low. Therefore, at present, the threat of being a victim of bullying is rather low (Hutchison, 2012).\n  * Resilience/strengths. The grandmother, who seems to disapprove of Aayla’s life choices, can be viewed as the source of support for Sasha. Similarly, the preschool facility mentioned above may provide extra opportunities for development.\n\nPart IV: Core Value of Personal Development\n\nBy definition, the Core Value of Personal Development as defined by the Saint Leo University includes the qualities such as Excellence, Community, Respect, Personal Development, Responsible Stewardship, and Integrity ( Student affairs division , 2016). Based on the evidence provided in the case study, however, one may conclude that Sasha’s rates in each of the identified domains are very low. Because of the lack of parental support in her cognitive and emotional development, she is incapable of building a strong and positive image of herself.\n\nChild 2: Cayley (1)\n\nPart I\n\n  * Completion of physical development tasks. Cayley’s physical development can be deemed as positive. Seeing that the child starts to walk, it can be assumed that she meets the physical standards for her age. However, the fact that she still has the grabbing function that most children get rid of by the age of one shows that she needs assistance in her development (Schlinger, 2013).\n  * Significant illness/disease. At present, there are no obvious health concerns for Cayley. However, the fact that her mother drinks heavily and, probably, was drinking during pregnancy shows that she may have developmental issues and the associated problems (Andrare, Fisberg, & Micheli, 2013).\n  * Nutrition and exercise issues. Cayley’s nutrition habits should also be viewed as a major problem since, by the age of one, toddlers are supposed to consume not only milk but also other types of food, including meat, fruit, vegetables, etc. Therefore, it is highly possible that the child is undernourished.\n\nPart II\n\n  * Cognitive development. When considering the specifics of Cayley’s cognitive development, one must bear in mind that the child is only one year old. Therefore, specific tests must be unto identify the level of her progress. Nevertheless, much like her sister, she seems to show signs of delayed development. For instance, the fact that she is only capable of using one or two words when communicating her needs and cannot form coherent phrases shows that she needs further support.\n  * Cultural development. Likewise, the age of the child can be viewed as an obstacle to determining the level of her cultural development. The fact that the child is not trying to mimic her mother but, instead, expresses her anger in a very loud and obvious manner shows that there might be a problem in promoting cultural development. Particularly, the ability of the child to communicate her needs and emotions must be addressed as an evident area of concern (McCoy, Black, Daelmans, & Dua, 2016).\n  * Emotional development. Similarly to Sasha, Cayley clearly has issues with her emotional development. For example, the fact that she only knows 1-2 words and is incapable of building longer phrases clearly is a reason for concern. The child clearly needs delicate yet consistent scaffolding so that she could acquire the necessary vocabulary and develop the social skills that she will require later on (Adams, Jensen, & Chemtob, 2013).\n  * Self-concept, self-esteem, and empowerment. Cayley’s self-concept might be somewhat damaged due to the fact that she has not been receiving enough care from her mother. Thus, it is important to make sure that the girl should be transferred to a loving and caring environment.\n  * Significant life issues/events and diversity issues. The absence of other members of the community of Jamaican descent may serve as a roadblock on the way to successful development.\n\nPart III\n\n  * Family environment. Despite the fact that Cayley is only a toddler, the unhealthy family environment in which she lives must have already had its toll on her. The fact that she gets hit a lot by her mother creates prerequisites for psychological trauma.\n  * Social institutions. The free preschool facility in the vicinity can be deemed as a possible source for providing Cayley with the assistance, resources, and support that she needs. However, Aayla needs to be informed better on the infrastructure of the neighborhood since she is completely unaware of this opportunity.\n  * Spirituality. The absence of religious institutions means that there is currently no way to provide a foil for developing Cayley’s spirituality.\n  * Community and social network. The community clearly lacks the elements that contribute to the development of a one-year-old. The failure of the mother to use the services of the nursery in the vicinity does not allow Cayley to receive the care that she needs.\n  * Discrimination/oppression and economic factors. The high poverty rates by which the neighborhood is characterized may become the defining factor for Cayley to be discriminated against in the future.\n  * Resilience/strengths. The grandmother that criticizes her daughter’s lifestyle and seems to have a better understanding of childrearing can be considered a possible source of resilience for Cayley. However, it is essential to help the two builds stronger relationships.\n\nPart IV: Core Value of Personal Development\n\nAlthough like Sasha, Cayley has not been provided with enough attention, it is hard to tell currently whether she has gained the necessary level of personal development. Given the fact that she is only one year old, it is impossible to identify any semblance of self-awareness in her. Nevertheless, the fact that her vocabulary is very restricted shows that she needs further development to create prerequisites for further cognitive development.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe case under analysis can be viewed as the primary example of neglectful parenting. Although the effects of the mother’s inadequate upbringing methods might seem barely noticeable at present, they are likely to snowball until the children fail to develop the essential cognitive and communicational skills. Therefore, it is imperative that an intervention should be provided. Particularly, the children should be taught the principal means of managing their emotions and acquiring the necessary skills, whereas the mother must receive information about early childhood development and the role of parents in it. Thus, prerequisites for addressing the problem can be created.\n\nReferences\n\nAdams, R. E., Jensen, P. S., & Chemtob, C. N. (2013).

      "Health and Its Sociological Factors Term Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nHealth is a condition of being free from injury or illness. It can also be said to be the physical and or mental state of a person. On the other hand, sociology is a social problem study. It can also be viewed as the functioning, structure, and development of the society of humans. Health and sociology are important elements in society and well being of humans in an environment. This is a write up on sociology and health with reference to the analysis of two hypotheses, and they include:\n\n 1. A child’s birth weight is associated with the parents’ birth weight and socioeconomic class.\n 2. Excellent health comes with less stress; therefore, people who work more are not as healthy as people who do not.\n\nA child’s birth weight is associated with the parents’ birth weight and socioeconomic class\n\nA child’s birth weight is the weight that a child bears at birth. A child may bear a high or low weight at birth. There are several factors that influence the weight of a child at birth, for instance, the weight of the parents and socioeconomic class of the parents among others. However, this paper focuses on the influence of parents’ weight and socioeconomic class on the weight of a child at birth. There are different assumptions that are made on the weight of children at birth. These assumptions are basically based on races and socioeconomic classes, for instance, race and weight at birth.\n\nIt is believed that there are certain races that give birth to children with average weights while others give birth to children with low or high weights above the expected and recommended weight at birth medically. Race influences weight at birth due to differentials in consumption or eating habits. There are certain races that consume junk foods while others rely on food with either high protein or carbohydrate content.\n\nFurthermore, there are certain races of people that are believed to have heavyweights, and always give birth to children with high birth weights. This is due to the physic of the respective race, for instance, Blacks. On the other hand, there are other races that are believed to give birth to low weighted children due to the physical nature of the respective race, for instance, Asians. Moreover, there are other races that are believed to give birth to children with average weight due to their physical appearance, for instance, the whites.\n\nRace may influence the weight of children at birth because racially there are different cultural beliefs during pregnancy. Cultural beliefs are upheld and rarely ignored due to the consequences of doing so. Therefore, pregnant women are not likely to ignore cultural beliefs during pregnancies.\n\nUpholding the beliefs may lead to the birth of a child with a weight associated with the respective race. This is because different races have different believes in what ought to be done by women while pregnant to ensure the healthy state of the unborn baby. Furthermore, different races have different beliefs on the foods to be taken by pregnant women. This influences the weight of children at birth. Therefore, since racial beliefs are respected by different races, a child’s weight is most likely to be associated with the weight of his or her parents’ birth weights. This is because their grandparents are also adhered to by the racial beliefs about pregnant women and feeding habits hence born under similar consequences.\n\nMoreover, a child’s birth weight is also associated with parents’ birth weight due to the biological composition of the parents. A child’s biological composition is influenced by the parents’ biological composition leading to similarities in genetic composition. Therefore, in case parents’ of a child were born with low weights especially mothers, then the child is most likely to have low birth weight and vice versa. However, it is believed that the weight of a girl child is closely associated with the mother’s birth weight while a boy childbirth weight is closely associated with the birth weight of the father.\n\nSecondly, socioeconomic class and a child’s birth weight. There are different classes in the society considering the social and economic well being of people living in society. Socioeconomic classification is basically based on the income of respective families in the society and their ability to afford basic needs among other family needs, for instance, wealthy, poor, and middle-level classes. It is logical that children from wealthy families should be healthy because they have access to health services and social facilities that they require considering their family income level. On the other hand, it is logical that children from poor families may be unable to access quality health services and access quality social amenities of facilities.\n\nA child’s weight at birth is associated with the socioeconomic class of his or her parents due to several reasons, for instance, the ability to access quality health services. Pregnant women opt to access quality health services to ensure that unborn babies are safe and healthy before birth.\n\nQuality health services to pregnant women also ensure that the children are healthy at birth. The weight of a child at birth is also a health concern that can also be influenced by the socioeconomic class of the parents of the respective child. Parents from a high social class have access to quality health services and diet. Medically, there are certain essential foodstuffs that are recommended for pregnant women to ensure that the child is healthy at birth. However, these foodstuffs may not be accessed by all families in the society or community due to high prices, especially low-income families.\n\nConsumption of such foodstuff ensures that a mother gives birth to a healthy baby with the recommended weight medically at birth. Lack of such foodstuff may lead to birth of low weighted children or high weighted children. Furthermore, there are certain food stuffs that are not recommendable for women during pregnancy. These food stuffs may be avoided by pregnant women from high income earning families while those from low income earning families may not. This is because the low income families mainly consume what they can afford and readily available at their reach. Moreover, families with high income have high purchasing power hence able to satisfy their needs and wants adequately.\n\nHigh income earning families are also able to afford consultative medical services. This enables the families to ensure that the weight of their child at birth is medically accepted and not a health threat to the newly born child. Such families may afford services of a doctor at their request leading to birth of children with controlled weights. On the other hand, families with low incomes may not be able to afford costs of consultative medical professionals.\n\nGenerally, weight of a child at birth is a health concern and opts to be monitored during the pregnancy period of the mother. Birth of a child with a weight that is medically recommended is only possible with constant consultation of medical services. These services are costly and can only be frequently accessed by high income earning families while low income earning families may rarely afford such services. Therefore, weight of a child is associated with the socioeconomic class of his or her parents because it determines access to health services, which determines weight of the respective child at birth being a health concern.\n\nExcellent health comes with less stress; therefore, people who work more are not as healthy as people who do not\n\nStress is a threat to the well being of human because it affects health status. There are several causes of stress, for instance, work. Work is considered one of the main causes of stress. Work related stress has adverse effects on health of workers hence affecting quality of health of workers. Unemployed people are not exposed to high levels of stress as opposed to those people who work. Stress at the work place is basically caused by deadline and objective pressures at the work place.\n\nThere are work schedules that employees must adhere to at a work a place. Furthermore, there are other several conditions or terms that employees must follow. These rules are applicable to all employees. Moreover, there are organizational objectives that opt to be achieved within a specified period failure to which might lead to sacking or suspension of responsible employees or workers in case they are not realized.\n\nThis forces workers to work hard to ensure that an organization achieves its goals. Failure to achieve the organizational goals may threaten employment status of responsible employees. This causes tension at the work place because each employee is in need of his or her job due to financial needs. These terms of employment and achievement of organizational goals are the main factors that cause stress in a working environment because they greatly influence employment status of employees in respective organizations or companies.\n\nEmployees or workers are exposed to more stress than the unemployed or people who do not work. Stress triggers reaction of the pituitary adrenal glands hence affecting quality of health of human. Therefore, based on stress grounds people who do not work have excellent health compared to people who work due to level of stress they are exposed to. However, avoiding stress is not the key to excellent health.\n\nThere are other factors that also affect health of human beings, for instance, obesity. Obesity is a condition whereby a person has high fat deposits in the body. It is mainly caused by consumption of high quantities of proteins and junk foods and failure to adequately break them down. These fats are not adequately broken down due to lack of exercises.\n\nWork causes stress and affects health of a person while obesity also hinders achievement of quality health by people. People who do not work are likely to be obese than those who work because work may serve as exercise to the body. Furthermore, health effects of obesity are higher than health effects of stress. Therefore, though people who work are exposed to stress than those who do not work, people who do not work are more likely to be obese. Moreover, obesity has more health effects compared to stress hence people who work are more likely to achieve excellent health compared to those who do not work. Though excellent health comes with less stress, people who do not work are not healthier than those who work.\n",
      "Motor City, Honda and Toyota Websites in Marketing Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nMotor City, Honda, and Toyota Websites have been visited and analyzed in this paper. All three websites have been found with numerous characteristics that enhance their usability as marketing tools. Most importantly, their popularity and usefulness are centered on layout and design. Their navigation bar, font color, and size among other features have notably enhanced their effectiveness. Their design appears clean, appealing, well organized, and easy to navigate.\n\nAll three websites contain magnificent images of cars on their home page, a feature that catches the audience’s eye. Motor City and Toyota websites have motionless graphics but the ones for Honda are sliding wonderfully, perhaps to showcase different products and services that the company offers.\n\nTo further enhance their usability, all three websites contain a searching function. They also have swift tools that allow easy navigation from one field to the other. Also, they all have excellent readability that encourages the visitor to stay on. Another feature that is common in the three websites is that they are content-rich. Considering that they are all meant to market automobile products, the content that is posted on them seems to be of much value to automobile users.\n\nAlthough most of the content for Motor City and Toyota can be found after navigating the interior of the websites, Honda seems to have concentrated most of the content on the home page, by providing links that lead to different fields (Holden, 2006).\n\nOf the three websites, I found the Honda website to be most effective. I reached this decision after considering several perceptions of the features that enhance the effectiveness of the website. I strongly enjoyed the information searching activity on this website since I found it the most users friendly. I also found my information searching on the website extremely useful since it provided links to other sites with valuable information. Furthermore, its search engine allowed me the best experience as I could easily search for anything from the website without difficulties (Holden, 2006).\n\nReferences\n\nHolden, G. (2006) .

      "Occupational Stress in the Maritime Industry Coursework\n\nIntroduction\n\nWhen Dean woke up at 6.00 a.m. today, he did not feel rested. He had been suffering from insomnia for several months. Dean could not fall asleep because of thoughts about work, and he usually slept only about 3-4 hours. Dean had a dream job: he started to work in one of the most successful companies in the maritime industry a year ago, and still, he was not happy. Seven months ago, he began to have chest pains; six months ago, migraines started; five months ago, he noticed that he could not concentrate on work tasks. Every notification and e-mail message made him shudder. Anytime his days off were invaded by any work-related tasks, he felt robbed of his free time, but even during that free time, his thoughts kept wandering towards what was left to do, what he was failing to do, and what he did not want to do but had to. When talking to Dean, I knew I could relate; I also know what it is like when your dream job turns into a nightmare. I think this story can seem familiar to many people, and some of them might suffer from occupational stress that became chronic.\n\nNow think about it: have you ever felt like your work drains you? Have you lost sleep or appetite because of the problems at work? Have you felt that working in the maritime industry may be damaging your family life? Chances are, you might be experiencing occupational stress, and you need some solutions. This book will provide you with the information that you can use to make work less stressful for yourself, your relatives, your employees, or, possibly, even employers.\n\nWho Is This Book for?\n\nThis book is dedicated to occupational or workplace stress, that is, the stress that people experience at work. The book covers most of the topics that are associated with occupational stress: first, the term itself is discussed, the causes of stress are considered, and its consequences are pictured in explicit detail. Then, solutions to stress are reviewed; I focus on the solutions which work, according to recent research. I used scientific sources as well as the results of the interviews that I conducted to gather the necessary information, and now, I present it to you. Are you an employer? Or an employee? I think that you might be equally interested in what this book has to offer regardless of whether you are a manager or a worker: if you have a job, occupational stress must be playing an important part in your life, and you can benefit from learning more about it.\n\nKeep it in mind that this book is dedicated to the maritime industry, and I will often make references to it. Some sections are entirely devoted to stress in the maritime industry; in fact, all of them would be if there was enough information on the topic. If you are my colleague and work in the maritime industry, you might be particularly interested in this book: I have gathered all the research that I could find on the topic here, which is honestly not that much. On the other hand, most of the information from the book is generally applicable to other industries and circumstances. Knowing about the maritime industry is not required to understand the causes of stress or solutions to it that can be used in the workplace.\n\nFinally, since the book incorporates solutions to occupational stress, it may also be especially recommended to managers and owners of businesses. While individual workers can make a difference, people with power are more likely to and, possibly, are even responsible for making workplaces less stress-inducing. I hope that my book will help everyone who reads it to manage their occupational stress better. I am especially hopeful that it can provide a manager with the tools which are necessary to make significant changes to the way their company operates, resulting in a better working environment for all their employees.\n\nWhy Was This Book Written?\n\nFor me, the issue of workplace stress is deeply personal. Some people are especially likely to experience stress, and I am one of them: some might call me a perfectionist, but I feel like the words “anxious” and “obsessive” might be more accurate. Consequently, I have been experiencing stress since before I knew what it meant with some very unfortunate physical and psychological reactions to it. I used to think that it was my problem and that something wrong was with me, but as I learned more about stress, I understood that, in my country and, possibly, on my planet, stress is an epidemic that is rarely appropriately countered (American Psychological Association, 2015). That is right: we are becoming increasingly stressed (or, possibly, we increasingly acknowledge being stressed), but we do not do enough to reduce our stress levels.\n\nI guess I should point out that doing something to combat stress is difficult. Stress is incredibly diverse, and it is caused by a wide variety of factors, which makes it difficult to manage. It would be accurate to claim that we cannot fully protect ourselves from stress. However, some things are particularly likely to cause stress, and in certain environments, we can control the stressors to a significant extent. A working environment is one of those, which led me to consider the topic of occupational stress.\n\nAccording to the American Psychological Association (2015), in the United States, work is the second greatest source of stress. It is surpassed only by the stress related to money concerns, which, if you think about it, is connected to work as well. What are the reasons for this tendency to get stressed overwork? Well, work is a necessity for more or less every American: except the particularly privileged of us, we all have to work. Therefore, the majority of adult Americans are likely to experience stress at work. Apart from that, work takes up a lot of time: we spend more time being at work than when doing any other activity (except for, arguably, family duties). Thus, an average American has ample opportunities to get stress at work. Additionally, certain evidence suggests that, in recent decades, the changes in the workplace have resulted in increased reasons for stress (Britt & Jex, 2015). As a result, occupational stress affects large populations for long periods, which can explain its high levels. It is a common concern, which is why it is of interest to modern researchers, including myself.\n\nFurthermore, occupational stress can be generally defined as a problem. It is not good for the health or career of employees, and it tends to affect their productivity. Stressed employees are more likely to make mistakes, have conflicts, and be dissatisfied with their jobs than the employees who are not stressed. Unmanaged stress is bad for everyone involved from workers to employers, for the company’s bottom line, and, occasionally, even for the brand. Therefore, stress is a problem that needs to be resolved, which also explains the interest of modern scientists in it. Overall, the idea that occupational stress needs investigation is a fact. But what about the maritime industry?\n\nFor me, the maritime industry is the working environment that I am interested in, and even though it is not fully homogenous (there are, for instance, seafarers and finance managers, and conditions for the two are vastly different), it seems to be particularly stressful on average. Admittedly, I have little personal experience outside of the maritime industry, which is why I cannot make accurate comparisons. Still, the very presence of unique stressors should warrant research in the field, right? Well, let me just say that when I was looking for the information on the topic, I could not find that much of it. Naturally, there are a few studies, even books, which can offer some advice on how to handle stress in the maritime industry, but they are so rare and often outdated that I could not justify not rectifying this situation. I decided to gather as much information as I can and make my book about occupational stress in the maritime industry – the book you are reading right now.\n\nThe Content of the Book\n\nAs I have mentioned, this book is based on my research, which includes literature review and interviews. As a part of my work, I became familiar with the maritime industry in two countries: the US and Singapore. I exploited this opportunity to a full extent and conducted some interviews with the people I could meet from both countries. This approach helped me cover some of the rather significant blank spots that research on the maritime industry has. I would not consider individual stories and accounts to be as scientifically significant and credible as full-fledged studies with carefully crafted methodology, so I will do my best to distinguish between the two and alert you to the possible bias in some of the responses of my interviewees. However, personal perspectives and, especially, personal stories can hold a lot of value in helping us to understand our own experiences. I hope that you will find the responses to my interviewees interesting or enlightening. Additionally, the research on stress in the maritime industry is rather difficult to come by. In a way, my interviewees helped me keep the focus on the maritime industry; they made sure that I could cover the topics that are relevant for my workplace.\n\nThis book has a structure that is aimed at helping a person understand occupational stress and connect its causes to the methods of resolving it. In the first part, I present the concept of stress: you can read about its definition, theoretical models that can help you understand it better, and learn about the things that tend to cause it. Also, I apply the definition of stress to the maritime industry here. The second section discusses the solutions to stress that the maritime industry and its workers can use. I hope that you will find it helpful, but if you would like to consider other sources, take a look at the bibliography; most of the literature there can be extremely useful as well.\n\nStudying Stress\n\nIn this section, I will provide you with some information about stress in general and stress in the maritime industry. I think that it is a good way to get to understand why stress affects us the way it does and what we can do to change that. Primarily, be ready to learn what stress is, how it develops, how it affects human life, and what factors can make it better or worse. This section does not look for solutions, though; check those out in the next one.\n\nSome Basics Definitions\n\nDefining a concept is one of the first steps towards understanding it. First, let’s try to define stress itself. Seaward (2018) points out that there are different attitudes to stress in different cultures; for example, in Eastern cultures, it may be perceived as the lack of inner peace, and in Western ones, it may indicate the lack of control. From the perspective of psychology, stress can be described as the situation in which one’s ability to cope with a variety of stressors (events that can cause stress) is exceeded. Also, Seaward (2018) highlights the fact that there is a physiological element to stress: the body also tends to respond to stress. As a result, stress can be defined as the “inability to cope with a perceived (real or imagined) threat,” which leads to a variety of psychological and physiological responses (p. 5). Stress is a complex phenomenon that involves a wide variety of different processes in our body, but in general, it is a form of reaction to events that overtax our ability to cope with them.\n\nNow, let’s consider occupational stress. Put simply, it is the type of stress that occurs at work. Take, for example, the definition by Landsbergis et al. (2017). According to them, occupational stress is “harmful physical and emotional responses that occur when the requirements of the job do not match the capabilities, resources or needs of the worker” (p. 325). From my perspective, this definition is very simple because it focuses on one particular type of stressors (job requirements) when in actuality, there is usually more than one at play. However, you can see the same pattern: occupational stress is the type of stress that occurs when we cannot cope with some stress-inducing factors that are present at our workplace. As you will see, most of those factors can indeed be defined as threats; they may not necessarily be threats to one’s body or life, and they might not even be real, but they are predominantly negative events with a few arguably positive ones thrown in the mix.\n\nTechnically, stress does not have to be negative; an inspiring event may result in eustress or positive stress, which has been known to improve one’s ability to perform (for example, in competitions) due to its ability to mobilize the resources of a human body and direct them at the task at hand (Seaward, 2018). There is also eustress, which is neither good nor bad, and simply describes a human’s reaction to inconsequential, unimportant stimuli. Furthermore, a small amount of negative stress is not a problem; in fact, it is extremely unlikely that we would be able to completely remove stress from or lives. However, significant stress tends to cause significant difficulties in the workplace.\n\nIn addition to that, a distinction can be made between acute and chronic stress. Both of those are not good, but acute stress is short-lived; it is a very intense reaction, and this reaction disappears fairly quickly. Imagine witnessing an accident at your workplace, for example, seeing a piece of equipment falling onto somebody. This event is likely to cause intense stress – you may freeze or try to help the person or scream for help, and you might start sweating, breathing heavily, and have a fast, irregular heartbeat. All of those are the body’s responses to stress; however, once the initial danger is over, your breathing and heartbeat will probably calm down. That is intense and short-lived stress that disappears after the stressor disappears. Chronic stress is unlikely to be equally intense, but it is present over time, which probably means that associated stressors are present over time. For example, if you work in an environment that carries a risk of things falling on people (yourself included), this stressor is going to be with you for a while, and it may continually cause stress. As you might imagine, workplaces often carry the potential for chronic stress; after all, there is a reason why we call certain jobs stressful.\n\nTo summarize, the primary distinctive feature of occupational stress is the fact that it is a reaction to the events that occur at our workplace, and many workplaces are fairly prone to having stress-inducing factors. As a result, occupational stress has already received quite a bit of attention from researchers. On that note, let us consider the way occupational stress can be researched.\n\nThe Research on Occupational Stress\n\nThis section of my book might appear a little overly scientific for some, but I think that it might be interesting for others. Here, I want to provide you with a short history lesson so that you know some key names and findings in the study of stress. This lesson is bound to be short because we are talking about a relatively young direction in research. It became fully formed closer to the 1970s, which makes it a recent development. However, several founding fathers of this branch of research we’re working earlier, and I should probably start with them.\n\nTake, for example, some of the earliest studies of stress which were connected to the research of the reactions of animals to various negative stimuli. In other words, scientists took laboratory animals like mice and, well, subjected them to negative stimuli. Those included, for instance, extreme temperatures or toxic substances, as well as a physical injury; it was not very pretty, but the research took place before animal rights were actively considered. Hans Selye, who was working on the topic in the early 1930s called those stimuli stressors (Seaward, 2018). The scientist noted that the stressors were associated with similar physiological changes unconnected to the nature of the stimuli themselves. For instance, there were adverse developments in lymphatic structures, and the stomach along with intestines developed ulcers even when the stressors consisted of physical injury to other parts of the animal’s bodies. This way, scientists gathered evidence that showed us that stress is not good for one’s health.\n\nWalter Cannon, on the other hand, worked with humans, although he was not subjecting humans to ulcer-inducing stimuli (Seaward, 2018). Instead, he investigated the way emotions affected the physiology of humans during a “fight-or-flight” response, theorizing that critical situations could result in physiological strain. He also specifically focused on the role of the brain in the processing of threats and non-threats and investigated the particular physiological responses of a body to threatening stimuli. He found that at least some of these responses included, increased heart rate and blood pressure, lung ventilation, the mobilization of various substances like fatty acid and serum glucose, and so on. All of these changes are technically aimed at making sure that a human’s body is ready to fight or flee; they provide muscles with oxygenated blood, ensure that humans have energy sources, and prepare people for the instances of running or bleeding. Both Cannon and Hans used the term “stress” and connected it to negative physical and emotional stimuli; Hans defined it as “the nonspecific response of the body to any demand” (Landsbergis et al., 2017, p. 326). The research demonstrated that stress could be associated with negative physiological outcomes.\n\nThe two scientists provided a foundation for the study of stress, but it became much more prominent in the 1960s and especially 1970s. Richard Lazarus was among the most prominent figures in this field at the time. However, it is especially important to note two other players who marked a milestone in stress research, especially for the US: the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).\n\nAs pointed out by Landsbergis et al. (2017), the establishment of the two bodies signified the interest of the government in the problems associated with worker safety. From the perspective of NIOSH and OSHA, as well as the Occupational Safety and Health Act, occupational stress is one of the workplace hazards, a psychological one that needs to be taken into account by employers to avoid harming their workers. By funding, prioritizing, and conducting research, disseminating relevant information, and establishing evidence-based requirements and standards, the two promoted occupational safety. To this day, NIOSH and OSHA contribute to the investigation of occupational stress, and this book incorporates the information gathered and popularized by them. And we did learn a lot about stress in no small part thanks to them.\n\nNowadays, for example, we know that stress is a highly subjective experience; what one person perceives as a traumatic event may be perfectly fine for another one. We are also expanding our understanding of the causes of stress, the stressors; the fact that their numbers are dauntingly large may appear problematic, but their understanding is a step towards solutions. The solutions are also being studied, and with time, we will probably have some conclusive evidence on how to best avoid stress and help stressed people. All this information is also arranged into models, which scientists use to attempt to make sense of their data and systematize them. Researchers are making progress, and we can make use of that, which is why I think we should show them some appreciation. After all, the study of stress is probably the first step towards resolving it.\n\nStarting with mice and fight-or-flight response, researchers all over the world provided a sufficient amount of scientific evidence for governments to recognize stress as an issue that requires intervention. Due to governmental efforts and funding in the US, we are becoming increasingly more stress-savvy. This book will offer you a general overview of the knowledge that our society has amassed on stress, but please keep it in mind that stress research is an ongoing project: as time passes, you might be interested in reviewing newer works on the topic.\n\nOccupational Stress in the Modern World\n\nNaturally, current research on occupational stress focuses on recent developments in the area, and a specific tendency can be observed: stress is becoming more prominent worldwide. In other words, nowadays, occupational stress becomes more of an issue for both employers and employees, at least in developed countries (they are better researched than developing ones as you might imagine).\n\nHaving observed this interesting trend, researchers tried to offer some explanations for it. On the one hand, globalization results in increased competition and, therefore, increased pressures on businesses worldwide. Such pressures can incorporate, for example, increased work hours or greater responsibility, which are significant stressors. On the other hand, modern business is also associated with growing insecurity and uncertainty, which are also problematic from the perspective of occupational stress. Those people who are fairly certain that they are not going to be fired today are admittedly less likely to be stressed than those who see their colleagues laid off and worry that they are next.\n\nParticular socioeconomic and political events like the economic recession which began in 2007 or the more recent events connected to plunging oil prices can be used as examples of this aspect of the problem. Indeed, as pointed out by Landsbergis et al. (2017), the events of this scope are likely to affect many if not all sectors of economics, resulting in issues like layoffs, increased unemployment rates, reduced wages, and so on. However, less global and more local concerns can also cause similar effects. Given the fact that we currently live in a post-recession world, it is not surprising that recent studies have indicated an increase in job-related stress.\n\nYou might also find it interesting that, nowadays, workers seem to perceive time differently (at least when compared to the workers of the previous few decades). In particular, we report that today, work takes up more time, which leaves no opportunity for balancing work and life. It is not a universal experience, but it seems to become rather common, which makes it another stressing tendency. Examples of such perceptions can include the lack of strength and energy for hobbies or favorite activities after work and the feeling of having no time for one’s family (especially spouses and children). Landsbergis et al. (2017) claim that this development may be connected to increased demands for productivity and competence, as well as the same problems of downsizing and layoffs, which result in fewer people being available for performing the necessary tasks. Greater workloads may mean longer hours, extra hours, fewer days off, and finishing work at home. Thus, as businesses become more competitive, workers become more loaded with work and have less time and strength for the non-work-related aspects of their life.\n\nThe bottom line of these tendencies is as follows: modern research explicitly indicates that today, you are more likely to experience occupational stress than 20 years ago (Landsbergis et al., 2017). On top of that, recent studies show that occupational stress can be a real problem. It causes negative health outcomes, hinders people in performing their tasks at work, disturbs their relationships, and is bad for everyone involved, from customers to the families of employees and employers.\n\n‘I think about stress whenever I am asked to work extra hours. It is like observing a large snowball approaching you, and it becomes bigger and closer every second. You just cannot avoid it, and when it is gone, you are crushed,’ says one of the interviewees who works in the maritime industry. I found this metaphor most apt. It is obvious that this topic requires particularly close attention from both scientists and businesspeople, and in this book, I offer my contribution to the task of investigating stress.\n\nTheoretical Models\n\nOne of the methods of understanding stress is the concept of theoretical models. They can help analyze a phenomenon and determine the approaches to managing it. They are commonly pretty simplistic, which is why they might not fit any situation, but they are really useful for structuring your data, and I plan to use a model for that exact purpose. The model which I chose for this book is called the Michigan occupational stress model; specifically, this book uses it’s Occupational Stress Indicator (OSI) (Annamalai & Nandagopal, 2014). OSI is an analytical tool with four sections: it considers the four major elements of stress, and it is usually employed to describe a specific instance of stress.\n\nIn OSI, the first element is the source of stress: after all, occupational stress can be caused by multiple issues, which should be regarded as stress sources. The second element is the person who experiences stress. The model focuses on the way an individual’s personality reacts to stress and the level of control that they believe that they have in a stressful situation. The third element is the coping strategies, which are employed by the individual to overcome stress; this element is crucial in determining the eventual outcomes of stress. Said outcomes (or effects) for the stressed person and their company is the final element of the model.\n\nCommonly, you would use the model to analyze a particular stress-related example. For instance, I could be an example. I am typically stressed whenever a deadline approaches, and the stressor in such a situation would be the deadline. I am a very stress-prone individual, which affects my stress response negatively, but I am also capable of controlling the situation, which improves my subjective perception of the stressor. My coping strategies vary, but the one I usually use before deadlines is binge eating my comfort foods (it is not healthy, please do not follow my example). The outcomes of the situation are mostly lost sleep and, at times, some weight gain. This is the way I can analyze a stressful situation with the help of OSI and see what the problem is, what I do wrong about it, and what I can do to make it better (say, do yoga instead of overeating for stress management).\n\nIn summary, the model allows considering the various aspects of stress, which eventually contribute to the relevant outcomes, as well as analyzing the latter. Additionally, this model is very individual-centered; it recognizes the fact that people have vastly different perceptions of stress and reaction to it depending on their personality, culture, and other factors (Chang & Taylor, 2013). It is because of these advantages that I chose the model for this book. I will use it to examine the crucial elements of workplace stress and determine the approaches to its management. However, I should probably mention the fact that the Michigan model is by no means the only one. It provides a good structure for the book, but in other sections, I will reference a few other approaches to understanding stress, its causes, and its consequences. Perhaps, you will find another model more to your liking, but from my perspective, they are all useful to their ends, especially when describing different aspects of occupational stress.\n\nSources of Occupational Stress\n\nHaving just reviewed the OSI from the Michigan model, I would like to point out one little fact: in it, stressors are important enough to make them the first element. This logic makes sense: the stressors are what causes stress, and without them, there is nothing to analyze. So, I will be logical as well; I will also start my investigation of stress with stressors.\n\nSimply put, stressors are the factors that tend to result in stress. As I have established, people have different reactions to and understanding of stress. To account for all these different views, any factor that can potentially cause distress in a person is usually viewed as a stressor. As pointed out by Britt and Jex (2015) and Landsbergis et al. (2017), the number of potential stressors in the workplace might be infinite. Certain groups of stressors have been established, although it can be argued that they are distinguished because of the increased attention of researchers to them rather than their actual importance. However, they did attract the attention of researchers, and investigations did show them to have an impact on stress in workers. Using recent research, I will present and analyze them in this chapter.\n\nWhile reading this section, keep it in mind that the presented stressors are rarely at work individually. It is entirely possible to be affected by several stressors at once, and individual situations and factors may modify the eventual outcome (Landsbergis et al., 2017). However, this classification can assist in understanding the causes of stress, which, in turn, will help prevent or manage it. Let’s get started: there is a lot to cover.\n\nWork Demands\n\nThe first topic to consider is the stressors that are associated with work demands. Work can be demanding from multiple perspectives: this category includes aspects like workload, working hours, the specifics of the tasks that may be stressful (for instance, frequent deadlines), the level of control over the job (the ability to choose what to do), and so on (Landsbergis et al., 2017; RAND, 2015). It is noteworthy that both rotating shifts and night shifts (especially permanent ones) can result in stress, which can be attributed to the disturbance of sleep patterns or social interaction. Also, rotating shifts hurt one’s internal organs, including the heart, stomach, and bowels; they can cause diseases of these organs (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Thus, it is not just stress that makes them dangerous.\n\nSimilarly, there exists sufficient evidence to suggest that overworking can cause stress. It is not very good for a person’s health in general since overtaxing your bodily reserves is generally bad for you (Munakata, Muratsubaki, Hattori, Li, & Fukudo, 2016; Tayama, Li, & Munakata, 2014), but on top of that, you get stressed. This problem has been reflected in the concept of “death from overwork” – karoshi, an initially Japanese term that has been applied to other settings as well (Britt & Jex, 2015; Tayama et al., 2014). For instance, it has been shown that overworking is associated with heart problems, and a cardiac arrest may be one of the ways of falling victim to karoshi (Munakata et al., 2016; Tayama et al., 2014). Yes, you can work yourself to death. Please do not do that.\n\nMoreover, particular types of tasks can also be especially stressful. Short-cycle and narrow tasks that do not involve creativity, tasks that are particularly demanding, or tasks that do not allow for much job control are among the ones that are stress-related (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Overall, workplace demands are a significant health concern that is a source of multiple stressors.\n\nWhen assessing work-related demands, Britt and Jex (2015) recommend focusing on the perceived features of the job: for instance, its perceived difficulty, intensity, and pace. The responsibilities that are associated with a post should also be taken into account. Additionally, the safety of the work should be noted; if a job is associated with activities that are perceived as or are dangerous, it can cause additional levels of stress. The perceived characteristics can reflect the work-related stressors better than more objective ones (for instance, working hours) because different people can perceive the same amount of work as taxing or not taxing depending on their abilities, personality, and so on.\n\nThe System of Rewards\n\nConnected to the topic of work demands, the system of rewards, including promotion, can also be a source of stress. Research shows that a career is a major concern for many people (Landsbergis et al., 2017). We may be anxious to advance, experience under-promotion, or fear the possibility of being fired. Furthermore, as pointed out by Landsbergis et al. (2017), overpromotion may also be stress-inducing because of a real or perceived experience of not being qualified for the job. In other words, it is very common for us to be stressed because of potential career-related outcomes.\n\nThe issue of insufficient rewards is also noteworthy. Landsbergis et al. (2017) report that one of the models of job stress is concerned with this topic; it can be called “the effort-reward imbalance model.” The authors highlight the fact that the model has not been fully tested yet, but there exists some evidence to support the following premise. According to this model, the reward system can include monetary, career, or “esteem” rewards, and if persons feel that their efforts to perform their duties are not sufficiently rewarded, they can experience stress and a general decrease in morale. Pay some attention to different types of rewards: the model indicates that a person may feel that he or she receives sufficient monetary rewards but is not appreciated or distinguished enough (“esteem” rewards), and, as a result, might still experience stress.\n\n‘My wage is satisfying, it is really what I want, but I am not sure about my reputation among my colleagues and supervisors,’ shares his experience one of the respondents. ‘They say they like my work, they see improvements, but I don’t feel my opinion has some value in our company. It’s not about considerable stress that I feel because of that, it is about some pressure that I experience while speaking with my co-workers … Maybe, it’s stress, you are right …’\n\nThe idea of adequate rewards is rather subjective. According to the model, workers try to find the balance between efforts and rewards themselves, but if they fail to do so, strain and negative health consequences that are associated with stress may become a problem. Following the model, it is apparent that some people who are extremely committed to their job (for example, as a result of personal factors like perfectionism) may be under a greater risk of developing rewards-related stress.\n\nRole Stressors\n\nA separate source of pressure that is specific for occupational stress is associated with the roles that we play in the workplace. In particular, role ambiguity and conflicts have a significant potential for producing stress (Landsbergis et al., 2017). The former term refers to employees not being certain about their role in an organization. For instance, if their job responsibility is not clearly explained to them (as stated in their contract or established informally), they can experience role ambiguity. According to Britt and Jex (2015), a very common example is the employees who do not know for sure how to define satisfactory and dissatisfactory performance. If you cannot tell what your employer expects from you, role ambiguity explains your situation.\n\n‘When I was hired, HR managers informed me about the list of my duties. But now I also perform responsibilities typical of the position for which they cannot find the right person. I receive bonuses for additional work, but I am still against this situation because I do not feel confident when performing tasks not related to my qualifications and experience,’ explains Jake. The described situation is one of the variants of stressful role ambiguity observed in the workplace.\n\nIn turn, the term “role conflict” refers to the problems which arise when a part of an employee’s responsibilities makes it difficult or impossible for them to perform their other tasks. Here, the simplest illustration is excessive work demands: if you do not have enough time to perform all your duties, the related responsibilities are going to conflict. Another example is concerned with the roles that people play at work and outside of it; if the job prevents a person from, for instance, taking care of their family, inter-role conflict may arise (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Both role-related issues can become the sources of significant stress depending on individual situations and the traits of the person who experiences them. For instance, Britt and Jex (2015) report that, in some cases, role ambiguity might be viewed as something positive if it offers an opportunity for a more flexible approach to one’s responsibilities. However, the fact that these issues can cause stress remains critical and needs to be taken into account when developing the strategies to prevent tension.\n\nWork Conditions\n\nDo you remember the stimuli that Hans Selye’s mice were subjected to? Unsurprisingly, humans also do not react well when subjected to negative physiological stressors. A very common example that is often cited to illustrate humans’ susceptibility to various physical influences is the seasonal affective disorder. It is found in people who live in an environment that lacks sunlight (particularly, the Arctic Circle) and is, as a result, deprived of it. Due to this disorder, we know that human bodies do not take well to the lack of sunlight: without it, we become depressed. Similarly, influences like radiation, biological threats, and toxins take a direct toll on human bodies. Some other examples include extreme temperatures and noise, as well as insufficient ventilation, bad, poor lighting, and uncomfortable furniture (Landsbergis et al., 2017).\n\nTo sum it up, if a person is physically uncomfortable, it is difficult for them to perform their job, and they might also experience negative health outcomes. In addition to that, the risk of exposure to various hazards, including toxic substances, and the risk of injury is known to increase stress in workers. Thus, the work conditions of an employee are also a significant concern that can result in stress.\n\n‘Everyone knows that working in our sphere (the maritime industry) is both about sitting in offices and being onboard. These environments influence the quality of our work. I’d like to change my job if I do not feel comfortable and safe at work,’ states an interviewee.\n\nThe category of work conditions can be expanded to include the organizational aspects of one’s job, including management, leadership, policies, and so on. For instance, there is evidence that suggests that particular approaches to management can be more stress-inducing, and a few good examples are excessive restrictions and the exclusion of employees from decision-making (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Both can result in negative outcomes, including reduced self-esteem, strain, and lower employee satisfaction, which are likely to be associated with stress.\n\nAnother element of work conditions can be described as “job resources.” This term is used in the Job Demands-Resources model of stress, according to which the balance between job demands and the resources that a job provides is what defines the risks of developing stress (Landsbergis et al., 2017). The resources that are cited by the model are often intangible like managerial feedback, supervision opportunities, the possibility of promotion, and even social support. These factors need to be taken into account when working to reduce stress risks in the workplace.\n\nInterpersonal Stressors\n\nA working environment is rarely limited just to work; most often, it presupposes interacting with people, including co-workers, managers, and clients, as well as the representatives of other organizations. These interactions can be formal or informal and friendly, neutral, or antagonistic, and they form another element of working conditions and a psychological climate in the workplace. Depending on the specifics of the encounter, the perception of employees involved in it, and their interpersonal skills, communication can be a source of stress. Certain interactions, however, are especially likely to become stressors.\n\nFor example, one of the major issues at work, as reported by Britt and Jex (2015), is workplace incivility that can include various minor violations of accepted norms of decency, in which it is not clear if a person committing this violation intends to harm someone else. The illustration that the authors use accentuates that gossiping is rarely meant to hurt someone, but it implies the disrespect of a person’s privacy and might result in negative outcomes (for instance, rumors) that can cause actual harm. Apart from that, there are direct instances of bullying and harassment, in which co-workers or superiors may act as perpetrators. All these factors are extremely stressful, and they are necessary to be defined in this book.\n\n‘Unfortunately, gossiping at work is a common practice. In my previous workplace, two teams gossiped against each other; it was like a war, and productivity of the whole unit decreased because of impossible cooperation and a stressful atmosphere,’ notes Mike, discussing this problem in the context of interpersonal stressors.\n\nIndeed, even though most of us have either witnessed or even personally experienced one or several interpersonal stressors, many people feel that they do not fully understand what they mean. Thus, bullying is usually defined by the presence of particular features: it is supposed to consist of repeated acts that are performed by a person (or people) who have relatively more power than their victim with the intent of harming him or her. The acts do not have to be physical; psychological bullying is also extremely harmful. Harassment, in turn, is a legal term: it involves “unwanted physical or verbal behavior that offends or humiliates” (Faucher, Cassidy, & Jackson, 2015, p. 112). In the cases when several people “gang up” against one person, both bullying and harassment can be referred to as mobbing. All the mentioned types of behavior have negative impacts on a victim’s health and productivity, and they are associated with stress.\n\nNow, regardless of the obvious fact that the above-mentioned behaviors are highly immoral and can be illegal, they are not rare. According to a recent survey by the Workplace Bullying Institute (2014), which was carried out in the US, 27% of the respondents reported experiencing bullying, and an additional 21% reported witnessing it. The same survey also indicates that people are typically very reluctant to intervene and stop abusing behaviors, but in general, Americans want to have the anti-bullying legislation to be implemented. Thus, interpersonal stressors can be very prevalent, which makes them an important source of stress.\n\nWork-Life Boundaries\n\nBritt and Jex (2015) recommend paying much attention to the boundary between work and life as another potential source of stress. This situation is likely to be very common for readers: work demands a lot of time, which is why we sometimes feel that we do not get enough time to live. Furthermore, outside of the workplace, we also play several roles that tend to come with certain responsibilities (American Psychological Association, 2015). For instance, parents have the responsibility to take care of their child: the more they have to work, the less time (and strength) they have to help their child with home tasks. On the other hand, the responsibilities of children to take care of their aging parents are also similar and can be thwarted by the vital responsibility to earn money. Other illustrations may include the roles of spouses, friends, community members, and so on. That is how workplace roles can conflict with people’s life or social roles.\n\nSome examples of this conflict were discussed during the interviews with employees in the maritime industry. ‘When coming home, I have only an hour or two to just talk with my children before they go to sleep. There were days when I came late at night and could not see my Rosie and Johnsy for a whole week,’ Daniel shares his experience.\n\nMoreover, Britt and Jex (2015) note how this category is similar to the role-related stressors and points out that it is also connected to workplace demands. After all, excessive workplace demands are an important source of the conflict between professional and life roles. On the other hand, the authors also note that especially important life duties (for instance, caring for a sick relative) may, in turn, interfere with job responsibilities. Both situations are reported to be stressful, but sufficient evidence indicates that people are particularly distressed when they cannot perform their non-work-related duties. Britt and Jex (2015) explain that this tendency is likely to be related to the fact that non-work-related duties are most often connected to one’s family, which is a universal value for people all over the world. It is much more stressful to fail as a parent than as an engineer. To sum up, work-life boundaries can indeed become an important and prevalent source of stress for professionals.\n\nExternal Stressors\n\nWhile the workplace has a lot of stressors that can affect an employee, they can come to work already stressed. A simple example is associated with issues that happen at home, for instance, an illness of a close person or legal problems of someone in the family. Paradoxically, as noted by Britt and Jex (2015), even happy events can be sources of stress; for instance, marriage is often associated with difficulties related to the procedures, ceremony, and the initial problems of adjustment to the new status and life. Attempting to describe or categorize external (extra-organizational) stressors may be futile. The point is that not all the stressors are present within or related to an organization, which can make it difficult to monitor, contain, or control them.\n\n‘It’s funny, but I like Mondays because I have time to concentrate and focus on work in my comparably silent office after active weekends with my family,’ this provocative idea was expressed by one of the interviewees discussing work and family stressors, and it serves as an example to illustrate the variety of external stressors.\n\nFactors Affecting Stress\n\nThe main conclusion that can be made from the discussion of stressors is that occupational stress is complex. It emerges from a wide variety of sources, some of which are not even concerned with the workplace. To make the issue even more complicated, some factors affect stress and can worsen or lessen its impact on employees. This section will consider these factors and attempt to characterize their diverse effects concerning occupational stress. Pay attention to the words of one of the respondents participating in my project, ‘I know when I am stressed, I can recognize this feeling, mood, or condition, but I cannot tell what has caused it. I can’t prevent it in the future.’ From the perspective of the Michigan model, this section is dedicated to the second element of stress: persons experiencing it. As you will see, when discussing the person, a great number of relevant factors should be considered, including personality, behaviors, lifestyle, and so on.\n\nPersonality and Other Personal Factors\n\nDifferent personality traits and behaviors of employees may affect the way each individual reacts to stress, and sometimes, they are interconnected. One of the most commonly discussed concerns related to job stress is the “Type A behavior pattern,” which can be characterized as an over-achieving, highly competitive, excessively committed, and driven behavior. Using the information that we have already learned about possible stressors, we can see that this approach to work can be stress-inducing: the anxiety to advance and excel is stress-inducing, the possibility of the effort-reward balance getting skewed is stress-inducing, and the continuous strive for perfection is stress-inducing and potentially exhausting. Landsbergis et al. (2017) report that research shows the association of Type A behavior with coronary heart disease, not to mention some emotional outcomes like irritability and anger. More research is required for conclusive statements, but the potential riskiness of Type A behavior is apparent.\n\nWhat factor causes this type of behavior? A common approach to explaining it focuses on personal characteristics: some people have personality traits that make them more prone to perfectionism or more likely to be competitive. However, some organizational factors might also contribute, including, for instance, the encouragement of competition or over-achievement that may be found in a company’s policy or unspoken rules. A common example is an encouragement of what can be defined as workaholism: if your company promotes the idea that overworking yourself is good for the bottom line (which is questionable), it might be pushing you and your coworkers toward Type A behavior. Similarly, a workaholic manager might encourage similar behavior in their employees either directly or indirectly, leading through example (Clark, Stevens, Michel, & Zimmerman, 2014). Either way, as a form of behavior that employees may adopt, Type A behavior is a personal factor that may put one at an increased risk of stress.\n\nOn the other hand, personal factors can also result in a reduced risk of stress. As a counterpoint to Type A behavior, Landsbergis et al. (2017) discuss the “hardy personality type,” which is characterized by having the traits and beliefs that make it easier to cope with stress. Examples include optimism and healthy coping strategies (as opposed to unhealthy ones like drinking alcohol; we will discuss coping strategies in detail later in the book). Another potentially positive personal factor is the so-called “internal locus of control.” This term is used for people who are certain that they can control events in their life. If you think that you have the power to control the things that happen to you, then you may be described as a person with an internal locus of control, which, according to Landsbergis et al. (2017), makes you less prone to stress. Fatalism, on the other hand, or the belief that one’s life cannot be controlled, has a greater association with stress.\n\nHere are some ideas on the issue from my interviews with workers in the maritime industry: ‘Overworking until ignoring my basic needs and desires – that is about me. I really cannot stop working without completing the task, and it’s my path to burnout,’ says John.\n\n‘When I understand that I can directly influence the situation, I feel better because I have prepared solutions to different force majeure situations. Yes, I try to prepare to force majeure cases,’ smiles Jenny. Additionally, Maria notes, ‘I feel under pressure when I cannot control everything; that is why I am not good at delegating.’\n\nFinally, Landsbergis et al. (2017) point out that one’s capabilities may have different effects on the level of stress experienced at work. We have mentioned coping strategies, but on top of that, one’s job qualifications may also matter. The lack of work experience is stress-inducing while its presence may result in improved coping. Consequently, it is not uncommon for people to become more relaxed as they gain the experience of working in one environment. Even if the stressors are not removed, an employee adapts and becomes better at managing them.\n\nLifestyle\n\nIt is logical to suggest that lifestyle factors can matter for stress management. In general, the state of your body is a major moderating factor for your stress experiences. You may have felt this connection yourself if you ever had to work while feeling a little under the weather as compared to the days when you were healthy and energetic. Landsbergis et al. (2017) point out that good health and physical fitness have the potential of improving one’s reaction to stress, although more research on the topic is required to determine the magnitude of this effect. Still, a person who does not smoke eats enough healthy foods, and exercises regularly are more likely to be able to cope with occupational stress effectively than a person with less sound lifestyle choices. I will keep that in mind; perhaps, it will help me to resist the temptation when I want my stress-reducing but unhealthy snacks. Here is what the participants of my project said about this aspect: ‘I am not sure that there is a real connection between stress and smoking,’ ‘I usually cope with stress eating sweets,’ ‘When I had started jogging, I began to feel more energetic and more productive at work.’ These statements indicate that this aspect needs detailed analysis later in the book.\n\nThe Concept of Personal Energy and Other Resources\n\nIn their book devoted to stress and its management, Britt and Jex (2015), consider the topic of personal energy, which they identify as the “energy we possess at a given time that can be used to get things done” (p. 139). It is difficult to measure, which is why the authors believe that an appropriate approach to the task would consist of the personal feelings of an individual. Simply put, your level of personal energy depends on how energized you feel at a particular moment. For instance, does the task that you need to undertake to excite you? Do you have the strength and enthusiasm to face it? Do you have the personal resources for it? By responding to these questions, you can determine your energy levels.\n\nEnergy levels can fluctuate during the day; some people feel very energized in the mornings, and others prefer to work at night. Also, different tasks can be associated with different levels of energy. For instance, a very tedious or strenuous activity may be more energy-intensive, and, therefore, you may feel less prepared to undertake it when you are not at your best. Britt and Jex (2015) offer using a scale from 0 to 6 to assess one’s energy levels, in which 0 signifies no energy whatsoever, and 6 stands for the maximum amount of energy you can potentially have. The authors also highlight the fact that personal energy is finite: it is possible to exhaust oneself completely, and this outcome can have no positive effects on one’s well-being or performance.\n\nPersonal energy is important for the discussion of occupational stress because it is the primary resource that allows people to accomplish things and respond to work demands. If a person is low on this energy and cannot find the means of replenishing it, they are going to start experiencing stress. Therefore, while personal energy is not a stressor, its lack can be viewed as such. Furthermore, Britt and Jex (2015) also point out that apart from personal energy, the loss (or the threat of loss) of other resources (like money, support, and so on) can also be stressful. For instance, if a person feels that their salary or bonuses may get cut, the situation can cause stress for them. Continuous losses of resources, especially personal energy, are predictive of burnout.\n\nAn important factor for losing energy is interpersonal stressors; they are capable of depleting one’s energy reserves, leaving less strength for work-related tasks. Additionally, certain interpersonal activities (most often associated with helping someone) can also require some energy. However, Britt and Jex (2015) highlight the fact that the presence of other people can also help to restore personal energy; in fact, even rival energy can invigorate us. Therefore, social interactions can have varied effects on personal energy.\n\nDemographics and Stress\n\nNowadays, employers become increasingly aware of the fact that their workforce is diverse, and among other things, this fact is interconnected with the issue of occupational stress. The research of the demographics of stress is not very extensive (Ferris, Daniels, & Sexton, 2014), but a crucial aspect of these interrelationships is noteworthy: diversity is associated with stress in the instances when it is not managed well. For instance, a workplace that is not inclusive and supports any kind of discrimination will invariably cause stress in the discriminated group. The mechanisms of this tendency can differ; for instance, bullying that is related to discrimination is a direct stressor from the interpersonal category, and the glass ceiling is related to the rewards system.\n\nSociocultural and socioeconomic barriers are interconnected in this regard, and they can include the preferential treatment of certain groups during hiring, compensation, performance evaluation, and promotion. For instance, Ferris et al. (2014) demonstrate that for people belonging to racial or ethnic minorities, career advancement is more complex than for white people. Similarly, women, especially women with children and older women, have been reported to receive lower wages when compared to men, and a common explanation of this tendency is the prejudice which implies that women are too focused on their families to be efficient workers (Sheth, Gal, & Skye, 2018). In addition to that, bullying and harassment affect minorities disproportionately; a common example is the sexual harassment of female employees. Overall, Ferris et al. (2014) report that discrimination is commonly connected to stress along with all its negative outcomes, including reduced psychological and physiological well-being.\n\nAnother significant issue that is related to discrimination is cultural diversity. It is not uncommon for the employees who belong to minority groups to suppress their culture to conform with the dominant one in their company, which is typically more or less identical to the culture of the dominant group (Ferris et al., 2014). This kind of conformity can also become a source of stress, especially in case there are significant conflicts between the two cultures. The same can apply for general, personal beliefs and values, which are also typically dependent on belonging to a particular minority culture. Overall, the primary lesson of the demographics of stress is that minorities find themselves at an increased risk of stress as compared to dominant groups.\n\nAn important observation to make is connected to socio-economic disparities. Specifically, people from low-income households can be more prone to stress than those from wealthier families as a result of a complex interplay of multiple factors. Some of them include the increased possibility of external stress-inducing situations, for instance, life in a high-crime neighborhood (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Similarly, lower-income populations are less likely to be able to afford housekeeping or childrearing services; as a result, they are overloaded with work at home and can experience interrole conflicts related to their family duties. Lower pay might increase one’s risk of failing to find a balance between efforts and rewards; additionally, lower-paying jobs can receive less recognition than higher-paying ones, which is another stress-inducing factor. Furthermore, as pointed out by Landsbergis et al. (2017), access to different coping strategies may be particularly limited for the people who have lower wages. For instance, a single mother with a low-wage job may find it particularly difficult to plan and afford travel for her vacation. To summarize, the demographic factors result in rather unique circumstances that can be directly or indirectly responsible for increased occupational stress risks.\n\nDemographics of the Maritime Industry\n\nThe maritime industry in the US and Singapore: is diversity a challenge? Having inquired both employees and managers from the US and Singapore about workplace diversity, I can conclude that it is a significant topic for most of them. The US has a rather diverse population. For instance, according to the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA, 2018), the most recent estimate indicates that around 16% of the population of the US are Hispanic, 12% are Black, and 4.8% are Asian. Also, there are native ethnic groups, including Amerindian and Alaska Natives (0.9%) and Hawaiian and other Pacific Islanders (0.2%). Several languages, including English and Spanish, are spoken in the US, and the population reports being affiliated to a wide variety of religions from Protestantism to Hindu. The workforce of the maritime industry in the US is no exception: it is quite diverse, and the industry acknowledges this fact.\n\n‘We have a lot of diversity programs,’ claims an HR from an American shipbuilding company. ‘We also have a relatively high percentage of women and people of color; there is some age diversity, and we employ a few veterans. We take diversity very seriously and do our best to achieve equality.’\n\nIn Singapore, diversity is also a significant topic. CIA (2018) states that as of 2017, the country divides its population into four general categories: Chinese (74.3%), Malay (13.4%), Indian (9%), and other (3.2%). The three latter groups include the following ethnicities: Malays, Indonesians, Indian, Pakistani, Bangladeshi, Sri Lankan, Eurasians, Caucasians, Japanese, Filipino, and Vietnamese. Four official languages are present (English, Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil), and multiple Chinese dialects were used by about 12% of the population in 2015. Diverse religions are present with Buddhism being the most popular one (33.2%) and Christianity, Islam, Taoism, and Hinduism also quite widespread. In addition to that, the maritime industry has a particular feature that is worth noting:\n\n‘The lower-level positions here are mostly occupied by foreigners,’ explains one of the managers to me, ‘and the locals are commonly in the management.’\n\nAs it turns out, this aspect of the maritime industry in Singapore causes not a small number of misunderstandings and misjudgment between the lower levels and the higher-ups.\n\n‘There are diversity efforts and programs, including those aimed at immigrants,’ the Singaporean manager notes. ‘We recognize the need to manage diversity. But it would be hypocritical to not acknowledge the fact that there is some inequality.’\n\nI also wanted to know if the managers of the US and Singapore view diversity as a problem to be solved, a challenge, or a potential asset. Most, however, stated that diversity is a fact or a working condition for them. Here are a few examples that I think offer pretty good points.\n\n‘I would not call it a problem, I would call it a statement of the problem,’ an American manager Steve suggested. ‘I have a diverse workforce and I need to help them be as productive as possible. Among other things, I have to keep it in mind that my followers are diverse – they have different backgrounds, different needs, and some of them may face unique challenges. If I do not keep that in mind, I will just fail to help them succeed.’\n\n‘I would not call diversity a problem,’ Singaporean manager Gemi told me, ‘mostly because I do not like the way it sounds. It sounds like I want my employees to be the same race, age, and gender, and I do not. The same goes for a challenge because it is just wrong to call diversity a challenge. However, I think that diversity is associated with challenges and problems because we have not achieved equality yet. I think that they are not the results of diversity – they are the result of us failing to achieve equality.’\n\n‘If you manage diversity right, your employees will feel more appreciated and accepted. It is an investment in your reputation and employee loyalty,’ Rebecca, who is an HR manager in a US maritime company, points out. ‘It will take effort, sure. So does running a business and solving any problem and challenge on the way. If you do not want to make an effort, you probably do not want a business.’\n\n‘Does your business make an effort?’ I am curious.\n\n‘It does,’ she states assuredly. ‘And if it suddenly stops, we are going to remind it that it has to.’\n\nAccording to my interviewees, in the maritime industry of the two countries I have had the opportunity to investigate, diversity is an important aspect of human resource management. Given its potential impact on stress, they believe that it is necessary to take it into account and make the effort to manage it appropriately by turning the challenges related to it into an opportunity for improved reputation and employee loyalty. I agree; do you?\n\nWomen in the maritime industry. The topic of gender diversity in the maritime industry is a complex one, and since it is connected to diversity and stress, I want to discuss it separately. I have seen the maritime industry in both the US and Singapore and I can testify that women in this field are not as commonly encountered as men. My interviewees can do the same: both the American and Singaporean managers and employees told me that women in the industry are less common than men, especially in technical positions.\n\n‘More, you know, office-based positions I think can have more women,’ an American seafarer tells me, ‘but here, we have mostly men. It has always been this way I think.’\n\nIndeed, the maritime industry has been a male-dominated industry since the dawn of time; this fact is reflected in the words of my interviewees and the literature on the topic (Grant & Grant, 2015). A few of the people I interviewed suggested that the specifics of the common jobs in the industry are not very appealing to women, but most of them also cited tradition and discrimination as the cause for the disparity. The situation has been steadily changing, of course, and nowadays, women hold about 34% of the workplaces in the industry worldwide. However, the number of women in the executive teams of the maritime industry amounts to less than 1% (Whiteman, 2018).\n\nIn technical positions, women hold about 14% of the workplaces. In the US, the number of women in the management sector of the industry appears to be at least relatively high (up to 20%). However, ample evidence indicates that the employees of the maritime industry in the US are still way more likely to be male than female (Whiteman, 2018). It is pretty difficult to find more specific statistics (for example, on the women in the maritime industry of Singapore), but the presented numbers still paint a rather clear picture. Many of the reasons for differing gender representation in the industry are associated with the factor that is also shown to be connected to stress: discrimination, especially its cultural aspects.\n\nSome of you might remember that there are cultures that view women as the bringers of ill fate for seafarers. While this idea seems ludicrous nowadays, a few other prejudices, which are often similarly ridiculous, may still prevent women from entering the industry. The traditional perspective on female roles is a major issue that can affect the attitudes towards women in the maritime industry and has historically done so. Employers and HR managers may find women unsuitable for the industry because of their perceived weaknesses or the duties that they are expected to perform concerning their families. For instance, since seafarers leave the shore along with their families for extended periods, this position can be perceived as inappropriate for a woman: she would be unable to take care of her children, and it would be inappropriate to have her husband do the thing, right? As for the strength of female seafarers, let us just say that if a woman attempts to get the position, she must have completed the relevant training. If her trainers think that she is qualified for the job, she is qualified for the job regardless of the harmful ideas about the abilities of women. In other words, the mentioned beliefs are barely better than the superstitions that are used to prevent women from entering the maritime industry, but still, they remain a problem.\n\nIn extreme cases, the discrepancies between the socially accepted female roles and those that women play in the maritime industry can result in bullying or the lack of support from families. When a woman’s choice to enter an industry is not supported by her family, or when she is ostracized by her coworkers and looked down upon by her superiors, she is likely to experience additional stress. For example, one of the first female cadets of the Singapore Maritime Officers’ Union’s Tripartite Nautical Training Award reported being teased by her coworkers when she was first introduced to them (Ho, 2015).\n\nThey were also trying to help her when she would not need it. It could be a touching gesture given that the men were, most likely, genuinely worried about their female colleague, but, of course, their actions ended up being demeaning and condescending. A female cadet of the Union is perfectly well-prepared for her duties, and this kind of well-meaning sexism could not (and was not) welcome. The woman explained that she found a way of combating the issue by showing that she was able to perform the same work as her coworkers, after which the attempts to help her were withdrawn and the men stopped their teasing. However, the fact that she had to prove her ability beyond having the necessary qualifications as determined by the Union and ensured by her training demonstrates that the issue of differential treatment of female workers in the maritime industry is indeed a problem. Naturally, it also shows the way women in the maritime industry may encounter additional stressors in the form of sexism and discrimination.\n\nAccording to the chief executive of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), women increasingly enter the maritime industry, and nowadays, they are not limited to the on-land professions. At the Singapore Maritime Academy, one-fifth of the Marine Engineering Diploma students are now female, and the numbers of women who obtain Certificates of Competency, which are necessary to work on ships, is growing. This fact shows that more women are being prepared for jobs in the maritime industry, which means that with time, the problem of discrimination is likely to abate. However, it also implies that for the next few years, decades, or, possibly, even longer, there will be more maritime workers fighting against the stress of discrimination as a result of being an actual minority in the field. Therefore, for the managers of the maritime industry, it is particularly important to check out the different aspects of gender-based discrimination, including the wage gap, which is a particularly stubborn testament to the fact that inequality is difficult to combat.\n\nWage gaps. While discussing women and other minorities in the maritime industry, it is necessary to review the problem of the wage gap as well. U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018) reports that on average, women earn about 82% of men’s income in the US. In Singapore, the figure is smaller: the Ministry of Social and Family Development (2017) states that in 2017, the monthly wages of women were about 10% lower than those of men. Wage gaps are a problem all over the world.\n\nAlso, the wage gap is a parameter that exists at the intersection of the discrimination of a variety of groups. For instance, while the wage gap between men and women is generally consistent, it is much more prominent between white men and women of color with the former earning almost twice as much as the latter (Sheth et al., 2018). Moreover, there is evidence which indicates that women with no children earn less than women without children (at least, in the US), but men with children are shown to be very likely to earn more than men without children. This tendency can be attributed to different factors, but some of the potential causes, according to the research by Sheth et al. (2018), include prejudice against motherhood (which can be viewed as a factor that reduces one’s commitment to work), as well as the idea that fathers are more likely to be committed to doing their job well since they need to provide for their child. Overall, the impact of gender stereotypes is not an unlikely cause of this particular aspect of the wage gap.\n\nFinally, it should be noted that the wage gap is preserved throughout the lifespan of employees: as women grow older, their pay is likely to decrease, but for men, it mostly increases (until the age of 65) in the US. The wage gap is a particularly good example of the way discrimination against different groups can intersect in individual cases.\n\nIt should be noted that it is difficult to locate recent statistics on wage gaps in the maritime industry. A study that took place in Jamaica and Barbados revealed that an average of 12-25% difference in the wages of men and women could be found in the maritime industry in the two countries with men earning more (Grant & Grant, 2015). Also, the mean hourly wage gap in the maritime industry is reported to amount to 36% (Whiteman, 2018). My interviewees could not provide me with direct figures that are true for their workplaces, but they generally supported the idea that women probably do not earn as much as men in their companies. The wage gap offers tangible proof of discrimination, and it is symptomatic of multiple underlying issues. As discrimination is a major stress factor, this issue needs to be taken into account when considering the means of reducing occupational stress in the maritime industry.\n\nSocial Support\n\nDespite my long digression on the fate of women and other minorities in the maritime industry, we are still talking about the factors that affect our stress reaction. As pointed out by Britt and Jex (2015) and Landsbergis et al. (2017), one of the primary non-job factors that are connected to occupational stress is social interactions. As I have mentioned, interpersonal relationships are a significant source of stress. However, they can be a buffer factor, one that reduces the effects of stress on a person, if the interactions are positive. Examples are multiple: supportive family or friends can provide an opportunity to rest and relax, as well as vent about job-related problems; coworkers or managers can also support an employee by providing emotional support, advice, or even direct assistance in job tasks.\n\nFrom the perspective of recent research (Landsbergis et al., 2017), the specific effects of this buffer might vary, but then, it is difficult to quantify support, which is subjectively evaluated by employees, and that makes it difficult to study. In any case, during my interviews, I routinely encountered comments about the importance of social support for coping with stress, although my interviewees typically used different terms. They commonly referred to their family, including parents and spouses, pointing out that just talking about their concerns with a close person helped to reduce anxiety. A few of the interviewees also commented on the way their colleagues helped them through difficult times. Furthermore, several of them commented on an unexpected aspect of our social interaction:\n\n‘I have a cat, and I swear to you, she knows it when I need some unwinding. She just comes to me and snuggles and purrs until I feel better. That’s my best anti-stress solution.’\n\nPets, of course. And I completely agree that it is one more way to get some support from another living creature. Thus, both subjective accounts and research evidence suggest that there is a possibility of social support modifying the effects of occupational stress.\n\nStress Resilience\n\nThe general term which is used to describe the ability of a person to cope with stressful situations is “stress resilience” (Britt & Jex, 2015, p. 71-72). According to Britt and Jex (2015), this particular ability is usually predicted by three components. The first one is social support. It is well-evidenced that somebody who has supportive people in their life is more likely to be able to cope with stress as compared to those who report the lack of such support (American Psychological Association, 2015). The sources of support can come from within the workplace (coworkers and supervisors) or outside of it (family and friends). The support itself can consist of assistance in resolving stress-inducing situations (for instance, taking care of someone’s child when they need to be at work) or offering emotional support (talking about a stressful event, for example). Furthermore, Britt and Jex (2015) report that people can become more resilient simply because they know that they can get help from somewhere: if you know that you can potentially discuss a troubling issue, this knowledge already helps you to deal with stress.\n\nListening to the interviewees’ responses, I have found an example of such behavior. ‘I have perfect relationships with my supervisor, he is always ready to help me. Knowing about this opportunity, I feel less stressed and more confident when working,’ says Mike.\n\nThe second element of stress resilience is concerned with a person’s traits: the relatively stable aspects of one’s personality. An example of a helpful trait is hardiness. Hardy people believe that they have a high level of control over their lives, are committed to their activities, tend to perceive stressors as challenges, and view them in a positive light. Thus, they are more likely not to experience severe negative reactions to stress. Other similarly useful traits include, for instance, optimism (because it is also associated with a positive perspective on events) and proactivity (because it enables people to respond to stressors before they become a significant problem and eliminate or even prevent them). Confidence, perseverance, and other traits may also be helpful.\n\nFinally, the third element of resilience can be defined as coping methods. Stress can result in very negative behaviors; for instance, smoking or substance problems can become one’s coping methods when stress is concerned. However, there are less harmful approaches and even beneficial ones, for example, listening to music or jogging to clear your head. According to Britt and Jex (2015), there is no actual limit to potentially useful coping methods, but their investigation in research provides more and more information about their relative effectiveness. This aspect of resilience will be considered in the following chapter. As you can see, this term generally encompasses most of the personal stress-affecting factors. Check if this concept can help you to analyze the factors that contribute to your resilience. Maybe you can control some of them?\n\nThe Impact of Stress\n\nAs can be seen from the Michigan model, the impact of stress is one of the most significant of its aspects. However, it should be noted that stress outcomes are very diverse. If you take a look at the Michigan model and the above-described moderating factors, you can see that the specific results of stress are very likely to vary depending on the person experiencing stress, their circumstances, their response to stress, and coping methods, and so on. Further, it should be noted that certain stressors may hurt health as they are, regardless of stress itself. For instance, overworking and related fatigue is indeed considered to be bad for you regardless of the levels of stress that you experience. Still, stress outcomes have been researched from different angles (Landsbergis et al., 2017), which allows, at the very least, to propose the following conclusions.\n\nHealth Outcomes\n\n‘Constant stress can’t be good for you. I am speaking from experience. I remember that in my previous workplace, a general strategy was to work as much as possible. My boss was a workaholic, and he set the tone for everyone else. I felt this continuous fatigue; eventually, I just did not want to do anything. And I was exhausted – mostly emotionally. The worst thing about it was that this state persisted even when I was away from work – days off, vacations… I simply could not rest enough.’\n\nWhen discussing the topic of the outcomes of stress with the employees in the maritime industry, I gathered a lot of accounts similar to this one. People report overwhelming fatigue, loss of motivation, and depression. On the other hand, a few had different stories to tell.\n\n‘I become extremely irritable when I am stressed. When nearing an important deadline, I try to limit my contacts with other people because I have a feeling that I might snap. I am glad that my family is understanding and supportive, but it would be difficult to gain similar support from my supervisor, and I do not want to take it out on other people.’\n\nSuch differences in reactions to stress are natural, but if you think about it, they are similar in one thing: they are associated with negative feelings and experiences. A few of the interviewed managers have also noted that they read or heard of stress having more profound impacts on one’s psychological and even physiological state. Their ideas are supported by recent literature, which proves that stress is harmful to a person’s health (Cooper & Quick, 2017). Here are some general conclusions about its effects.\n\nPhysiological effects\n\nStress tends to hurt human bodies. If the organism functions under stress during a long period, this situation associated with the active secretion of stress hormones leads to dysfunction in body systems. For instance, our heart and blood vessels can be damaged by stress: it increases blood pressure, as well as the risks of cardiovascular diseases like heart attacks or angina (Seaward, 2018). The reason for developing these stress-related diseases is the release of cortisol provoked by stress and affecting the work of the heart muscle and the increased heart rate, making the cardiovascular system work more intensively till its exhaustion.\n\nStress can also lead to problems with the stomach and bowels, for instance, constipation and diarrhea. Irritable bowel syndrome associated with nausea, constipation, diarrhea, and abdominal pain is also a common health outcome of stress (Mosadeghrad, 2014; Seaward, 2018). The causes of this syndrome are changes in the neural stimulation of the organs of the gastrointestinal tract as well as the changes in eating behaviors because of the loss of appetite or, instead, increased hunger. The problem is that many people do not pay attention to these signals of their organism, and they cannot see the connection between their condition and stress. Unfortunately, if stressful factors are not removed, medications cannot have a prolonged relieving effect.\n\nOverall, stress can cause discomfort, pain, and even serious diseases that affect various parts of the human body. Thus, stress can cause pain in muscles and bones, as well as headaches. In many people who suffer from chronic stress, specialists diagnose temporomandibular joint dysfunction associated with pain in jaw joints and bruxism (grinding your teeth at night). What is the connection between these conditions and stress? When a person suffers from untreated stress, muscles and joints cannot relax, and their regular functions become affected because of constant tension. Furthermore, the tension in the muscles of the jaw and forehead often leads to tension headaches because of the contraction of muscles (Seaward, 2018). This type of headaches is rather often related to stress. If stress is chronic, associated changes in the vascular tension can lead to migraines that are rather difficult to be addressed with the help of medications.\n\n‘I began to suffer from migraines five years ago after changing my job and moving to another city. During those three months, I also finished my divorce process. I had no time to think about stress, but it caused migraines,’ notes Andrew, one of my interviewees. A lot of other people I talked to noted similar issues. Even I have had some nasty bowel-related experiences when preparing for my exams back in school. Such effects are a very common experience, as you can see, which only serves to prove that stress is bad for your body.\n\nPsychological effects\n\nOn the other hand, many of the stress-related issues are psychological: mood problems, depression, and anxiety can also be a direct product of stress. Mood problems can be viewed as short-term reactions to stress when depression is a complex disease that requires medical treatment and monitoring by a professional. If an individual has some of the listed symptoms, it is possible to speak about negative outcomes of stress on his or her psychological state: persistent feelings of hopelessness and sadness decreased productivity, and the loss of interest in favorite or usual activities among others (Seaward, 2018). Depression and anxiety are frequent psychological responses of the organism to stressful situations when an individual cannot cope with them effectively.\n\nA very common outcome is sleep disturbances (Landsbergis et al., 2017). The quality of sleep in persons depends on the balanced work of such hormones as epinephrine, norepinephrine, serotonin, and melatonin. The release of these hormones is based on a variety of factors: situations experienced during a day, stress, emotions, the caffeine intake, meals, light, and the use of mobile phones (Seaward, 2018). Thus, inappropriate everyday routines and unhealthy habits that are combined with stress at work can lead to sleep disturbances. Still, people often do not pay attention to such details as the light caused by the screens of their smartphones, TV sets, laptops, and tablets at night. Many individuals also do not follow the rule of avoiding watching TV or using smartphones and computers for two hours before going to sleep. However, even good sleep hygiene might not save you from insomnia if you are stressed.\n\nIf we look into more extreme outcomes, we will find that significant and prolonged stress can cause ideas of suicide (Mosadeghrad, 2014), as well as provoke violence (American Psychological Association, n.d.). Thoughts of suicide are usually related to situations when individuals experience stress and depression during a long period. Stress is associated with the range of working tasks that seem to be unbearable, overworking, and the lack of rest can be worsened because of problems in the family (Seaward, 2018). As a result, individuals begin to suffer from depression and think about their death as the only way to cope with all the problems they face. If a person speaks about death, it is an extremely important sign to pay attention to and demonstrate support and offer help concerning professionals’ assistance. The American Psychological Association (2013) also notes that the health issues which existed before a stressing event may be aggravated by stress responses. If a person has experienced problems with depression or, say, anger management, stress can be particularly bad for them.\n\nLess harmful outcomes may include a lack of concentration or emotional exhaustion. When individual experiences regular stressful situations at work, his or her ability to concentrate becomes affected because stress influences the brain activities and the speed of reactions. It is possible to observe a kind of a vicious circle when stress at work causes exhaustion and mistakes that can be associated with the lack of concentration which leads to more stress and anxiety. This is an unpleasant outcome since it can be bad for one’s performance, which may cause more stress since the person gets worried about keeping their job, which makes him or her perform worse, which… you get the picture.\n\nThe fact that stress can affect attention is also hazardous. Indeed, it is well-established that workers with high levels of stress are more likely to make mistakes and be insufficiently attentive (Landsbergis et al., 2017). In dangerous environments, mistakes can result in incidents and accidents, which can lead to traumas. An example is the increased rate of crashes among workers with prolonged shifts (Landsbergis et al., 2017). The bottom line is that, in most cases, individuals cannot effectively work under pressure of stress, tiredness, and nervousness. As a result, the brain uses a coping mechanism, and a person becomes less attentive or more relaxed without his or her intention. This specific and often uncontrolled state can lead to fatal errors in the workplace, but, unfortunately, managers often do not consider this aspect and make employees accept over hours despite their physical, emotional, and psychological state. To sum up, the psychological effects of stress cause suffering, reduced quality of life, and may even be life-threatening in more ways than one.\n\nBehavioral patterns\n\nAs if affecting our body and brain is not enough, stress causes people to engage in a variety of unhealthy behaviors. For instance, unhealthy eating habits like overeating (that’s me), skipping a meal, or eating unhealthy foods are often connected to stress (RAND, 2015). If you are looking for a more dangerous outcome, think about substance abuse (from smoking to alcohol or drugs). These behaviors may be a coping mechanism or, for instance, in the case of fast food, the result of workplace demands: after all, many people do not have the time or resources to obtain healthy foods for every meal while also working themselves to death (Britt & Jex, 2015).\n\nFurther, as I have mentioned, stress can result in bad sleeping hygiene, which, technically, is a harmful behavioral pattern (Cooper & Quick, 2017; Mullan, 2014). All these side-effects of stress are not good for one’s health and can cause additional issues or aggravate the rest of the mentioned problems. On the one hand, these behaviors can provide a person with an immediate feeling of relief and satisfaction. On the other hand, referring to a long-term perspective, a person will be dissatisfied with the negative effects of eating fast food or breaking a regular sleep regimen. It is particularly bad for you if you have this nagging perfectionism which tells you that every Big Mac is a failure. As a result, stress will intensify, and it will be fed up by an individual’s wrong choice of coping strategies. Look, another vicious circle!\n\nInterpersonal relationships\n\nYou knew this was coming. Yes, stress can affect interpersonal relationships, especially in people who tend to get irritable when stressed. Both family and working relationships can be damaged by stress-caused arguments and inappropriate behaviors (for instance, yelling or snapping). Particularly stressful work can intensify these issues; for example, employees with shift work and long hours are more likely to be divorced than their counterparts with more manageable working conditions (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Persons suffering from stress at work can be extremely emotional, feel dissatisfaction, fatigue, anger, and frustration. They can choose to be silent at home or shout at family members, cry or complain. All these reactions are problematic to cope with for both stressed individuals and their close people. Therefore, relationships with spouses, children, parents, and friends can be affected because of stress. Sometimes people also do not realize that their actions or words are the results of their stress and tiredness rather than their bad intention; that is true for both the stressed person and their family. As a result, solving the problem can be difficult; you cannot even identify it after all.\n\nWhile this outcome is not directly connected to human health, the American Psychological Association (2015) highlights the significance of healthy relationships for one’s psychological health. Among other things, emotional support from a close person can help to reduce stress. The lack of such support and the deterioration of supportive relationships can either cause or aggravate stress. Thus, the damage to one’s relationships is indirectly harmful to one’s health. From this perspective, if family members can recognize stress in their close people, they are also able to help a person overcome it. Also, it is possible to achieve the highest results while creating a positive and relaxing atmosphere at home and encouraging this individual to share his or her concerns, feelings, and fears. When being asked about her support system, Alice has stated, ‘I understand that I am more productive when my family supports me. I honestly cannot work far from home, and I hate business trips that are too stressful for me.’ Norman has added that he likes finding cards prepared by his children in his case when coming to the workplace. Researchers state these details can contribute to decreasing the levels of stress in individuals (Landsbergis et al., 2017; Seaward, 2018). The support of a loving family can do wonders for a stressed individual.\n\nTo clarify, I just want to point out that stress does not excuse abuse, especially the abuse that is not verbal. However, aggression may be a sign of stress, particularly when a person is not usually violent but somehow grew to act like that over time. And aggression is a plausible outcome of stress, which just goes to prove that stress can be a huge problem with very serious consequences.\n\nThe general adaptation syndrome and the evils of chronic stress\n\nAs we have discovered, chronic stress is a special kind of evil, and among other things, its impact on health is worth noting. Do you remember the experiments of Hans Selye? Poor things would be exposed to all sorts of negative physiological factors, including things like hot and freezing environments or being cut. Well, one of the findings of Selye’s research included the general responses of rat’s bodies to all types of stress, which are quite disconcerting. Using science language, their adrenal cortex expanded (apparently, in response to the need to produce a lot of stress hormones, which is the function of the adrenal cortex), but their lymphatic glans shrunk or atrophied completely; white blood cells in their blood also reduced in numbers, and their stomachs and colons started forming ulcerations that would bleed.\n\nAll those changes were very slow and barely noticeable until significant damage was done to the animals, and eventually, the rats would die. According to Selye, these similar patterns might reflect a body’s general response to stress (Seaward, 2018). He theorized that, when in stress, an organism is bound to respond to it by overtaxing its various systems, which is why, if the stress is continuous, chronic, those systems may become exhausted. According to the researcher, many organs of the mice he worked with failed because of this exhaustion. He called this tendency the General Adaptation Syndrome because, from his perspective, all the negative outcomes of rat stress were the result of their organisms trying to get used to the situation. The poor rats tried to adapt to constant stress, but their bodies were not meant for such strain.\n\nNow, humans are not rats or mice, and workplaces are typically not similar to a rodent torture chamber (keep it in mind that those experiments took place at the beginning of the twentieth century; it was a different time). However, human bodies do react to stress by overtaxing our systems, and chronic stress is something that we can experience. Also, human body systems, for example, the cardiovascular one, show deterioration as a result of stress. Consequently, Selye’s ideas about the way chronic stress are prone to exhaust bodies may eventually be of interest to humans (Seaward, 2018). This theory can explain at least some of the negative health outcomes that stressed people’s experience while also providing a very sad illustration of what happens when stress overwhelms a body. Even if it is a rat body, you cannot tell me that the story about the shrinkage or atrophy of various organs is not alarming. Similar ideas and analogies were also discussed in the interviews conducted for my project.\n\n‘My body tries to adapt to any regime I choose to follow, but when deadlines are addressed and projects are completed, I feel being sick and I need one or two days of leave. I am wrung-out by then, and I understand what “unable to can” means.’\n\n‘Sometimes I feel like being in a hamster wheel that I cannot escape from because of that work I have to do every day, you know,’ adds one of the participants. ‘I feel drained, like my body does not have an ounce of strength left. I can’t force myself to get out of bed.’\n\nYes, humans know what it’s like to overtax their bodily systems even if they do not put it like that. We have something to learn from rat experiments.\n\nA note on differing effects\n\nIt is also noteworthy that the effects of stress depend on its nature. Acute stress, which is your response to an individual stressful event, is more likely to cause bowel problems like diarrhea or constipation rather than a major issue like angina. On the other hand, chronic stress is much more traumatic and can result in the most negative outcomes like heart attacks, suicide, or violence (American Psychological Association, n.d.). In any case, stress can have a direct negative impact on a person’s health.\n\nIt should also be mentioned that the outcomes of stress are mediated by multiple factors (keep in mind our stress model). For example, Landsbergis et al. (2017) report that one’s personality can significantly affect health outcomes of stress with more resilient people being less likely to experience significant adverse effects. Furthermore, the presence of social support is a particularly important dimension to consider; people who have the emotional support of others can be able to cope with stress more effectively. Also, the knowledge and use of healthy coping strategies is a factor. However, the potential of mediating factors cannot overshadow the fact that stress can be very bad for our health. As a result, even though some people might cope better than others, the health outcomes of stress should be viewed as the most significant concern for employers.\n\nThe Bottom Line (Companies and Stress)\n\nGiven the horrendous effects of stress on human health, it is apparent that managers must at the very least try to prevent occupational stress and alleviate their outcomes. After all, a manager needs to guarantee the physical safety of an employee and make sure that the job does not damage their health; the prevention of stress is just a way to secure the psychological safety in the workplace. However, there is another reason for managers to want to have healthy, happy employees: the bottom line.\n\n‘From my experience, a stressed worker is never a good worker. They are not very focused; they can be irritable, or there is some other significant problem which prevents them from working well. It is bad from every perspective: they make mistakes, they endanger themselves and others, they are not very good with customers… They are also not very motivated.’\n\nThis manager was correct in every instance. He pointed out the different reactions that people have when stressed while also assuming that neither of them is good for performance. For instance, in the United States, roughly equal numbers of people report either feeling angry or anxious as a result of stress; also, many become depressed, sad, or overwhelmed, as well as fatigued, because of it. Moreover, about one-third of Americans begin to lose motivation when stressed (American Psychological Association, 2015). And all the mentioned reactions are not particularly conducive to good performance. Indeed, an angry employee may cause conflicts, which are not good for productivity. A fatigued or depressed worker will not be able to do their best. A demotivated employee is not going to be particularly helpful. As a result, it is not surprising that modern research indicates rather unambiguously that stress is bad for employee performance (Mosadeghrad, 2014). The rest of the company-related outcomes are similarly unattractive.\n\nIndeed, apart from decreased performance, stressed employees are more likely to experience burnout and less likely to be committed to the organization which triggers such stress in them. They tend to have lower morale and job satisfaction as well (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Eventually, stressed employees have a greater risk of skipping or changing jobs. If I use business terms for the situation, I can say that stress increases absenteeism and employee turnover (Mosadeghrad, 2014). Furthermore, stress promotes the so-called presenteeism: the situation in which a person is present at work but remains withdrawn from it (Britt & Jex, 2015). For instance, employees can daydream, play games, or otherwise engage in some off-task behaviors, which eventually results in very little work being done.\n\nFinally, there are also counterproductive work behaviors that are evidenced to increase as a result of stress. They are similar to presenteeism and can intersect with it because they are also off-task, but they are different in that they are likely to disrupt the working process. Thus, chatting with another employee is off-task and can be classified as presenteeism, but if the action becomes disruptive, it may become counterproductive. For instance, when the chatting distracts an employee who is in the middle of performing an important and urgent task or involves talking instead of working, this type of behavior is counterproductive. Other examples of counterproductive behavior can be more problematic like, for instance, sabotaging a task, damaging a piece of machinery, or engaging in abuse and harassment. In other words, counterproductive behavior is an especially serious outcome of stress.\n\nOverall, the common examples of the negative effects of stress on employees are very detrimental to a company. They explain why employee performance decreases as a result of stress and hold some additional risks, especially in the case of extreme counterproductive behaviors. So, in the end, the bottom-line argument cannot be denied: stressed employees are not good for business, and to be effective, a company needs to find a way to reduce stress.\n\nPositive Effects of Stress?\n\nStress is not a toxic condition; it is not the type of health state that requires a health intervention in every case and situation. As pointed out by the American Psychological Association (2013), “stress can be a positive force, motivating you to perform well” (para. 1). This idea is explored in detail in business settings by Britt and Jex (2015) in their book Thriving under Stress. The book is focused on the way occupational stress can become a motivational force. The authors suggest that, by managing stress effectively, a person can “harness” and use it for job achievements. The book also recognizes the fact that managers are an important force that can help to educate employees on the topic of stress.\n\nHowever, Britt and Jex (2015) do not attempt to ignore the negative impact of stress on people. The costs of stress are among the first things that are covered by the book. Similarly, when considering stress management approaches, they specifically review the methods that can help to recover from anxiety. In general, their position is that high levels of stress are unlikely to stimulate people to become more motivated. Thus, the authors do not contradict the idea that stress is problematic directly: they recognize its negative outcomes and aim their book at assisting employees to reduce stress.\n\nStill, Britt and Jex (2015) suggest that viewing stress as an “inherently toxic experience that should be avoided at all costs” is not likely to bring positive results (p. xi). This approach demonizes stress and promotes the idea that people should try to avoid or eliminate stress from their lives, which is not feasible. Instead, the authors demonstrate that stress can be symptomatic of a challenging environment, which can foster development. Additionally, they also suggest that certain negative outcomes of stress, in particular, health-related strains like irritability can have a silver lining since they signal the presence of stress in one’s life. As long as they are not debilitating, they can motivate us to make some changes which would be better for our health. For instance, after noticing some stress-related outcomes, one can choose to work less or take a vacation. In general, Britt and Jex (2015) support a positive approach to stress, which, as they prove, has its merits.\n\n‘I consider my work as challenging and associated with both emotional and physical pressure and stress. But I got used to stressing in my life as a companion of all my activities, and I think I can achieve better results when working under stress,’ one of the interviewees explains his position regarding stress and motivation.\n\nIn this regard, it is important to remember that stress is mostly inevitable. The modern maritime business exists in an unstable, complex environment. Modern people experience unprecedented competition and are required to balance their work and life, both of which can be stressful. Worldwide or local crises can have an impact, resulting in unpredictable and harmful occurrences. Everyday events can be stressful too; non-work-related stressors are always going to be present. The need to develop is associated with changes and challenges, both of which tend to produce stress. Consequently, a more positive (or well-balanced) approach to stress may have its merits.\n\nStress and Eustress\n\nIn connection with the positive perspective on stress, it may be helpful to mention the term “eustress,” which means “good, positive stress.” For instance, when you undertake a difficult task that you find interesting and challenging or when you participate in a fun competition, you may experience eustress. It can also be the result of perceiving any stressor in an optimistic light. This beneficial stress results in some positive feelings like hope, vigor, enthusiasm, and so on. Additionally, eustress can boost performance and assist in the acquisition of crucial skills, including those related to stress management.\n\nWhen discussing eustress in workplace environments, Britt and Jex (2015) use the example of positive stress associated with emotional labor, specifically the demand to produce particular emotions as a part of job responsibilities. A simple illustration is the need to deliver your service with a smile, especially when you do not feel like smiling. This situation can be stressful since it requires some level of acting. There is evidence indicating that employees who attempt to feel the emotions that they are supposed to project can receive beneficial outcomes. For instance, by recalling a memory that makes them happy, they smile, improve productivity, and reduce stress. Also, this type of acting is more convincing, and it receives a better response from people who it is directed at. Thus, there are specific varieties of stress that are likely to have little to no negative effects.\n\n‘It is almost impossible to avoid stress in modern life, and sometimes, I just can’t stay positive and enthusiastic at work. My secret weapon against stress is thoughts about my children and funny moments that occurred this morning,’ shares Nina her feelings. However, solutions are something we will discuss in the next section; for the time being, just think if viewing stress in a positive light is possible for you. Perhaps, it is not a notion that is completely detached from reality.\n\nStress in the Maritime Industry: What Do We Know?\n\nOne of the reasons why I started this book, as well as the study of occupational stress in the maritime industry in general, is that there are not that many sources dedicated to this topic. There are occasional articles and some books that consider it, but most often, they are either dedicated to something different and merely mention stress or review a specific aspect of the maritime industry. In this chapter, I want to present you with the most recent research on the maritime industry so that you can make conclusions about the importance of this topic and its coverage.\n\nThe Importance of the Maritime Industry\n\nBefore I proceed to explain the significance of a stress-free workforce for the maritime industry, a few words should be said about the industry itself. The maritime industry incorporates multiple aspects, including seafaring, shipbuilding and repair, fishing, commercial diving, aquaculture, and so on (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2017). However, it is particularly important because the majority of the world trade (up to 90%) is supported specifically by the maritime industry (Grant & Grant, 2015). This industry is crucial for islands like Singapore because of their easy access to the sea and the limited amount of land and resources (CIA, 2018; Grant & Grant, 2015). Singapore employed the industry’s benefits to successfully develop strong trading links with several other countries, which has resulted in the prosperity of the city-state (CIA, 2018).\n\nIn other words, you could argue that Singapore is a maritime-dependent state because its trade relations are mostly based on the development of this sector. Maritime enterprises located in the city-state contribute to the progress of the country’s economy, and the focus on this industry allows for determining trends in its development. Globalization has significantly influenced modern approaches to developing the maritime sector of each nation, not only Singapore. However, the example of this country can demonstrate what success can be achieved in the field. In 2009, the vision regarding the further development of the nation was introduced, and the goal was formulated as becoming a globally recognizable maritime state. It was determined that, by 2025, Singapore would have the most developed maritime sector based on the implementation of advanced technologies and innovations (Myles, 2017). Currently, it is possible to observe the dynamic growth of the maritime industry in this city-state, and it seems that the vision and goal for the development of the sector will be addressed.\n\n‘I have been working in the maritime industry of Singapore for twelve years, and I remember how it began to alter in 2009. There were dynamic changes to address the demand for a more innovative and modernized sector that could assist in achieving the state’s economic goals,’ notes one of the interviewees from Singapore who participated in my project.\n\nFor the US, the maritime industry is also extremely significant to the point where it has affected almost every state, employing over 400,000 people (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, 2017). Thus, the number of people working as seafarers, mariners, and employees at shipyards as well as in shipping companies is considerable. In addition to creating jobs for thousands of citizens, in the US, the maritime industry is the key source of trade and commercial relations, national security, and economic growth. Waterborne commerce is the main contributor to the national economy concerning the maritime sector of the United States (Myles, 2017). Therefore, much attention is paid to making the US maritime industry, the shipbuilding sector, the fleet, and other related organizations sustainable and profitable.\n\nThe respondents participating in the interviews that I conducted on the topic of occupational stress have stated that they understood the importance of their industry for the economies of their countries. However, this industry should still be viewed as one of the most problematic and challenging ones in terms of conditions and environments in which employees are expected to work. I have had a chance to interview seafarers, technicians, managers, and many other workers, and while a lot of them mentioned generic stressors like deadlines or quality control, many of them also had comments about the way the specifics of the maritime industry affected stress levels in their lives. For instance, issues like safety concerns, which are especially important in, say, seafaring or shipbuilding, were a common topic. I will discuss these problems in detail below, but I will point out this: a major industry that remains a backbone for the economy of many countries could use stress-free workers.\n\nTo sum it up, the maritime industry provides workplaces, seafood, the means of transportation, and many other benefits which make it one of the primary pillars of the modern economy in multiple countries. These aspects accentuate the necessity of researching and discussing working conditions and employees’ attitudes in this sector with a focus on the problem of stress. As we have discovered together, stress is bad for a worker, bad for an employer, and bad for the customer. To help our maritime industry to prosper, we need to find ways of eliminating the negative stress that is commonly experienced within it.\n\nSeafarers and Stress\n\nAs I have mentioned, it is relatively difficult to find research that would focus on stress in the maritime industry, but I have to admit that this topic is rather huge. A lot of researchers choose to consider particular elements of the maritime industry instead so that they can hope to cover them more or less extensively. One of the aspects of the maritime industry stress that seems to receive at least some coverage is stress in seafarers. As highlighted by one of the researchers, Slišković (2017), the stress in seafarers is by no means studied exhaustively. The author points out that most of the studies on the topic produce rather weak evidence, especially since they typically consist of surveys, which are carried out ashore. Still, I was able to pinpoint at least some research on this topic, and I think that it may be useful for my readers.\n\nThe attention to this specific group of workers can be easily explained: seafarers are a very important part of the industry’s workforce, and they are likely to be subjected to particularly stressful circumstances. As reported by Yuen, Loh, Zhou, and Wong (2018), seafarers tend to have very high turnover rates, which, given their general shortage, is a significant issue for the industry. According to the authors, this problem is not country-specific; it is something that the maritime employers all over the world have to cope with. It is noteworthy, of course, that high turnover rates may be the result of excessive stress. Moreover, the stress in seafarers can be especially problematic because their job is often associated with danger; incidents and accidents at sea are not an insignificant or rare issue, and we know that stress can make a person absent-minded and accident-prone. Therefore, the attention of modern stress researchers to this group of maritime workers is understandable.\n\nChung, Lee, and Lee (2017), Håvold (2015), Slišković (2017), Yuen et al. (2018), and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2017) provide a general analysis of the stressors that are present in a working environment of a seafarer. They include the monotonous nature of their work and long and irregular working hours, which are common for the position. In response to these factors, seafarers often report fatigue and sleepiness, and the lack of rest or insufficient rest is another major factor for stress. It is noteworthy that sleepiness (just like stress) is also associated with increased safety problems; all of these factors are quite concerning.\n\nThe fact that seafarers are confined to one restricted location is also stress-inducing. Additionally, afloat, a physical environment is problematic: it often involves the noise produced by the ship and sea, which may make resting and sleeping difficult, and the movement can potentially cause sickness. Exposure to different climates, especially changing ones, maybe physically uncomfortable. Work-life boundary stress is also common for this group of workers: since the job requires being away from relatives for longer than usual, family time is often very short for seafarers.\n\n‘On the sea, I cannot feel relaxed. When a sail lasts more than four or five weeks, I grow so tense – but I can’t show it either, I don’t think. I chose this job after all,’ says one of the interviewed seafarers. Similar ideas were also presented by other interviewees: ‘I am sure that people in our profession should or even must be rather ascetic to cope with challenges and limitations we face every day,’ one of the respondents shares his opinion.\n\nSlišković (2017) and Yuen et al. (2018) also point out that an important aspect of a seafarer’s stress consists of their company’s (and management’s) attitude toward this group of workers. The authors note that seafarers often report being treated like “slaves,” are driven to work excessively, and are not sufficiently respected despite the significance of their work. If living and working conditions, as well as food, are low-quality, this problem can also be a source of stress, and it indicates disrespect toward seafarers too. As I have mentioned, insufficient reward systems are stress-inducing, and disrespect is one of the worst ways of “rewarding” a worker. Naturally, these studies do not imply that all the maritime industry mistreats its seafarers. But while Slišković (2017) focuses on specifically Croatia, Yuen et al. (2018) discuss the global maritime industry, which implies that this problem is probably not symptomatic of only one country.\n\nNaturally, general stressors like conflicts with crew members or the fact of responsibility are also applicable to seafarers. However, Håvold (2015) specifically focuses on the fact that seafaring is a dangerous profession. Tough weather conditions can endanger a vessel and, in certain cases, may limit visibility, which is especially important for maneuvering. Complex machinery can fail, resulting in significant issues and, potentially, incidents, or accidents. Human failure and errors can endanger both the erring person and their crew. The responsibility of a seafarer is huge and can be incredibly distressing; lives might very well be on the line. As a result, Håvold (2015) notes, safety measures, and attitudes are especially important for reducing stress-inducing factors of the seafaring profession.\n\nSlišković (2017) concludes by stating that the stressors experienced by seafarers are extremely numerous, which makes it difficult to cover all of them. However, this information can be used to explain high turnover rates and find some of the common mistakes of management in handling seafarers. Overall, the understanding of the topic would be beneficial for finding specific solutions to the stress experienced by these specialists in the maritime industry.\n\nGovernmental Sources\n\nSome country-specific information about the maritime industry can be found in governmental sources. The interest of the government in occupational stress in the maritime industry is explained by its potential dangers for human health, as well as the increase in incidents and accidents that it tends to cause. As a result, governments fund research and disseminate information that can be of use to the people studying the topic. An example is the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2017) of the US. This governmental body presents its collection of research and summaries on the maritime industry, focusing on the issues that endanger the safety of its workers, which is why it predominantly focuses on hazards. Given that hazardous working conditions are among the reasons for stress, I will summarize them here.\n\nAs pointed out by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2017), the maritime industry can be rather diverse. We have considered the topic of seafarers, but, for example, divers are at a particularly high risk of drowning, as well as different complications related to the respiratory system, and even hypothermia. On the other hand, longshoring workers are not likely to go diving, but they are often required to work with heavy loads (including carrying them around), which increases the possibility of being injured by objects with large weight. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2017) discusses the chemical hazards present in the maritime industry, which, among other things, incorporate those related to beryllium, phosphine, styrene, and other dangerous substances. The environmental risks include the weather-induced conditions (heat and cold stress), as well as UV radiation. The respiratory system of the maritime workers seems to be particularly endangered, especially in the people who are confined to small spaces and work with welding and manganese and aerosols; occupational asthma is not uncommon for this type of work. Naturally, there are multiple injury hazards from falls to traumas to vessel disasters; decompression sickness, electrical safety, and machine safety are also important concerns.\n\nUnfortunately, when discussing stress, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2017) does not focus on the maritime industry individually; rather, it presents the general research, which is dedicated to stress in all industries. However, the agency acknowledges the fact that the maritime industry has some specific concerns, which are listed for seafarers above (the family time concerns are mentioned specifically, as well as the problem of being confined to one location). The agency is also interested in workplace violence and develops training resources for its prevention. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (2018) is similar in that stress is barely mentioned by it, and it is also predominantly focused on the safety and security measures. To me, it is clear that the example of the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (2018) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health demonstrates that the topic of stress in the maritime industry could receive some more extensive coverage with attention paid to its unique features. In other words, more research is needed.\n\nA Summary and Some Concluding Thoughts\n\nSo, we made it through the first section together. I think that it would be a good idea to recap everything that we have studied and explained how we are going to use that in the next section.\n\nFirst of all, we discussed what stress is. To put it simply, stress is the reaction that human experience when they find it difficult to cope with something, and occupational stress is the stress that occurs at the workplace. The causes of stress can be nearly infinite; after all, people react differently to different conditions. However, when we are talking about occupational stress, it may be helpful to consider external and internal stressors. External ones happen outside of your workplace, although they still result in stressed-out employees. Internal ones are the stressors that occur at work: huge workloads, uncomfortable working environment, tense relationships with colleagues, bad management, that sort of thing.\n\nThe effects of stress are also important. As I have shown to you, they can be rather severe. In my view, the most important ones are the outcomes that harm us: the physiological and psychological effects from minor snappiness to depression, from diarrhea to heart conditions. The issues with attention and concentration can also be potentially very harmful, especially if your work requires attentiveness to keep people safe. However, for the more cynical of us, it can be pointed out that businesses do not benefit from employees (or managers) being stressed out: absenteeism, presenteeism, low motivation, and morale are not good for the bottom line.\n\nStress can be bad, yes, that is the general point of this book; that is why this book was written. However, I do want to remind you that keeping a more positive perspective on stress can help. After all, you cannot eliminate stress. Still, you can learn to discern it, which is the first step to controlling it. That is the general idea of this section anyway; hope it works.\n\nIn addition to that, we considered the maritime industry and stress within it. My general aim was to convince you that the maritime industry is immensely important and, at the same time, quite stress-prone, which is why yes, it is necessary to consider the two topics together. I wish I could present you with more information about industry-specific stress, but alas, it is not very common. That said, the existing knowledge is enough to suggest that at the very least, the individual working conditions (especially those related to safety) of various environments can make them stress-prone, which generally proves the idea that stress in the maritime industry needs to be studied. However, it is also apparent that stress remains stress in any environment; the findings of the studies that consider stress, in general, should commonly apply to the maritime industry. As a result, using both industry-specific and general research, I was able to amass quite a bit of evidence on how to solve stress among maritime workers. You will find them in the next section.\n\nSolutions to Stress\n\nSo, you have determined that you have stress. You know that those migraines intensify when you worry about your next deadline, and you can tell that even the idea of talking to your boss gives you shivers. What are you going to do now? Probably, you will try to find some sort of solution; preferably, one that does not involve resigning since you need your job.\n\nConversely, you are not actually that stressed, but you are an employer, and you realize that quite a few of the stressors we discussed in the previous section can be found at your workplace. You want happy, healthy, and productive employees, and you look for ways of reducing stress as a result. How do you go about eradicating stress at your workplace?\n\nWell, to be fair, attempting to eradicate stress once and for all is rather futile. People are going to experience stress at work, there is no real way around it. However, since it can be a major problem that has multiple negative consequences, it makes sense to introduce different precautions, especially in high-stress jobs like those that are often found in the maritime industry. This section will summarize the modern research on the topic of combating stress that is either applied to or can be applied to workplace settings and the maritime industry. A lot of the solutions below refer to something that a manager can do because managers have greater control over workplace factors and also more resources and means of altering them. However, even if you are not a manager, you may find these solutions interesting or helpful in managing stress and finding a job that would not be too stressful for you. Check out, for example, the general guidelines; they are meant to be widely applicable.\n\nGeneral Guidelines\n\nNow that I have discussed what stress is, it should be clear that the solutions will not be simple; for a problem that is as complex as stress, they cannot be. There is a wide variety of stressors, which we cannot even finish enumerating, and trying to control all of them is problematic. Also, as pointed out by Landsbergis et al. (2017), there exists more research on the topic of stress itself than interventions meant for solving it. It means that approaches to handling workplace stress may differ, and we might not be able to tell which one is better for the time being – we need more research first.\n\nThat said, it is possible to come up with a general strategy for resolving stress that can be summarized in a few statements. It is generally acknowledged that stress can be both prevented and mitigated, and there is a growing body of evidence and experience of handling stress by the managers. To systematize this information and give it structure, Landsbergis et al. (2017) and Slišković (2017) use the model of primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention and apply it to their discussion of occupational stress solutions. This model is commonly used in public health, especially when solutions to healthcare problems are developed, and it fits the problem of occupational stress well enough.\n\nFrom this perspective, primary prevention measures would be aimed at reducing risk factors, which, as you have already discovered, consist of potential stressors. Secondary interventions intend to boost the ability of workers to cope with stress; they do not target stressors or stress itself but rather focus on the personal element of the Michigan model, as well as the coping mechanisms. Tertiary prevention is concerned with assisting the workers who are already stressed and, possibly, experience the damaging effects of stress. All three groups of solutions should be present in your plan of managing stress in your organization. Below, I will present a general overview of all the three groups.\n\nPrimary Prevention\n\n‘We have a good understanding of what causes stress,’ stated Steve, one of my interviewees. ‘For instance, we recognize that overworking employees is not an option, and we have carried out a pretty successful experiment of introducing better vacation options.’\n\nFor primary prevention approaches to be devised, the people responsible for them need to study stress and understand what causes it. From my interviews, it appears that both managers and employees have at least some idea of how stress works. It makes sense; after all, most of them (if not all) have experienced it first-hand or have had other people describe their experiences for them. That said, it is important to consider the factors that are shown to be stressors by the research on the topic because people have different reactions to stressors. To put it simply, it will do us little good to base our interventions on the reactions of a particularly resilient person; rather, we should investigate some literature on the topic and then make conclusions as to how this information can be applied to our workplace. However, this fact does not mean that it is a good idea to ignore the personal accounts of employees; if employees report stress-inducing issues, they need to be investigated.\n\nThus, the first step towards devising a primary prevention intervention is research, which would contribute to the identification of stressors at a particular workplace. Then, research should be used to identify evidence-based solutions to the problem. This step can be especially difficult if the research on the topic is lacking, which is why alternative sources of solutions can also be considered. They include brainstorming, consulting specialists in the field, and communicating with employees, who can also provide insightful ideas on managing stressors.\n\n‘Our solution is experimental. You will not find it in literature in its final form, although it is based on the general recommendation to provide employees with sufficient opportunities for rest,’ Steve continues. ‘However, there are so many details on how to manage your vacation policies that we mostly had to improvise.’\n\nWhile it may be daunting to move in the dark, improvisation is not a bad thing. In fact, according to Steve, it can be beneficial. After all, the solution of his company ended up being tailored to the needs of the company, carefully balancing the employees’ need for rest and the company’s need to make profits. That is another important part of the plan for introducing stress prevention strategies: they need to take into account the company’s specifics, especially its resources.\n\n‘See, vacation policies, especially the ones that incorporate paid days off, are expensive. I would love to say that our employees are more important to us, but actually, we did have to juggle it all a bit, to come to a compromise. A smaller company would probably have even more difficulties.’\n\nAfter the decision on the intervention is made, it needs to be tested (implemented for a short period while being monitored), improved is necessary, and eventually implemented for good or discarded depending on its usefulness. Also, one needs to introduce the means of monitoring the outcomes. Think of the ways you can measure stress or its consequences, and you have yourself the criteria that will tell you if your intervention is effective.\n\n‘We would not be allowed to keep an expensive policy that does not work,’ Steve admits. ‘We had to show that it worked, and we did: after its introduction, the absence and turnover rates in my department fell, so I consider it a success.’\n\nSteve uses a specific example (vacation policies), but, naturally, it is not the only approach to reducing stress. Take a look at the list of stressors in the previous section, and you will see that there are multiple problems to be considered. In the following chapters, I will present the particular solutions that can currently be found in the literature on stress. However, keep it in mind that thinking outside of the box and finding customized solutions to stressors at your workplace can work as well – just make sure to research and test them first.\n\nSecondary Prevention\n\nSecondary stress prevention methods can be simply defined as ways of coping with stress. The secondary level of prevention differs from the primary one in its focus: while the latter considers stressors, which is the first element of the Michigan stress model, the former is concerned with the second and third elements: the person who experiences stress and their coping methods. Since not every stressor can be removed, it is important to improve the resilience of oneself and one’s employees. For instance, the stressor of leaving one’s family on the shore is unavoidable for seafarers, but it can be mitigated by finding the means of contacting the family whenever possible. Similarly, an individual can manage his or her coping strategies by choosing the ones that are the least harmful and most enjoyable. Examples that I have encountered in my interviews included music, jogging, walking, napping, yoga, and so on. One of the interviewees confessed to using Candy Crush because it is not very “mentally taxing.”\n\n‘What is my favorite method of coping with stress? Boxing, I guess. It is relaxing for me,’ reported one of my interviewees, and I have to admit that it is an awesome option (sports are good for you) which makes a lot of sense. Do you not want to punch something sometimes, especially when you are stressed? Yes, boxing as a stress-reducing technique makes perfect sense to me.\n\nAn interesting thing about secondary prevention is that it can be managed on a personal or group level. For example, a few interviewees told me that they received some sort of stress-coping training at their workplace, but they also made some research on their own, thus trying out both levels.\n\n‘Our manager trained us on how to cope with stress in the workplace. Honestly, the offered methods are good, but I mostly use them when resolving problematic situations at home rather than at work,’ states one of the interviewees. If I can have a stress-free home as a result of those methods, it is a win in my book. And I do feel more productive when I know that everything is well at home.’\n\nFor the group level, interventions should follow the same structure as the one described above for primary prevention methods. In particular, there should be a research stage, a testing stage, and the means of monitoring the progress. At the individual level, a person works to prevent stress on one’s own, which is why the same formal structure is not usually followed, but its elements are often preserved. For instance, if you are reading this book to learn about stress and its management for yourself, you are at the first stage, research. If you find a strategy that suits your needs, you will test it, and most likely, you will determine its success or failure using certain criteria (for instance, how much better it makes you feel). This approach is very effective, so it may be a good idea to consciously apply it to your individual-level secondary prevention methods, that is, to find the best ways of coping with stress.\n\nTertiary Prevention\n\nUsing regular English, tertiary stress prevention consists of recovering from stress or helping employees to recover. Keep it in mind that being stressed or having your employees stressed is not a failure; stress is a common human reaction, and it is bound to happen once in a while. However, being stressed is not good for your health as we have discovered, which means that it is necessary to follow some techniques of recovery.\n\nTo return to the Michigan model, this type of prevention often focuses on the consequences of stress. For instance, training a company’s managers to recognize the signs of stress or depression would be a tertiary stress prevention intervention. This type of prevention focuses on consequences because it is aimed at reducing and controlling them. Yes, it is uncommon for us to use the word “prevention” when something has already occurred, but this medical term can be logical: even if you are not preventing stress, you are preventing further damage caused by it during this stage of prevention.\n\nNot many of my interviewees described their workplace as having tertiary prevention methods, but in general, even things like days off can work. In this respect, quite a several people told me that their bosses were quite understanding when they learned about stressed-out employees.\n\n‘It’s not a policy,’ told me one of the HR managers I interviewed, ‘but we do take into account the emotional state of our employees. That’s why we have a system of paid and unpaid days off and leaves; you can use them when you’re stressed, and if I see that my employee is stressed, sure, I’ll encourage them to get some rest.’\n\nDue to the severity of the potential consequences of stress, it is especially important to have the means of tertiary stress prevention in any organization. It is essential to have the means of monitoring employees for signs of stress, and it is necessary to introduce various support methods. Again, the introduction of specific interventions should involve research and testing, but given that the outcomes of stress are multiple, I will not attempt to present all the possible examples of tertiary prevention here. In future chapters, we will consider the ones that are mentioned in the literature.\n\nWhy Bother?\n\nWhy did I bother with these unfamiliar medical terms and an additional classification? Well, aside from the fact that medical terms are very applicable to stress because of its effects on human health, this classification exists to help to connect the solutions to stress to its components. Given the fact that interventions need to work, we must understand how they work, research the issues that they target, and employ evidence-based solutions. Our interventions are only going to be successful if we understand why they are required, and I think that the three prevention levels are good at explaining why and how interventions should be developed. Additionally, the model covers almost all possible interventions, and it is simple. I did promise you a simple, general guideline for managing stress. Now, we will move on to more specific solutions.\n\nWho Should Bother?\n\nSlišković (2017) notes that there are two main approaches to handling stress, which is connected to different perspectives on the problem. One of them implies that stress is a problem of an employee, a personal problem that should be resolved personally. As we have discovered, one can say that there is some merit to the idea: a person, as well as personal coping mechanisms, are important for stress management. Also, individual characteristics do affect the way people experience or handle stress. For instance, the fact that deadlines cause me significant anxiety is my problem; my employer would never be able to resolve this issue. Also, I am more likely to know how to handle myself when I am stressed by a deadline. In general, people tend to know what kind of stress coping techniques is especially effective for them (although some of those can be harmful). Moreover, it is often impossible to eliminate stress at work, which means that personal ability to cope is a particularly helpful asset. Although, admittedly, it is not always the case.\n\n‘My colleagues think that I am stress-free because I try to look self-confident, but I just drag myself through,’ responds one of the interviewees to my question about individual stress-coping techniques. ‘I don’t think I know a way to deal with it. I tried jogging, but it’s not for me, and it takes too much time, and I am not going for yoga or something like that.’\n\nYes, even when you know yourself, you might not figure out a stress-coping strategy that would help.\n\nIt should also be noted that the individualistic perspective can lead to important improvements and advancement in the studies of personal stress management strategies. One might also argue that it can guide certain organization-level interventions, for example, those that empower people to manage stress on their own. Technically, that is not true; after all, if an organization believes that stress is the problem of a stressed person, most likely, its executives are not particularly interested in helping. Still, the idea of viewing stress from the perspective of an individual who experiences the issue is not without merit – the Michigan model is there to confirm this approach. However, it is also not without flaws.\n\nFirst, as we have discussed, most workplace stressors are not within an employee’s control; in fact, many of them are directly controlled by an employer. Take, for instance, shift works. While an employee might be able to choose between different types of shift work, it is an employer who determines what options an employee has, and there are bad and good ways of designing shifts. The fact that employers may have greater power over many stressors implies that they can help, which is always a nice opportunity. Making people’s lives better can be a reward.\n\nMoreover, there are some stressors, which an employer must manage. For instance, bad working conditions, especially concerning safety, can result in legal issues. Similarly, not managing discrimination in the workplace can cause lawsuits and for a good reason. After all, an employer is obliged to ensure safe working conditions for his or her employees. From this perspective, it can also be noted that employers may be responsible for stress, especially if working conditions that they provide are inappropriate. If an employer causes a problem, it is only his or her right and responsibility to resolve it.\n\n‘For me, stress-free working environments mean comfortable settings that do not prevent me from completing my tasks. Sometimes, noise, heat, and humidity in the workplace can cause significant stress for me,’ states Steve. One may agree that employers can contribute to improving the situation and make all possible to address different types of stressors. Employers should pay attention to removing these and similar stressing triggers to increase employees’ satisfaction and productivity.\n\nAdditionally, there are things that employers do not have to do but would benefit from doing. The previous section shows extensively that a stressed worker is not unlikely to experience and cause problems, and few arguments would work better to prove that stress is not exclusively a personal problem. It is everybody’s problem, especially in a high-risk environment because it tends to produce stress and make it very dangerous. By leaving employees to deal with the issue on their own, employers leave it to chance. Maybe workers will indeed resolve their problems, but they might also fail. In contrast, addressing the issue of stress increases the possibility of employing stress-free workers who make fewer mistakes and are more effective, healthier, happier, and more satisfied with their workplace.\n\n‘If our managers implement changes to improve our working conditions, I will support them,’ says one of the respondents. ‘Yes, I need more comfortable settings to feel calm and less anxious at work, and I think that it would show that my boss cares about my productivity.’\n\nThe bottom-line consequences of an important stress-related decision might also be complemented by reputational boosts. Slišković (2017) suggests that the latter argument is becoming more critical nowadays, and it works both ways. While efforts to reduce stress in the workplace are likely to make a company a more desirable employer, the lack of concern for employees’ health is problematic and can be damaging for a brand. Companies do have to compete for their workforce or customers; solutions that reduce stress are a good addition to your PR program.\n\n‘I do my best to satisfy the needs of my employees,’ notes one of the managers I have interviewed, ‘because I think that an unmanageable or, worse, the unsafe working environment is an insult to them. Would you rather work for somebody who cares about employees or somebody fine with sticking them in some sort of rundown basement? I would rather go with a good employer, so I try to be a good employer myself.’\n\nWhile the causes of stress prove that stress is not a personal problem, it is necessary to remember that addressing the causes of stress is only one of the ways of managing stress. Secondary and tertiary preventions are just as important, and they can also involve an employer’s efforts. For instance, introducing stress coping classes for employees would constitute secondary prevention performed by an employer, and various support programs for stressed employees would constitute tertiary prevention methods. The benefits for employers are the same: they avoid appearing uncaring for their employees and help them remain stress-free, satisfied, and productive.\n\nAccording to Slišković (2017), modern managers experience public pressure to address stress in their employees, and my interviews mostly support the idea. Accordingly, the approach to stress as a personal concern does not seem to be feasible these days. The fact that there is a personal aspect of stress needs to be acknowledged, but in general, a more comprehensive approach is required. Employers should actively engage in providing primary, secondary, and tertiary prevention interventions and enjoy the benefits of taking into account the needs of employees. Employers should employ their greater resources and opportunities to improve the working conditions of their employees by reducing their stress. Finally, employers should bother at least as much or more than employees.\n\nSafety First\n\nIn my workplace, safety is valued above all else, and from what I have gathered through my interviews, it is a common approach. Most of my interviewees mentioned safety in one way or the other. While some of them criticized their companies’ approaches to ensuring safety, it appears that none of them could claim that there were no attempts to make their workplace safer.\n\n‘Of course, my workplace is not the safest place in the world,’ says one of the interviewees who works in docks. ‘There are evident risks, and safety rules are not there just for show. And to be honest, my work remains hazardous and stressful despite all applied measures. I prefer not to think about possible threats, though, but focus on instructions; that’s something I can control at least.’\n\nA safe working environment is extremely important for a person’s well-being, especially when it is reasonable to assume that this environment is hazardous. It is also the type of stressor that a company has to take into account. It is common for governmental bodies to monitor employers and motivate them (through incentives or sanctions) to guarantee the safety of their employees (European Agency for Safety and Health at Work, 2014). As a result, aside from obvious risks of harm to people, equipment, reputation, and the bottom line, unsafe working environments are likely to cause legal problems.\n\nWhile it is probably not the primary concern of the employers who try to ensure the well-being of their employees, safety is directly connected to stress, which is why I will consider it in this section. Indeed, safety concerns can cause stress, especially in a high-risk environment or position. For example, if persons have to work with hazardous substances or in a situation that can potentially endanger their limbs, they are likely to worry about the hazards and, as a result, can become stressed. Moreover, those people who are not directly endangered during their work but responsible for ensuring the safety of others can also be significantly distressed by their responsibility. In general, humans tend to worry about another’s health, which is also stress-inducing. That is why ensuring safety is going to be beneficial from multiple perspectives.\n\nStress can also result in increased dangers. As it was mentioned, stressed people are not unlikely to get overwhelmed and distracted, which can hurt their performance and result in mistakes. In turn, if a position requires attention, important decision-making, or is somehow connected to safety concerns, the costs of mistakes can be too high. High-risk jobs are dangerous for stressed people and everyone around them, which is another proof of the importance of workplace safety.\n\nAccording to recent research, the problem of safety-related stress can be resolved. Indeed, by guaranteeing the physical safety of employees, a company can improve their emotional, as well as physical, well-being (Kula & Sahin, 2015). The employees who know that their employer makes reasonable efforts to protect their safety are less likely to experience stress than those who do not believe that they are adequately protected. Thus, the safety-related policies do not just assist in avoiding incidents and ensuring the safety of employees; they are also appropriate to reduce stress, and this rule applies to any environment and business.\n\nSafety in the Maritime Industry\n\nSince this book focuses on the maritime industry, it makes sense to reconsider its dangers. In this context, safety-related stressors depend on specific job positions, some of which are especially hazardous. For instance, terminal handlers in docks face rather high risks of injuries, which can range from sprains and falls to cuts, crushing injuries, and even amputations. Also, like many other physical labor jobs, this occupation can result in the diseases of the musculoskeletal system (those related to muscles and bones like back pain or arthritis) (Cezar-Vaz et al., 2014). The detailed considerations of occupational hazards in the maritime industry are presented by the Workplace Safety and Health Council (2014), which, by the way, is based in Singapore.\n\nThe Council has published a booklet that focuses on different types of jobs and offers specific recommendations and requirements that would help a company ensure the safety of its workers. I do not think that it would be helpful to copy the information from this booklet here, but it is appropriate to provide some general guidelines on how to promote workplace safety to reduce stress in workers. Check them out and compare them to the steps taken by your company to achieve safety.\n\nSource of my guidelines: governmental safety efforts. Given the importance of safety within the maritime industry, which is prone to incidents and accidents, the governmental efforts that target it can be encountered. Their value is not limited to safety standards, although those are significant; the government has particular potential for research due to its access to resources, which is why its training and awareness programs can become as helpful as standards themselves. An example of a safety program implemented by a governmental agency is the Safety at Sea by the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (2018). It focuses on providing people with information that can help to promote a safety-oriented culture at sea. Furthermore, the Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore reports that it works to make the program informed by the people who work in the maritime industry; that outcome is achieved by conducting relevant briefing sessions, which aim to explore the best safety practices of seasoned professionals. Eventually, such briefing is supposed to become a reporting framework that will regularly supply the information to update the effort.\n\nSimilarly, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (2017) of the US also focuses on the investigation of different risks within the industry in the country, including occupational stress. It presents educational resources and produces the standards that are supposed to ensure the physical and psychological protection of employees of the industry. Examples of the latter include the workplace violence training and the Working Hours, Sleep and Fatigue Forum, which is devoted to the sleeping hygiene of employees. Overall, there are government resources that can be consulted to improve one’s understanding of the means to improve safety at the workplace. That is precisely what I will do right now.\n\nGeneral guidelines. Unsurprisingly, the overall plan for safety policy implementation is similar to those for all stress prevention strategies. On a very basic level, it consists of identifying hazards (researching risks), finding appropriate solutions, and implementing them. However, this is a specific stress reduction strategy, which is why I will consider it in greater detail.\n\nStep 1\n\nAssign a risk management team. The Council states that a risk management team is necessary for successful risk prevention and control. In other words, a company needs people who will be there specifically to manage risks and ensure safety. Such a team should include specialists in risk management, as well as people who have experience and knowledge pertinent to a company’s field of activity. Thus, expert seafarers would be more likely to contribute important safety information for seafarers than people who are not familiar with a job and related tasks. By recruiting the most experienced employees, a team will be able to address workplace risks adequately.\n\nBased on my interviews, I can tell that this practice is fairly common. At the very least, the companies that I managed to contact seem to appoint people who would be responsible for safety and risk management.\n\n‘It’s an important part of our operations,’ one of my interviewees explains. ‘We have an HR department and an R&D department; naturally, we have a Safety Department too.’\n\nStep 2\n\nSafety policies. The Council devotes much attention to safety policies; apparently, they are the first thing that a risk management team should be busy with. Here are a few of the features that a well-crafted safety policy needs to include.\n\n 1. According to the Council, safety policies must be official, specifically compiled documents. That makes sense: safety policies cannot be recommendations; they cannot be unofficial or optional.\n 2. A good safety policy is in line with the local legislation and, if possible, follows the recommendations of local, national, or international organizations, for example, the Workplace Safety and Health Council (2014).\n 3. A policy needs to cover particular topics; its content is very important. Thus, good policy must determine the people responsible and accountable for the prevention, documentation, and investigation of incidents, as well as all the procedures associated with these processes. A safety policy is a document that describes how your company intends to ensure safety, and it needs to cover everything related to this topic.\n 4. Also, the policy should naturally take into account a company’s resources and the interests of all stakeholders. In other words, it must be feasible; otherwise, it is not going to be of any use.\n 5. The communication of the safety policy to every person in a company is particularly significant. Designing a simple-to-understand short version of the policy in the form of a handbook can be a good idea. It can be printed and handed out to employees, and it can also be published on a company’s website. You need to make the safety policy as accessible as possible.\n 6. Finally, a good policy is regularly reviewed to ensure its relevance. The Council recommends coming back to it at least every few years.\n\nI have asked the interviewees about safety policies utilized in their organizations and how their use might influence stress levels, ‘We have the opportunity to learn our safety policy during the employee orientation program; we get trained pretty well with an exam and everything. I think that it is good, but maybe not enough. I would feel safer if we had such training more often,’ one of the respondent’s notes with a nervous smile. It appears that something as simple as having a policy and communicating it well can help to reduce stress in employees and, conversely, the lack of communication may be problematic.\n\nStep 3\n\nResearch the hazards. After assembling a team and compiling the policy, which is technically a plan of action, it is necessary to determine what particular hazards your company deals with. The identification of those hazards has to be comprehensive. Your research should take into account the work organization, workplace design, and specifics of work processes, including the equipment, materials, and substances used in them. When considering equipment and materials, it is necessary to review all aspects of their use from fabrication (or purchase) to installation, use, and inspection. Abnormal working conditions should be taken into consideration (for instance, a power shutdown could cause hazardous situations). In general, it is important to review any foreseeable outcomes in the workplace, which is precisely why you need experienced workers in your risk management team – their knowledge will offer additional insights into relevant problems. Finally, the Council recommends determining the significance of different workplace risks: rating them according to their priority. This way, the most important ones can be addressed before the less important ones.\n\nStep 4\n\nFind solutions. The prevention and control measures are issue-specific; they should be established by the risk management team individually while keeping in mind the company’s hazards and resources. However, strategies employed in the maritime industries are rather common; here is their very short, very limited list.\n\n 1. First, you can (and should) try to eliminate the risk if possible. For instance, you can try to eliminate the risk of malfunctioning equipment by ensuring its appropriate maintenance.\n 2. Second, if you cannot eliminate a hazard, you can try to substitute it with something less risky. For example, if a job that you want to make safer is connected to coming into contact with machinery, choosing the safest equipment will qualify as prevention and control for this type of risk.\n 3. Finally, some risks cannot be eliminated or substituted. In that case, they or their negative impacts need to be minimized. For example, you can limit a worker’s contact with hazardous materials, which means that a hazard will still be present in the workplace. However, employees will be relatively safe, especially if you add a few warning signs, which are another risk management solution. This group of solutions also incorporates protective equipment. Indeed, you cannot eliminate the possibility of a terminal handler being injured as a result of their daily work, but you can at least provide them with appropriate protective clothing.\n\nThe Council reminds us that all the prevention and control measures must be included in the safety policy, that is, documented, approved, and revised regularly for potential updates. Also, the strategies need to be in line with the law, as well as the recommendations of any overseeing bodies.\n\nStep 5\n\nHaving fully developed your strategy, a company needs to implement and keep track of it. The Council suggests revising the risk assessment and control policies every three years. However, significant changes in working procedures should also warrant a revision, and they should naturally be reconsidered in case an incident occurs in the workplace. Hazard identification is a continuous, regular process undertaken by the risk management team that is responsible and accountable for all the related procedures.\n\nSidestep employee engagement. It should be taken into account that safety in the workplace is upheld by everybody involved. The Council notes that all the people who may at any point be the part of a company, including employers, employees, self-employed people, suppliers, and so on, need to “take reasonably practicable measures to ensure” the safety of their workplace (Workplace Safety and Health Council, 2014, p. 12-14). Indeed, any person who breaks safety rules endangers people around him or her. As a result, we might also need to consider the means of enforcing safety.\n\nUpholding the policy: sticks and carrots. From the perspective of the Council, the enforcement of the policy is just another risk prevention and control measure. Indeed, if you punish failure and reward appropriate behaviors, the latter should stick. The Council does not offer specifics, providing companies with an opportunity to develop their own “incentive and disincentive system,” but it has a couple of suggestions. Disciplinary actions taken against people need to be followed by corrective ones.\n\nFor example, apart from disciplining employees, it would be helpful to make them re-read safety requirements that they have broken and, maybe, even make them go through retraining. The Council also notes that some people demonstrate “blatant” disregard for rules. For them, the Council suggests using “serious disciplinary actions.” Or, if they prove never to learn, their employment may need to be discontinued – for their safety. Finally, it should be noted that all sticks and no carrots would result in a very imbalanced system. It is a good idea to praise best practices, emphasize a department’s achievements in preventing accidents, and offer rewards for those who follow safety rules. However, each company should decide which carrots or sticks it wants (and can afford) as long as they are incorporated in the safety policy.\n\n‘I do not understand those employees who don’t pay attention to their safety and the safety of their coworkers. They ignore policies and create risky situations, and I seriously do not understand that. Are they immortal or do they have a death wish? Or do they just not understand that lives are on the line? In any case, for them, a dismissal can be the only possible solution,’ says one of the docks workers who I interviewed. Thus, “sticks” for violating safety norms and policies can have different forms. Managers need to understand that by ignoring the safety policy violation, they endanger employees and create a stressful atmosphere because of potential threats associated with work in the maritime industry.\n\nNaturally, you can only expect people to know what to do if you have already communicated the safety policy to them. In this regard, the training of employees is also highlighted by the Council as an important safety precaution. It makes sense: training ensures that employees are aware of hazards and equipped to deal with them. As a result, your risk and hazard prevention policy must incorporate appropriate training programs that take into account the specifics of working in your company and are approved by the risk management team. If you wonder what a training program should consist of, you might find its general structure familiar.\n\nSafety training: the same thing all over again\n\nIndeed, the general idea of how to introduce a training intervention is the same as the ones described above. First, it is necessary to do your research: determine the training needs of people in the workplace, as well as training requirements (that is the things that they need to learn to ensure safety). Keep it in mind that different occupations would require different types of training. For instance, crane operators require mandatory training in safe crane operation, and a welder needs to understand how to weld safely. However, every employee should also become aware of the company’s safety policies and be provided with all the information about potential risks that they might encounter, as well as the steps that they must take to keep themselves and others safe.\n\nThen, the intervention needs to be devised: check which courses you would like the employees to attend (you might want to implement your courses or outsource the task) and plan the allocation of resources (especially time and money) to them. Scheduling may be particularly problematic, but untrained personnel mustn’t be allowed to operate. After that, the plan is to be implemented, evaluated, and changed if necessary. Thus, the courses will incorporate the means of assessing the change in employees’ competency, but if they do not, such means should be devised. Regular monitoring and revision would ensure that the courses remain up-to-date and effective.\n\nSafety culture in the maritime industry\n\nAside from training, another important component of a safe workplace needs to be considered: safety culture. The term “safety culture” started to be actively applied in industry reports after the Chernobyl disaster, which occurred at a nuclear station and resulted in a massive discharge of harmful radiation. In the maritime industry, this term became used in publications, discussions, and reports on accidents involving such ships and tankers as Sleipner, Bow Mariner, Prestige, Scandinavian Star Estonia, and others (Oltedal & Lützhöft, 2018). The analysis and discussion of these accidents contributed to the development of the principles of a safety culture in the maritime industry. The culture of safety in this specific field prioritizes the focus on following safety principles and measures through forming a positive attitude to safety standards in people working in the industry (Froholdt, 2018). Thus, a safety culture on ships exists only when all members of a crew share and follow safety rules. In this case, their awareness of their safety increases, and certain fears of onboard disappearing, reducing stress levels.\n\nWhat methods can be used to develop a safety culture in crew members and other employees in the context of risks typical of the maritime industry? How can the developed safety culture be related to human resources’ stress? The adoption of this culture in a certain environment is based on sharing the view of the necessity of following safe work practices to prevent accidents and guarantee safety. However, even if employees in the maritime industry know about specific risks of their profession and widely discussed cases of accidents in this sphere, their attitude to a safety culture can be negative.\n\n‘I am not enthusiastic about following safety rules in cases when some of them can be ignored to save time and resources,’ claims one of the interviewees. ‘When I see that some of my colleagues ignore norms of safety adopted onboard, I am just praying, and I do not hesitate to report the riskiest cases to supervisors,’ says another person. These answers illustrate two opposite attitudes to a safety culture in the maritime industry; from the perspective of forming a safety culture, only one of them is correct (yes, the latter).\n\nThus, to persuade the first respondent to follow safety rules in all cases and while performing all tasks, it is necessary to develop his understanding of a safety culture. He needs to be informed about how he can benefit from adhering to standards; in this case, only telling him about the punitive action he will be subjected to will not work. The promotion of safety culture should be based on the development of a positive attitude to safety policies.\n\nEmployees need to be trained regarding safety principles and rules, and they should share the idea that safety is prioritized in any work. They need to recognize the idea that all accidents can be prevented, determined safe procedures guarantee positive outcomes, and adherence to safety is rewarded. People need to learn how to work concerning the idea of safety, and they also need to see that all their colleagues, and especially supervisors, also focus on safety in their daily practice.\n\nTo spread the principles of a safety culture, a manager can apply certain practices like training programs, presentations, case study analysis, and meetings. The reason for accentuating the necessity of following a safety culture with the help of training, presentations, and meetings is that employees in the maritime industry need not only theoretical knowledge regarding the issue but also practical skills. Therefore, researchers also emphasize the effectiveness of reflective training for employees after discussing safety norms of working with onboard equipment and learning the work of safety management systems (Gilbert, Journé, Laroche, & Bieder, 2018). These regular practices help employees perceive a safety culture as the core of their work in the maritime industry. Such training sessions and meetings contribute to maintaining safety as the key feature of operations in the industry, and it is a critical factor for creating a safety culture.\n\nWhat other techniques can be used by managers to promote a safety culture and make a working environment friendlier for employees? According to the respondents participating in this project, managers often choose to conduct risk assessments and train workers additionally if safety problems are noticed. Changes in using equipment and improvements in processes are promptly discussed during meetings, and additional training is usually proposed. The interviewees also mentioned the positive effects of encouraging and rewarding employees to identify and report different safety issues. Some of the interviewers noted that such easy steps as the use of posters and noticeboards can increase one’s awareness of the importance of a safety culture in their industry.\n\nThe promotion of safety culture as a manager’s task can also lead to decreasing stress in the workplace. However, an individual employee can help as well. Simply leading by example is a good choice; however, reinforcing the approach verbally can be even more effective. In this process, everyone’s contribution is important, and the goal – a safe working environment – is worth the bother because it will make sure that you can worry less about the safety of yourself and your colleagues.\n\nIf people understand that a safety culture is effectively promoted in their organization, stress triggers eliminate, and they feel more comfortable and secured. On the other hand, continuously observed violations of safety norms usually lead to stress in employees even if they are not conscious of their stress. Working in a threatening environment, employees can suffer from pressure, and their productivity decreases. Therefore, the development of a safety culture is an important task in the maritime industry as a safety-critical one. Stress goes down, performance goes up, and nobody suffers an accident; that is what safety culture can help to achieve.\n\nSome creative ideas about safety culture\n\nWhen considering the means of stimulating the employees’ interest in safety policies and upholding safety culture, the Workplace Safety and Health Council (2014) proposes holding promotion campaigns. Think about political PR campaigns and imagine one for a safety policy. For instance, a company can design posters devoted to important safety concerns (the Council suggests regularly changing and updating them to keep them fresh and interesting). Similarly, if your company has its magazine, it can incorporate safety-related information. It does not have to be devoted to concerns only. For instance, major accomplishments like the acquisition of especially safety equipment could be described or interviews with specialists in the field could be featured.\n\nAlso, the Council points out that while the violation of safety regulations can and should be punished, it may also be a good idea to reward adherence to them. To this end, safety-based competitions can be held in which a department or a team that excels at safety gets acknowledged and rewarded. According to the Council, with the help of appropriate prizes and publicity, a company can encourage employees to engage in safe behaviors. Another approach to such competitions would involve developing quizzes about safety: the employees who know the most about safety at the workplace would get rewarded while also revising safety requirements and having some fun. And you want to make safety fun, I think, at least if the workers are not opposed to the idea.\n\nSafety and Stress\n\nTo finish this part of the book, I would like to report to you some of the results of my interviews. I want to state it once again that more or less every person from the maritime industry that I asked about stressors noted that safety was a concern. It was especially prominent among the employees who did not work in offices, but apart from that, safety seemed to be giving managers real headaches. This finding does correspond to what the literature on the topic says: an unsafe environment is bound to cause stress, and in the maritime industry, you cannot eliminate all the stressors. When asked how they cope with it, most workers responded that they “deal with it,” but a few did note that safety polices or training could help.\n\n‘If I know what to do in threatening situations and have received appropriate training, I feel more confident and less stressed,’ claims one of the specialists.\n\n‘I know that my company takes safety seriously,’ another one notes. ‘The policies are sound and up-to-date, and they are enforced regularly. That’s good. That makes me feel safer.’\n\nIn other words, the primary concern for an employer when developing a stress-free working environment would be to check if everything is fine with the safety policy that they have and to work toward developing a good, healthy safety culture. That will be the first step; a few other ones are coming too, do not worry.\n\nWorking Environment\n\nApart from the factors that make a working environment safe, some features make it comfortable and stress-free (or, at least, not stress-inducing). Naturally, there is no single work environment for the maritime industry; rather, there are different areas that have unique environments with individual risks and considerations. Indeed, the people who are traveling, working with repair equipment, and draft financial statements are all subjected to different levels and types of stress. For the first one, the stress of changing the environment needs to be taken into account; for the second one, safety considerations are extremely important, and for the third one, the issues of repetitive work and extreme responsibility should be considered. You will also notice that not all of these risks are specific for the maritime industry; if anything, their categories are almost universal, even if their unique manifestations can be specific. Still, a couple of categories of the environmental factors can be named: they include the physical environment and the socio-emotional one.\n\nPhysical Environment\n\nA physically uncomfortable environment makes it difficult to perform well; also, it can cause stress. Additionally, a worker might be tempted to take breaks more often or have prolonged lunches just to avoid staying in a physically uncomfortable environment. All of the mentioned outcomes are not good for employees’ productivity, which explains the significance of improving the physical environment of your company. If a working place remains to be uncomfortable for an individual, his or her level of stress increases even if it can be unnoticeable and imperceptible. The problem is that a person unconsciously spends more time not to notice distracting aspects and concentrate on work and completing different types of tasks. Speaking and laughing colleagues, the noise produced by the working equipment, and different types of signals can be perceived as normal aspects of the everyday work, but they prevent individuals from concentrating and being fully attentive in the workplace.\n\nSome of the commonly considered aspects of a physically uncomfortable environment include sound (noise) levels, temperature, humidity, and lighting. Recent research indicates that temperature and air quality have notable effects on employee productivity (Roelofsen, 2002). If the temperature of the air is uncomfortable for a person, he or she tends to be distracted and focus on resolving the problem. According to studies, the comfortable temperature in a building should be 23-26°C because this temperature does not affect employees’ productivity (Roelofsen, 2002). High and low temperatures make the body adapt to them; as a result, some processes in the organism become accelerated when others slow down. These changes in the heart rate and the temperature of the body, and a possible headache make employees stressed and less productive. The same effect is typical of the change in humidity levels. Therefore, there should be norms adopted for companies’ facilities regarding temperature and humidity levels.\n\n‘I work in an office with twenty other employees. Although we have modern air conditioning, I hate summer months when I have to work in my office. I try to work from home when possible because I think about the heat during my working hours rather than about my tasks,’ notes Stacy.\n\nRegarding the rest of the factors, humans can adapt to different lighting relatively easily, and the noise that is below damaging levels is not proven to reduce employee productivity significantly. However, they might still cause discomfort, which is why their management may also be important. Additionally, Roelofsen (2002) notes that the ability to control the environment can be appreciated by employees. At plants or on board, it is problematic to control the levels of noise, but there are still standards that should be followed by executives and managers. Lighting should also be controlled to avoid decreases in employees’ productivity and avoid potential errors.\n\nStill, the maritime industry is also associated with such physical conditions as the exposure to the increased levels of dust, chemicals, and smoke in the air among other factors. Moreover, it is expected that people work with different types of equipment and machinery, and the use of these technologies is associated with following certain rules. In most cases, these aspects are taken into account when organizing workplaces for employees, but overall environments can be rather stressful for persons. The appropriate organization of a physical working environment is important to avoid different health issues experienced by employees because of the low quality of their workplaces. These problems can include fatigue, dizziness, eye irritation, allergy, and dry skin among others. Managers need to pay much attention to addressing factors that can provoke these symptoms to avoid employees’ absence in the workplace.\n\n‘My friend working for one of our suppliers had to change her job because working conditions were not appropriate for her. She had to spend ten hours per day in an office where the temperature was not higher than 16°C, and she suffered from frequent colds, but she could not take so many sick leaves,’ says John. ‘I understand her decision because it seems impossible to be productive when being unhealthy.’\n\nAfter all, the objective environment is not the only aspect of the environment that matters. The subjective or psychological environment (that is, the way it is perceived by employees) maybe even more important than objective one (Britt & Jex, 2015). Therefore, by enabling employees to change temperature or ventilation, a manager can help them in creating an optimal working environment that will not cause stress because of its physically uncomfortable conditions. Any efforts oriented toward making working conditions of employees comfier will result in decreasing their stress and increasing their productivity and improving performance. The subjective environment is also related to such aspects as workloads, high demands and set expectations, the capacity to work at high speed, the predictability of work, and the freedom to organize a working day and performance of tasks. All these aspects directly influence the quality of employees’ work and their commitment, as well as levels of their daily stress.\n\nSocial Environment\n\nAs it was mentioned, the interactions with other people can result in notable stress, which means that our social environment can and should be modified to minimize the number of stressors in it. In this section, let us consider at least some of the social stressors and discuss how, as research suggests, they can be resolved.\n\nReducing bullying\n\nWhen I told my friend about this section of the book, she was surprised that I would bring something like this up. Doesn’t bullying refer to kindergarteners or junior-to-middle schoolers at most? Would you call conflicts at work “bullying”? As it turns out, this position is not unheard of. Faucher et al. (2015) note that even in the literature on the topic bullying was considered in the context of schools or higher education, as well as cyberspace. According to the authors, there are even some studies that can indicate that the peak of bullying occurs in middle school with older people being less engaged in bullying. However, Faucher et al. (2015) highlight that other investigations demonstrate that bullying does not only occur in the workplace; it is rather prevalent with 25-30% people reporting being bullied despite their age all over the world. Bullying is not an exclusive kindergarten problem.\n\n‘Luckily, I did not experience bullying in the workplace, but I know people who did. My cousin was bullied at work when he was in his twenties because all his colleagues were much older,’ says one of the respondents. ‘They acted just like children: sent terrifying messages, left negative comments, interrupted his speech at meetings, and refused to cooperate.’\n\nIf we refer back to the definition of bullying – aggression perpetrated by someone with more power towards the relatively powerless on a more or less regular basis – we can see that the workplace is probably conducive to this type of behavior. It involves people who are often arranged into a hierarchy (which presupposes power imbalances) meeting regularly (which presupposes the possibility of repeated aggression toward those with less power) in a stressful environment (which can promote aggression). Unless we do something to prevent it, bullying is more than likely to occur in the workplace!\n\nIf the term seems childish to some, well, there is no real reason to invent a new one when this specific notion does its job. After all, the consequences of bullying are not trivial at all; it can be extremely damaging to the bullied individual, his or her coworkers, and the social climate of a company. Eventually, the bottom line may suffer as well as absenteeism and turnover can be observed (Escartín, 2016). Though, from my perspective, the fact that bullying is known to lead to suicide in some cases is the most important negative outcome (Faucher et al., 2015). Bullying in the workplace is a thing, unfortunately, and we need to find ways of preventing it. Now, there is not very much research on the effectiveness of bullying interventions; not as much as we would want for conclusive statements, anyway. However, several methods have been studied, and I will present them here for your consideration.\n\nA major problem that has been found by researchers is that bullying is not always reported. There are a few reasons why people in various settings, including the workplace, may choose to stay silent. Some of the commonly cited motivations include the fear of retaliation from the bully, the feeling that things might not improve (especially if no action is taken by the management to remedy the situation) or might turn worse (again, because of the retaliation). Also, there is a fear of being perceived as weak or incompetent. For example, if a person believes that they should tough it out or show superior negotiating skills, they might worry about the impact of bullying incidents on their image.\n\nOne of the managers commented on this situation in his interview: ‘As a manager of the department, I noticed some signs of bullying in my previous workplace, but the bullied individuals did not report the problem and they did not react to my willingness to help and address the issue. I think this is because they did not want to seem like being powerless and broken.’\n\nAlso, many people report not knowing how to handle the situation, how to file a complaint, and how a company commonly deals with the issue up to the point of not knowing if their workplace even has any rule or policy against bullying. Also, many victims of bullying do not identify themselves as such. For example, in a study that was carried in the US in 2007, around a quarter of respondents reported acts that qualified as bullying, but only 9% recognized the fact that it was bullying and were identified as bullying victims (Faucher et al., 2015). A similar picture can be found in other countries and settings; people seem to either misunderstand what bullying is (like my friend did) or feel uncomfortable admitting that they have experienced bullying. This factor also reduces the probability of bullying is reported.\n\n‘Even if I become the victim of bullying or any other kind of pressure from my co-workers, I will not report the case until it prevents me from performing my tasks,’ shares Jake his ideas. ‘I am a big boy, and I can cope with the problem by myself, without involving other people.’\n\nWhat does that mean for our attempts to improve the social environment of our workplaces? Well, first of all, bullying is a covert problem, which means that while it helps to keep track of bullying complaints, they are unlikely to demonstrate a full picture – unless, that is, we manage to eliminate the causes of the underreporting of bullying. As you can see, the root problem is in the lack of awareness of bullying: a person who does not know what bullying is or what a company’s policy and stance on bullying are may not be able to report the problem. The obvious solution is education; the same way a company teaches (or should teach) its employees about safety policies and their importance, it can also educate employees on the topic of bullying and the measures that it takes to protect the bullied and correct the bullies.\n\nAdditionally, such efforts may also be aimed at empowering bystanders (that is, promoting the ability of people who witness bullying to report on it, which improves the reporting of the issue). This method of combating bullying does not seem to be very widespread, but research suggests that it has the potential for reducing bullying (Escartín, 2016). Also, it is the most reasonable course of action given the problems that people may have with identifying bullying.\n\nThat said, obviously, a company also needs policies that can be applied to bullying and the mechanisms of handling such complaints. Now, it is entirely possible to use non-specific procedures; for example, a general policy of conduct may include bullying protections, and if it works appropriately, there may be no need for the additional bullying policy. It is a relatively common practice in modern organizations, although it should be pointed out that the lack of any code of conduct that at least mentions bullying may result in the lackluster management of the issue (Escartín, 2016). Consequently, a specific procedure may be an excellent way of attracting the attention of employees and managers to the problem, and it might facilitate dealing with the problem. An example of a bullying-specific policy is zero-tolerance toward bullying. According to Escartín (2016), it is effective, but the number of studies on the topic is not very large.\n\n‘In our organization, there is a policy regulating the conduct of employees in ethical terms, and statements regarding bullying are also included in it. I am not sure how it works, but I feel more confident because I know that we have tools to combat this problem if necessary,’ notes one of the interviewees.\n\nLike always, I will not make direct suggestions on what a bullying policy should include, but what is important is making sure that the strategy does work. Current research shows that desired outcomes are not always achieved by anti-bullying policies (Escartín, 2016), and that is why it is important to monitor them. Here is when the research part of dealing with bullying comes in. Keeping track of bullying complaints is very important because their rate will help you determine the effectiveness of your policies, education, and all other interventions. It may also help to survey or interview the people who participate in various bullying prevention measures; they might have helpful ideas on how to improve the approaches that you currently use. Revising policies, especially if they are shown to be ineffective, is of primary importance. An employer needs to be aware of the climate in the workplace, and the only way to achieve that is research.\n\nIn addition to that, keep in mind the three levels of prevention. While education as the primary prevention intervention is perfectly good, you will also necessarily need secondary measures: disciplinary methods for bullies are probably the most obvious ones, but they can also be combined with extra training sessions, coaching, or counseling in certain instances (Escartín, 2016; Faucher et al., 2015). If you manage to introduce a tertiary preventative measure as well, for example, counseling services for the victims of abuse who suffer from the consequences of being bullied, you will have gathered all the possible approaches to resolving the problem of bullying in the workplace.\n\nFinally, it should be pointed out that recent research suggests that bullying mostly occurs in the environments that allow it (Escartín, 2016). If we want to prevent bullying, we need to focus on the organizational climate. A company needs to make it very apparent that bullying is discouraged and inappropriate for its employees and managers. It is necessary to work on the collective understanding of the negative nature of bullying and the importance of the fair, respectful treatment of everybody involved. These outcomes are generally achieved through the above-described means (education, policies, disciplinary measures, and so on), but while developing those measures, it is important to keep this aspect of bullying prevention in mind and devise them to promote a positive, anti-bullying climate. Overall, bullying prevention and management is a complex endeavor and it requires multilevel solutions; most likely, a workplace will have to introduce all of the above.\n\n‘Bullying occurs in those workplaces where people do not know and do not support each other, where teambuilding is not a part of the corporate culture and training, I think,’ states the respondent obtaining a managerial position in the maritime industry. ‘If you know a person, spend much time working with him or her, collaborate in groups and aim to achieve the same goal, there is no place for bullying, and a manager plays a key role in preventing such destructive behaviors in the workplace.’\n\nBad management as a stressor\n\nThe phrases “bad management” or “bad leadership” are rather judgmental, which is why I feel that it would be helpful to consider what they signify before proceeding. Now, in general, bad management (or leadership; I am going to use the terms interchangeably from now on) are toxic managerial or leadership patterns which, naturally, result in negative outcomes, including stress. It may be difficult to enumerate all the potential bad management behaviors, but I will try to give a general list of the most common ones as described by Bachmann (2016) because that work analyzes the topic rather extensively. I will also try to define the behaviors that do not qualify for bad management to avoid shaming and judging managers who are not toxic. Let us begin.\n\n 1. Bad management does not include every mistake a manager makes; in fact, we are all humans, and we are going to make mistakes, which is not a problem. However, a very common signifier of bad management is the lack of desire to admit a mistake or even correct it.\n 2. This issue is also connected to inability or unwillingness to take responsibility – passing the blame onto somebody else, most often, an employee. Managerial positions usually come with the need to take responsibility, so if a manager cannot do that, it may cause issues.\n 3. Being authoritative does not necessarily mean that a person is a bad leader, but completely overlooking employees’ ideas, especially their concerns, is a definite sign of a toxic manager.\n 4. Conversely, stealing employees’ ideas and presenting them as one’s own is unethical and a sign of bad leadership. In general, unethical behavior is very likely to qualify as bad leadership. There is a reason why we talk about leading by example; a leader should try to make ethical decisions.\n 5. Any sort of employee mistreatment is going to be toxic. That includes bullying and harassment, but also the general lack of respect can be problematic. For example, Bachmann (2016) reports that treating employees like resources rather than people, refusing to greet or thank them, screaming at them is going to cause difficulties. I will also include unfair, unreasonable criticism here, as well as excessive pressure; they may not always amount to mistreatment per se, but they are unjust and should not be tolerated.\n 6. On the other hand, favoritism and nepotism are also likely to be toxic. Put simply, they refer to the preferential treatment of certain employees (friends, family, simply the people who a manager likes). The examples that Bachmann (2016) uses include promoting people based on personal preferences rather than merit, offering bonuses or more flexible schedules to the people a manager likes more, and so on. It is a form of unethical leadership, I suppose, but it is a very specific issue that is not uncommon, so it seems to be worth mentioning.\n 7. Bad management often presupposes the lack of important managerial skills like planning or problem-solving. Also, one might argue that the lack of interpersonal skills is a significant issue; it may, among other things, be reflected in the above-mentioned mistreatment of employees.\n 8. A very common example of bad management is conflicting messages. In this case, the problem is likely to be concerned with policies and rules rather than individual managers (although conflicting messages from one person are also a possibility).\n\nIf you look at this list, you will generally understand what is needed to avoid bad management. You need to avoid these unhealthy behaviors, and everything will be fine. However, as you may have noticed, the range of bad management behaviors is rather impressive. They do have a general theme of unjust, unethical, or incompetent performances and actions, but overall, they are relatively diverse.\n\nMany of the asked interviewees had something to say about bad managers about stress experienced at work. ‘The manager I had a few years ago, she was a nightmare. She just could not use her normal voice to speak to me, only shouts. She changed her mind each hour and, yeah, she used conflicting messages. She was always dissatisfied with each aspect of our work. When she was approaching me, I just felt how my blood pressure was getting higher and my palms were becoming sweaty. A nice experience, really,’ smiles one of the interviewed employees.\n\nAn attentive reader might notice that my list of toxic behaviors also includes rather subjective things; for instance, what does unjust criticism include? More than that, how do you even define excessive pressure? Most likely, people are going to perceive various levels of pressure very differently; it is entirely subjective! And that is why, from my perspective, one of the best features of good managers (even if they do make mistakes sometimes) is listening to their employees. It is extremely important to institute good, reliable, working mechanisms of communication between employees and managers. In that case, an employee may be more likely to report on an issue, for instance, with excessive pressure, which will enable a manager to resolve it.\n\n‘Once I noticed how the attitude of my subordinates toward me had changed significantly. They did not trust me and my words anymore,’ tells Julia who works as a regional manager in her company. ‘Later I learned that one person began to spread a rumor that I had favorites at work and other people had to work more and prove themselves because of that. So … that was not true, but I gained the reputation of a bad manager.’\n\nThe solution to bad management is not something that can be completely addressed on an individual level (Bachmann, 2016). Managers who are committed to improving their leadership and management are likely to do their best to resolve the problem, but then, those managers are not bad, are they? These people are incredibly good, even if they fail at times. But what about actually toxic managers – nepotists, for example, or people who look down on their employees? And what about the issues that an individual manager simply cannot resolve, like bad policies or the problem of managers being insufficiently trained?\n\nHere is when organizational-level interventions come in. They seem to be familiar if you have read the previous chapters, and they include the means of preventing bad management, means of dealing with the existing instances of bad management, and the means of resolving negative aftereffects of bad management. Here, the diversity of bad managerial practices also matters. We can prevent unskilled leadership by encouraging leaders to receive additional training or, possibly, providing it and paying for it. We can stop nepotism by introducing the policies that make preferential treatment more difficult, allow employees to report on such cases, and include disciplinary measures for nepotists.\n\n‘I remember the situation when we reported the unprofessional behavior of our supervisor to the upper management: he insisted on hiring his wife for a well-paid position, but she was absent three days per week. We could not ignore this practice because it directly affected our work. There are no excuses for nepotism at work,’ explains Jerry his position.\n\nHarassment and bullying can be prevented and dealt with through many relevant policies (check the previous chapters for them). As you can see, there are methods of combating bad management. However, the problem is complex, which is why there is no simple one-step solution; again, it is necessary to investigate potential and existing problems, seeking out customized solutions, and monitoring their effectiveness. Some things never change. Still, acknowledging the fact that bad management exists and can be a problem that heightens employee stress level, absenteeism, and turnover is important. The identification and acknowledgment of an issue is the first step toward resolving it, and when you ponder on possible solutions, keep it in mind that among other things, you are making the workplace a little less stress-prone.\n\nManaging diversity in the maritime industry\n\nThis book has presented the facts which indicate that ill-managed diversity (or unmanaged diversity) leads to discrimination and the failure to make the workplace sufficiently inclusive. As a result, ill-managed diversity is associated with an increased risk of stress for minorities. However, there exists sufficient evidence to suggest that diversity can be managed well, and the outcomes of such management involve the reduction of stress. For instance, Ferris et al. (2014) report that when employees feel that they are treated equally, they experience reduced stress, improved well-being, and greater commitment to their organizations. Similarly, when employees feel that their organization’s culture incorporates the values that are in line with the culture of their group, another stressor is removed from their social environment. Thus, we need to consider approaches to appropriately managing workplace diversity.\n\nAlthough diversity and inclusiveness are promoted in all organizations and businesses, including the maritime industry, the achievement of diversity goals can become challenging for HR managers. To overcome obstacles associated with the necessity of managing diverse employees, HR managers usually adopt the following practices: respecting employees’ individuality, acknowledging people’s differences, focusing on persons’ cultures and beliefs, and recognizing employees’ capacities (Mor Barak, 2017).\n\n‘I found the best example of diversity management in the company organizing logistics in our sphere,’ says one of the African American male specialists working in the maritime industry. ‘Managers treated all diverse employees with respect, and this aspect was accentuated during employee orientation. I saw that each employee’s perspective and idea were heard and discussed. They created an inclusive environment, in which employees communicated friendly and positively.’\n\nThe interviewer also reported that such an atmosphere of support and respect made him perform his working duties with pleasure. ‘That was the first time in my career when I did not perceive my work just as the responsibility, and I was satisfied with my job,’ continues the man. Responding to the question about stress at work, he also added with a smile that he even did not think about problematic situations and challenges as stressful ones, the overall atmosphere did not contribute to developing such perceptions and attitudes.\n\nUnfortunately, not all HR managers can succeed in promoting diversity effectively to eliminate the number of stressful situations in the workplace. What is recommended for managers interested in creating inclusive environments is the stimulation of diverse workers’ positive collaboration. At this stage, managers should organize discussions of individuals’ ideas to maximize the use of their unique skills, experience, background, and perspectives. Also, tasks should be assigned depending on employees’ abilities and preferences (Hays-Thomas, 2016). Moreover, there also should be diversity training that not only illustrates how to collaborate with colleagues but also demonstrates how to address situations of stereotyping, discrimination, or harassment in the workplace.\n\nThe management of diversity in the maritime industry with a focus on creating an inclusive working environment is a complex process because the development of positive relations between diverse employees is not a one-day task. ‘Managers state that our diversity is recognized and respected, but in reality, many of my colleagues suffer from stereotyping and prejudice despite the adopted policies,’ claims one of the respondents. He noted that the problem is that white men prefer to work in teams only with other white persons. African Americans in predominantly white teams are discriminated against and viewed as having less knowledge and experience.\n\nFurthermore, the man noted that his colleagues seem not to respect women taking leading positions in their organization, and the spread of jokes about female leaders is a common situation in their organization. This example illustrates that the adoption of formal diversity and anti-discrimination policies cannot guarantee the immediate creation of an inclusive environment. Referring to the complex issue of promoting diversity in the workplace in the context of eliminating or increasing stress, I asked interviews about their attitudes to diversity programs in their organizations. I also asked about possible “ideal” practices and strategies that can be used in companies to make the workplace diverse and inclusive.\n\n‘I do not understand the idea of diversity as it is declared by our managers – we are all similar, but we are diverse. What does it mean? In my opinion, an inclusive environment is when we are viewed as individuals, but we are still equal to receive all the benefits of working in this organization,’ shares one of the respondents.\n\n‘I am a woman of color, and my “uniqueness” is accentuated throughout all my life, but I want my managers and colleagues to view me only as a good specialist when I am at work. Thus, an inclusive and stress-free environment for me is that one where I am not perceived only as a woman or as an African American,’ says Wanda.\n\n‘Our managers should understand that discrimination and stereotyping have no place in the 21st century; therefore, those people who bully their colleagues, participate in harassment, or spread biases should be punished. Diversity is the key feature of our society, this aspect cannot be ignored,’ claims John.\n\nThe respondents’ answers emphasize the idea that to build a diverse and inclusive working environment, managers need to promote an inclusive culture. This culture is characterized by the presence and active involvement of diverse workers in organizational processes with a focus on their representation and support. Employees are promoted and supported depending on their abilities, qualifications, and experience, as well as their potential to contribute to the organization’s progress. As a result, employees are not discriminated against because of their gender, race, disability, or any other aspect.\n\nAnother feature of this culture is receptivity that is associated with respecting diverse workers for their differences, strengths, and skills. One more important aspect is fairness reflected in employers’ and managers’ attitudes or their promotion of equality (Mor Barak, 2017). Inclusiveness is based on the idea that all employees are unique, and all of them should be treated equally and positively in a working environment. The corporate culture of companies in the maritime industry is expected to be grounded in these ideas.\n\nAs a result of creating an inclusive working environment, employees feel comfortable and safe at work because they do not suffer from stress and pressure of being stereotyped or discriminated against. In creating such a specific positive and inclusive atmosphere, each detail matters, including how managers organize teams or how often diverse employees have lunch together. Organizations in the maritime industry should be perceived as networks, and the effectiveness of employees’ work depends on their personal and professional relationships and understanding of each other, especially in crews. If there are issues related to discrimination, harassment, and bias, the quality of a crew’s work is negatively affected.\n\n‘In our company, new employees cannot join a team without completing training in diversity that was developed by experts in the field five years ago,’ says one of the interviewers. ‘This training is focused on developing our knowledge regarding different cultural groups, empathy, support, and awareness.’ Similar training and development sessions are adopted in different organizations for helping their employees accept the idea of diversity and the principles of an inclusive culture. These sessions are used by managers as one of the methods to design positive environments in which diversity and inclusiveness are respected and appreciated. The adoption of such training can be the first step toward building an inclusive workplace.\n\nThe role of managers\n\n‘I think that managers are the people who have the greatest number of opportunities to keep the relationships between coworkers civil,’ says Alice, a marine electrician with over eleven years of experience in the industry. ‘I am not saying that the rest of us are not responsible, but managers simply have more resources. And probably knowledge, right?’\n\nIndeed, while the social environment is dependent on multiple players, including the employees, the managers are usually the ones who are expected to address the related issues. After all, managers have the means of resolving interpersonal stressors in a way that employees do not: think of policies, authority, and, indeed, the training in interpersonal relationships that are not always available for non-managerial positions. Here, it should be noted that interpersonal stressors can be associated with other issues; for instance, if a person is stressed because of excessive workload, they are more likely to be irritable and, therefore, stress out other employees. Consequently, the actions of managers that help to reduce stress are likely to contribute to the improvement of the social climate as well. However, there are approaches to managing specifically interpersonal stressors, and this is the topic that I want to cover in this section.\n\nIn their analysis of interpersonal stressors, Britt and Jex (2015) discuss very important components of the successful management of interpersonal stressors: knowledge, rules, and leading by example. Indeed, the first step toward using one’s managerial skills in improving the working environment consists of learning about the state of the said environment. The only way to achieve this outcome is communication; specifically, it is necessary to establish the means of communication between employees and managers. They can be informal ones (for instance, personal communication) or more formal ones (grievances handling procedures and regular surveys). The point is that the manager needs to have the means of learning about interpersonal stressors to be able to manage them.\n\n‘I know that many managers prefer to avoid touching conflicts between employees unless it’s something very serious,’ notes Alice. ‘I understand why they do not feel like they should interfere, but I think that when conflicts become bullying or harassment, their intervention is necessary. And they are not going to learn about these issues if they are used to turning a blind eye to everything that happens between employees.’\n\nOn top of that, Britt and Jex (2015) highlight the importance of making it clear what types of behavior managers support, tolerate, and condemn. Making it apparent, for example, that the company will not tolerate bullying is a good way to reduce the possibility of employees engaging in that kind of behavior. A good approach to achieving that is an anti-bullying policy, but informal communication can also be very helpful.\n\n‘In my experience,’ says Alice, ‘policies are worth little when the more subtle, unspoken rules do not support them. It is especially clear when your boss does not follow the policy – not just because it is more difficult to stand up to someone with more authority and power but because people start to emulate what their boss is doing. And if the boss is abusive, it becomes a serious problem.’\n\nBritt and Jex (2015) also considered the ability of a manager to lead by example. This is particularly important for an organization that does have anti-harassment and anti-bullying policies because a manager who breaks such policies is very unlikely to be able to instill the wish to follow them in their employees. On the other hand, even if relevant policies are not present in an organization, a polite, respectful manager may be able to influence the behaviors of other people at the workplace. Overall, the personal behavior of a manager is crucial for reducing interpersonal stressors in the workplace.\n\nIn addition to that, I would like to focus on the interventions that a manager can use to improve the workplace climate. As was mentioned, policies and the means of communication are important tools, but the problem is that employees are maybe not aware of what interpersonal stressors imply. For instance, while they may know that there are terms like “bullying” and “harassment,” they might not fully understand them and, as a result, they might not recognize them when witnessing, experiencing, or even exhibiting such behaviors (Workplace Bullying Institute, 2014). That is why it is necessary to educate employees.\n\nIn general, the solutions to interpersonal stressors often incorporate related training and education. For instance, diversity training is likely to reduce the instances of casual racism and sexism specifically because it focuses on explaining to people why certain interactions and behaviors are problematic. Similarly, bystander intervention training is a very good way of empowering employees to discern and be able (and willing) to prevent negative behaviors. Additionally, civility training will educate employees on the topic of respect and respectful interaction, which can be particularly good for eliminating incivility that, as I have mentioned, is mostly unintentional and results from the lack of understanding.\n\nFinally, the topic of organizational culture should be noted. It will be discussed in greater detail later in the book, but here, it is necessary to note that organizational culture is a very important component of a healthy social climate. This culture needs to be inclusive to prevent the common reasons for bullying and harassment; it needs to explicitly discourage predatory behaviors, and it needs to support healthy relationships and communication. For a more detailed description of the topic and the means of modifying organizational culture, check the chapter dedicated to it.\n\nChecking Work-Related Problems\n\nA short note should be made on the topic of work-related problems, that is, the problems of badly designed tasks, badly defined roles, and so on. Technically, this issue can be connected to bad management, and I will keep it close to the social environment topic. Now, I need to point out that work is inherently stressful. There are responsibilities, deadlines, complex and challenging tasks, and so on; you cannot make work not stressful. However, you can at least eliminate some of the issues that are associated with bad management. Let us take a look at role ambiguity and shift design.\n\nRole Ambiguity: The Role of Managers\n\nRole ambiguity, as I have mentioned, is a problem that is rather common in our workplaces. It should be noted that the primary reason for role ambiguity is the inappropriate communication of roles. Britt and Jex (2015) note that the key figure that transmits this information is managers, which makes them very important for reducing role-related concerns. The authors offer several pieces of advice specifically for managers as a result.\n\nFirst, managers need to be aware of the job descriptions that are used by their companies and, most importantly, of the problems with said job descriptions. It may be a good practice to regularly update them to ensure that no outdated information is communicated to employees. Also, it is extremely important to make sure that the descriptions are clear. Soliciting the opinions of employees could help; after all, people can perceive the same thing very differently.\n\nApart from job descriptions, other sources also translate role-related information. Managers themselves are likely to explain certain responsibilities to employees, and in this regard, managers’ words need to be as clear and apparent as possible. Furthermore, Britt and Jex (2015) note that it is very dangerous to simply assume that other people understand you perfectly or that their perception is identical to yours. Rather, it is helpful to ensure that you understand each other by asking them to re-explain the provided information. Furthermore, if any other people might be communicating role-related information, a manager should encourage them to follow the same principles of clarity and understanding. Different managers mustn’t provide employees with conflicting information, which also demonstrates the significance of communication between managers themselves. Overall, as with any topic that is related to significant information, clarity and successful communication are the primary concerns.\n\nShift Design: Some Pointers\n\nI mentioned bad management in this section, but actually, I am not sure that every badly designed shift qualifies for that term. Shift design is an art, it seems, or such is my impression after studying the way a badly designed shift can cause stress and other health problems. Fortunately, there are legal requirements and friendly recommendations on how you should go about designing shifts. I find it interesting; perhaps, you will as well.\n\nA very common example of stress-inducing shifts is rotating shift work and night shift work. As it has been mentioned, these kinds of shifts are associated with very significant negative outcomes, especially those related to sleep (Landsbergis et al., 2017). Naturally, sleep disturbances are likely to affect alertness and performance, which, in certain conditions and especially in the maritime industry may become problematic from the perspective of safety. There is no simple solution to the issue since the shifts are typically introduced for a good reason. However, some advice on the matter can be provided.\n\nA not very recent but evidence-based guideline was published by the United Kingdom Health and Safety Executive, and its general principles can be used by employers and employees. The former need to set certain standards for their shifts, especially in terms of time. For instance, the guide points out that morning shifts should not start before 6 AM, and that greatly extended shifts are bound to cause stress-related issues. Furthermore, while it may seem apparent, shifts need to be planned in a way that would allow for sufficient rest with separate rest days and at least 11 hours of rest every day. Night and evening shifts that are followed by a morning shift are also likely to be problematic; in general, very rapid changes in sleeping schedule are bound to cause issues. On the other hand, more than three morning or night shifts in a row should also be avoided. Clockwise rotation is preferable, and night shifts should come at the end of the shift cycle rather than at its beginning. Finally, it is necessary to take into account employees’ preferences; they should have a choice between permanent and rotating shifts since the latter are a significant stressor, and people who are older than 45 should be offered the opportunity to avoid rotating shifts because of health concerns. Do not be a bad manager; listen to your employees!\n\nAs for employees, while they would also benefit from the above-presented advice, for them, it is suggested that 11 hours of rest days are a requirement for healthy rotating shift work and that night shifts can be made more manageable through short pre-scheduled naps. Most importantly, though, workers with rotating shifts or night shifts need to maintain healthy sleeping routines: they should make their family and friends aware of their sleeping schedule so that their sleep is not disturbed; they require a good sleeping environment that would be dark and quiet, and they can use their sleep strategically with short naps for the days when their shifts or social environment disallow good undisturbed sleeping. Thus, when shifts are concerned, both employers and employees can make sure that their impact on stress is minimized. All they have to do is make sure that they have done their research and know what is best.\n\nExtra-Organizational Stressors\n\nWhile work is one of the most significant stressors in the life of an average modern worker, it is by no means the only one. A lot of other things can cause stress: one’s child going through a rough phase, one’s pet getting ill, one’s relative being in the middle of a nasty divorce – you name it. Are these extra-organizational stressors important for an organization? The simplest answer to that question is “yes.” First, they impact an organization, which is why they cannot be overlooked. If a person comes to the work already stressed, the organization will experience all the negative outcomes of stress in the workplace. Thus, at the very least, extra-organizational stressors have an impact on a business.\n\nThat said, are organizations supposed to address extra-organizational stress? In fact, can they even do that? After all, it is not like an employer can (or should) intervene and resolve all the problems that their employees have. Well, here, it may do us some good to remember the three levels of stress prevention, in which the only one is technically aimed at preventing stress, that is, at resolving its causes. Of course, an employer cannot help a person with their family life or magically cure their illness. However, an employer can either help an employee become better at handling stress or reduce its outcomes. This section is going to be devoted to these kinds of interventions. Remember, that they are particularly helpful because they can resolve any type of stress, but they are your primary tool in dealing with extra-organizational stressors, which is why they are presented here.\n\nIdentifying Stressed People\n\nThe management of extra-organizational stressors is particularly difficult because they are not within reach of the organization. Often, the coworkers and managers of an employee are not even aware of their difficulties. However, as it has been mentioned, one of the sources of social support in the workplace; an employee’s supervisor or a colleague can help deal with stress. As a result, an important element of ensuring the psychological safety of employees that can be performed by managers and coworkers is identifying the employees who seem to be stressed (Britt & Jex, 2015). Then, appropriate interventions can be carried out by the people who have the resources and connection with the stressed-out employee.\n\nAs I have mentioned, stress can result in extremely negative psychological outcomes (Mosadeghrad, 2014), and such outcomes are typically associated with certain behaviors that can help in identifying issues before they cause significant problems. Britt and Jex (2015) recommend looking out for the cues that may be indicative of anxiety and depression. An anxious person may find it difficult to concentrate and sit still, as well as relax. A person with sub-clinical depression (a depression that is very low in severity and does not require medical intervention) may have problems in finding the energy to perform their tasks or socialize.\n\nAlso, depression is often associated with flat affect – people become less emotional, less likely to react with strong or vivid emotion to various situations that should normally cause such a reaction. In general, the lack of motivation and reduced energy are the common signs that can cause concern. Additionally, Britt and Jex (2015) suggest paying attention to the cues of frustration like repeated complaints and verbal aggression: they may also be connected to stress. Any of those signs are problematic on their own, but they are particularly likely to indicate issues if they develop over time. In other words, if a person used to be emotional but now appears not to care about anything, they might need some help. One of my interviewees supplied a personal anecdote that I think can illustrate this idea.\n\n‘I was in a really bad, unhealthy relationship,’ she supplies without going into detail, ‘and I felt drained, but I also snapped at everyone, and I am honestly ashamed of how I behaved, but it helped eventually. Maybe it’s some way of telling other people that you are not OK? Anyway, my favorite girl here, she was the one to tell me that I changed, and she asked me what was wrong, and after that, I kind of started noticing that I was not myself. That’s how I saw that I had a problem and needed to do something.’\n\nIt can also be noted that absenteeism and presenteeism are the common signs of a person being stressed. The people who are frequently absent from work might be struggling with stress (absenteeism), but also a person who is physically present but technically does not do much work may be a likely victim (presenteeism). Counterproductive behavior is another potential sign: if a person sabotages their work, it may be an outcome of stress. It is noteworthy that while the signs of anxiety or depression may be difficult for a manager to notice, absenteeism, presenteeism, and counterproductive actions are likely to be brought to their attention. These kinds of behaviors are typically monitored and investigated. Knowledge of the fact that these behaviors are associated with stress may help a manager to search for appropriate interventions rather than resorting to ineffective punishments.\n\n‘We use absenteeism figures to monitor the effectiveness of our stress reduction methods,’ Steve, who is one of the managers I interviewed, reports. ‘Interviews and surveys are helpful, sure, but they are very subjective, and we want an objective measure. And absenteeism is more complex, of course, it is not caused by stress only. But it has served us just fine in conjunctions with surveys, and I would recommend at least looking at absenteeism figures when working with stress. It does help to get a clearer picture.’\n\nWhile it looks like some literature (Britt & Jex, 2015) encourages monitoring employees for signs of stress, it should be noted that coworkers and managers are not entitled to inquiring employees about their emotional state. As for the reasons for stress, inquiring about them may be a very bad idea, especially if you are not very close to the person who you think is stressed. People have the right to privacy and are not obliged to provide information about their problems. Now, this rule can prevent their colleagues and superiors from assisting them with extra-organizational stress. However, it also hints at another conclusion: it appears that a key solution to extra-organizational stress would be simply recognizing the fact that humans are not machines. Indeed, they can sometimes experience stress, which may affect their work, regardless of the efforts of a company to reduce stress at the workplace. It is just the fact of life that must be taken into account in an industry that employs people. But despite this, one can still empower the stressed-out employees to deal with extra-organizational stressors. Let’s talk about enabling people to deal with their stress individually.\n\nIndividual Stress Management Approaches\n\nGiven that stress is a prevailing, daily reality of our worktime experiences, it is necessary to be able to manage it. However, the American Psychological Association (2015) reports that it is fairly common for people not to know what to do with stress or not do “enough” to manage it. The solution to the issue is apparent: the people who encounter stress at their workplace need to be provided with the means of fighting it. The information about stress management is a major step towards that outcome. Apart from that, a manager needs to promote a proactive approach towards it: that is, employees need to be encouraged to learn more and find the methods that work for them (Chang & Taylor, 2013). This method of resolving the stress problem is empowering; as pointed out by Britt and Jex (2015), employees are not some passive objects that are influenced by the working environment; they are, in fact, actors who can affect it. Therefore, it is especially important to enable them to affect it in the right way.\n\nCoping strategies: can they be bad for you?\n\nAn important element of stress management is coping strategies. There is no universal approach to the task; for some people, seeking support is the most effective strategy, but others prefer coping on their own, for example, by exercising or listening to music. In certain cases, it is best to contact a psychologist or another mental health professional (American Psychological Association, 2013). Individual preferences and traits should determine the choice of approach for each employee. The specific strategies are extremely numerous, but they are usually divided into a problem- and emotion-focused ones (Chang & Taylor, 2013). The former group aims to improve the circumstances, reducing the effect of the stressor that causes negative emotions. The latter helps a person in regulating their response to the stressor, minimizing the negative feelings that it triggers. The emotion-focused group is particularly helpful when the circumstances of the stress situation cannot be changed. Additionally, Chang and Taylor (2013) note that there is the strategy of avoidance, but it is not effective; while it is technically a coping strategy, it is a problematic one, which should be discouraged. Furthermore, there are undesirable, unhealthy coping behaviors that you can probably anticipate: substance use is a good example, as well as overeating.\n\nThat said, coping strategies are quite indispensable. Although an individual’s organism can adapt to stressful situations, this natural coping mechanism has such negative effects as the development of chronic stress. Therefore, healthcare professionals promote the idea that each person should learn how to cope with stress and pressure at work. Healthcare providers, psychologists, therapists, and counselors propose specific coping strategies that are known as individual stress management techniques because people can use them individually, without the participation of an organization (Dewe & Cooper, 2017). What are these effective techniques that can help employees cope with their everyday stress? Professionals usually recommend following a healthy lifestyle, changing eating habits, trying meditation, increasing physical activity, improving sleep patterns, learning relaxation strategies, and visiting counselors (Dewe & Cooper, 2017; Seaward, 2018). Thus, there are good and bad coping strategies, which highlights the importance of analyzing the ones that we use and, possibly, finding the means of improving them. For example, by reading the next few chapters.\n\nA healthy lifestyle as the key to overcoming stress\n\nWhen I hear about the necessity of following a healthy lifestyle, I cannot focus on its specific role in stress management because the overall approach seems to be too complex to change life habits in one day or notice significant results immediately. However, researchers note that those people, who can describe their lifestyle as healthily, usually cope with regular work stress more effectively than their colleagues who are not focused on such a lifestyle (Rabenu, Yaniv, & Elizur, 2017; Seaward, 2018). The components of a healthy lifestyle include eating healthy food, green vegetables, avoiding sugar and saturated fats, doing exercises regularly, increasing physical activity, sleeping 7-8 hours, walking, and having rest (Seaward, 2018). According to this description, following a healthy lifestyle generally means keeping to positive habits that are well-known to all people and associated with effective daily regimens, but they are often ignored in the context of work pressure.\n\n‘My life changed when I became concentrated on my daily routines and regime and adopted the philosophy of a healthy lifestyle spread in media. I noticed that my reactions to stressful situations changed because of my positive mood and strengths to cope with problems without suffering from pressure,’ claims a full-time employee from a maritime organization. This view is supported by experts who accentuate that healthy habits contribute to strengthening a human organism and its abilities to manage stress (Dewe & Cooper, 2017).\n\n‘People talk a lot about a healthy and active lifestyle, about their successes in improving their health and increased productivity. But I do not have time to follow all these routines because of constantly feeling tired,’ says an interviewer working in the maritime industry. It is obvious that this person needs to change his everyday life habits to cope with stress, but he is stressed and cannot bring himself to do so.\n\nUnfortunately, this situation is not unique, and professionals recommend adopting new healthy habits little by little, without causing additional stress for an organism. It is important to start by formulating a list of healthy habits to be integrated into daily life and use habit trackers for marking the progress (Seaward, 2018). For one month, it is recommended to focus only on 2-3 habits that will help to alter a lifestyle and contribute to stress management. In this case, a person will observe positive changes related to his or her well-being shortly.\n\nTime to change eating patterns\n\nAt first sight, there is no direct relationship between eating and stress management. However, researchers promote an opposite view, stating that human organisms require good nutrition to be ready to cope with stress and maintain emotional and physical stability (Cooper & Quick, 2017). Interviews with employees in the maritime industry revealed that people often chose different strategies associated with eating to improve their emotional state and address stress. One group of interviewers reported the increased intake of sweets, including chocolate and ice-cream, and coffee. The other group emphasized eating more fried, fatty, and sweet food at night. Some people also stated that they ate fast food when they were under pressure because stress in their workplace was associated with strict deadlines, overwork, and the lack of time to prepare meals. Other people reported the loss of appetite because of stress. These answers demonstrate that individuals are inclined to associate eating and stress, but they should focus on how to alter eating habits to improve their stress management.\n\nTo help the body cope with stress, nutritionists advise to balance a diet and monitor the number of carbohydrates, fat, protein, minerals, and vitamins in meals. This balance is important to contribute to the work of the immune system. Experts also note that the increased consumption of fresh fruits and vegetables can lead to stress reduction because they include certain antioxidants and vitamins (Seaward, 2018). Such carbohydrates as sugars in sweets are recommended to be changed with honey, sweet fruits, and dark chocolate with a high percentage of cocoa to increase the level of serotonin. This hormone helps a person activate the stress management mechanisms of an organism.\n\n‘My friend advised me to add cinnamon, cardamom, and ginger to tea when I feel tired and stressed, and this works! I usually feel much better and energetic after a cup of this spicy tea,’ claims one of the interviewers in this project. This advice is also found in the literature on stress management for using when it is necessary to increases levels of energy (Schiraldi, 2017). When a person needs to cope with stress and anxiety, researchers also recommend drinking tea with chamomile and peppermint. Other general advice on improving eating habits includes balancing the nutritional value of foods, avoiding skipping meals, consuming more vegetables than meat, eating seafood and fish, changing sugar-based sweets with fruits and honey. These easy steps can help make stress leave your life.\n\nMeditation: finding harmony in the face of stress\n\nOne of the most popular recommendations given to persons suffering from stress is practicing meditation. Still, the majority of employees who are daily under the pressure of working tasks and stressful situations even do not try to meditate some minutes during a day. The reason reported by professionals in the maritime industry is the lack of skills in meditating, the inability to concentrate, and the absence of immediate positive results.\n\n‘When I say I feel stressed at work, my wife asks me to join her meditation sessions. She meditates every day before going to sleep, and this action usually takes her about 15 minutes,’ states the person I have interviewed for this project. Steve continues, ‘Nothing seems to be difficult in this process, but I cannot concentrate more than 2 minutes, and thoughts about work occupy my mind again.’\n\nThis problem is typical of many people trying meditation for the first time. The paradox is that meditation works when individuals can avoid focusing their thinking on different thoughts when meditating, but they cannot do that without practice. The most important advice that I received when starting to practice meditation is that the first meditating sessions should not belong and “perfect.” Beginners in meditation, especially those who suffer from stress, should start meditating from about 5 minutes of trying to clean their mind off any thoughts that make them worry. Furthermore, another meditation technique is based on concentrating on pleasant images or thoughts, finding “a safe place” to get rid of anxiety and nervousness associated with stress. It is important to remember that a person should feel comfortable when meditating to avoid additional stress if he or she thinks that a meditation session is not perfect, not conducted correctly (Cooper & Quick, 2017). Thus, the most working advice for people thinking about meditation is “Just try it right now.”\n\nPhysical activity as a way of managing stress\n\nHow can the increased physical activity associated with making significant efforts and physical and emotional pressure contribute to reducing stress levels? According to researchers, the secret is in increasing levels of hormones responsible for stabilizing the emotional state (Seaward, 2018). When you run, play basketball or tennis, do exercises, or perform yoga practices, the production of endorphin rises, and you feel better and more positive. Thus, it does not matter what type of physical activity to follow, and experts recommend focusing on the most pleasant kinds of sports for an individual. If a person runs every morning only because it is a current trend and running helps to cope with stress, outcomes will not be as positive as it is expected.\n\n‘I noticed that when I started to play tennis with my friends each week, I began feeling less pressure at work,’ says Steve. ‘I found that I think about coming weekends, and these thoughts make me feel happier. Moreover, after two months of regular training, I found I became more concentrated.’ This example demonstrates that common recommendations of healthcare providers regarding increasing physical activity in working people are also effective for coping with stress.\n\nThe most enjoyable aspect is that any type of regular activity will lead to improvements in one’s physical and emotional health while also enhancing stress resilience (the ability to manage and cope with stress). Male and female individuals can choose from yoga, jogging, aerobics, fitness, stretching, playing tennis, basketball, and football to add them to their weekly plans. In this case, stress relief is achieved in association with increasing strength, energy levels, and improving mood.\n\n‘I am not a fan of jogging or yoga that is popular among my friends, but I like classes in stretching that I visit two times per week. I like this feeling of muscle tension that is followed by relief,’ states one of the women participating in the interview. Physical activity and associated muscle work usually contribute to decreasing the level of emotional pressure by making the body get rid of stress.\n\nThe role of sleep in stress management\n\nThe first thought in my mind associated with stress management techniques is related to improving sleep patterns. Different media promote the idea that the lack of sleep leads to decreasing life energy and higher risks of stress. The problem is that stress in its nature can also provoke problems with sleep and even cause insomnia if it is chronic. Thus, sleep and stress are in close and direct relationships.\n\nMore than 50% of respondents in this project noted that they often suffer from insomnia because of stress. Some of these individuals take medications to fall asleep, and others reported problems with sleep because of going to bed late at night. The key advice given by healthcare professionals to persons with stress is to improve their sleep patterns, monitor the duration and quality of sleep, and go to bed before 11:00 pm. However, for many adults, this advice seems to be hardly feasible because of the necessity to cope with many working and home tasks during a day.\n\n‘I was diagnosed with chronic sleep deprivation three years ago, and my counselor advised me to change my sleep regimen. We started from avoiding watching TV or using a laptop and a phone one hour before preparing for sleep, going to bed at 11:00 pm, and waking up at 6:30 am,’ one of the respondents shares his experience. These simple tips are usually mentioned by specialists for people having problems with sleep and suffering from constant stress (Seaward, 2018).\n\nAccording to research, the reason for improving sleep patterns to cope with stress is also associated with hormones. Sleep deprivation leads to decreasing melatonin levels, and persons face difficulties with managing stress and stabilizing their emotional level because of problems with regulating their circadian rhythm (Seaward, 2018). Cortisol is another type of hormone that is usually released in response to sleep deprivation leading to increased anxiety. Simple steps for improving sleep patterns will contribute to improving the work of the endocrine system, and stress will be managed easily.\n\nRelaxation strategies for coping with stress\n\nI agree with the ideas of researchers who state that the ability to relax is important to manage stress in the workplace because an organism needs rest when addressing pressure and different troubles (Cooper & Quick, 2017). Several widely-known techniques for relaxing include massage, aromatherapy, deep breathing, yoga and meditation exercises, art therapy, and muscle relaxation (Seaward, 2018). What effects can these techniques have on reducing stress levels in working people?\n\nWhen persons focus on relaxation techniques, they avoid triggers of stress, find comfortable places to relax, and concentrate on their bodies’ responses. As a result, the heart and breathing rates slow down, stress hormones become less active, and muscle tension can decrease (Seaward, 2018). Individuals can practice relaxation at home, performing self-massage, focusing on deep breathing, and progressive muscle relaxation. These techniques are easy to learn, and they do not require specific skills. However, the assistance of professionals in massage, coordinated yoga, and art therapy also has positive effects on overcoming stress.\n\nStill, there are also more available strategies for relaxing at home. ‘When I feel stressed, I like to listen to my favorite music and watch a good film,’ states one of the interviewers. Female respondents working in the maritime industry noted that they like to cope with stress with the help of baths, weekends spent in nature, and reading books. These easy strategies are also effective for coping with worrying and anxiousness and stabilizing the emotional state.\n\nData in the literature on stress management and coping techniques and strategies provide the background for the following question: what is the most effective relaxation technique to overcome stress as quickly as possible? According to experts, such techniques as deep breathing, progressive muscle relaxation, and massage are more working in coping with stress than watching a film because of provoking the body’s response to the problem (Seaward, 2018). However, I believe that any strategy that helps you relax can be used to manage stress and restore your levels of energy and optimism.\n\nCounseling for coping with stress\n\nIf stress becomes an integral part of life and a person constantly experiences pressure at work, stress management can become a difficult task to complete in this case. Some people who cannot self-manage stress require counselors’ help. Different types of therapy can be proposed to overcome the causes and symptoms of stress, including cognitive behavioral therapy, art therapy, stress inoculation therapy, and emotionally focused therapy (Seaward, 2018). The problem is that individuals are often not ready to admit the presence of such a health issue as stress. Employees in the maritime industry usually ignore symptoms of stress and anxiety or try to cope with them independently, as it is reported by the respondents.\n\n‘Today, people often discuss stress in the workplace, but I am not sure that I experience significant stress at work. Of course, I do not think that I need specific support or counseling. And yes, I often feel tired and even exhausted after a working day, but I do not view this as anything unique. Many people face the same problems,’ asserts one of the interviewers having the experience of 7 years in the maritime industry. Thus, many working people often do not recognize the levels of stress they have to cope with, and they do not ask for the assistance of professionals due to a variety of reasons.\n\nIf stress is untreated, it leads to chronic exhaustion of a human organism, problems with the immune and endocrine systems, and decreased levels of energy. Therapists and counselors can help employees reduce stress with the help of the mentioned therapies. Cognitive-behavioral therapy is useful for helping individuals change their perception of stressful situations to decrease the effect of stressors on people’s health and emotional state (Seaward, 2018). Participating in this therapy, people develop a new way of thinking regarding their daily working responsibilities and associated stress.\n\nIn its turn, art therapy allows for focusing on pleasant images rather than thoughts about work or on reflecting on stressful situations with the help of drawing and painting. Stress inoculation therapy helps people prepare for stressful events that can include promotion or retirement in the context of working environments. Emotionally focused therapy helps individuals understand their emotions and needs as well as correlate them to achieve satisfaction for a person (Seaward, 2018).\n\nThese approaches are actively used in therapists’ work with clients’ stress, but people have little information about counselors’ role in helping to overcome stress, and they often avoid visiting professionals. Still, consulting specialists regarding therapies, relaxation, meditation, sleep, and nutrition can become an effective strategy for employees who feel that they cannot cope with stress independently. The adoption of various stress management strategies, in this case, can have a positive effect on an individual’s emotional and physical state.\n\nBuilding up personal energy\n\nReturning to the topic of potential stressors, I would like to revisit the concept of personal energy. Britt and Jex (2015) pointed out that the loss of this resource is associated with stress, which highlights the significance of finding the means of replenishing it. Indeed, the authors demonstrate very clearly that the only way of avoiding the stress of being low on energy is to have an effective method of restoring it. The simplest way of achieving this outcome is a break, which can be customized to your personal needs and preferences. Indeed, a break can be an actual opportunity to simply have some rest: you may choose to play a game, browse social media, or daydream. On the other hand, you can take a break from the particular activity that you are engaged in and a switch to another task – from job-related ones to, for instance, cleaning your working place. Meditation can also be a good activity during your break, and naps are very effective, but they are not always an option. Overall, the approaches to breaks can vary; just find the one that suits you the best.\n\nUnsurprisingly, glucose is another helpful resource that can help you to restore your energy levels. Small amounts of sweet foods can provide a quick energy boost that is beneficial for a variety of tasks, especially those that require self-control or intense attention. Just remember that overindulgence in sweet foods may be unhealthy. As for less urgent means of restoring energy, rest (especially sleeping), nutrition, and exercise are the primary solutions. The people who maintain good sleep hygiene (sleep enough, avoid eating, drinking, and smoking before bedtime, and treat sleeping disorders) and have proper nutrition are generally more energized than those who do not have the luxury. Together with exercise, these methods are good for our well-being from multiple perspectives.\n\nThe interaction with other people can also become a source of energy as long as it is positive. Examples include discussing a problem, thanking coworkers for their help, offering help to others, or seeking feedback on your work. Furthermore, finding inspiration for one’s work is a good way to ensure the presence of energy to complete it; in practice, you can achieve this outcome by thinking of the meaning of your task and its importance for the organization or your community.\n\nIt is also noteworthy that our levels of energy can be expanded as we become more proficient with varied tasks. For instance, if you frequently have to perform the activities that require self-control, you will eventually become better at it, and similar tasks will not take up as much energy as they used to. As a result, it is possible to deliberately drain our energy reserves. Overall, there are multiple strategies for the improvement of one’s energy levels, and it is possible to devise customized strategies based on personal preferences.\n\nSocial support\n\nSocial support is one more resource that can reduce the stress experienced by people in the workplace. This support is a result of efforts demonstrated by an individual’s social network that usually includes a family, relatives, friends, colleagues, and acquaintances. Social support is observed when family members, coworkers, friends, and other people encourage you, they are ready to assist and provide guidance or advice. In addition to emotional support, people can also provide physical support to demonstrate their empathy, and they can even guarantee financial assistance if necessary. This help is important for a person in different problematic periods of his or her life, and as a result of this social support, stress can decrease. If an individual has no relationships, in which he or she can be listened to, encouraged, or cared, stressful situations become a significant obstacle.\n\nResearchers agree that a family, partners, and relatives usually represent the most influential support system for people because of their role in reducing stress. Close people often provide emotional and practical support, and their assistance is usually most meaningful for individuals under stressful circumstances (Nicholas & Steyn, 2017). Social support in the form of physical support and sympathy or comforting improves the immune system, relieves pain, and decreases blood pressure.\n\n‘When I come home after a working day full of challenges, I feel relief immediately after hugging my wife,’ says one of the respondents. ‘This easy ritual helps me become aware that I am at home and all problems remained at work.’ I should state that, for many people, one of the simplest ways to cope with stress is to share one’s thoughts and worries with a partner or a close friend. Those people who have no social support have higher levels of stress because they remain alone with their thoughts and unrest.\n\nThe people who have not managed to secure a well-developed social network for themselves experience greater risks of multiple psychosomatic symptoms that are associated with stress. Also, the lack of support can be stressful and harmful on its own. These ideas are usually started by researchers in their studies (Nicholas & Steyn, 2017; Seaward, 2018). Therefore, if a person has support at home or in relationships with friends and other close people, she or he feels healthier and stronger than lonely individuals. Support in different forms helps persons cope with everyday challenges more effectively and understand that they will receive the necessary assistance when required. As a result, people with wide and diverse social networks, including individuals they love and respect, rarely suffer from chronic stress and diseases associated with psychosomatic causes.\n\nSocial support is also important at work where people spend a large part of their life. Work is usually associated with stress, and to cope with its negative effects, managers are interested in creating a specific supportive climate. This climate is based on following the principles of mutual respect, assistance, and encouragement. If employees do not feel the support of their colleagues, their stress increases in correlation with decreases in their productivity.\n\n‘I left the previous job position in a well-known company because there was no social support in their corporate culture. Much attention was paid to formalizing interactions, and personal contacts between employees were not supported,’ Stacy shares her experience. The woman also noted that she did not feel any assistance from her supervisor and colleagues, and the feeling of helplessness and stress made her find another job. The trend of formalizing relationships at work is followed in many modern organizations to boost employees’ productivity and improve their performance by eliminating triggers for communication not related to work.\n\nHowever, the lack of social support in the workplace can result in an opposite effect associated with decreased productivity and the absence of commitment due to increased stress. A supportive climate at work based on guidance, advice, assistance, and sympathy is traditionally viewed as an effective stress reduction strategy. Still, the percentage of employees who report being supported by their managers and colleagues is rather low, according to the results of the interviews conducted with professionals in the maritime industry. More supportive relationships are typical of employees working in crews onboard because they need to spend much time together, and their external social contacts are limited. In this case, members of crews can cope with stress effectively if they feel the support of their colleagues, they do not feel lonely and abandoned in stressful situations.\n\nStill, the climate in organizations in the maritime industry that are not directly associated with maritime transportation and the work in crews is commonly formal. Thus, employees can feel much stress when working in shipping companies, for example, even if their environment is less stressful than it is in crews. The reason is that a positive and supportive climate at work is important to guarantee that all employees can receive assistance from each other, information is exchanged easily, and an overall atmosphere is comfortable.\n\n‘I began to experience less stress at work when a new manager joined our team. Previously he worked in another department of our company, and he had developed skills in building strong positive relationships with employees,’ states one of the respondents in the interview. ‘He started with organizing weekly team-building sessions to help us get acquainted and trust each other. I am usually rather skeptical regarding these activities, but it worked!’\n\nSupportive management is the key to creating a supportive climate at work. Leaders need to demonstrate what type of behavior is appreciated in the workplace, and employees as their followers will imitate this pattern. If managers promote only formal communication between employees, stimulate competition, and encourage it with the help of rewards and bonuses, it is almost impossible to expect that coworkers will be supportive about each other (Nicholas & Steyn, 2017). Such working conditions are extremely stressful for employees, and the only way to feel comfortable is to find social support at home.\n\nThe promotion of support at work can also be associated with supportive leadership. Thus, supportive leaders provide their subordinates with all the required guidance and tools to perform their duties effectively. If a person knows that he or she can ask questions and will receive answers, the levels of stress also reduce. From this perspective, each type of social support (emotional, practical, informational) is important in the workplace because they lack support leads to worsening stress. When people do not know how to resolve a working issue without the advice or assistance of their colleagues, they experience stress even when being professionals in their areas. Furthermore, social support at work contributes to developing the feelings of commitment and belongingness in employees, they begin to perceive their working environments as friendly, and they do not experience stress typical of people who are not satisfied with their work.\n\nThe role of a manager\n\nEven though employees are capable of taking care of their energy level, the role of the manager is still noteworthy. Indeed, given the fact that personal energy gets depleted, it is important to avoid overloading employees with tasks, and it is necessary to provide them with sufficient opportunities for restoring their reserves. The latter point refers to breaks, days off, vacations, and so on, but is not limited to them. It is also important to acknowledge that people are different, and some of them may need more breaks and more time off work to be able to restore their energy. A manager needs to respect this fact. Naturally, some people may be (or appear to be) particularly resilient and state that they do not need to rest too often. However, this position may not be very healthy; in general, it may be better to avoid encouraging excessive work: after all, the potential negative effects of depleted energy (including stress and worse performance) are most undesirable.\n\nEmployees can be inspired to accomplish important things through leadership, the support of the company’s vision, and organizational culture. Employees are much more likely to be enthusiastic and energetic if they like what they are doing and if they understand the aims of their activities (especially when they approve them). Also, the relative freedom of expression at the workplace can have beneficial effects while continuous supervision is likely to be demotivating (Britt & Jex, 2015). The successful management of the organizational climate can ensure that employees’ interactions are positive. Further, it is not uncommon for a company to present employees with healthy food options and the opportunity to exercise during breaks. Both these approaches can help to keep employees energized. If a particular position makes it possible, allowing employees to take naps may also be a great solution, but it is clear that not every company would permit that.\n\nA manager can also organize stress management interventions and customize them to the needs of employees. However, this solution will only be useful if the employees are allowed to provide their input. As it was mentioned, the strategies of stress management are very diverse, and without the information about the preferences and abilities of employees, a manager will not manage to choose the right options. Also, as pointed out by Britt and Jex (2015), it is very common for stress management approaches to view stress as “inherently toxic” (p. xi). Therefore, a less one-sided approach could be more useful. In it, the positive aspects of stress would be taken into account, as well as the fact that it is not feasible to try and eliminate it absolutely and completely.\n\nWork-Life Balance\n\nWe have covered most of the easy topics. Now, it is time for the big stressor, the one which is both external and internal, the one that more or less universal, the one that is caused by complex issues and requires complex solutions: the work-life balance. I know that it is a big one (just like safety) because it is all over my interviews and literature. Work-life balance is a major topic when it comes to stress management, which is why I am going to talk about it at length. Also, I encountered a very interesting case of a company choosing to go through noticeable changes to help its employees balance their work and life, and I am dying to share this inspirational story with you. Without further ado, let us begin.\n\nWork-Life Balance: The Concept\n\nPersonal life is very important for our well-being and, naturally, it can affect our stress levels (Cardoso, Padovani, & Tucci, 2014). To put it simply, our relatives and friends can serve as a safeguard against stress. It has been proven scientifically that the people who can rely on someone close and request emotional support from them tend to have lower levels of stress than the people who claim that they do not receive emotional support (American Psychological Association, 2015). On the other hand, it is entirely possible for a person to be stressed at home and, after coming to work, experience all the negative outcomes of stress, which can eventually affect their performance. In fact, according to the report by the American Psychological Association (2015), family and family responsibilities have been consistently ranked as the third most important source of stress in the United States (after money and work). The same source claims that the people who have children are much more likely to experience stress than those who do not have children.\n\n‘I think that many workers bring their family problems to the workplace. They get stressed at home and come stressed to work, and others get to deal with all the negative outcomes,’ claims one of the maritime industry managers who were interviewed for this book. ‘They might not even have stress at work; they bring it here. It does not matter how well employers and management protect them from stress when the source is not in the workplace environment.’\n\n‘Do you think that occupational stress can cause stressful conditions at home?’ I ask.\n\n‘It probably does,’ agrees the managers without much hesitation. ‘Looks like we have a vicious circle.’\n\nDuring this research, a lot of accounts were gathered about maritime workers being stressed because of the impact that their job has on their familial relationships. The managers pointed out the fact that the industry is often associated with traveling, which prevents the workers from seeing their families for way too long. Additionally, even the positions that do not require traveling still demand a lot of time, which means that less time can be spent with the family. This problem is also stress-inducing on its own; if it tends to affect familial relationships, any problems in which are stressful as well, the term “vicious circle” covers the situation quite well. Naturally, one’s work life and family life require some form of balance for the successful functioning of every person. However, how do you get to that balance?\n\nMike, who is a middle-aged middle-level manager in the maritime industry, smiles self-depreciatingly.\n\n‘The main thing that I know about work-life balance is that I do not know how to achieve it,’ he admits. ‘I mean, I studied the thing, sure, but somehow all this literature is not helping. I am not sure that I am comfortable with telling you others’ stories, but I can tell you mine, and you will see that I cannot manage even my work-life balance, not to speak of my co-workers.’\n\nThere is much research on work-life balance, and one of the main conclusions that can be made about it is that its lack causes stress (Lyness & Judiesch, 2014). However, there is no universal approach to the task of balancing the two parts, so Mike’s confusion and disappointment generally make sense.\n\n‘Now, I know that the “life” part of the balance is not about your family and nothing else, but my experience tells me that it is the main thing that we usually discuss when talking about this thing. For me, it is the most important one. Maybe it’s just that I do not have that many hobbies.’\n\nMike is correct: work-and-life balance is an inclusive term, and the “life” element can stand for various aspects like interests, hobbies, and other parts of your personal life. Britt and Jex (2015) note that a very important development in the perception of a work-life balance was connected to expanding this notion. Initially, it was mostly connected to the responsibilities that people have concerning children, especially very young ones, but it is apparent that even within the context of families, people also have responsibilities towards their parents and siblings, and outside of that context – towards friends, peers, and so on. A single childless employee is no less entitled to some out-of-workplace time than an employee who has many children. The family is still a big part of our lives, though, so I am not surprised when Mike shows me a picture: a brown-eyed toddler sitting on the lap of a similarly brown-eyed smiling woman.\n\n‘Tracey is now three years old,’ he explains. ‘I try to spend as much time with her as I can. I feel bad about not being around enough. But then, I can’t sacrifice my job, you know? And it is pretty demanding.’\n\nA lot of reasons for work-life disbalance have been named, and predominantly, they are connected to the excessive attention to work. For example, extra hours are problematic because they further decrease the time available for not-work-related activities. With the spread of technology, working from home became a rather common approach to managing workloads (Britt & Jex, 2015), and this method is also very bad for the work-life balance. In general, excessive workloads, extra hours, and understaffing are the primary factors that prevent employees from spending enough time away from work.\n\n‘You know those kid’s movies with the general idea of “daddy, you need to work less?” I watched a couple, and I have noticed that they focus on the way children get deprived of the attention of their parents, which – don’t get me wrong, it is true, but recently, I feel like what I need to see is a movie that pays some attention to the father’s feelings. Because, sure, my girl does not get to see me too often, but we can catch up at any time, right? She is not losing something. Me, on the other hand? I will not see her grow again. It is me who is missing out. I have this feeling more and more often as she grows up… Well, maybe that’s just my middle-age crisis talking.’\n\nWithout meaning to, Mike mentions a very important problem. It is essential to remember that the concept of work-life balance does not exist to make working parents feel bad about not spending enough time with their children. If anything, this kind of pressure is likely to cause stress, not decrease it. The point of work-life balance consists of helping people to find a balance between their work and life, and this outcome can be achieved with the help of a manager.\n\nDeciding to Help\n\n‘So, can you work less?’ I ask Mike.\n\n‘I think I can,’ he responds without much hesitation. ‘I can take more days off; I have not been using them for quite a while. But it is a very difficult choice. I mean, my family does not need anything, it’s not like me working less would make us broke. But I want to make sure that we are financially secure. Also, I am not sure that my superiors would feel good about me suddenly starting to take every day off. You do not usually encourage this kind of behavior.’\n\n‘Does it mean that you do not encourage that kind of behavior?’ I ask. Mike seems to be genuinely taken aback.\n\n‘I mean I am not going to make a person work when they are ill or when they have some emergency at home. Also, I do not discourage them from taking days off. But I do not encourage it either,’ he shrugs. ‘I have not met any manager who would.’\n\n‘I have had some experience with three different companies and, like, at least six managers, and they always encouraged us to work more,’ says Dolores, an IT specialist. ‘It does not have to be direct, you know. But I once did get unofficially reprimanded for taking sick leave at a, particularly inconvenient time. And it’s not like I can time getting sick, but I still was rather worried about my bonuses for a while after that. Good thing nothing came out of it. I guess my boss has stressed himself, so he lashed out at me.’\n\nThis position is not surprising. Given the fact that the typically discussed disbalance is concerned with overworking, it is reasonable to ask: does a manager need a worker to have a balanced life? Overworking is not bad for a company, right? Well, this statement is very questionable. The benefits of overworking are apparent, but there is some evidence that also points to negative outcomes. Recent research in the field suggests that the lack of work-life balance is bad for a person’s emotional well-being and promotability, which eventually causes stress and all the related issues. Moreover, people with imbalanced work and life may also be less productive than those who have it figured out (Lyness & Judiesch, 2014). Thus, while it may appear that overworking is helpful for a company, it is likely that the long-term costs will include stressed workers and reduced productivity. Encouraging employees to find a better work-life balance may be a reasonable decision, and to achieve that, it is important to prevent overworking.\n\nUnlike Mike, I have met the managers who decided to encourage “that kind of behavior” – that is, the behavior which involves taking the days off that you need. They believe that they might have discovered an advanced approach to handling the issue of stress. Before we proceed to discuss it, however, we need to make some concluding remarks about work-life balance. First, let us note that some discrepancies are related to work-life balance. For instance, the American Psychological Association (2015) notes that parents tend to report more stress than people without children. In other words, people with children may be under increased duress and, therefore, the establishment of work-life balance for them may be more difficult.\n\nFurthermore, there are some gender-related inequalities. In particular, for women, the establishment of work-life balance can be more difficult than for men, especially in more conservative countries, states, or communities. This tendency can be explained by the fact that women in traditional communities are viewed as the ones who are responsible for the not-work-related parts of our life such as household chores and children. In turn, men in such communities do not contribute much to said chores, which is why it is easier for them to find the time for rest, hobbies, and other important parts of life (Lyness & Judiesch, 2014). According to the American Psychological Association (2015), women also tend to report stress more often than men. While this fact does not necessarily imply that they are more stressed (men, for instance, maybe uncomfortable with reporting stress), this information needs to be taken into account by managers. For some people, work-life balance may be more difficult to achieve; now, that we have decided that they need managerial help, managers also need to acknowledge they will need special, individual approaches.\n\nFinally, it should be mentioned that, as found by Lyness and Judiesch (2014), the perceptions of managers regarding the work-life balance of their employees may be skewed. The authors mostly focus on the way managers (like any other living human) are affected by stereotypes, but in general, their observation can be used to point out the importance of the employees’ perceptions once again. It is necessary to consider the views of the employees to help them with their work-life balance. As for how this outcome can be achieved, the next sections will consider this topic in detail.\n\nA New Approach to Vacation Policies\n\nI talk to Steve, a man with over seventeen years of experience in the maritime industry, seven of them as a manager. Currently, he works in a ship repair company, which went through a major change in its vacation policy in 2014. It is that change which he wants to share because he believes that it demonstrates the cardinal flaw in the policies that many companies have and the really simple solution to it. First, however, we discuss the problems that can cause work-life disbalance.\n\n‘Do people often sacrifice their personal life to earn more money?’ I ask you to start this conversation.\n\n‘Yes, of course,’ Steve responds assuredly. ‘, throughout my experience both as an employee and a manager, I have been working with the people who are very willing to work more and earn more.’\n\n‘Is it a good thing? For the company and themselves?’\n\n‘That depends. Sure, a dedicated worker is a great worker, but it is not only about meeting a deadline or managing a critical stage in your work. It’s not good for the worker.’\n\n‘Because of stress?’\n\n‘Yes, yes. We know for sure that working without resting is very, very stressful.’\n\n‘And resting helps with stress?’\n\n‘Yes, resting is the best remedy I think.’\n\nSteve is likely to be correct: the recent research allows making similar conclusions. Things like rest and good sleep (especially during the night) are known to reduce stress (Dias, Santos, Abelha, & Lovisi, 2016). On the other hand, the lack of rest is one of the major factors for its development. Therefore, by ensuring that the worker’s rest, a manager can both prevent stress and help to reduce the tension that has already accumulated.\n\n‘It’s a problem because it is a common practice to encourage people to give up their rest for the sake of work,’ Steve points out. ‘And I think that it is our problem, the managers’ problem. We do that.’\n\n‘How do you encourage a person to restless?’\n\n‘Well, there are many ways, but in my experience, it is mostly implicit. You do not go and deprive your employees of their days off or vacations; that would get you into trouble. But there are other, subtler ways, you know?’\n\nIt turns out that I do know. The examples that Steve uses ring a bell and seem to be very common; they are connected to the organizational practices, promoted values, and unspoken rules. For instance, a manager can communicate it rather clear that a person who does not take too many days off may be more likely to get promoted. Also, a manager can lead by example – a bad example in this case – by not taking days off and working him- or herself into the ground. The organizational culture may implicitly stigmatize the people who take days off or sick leaves while promoting extra hours and working from home. All these examples are something that many of us have encountered in our personal life.\n\n‘Changing the organizational culture is hard,’ I note to Steve. He nods eagerly, ready to explain the reasoning that he and his co-workers chose.\n\n‘Yes, and culture is also very difficult to, you know, measure. We wanted to do some changes, but we also recognized that to change something this complex, we would need to start small. So, we focused on a less covert and more tangible encouragement: our vacation policy.’\n\nAs stated by Steve, their old vacation policy was nothing special; I encountered that kind of thing in every company that I have ever worked with. The primary features of the policy were the loss of unused sick days and the purchasing of unused days off at the end of the year; none of them could be carried forward into the next one.\n\n‘In other words, days off were optional?’\n\n‘Worse than that. It was not just that we did not encourage the employees to take days off, you know? We encouraged them not to do so!’\n\n‘But people should know that they need to rest, right?’\n\n‘They do, but they can be very self-sacrificing. In my experience, people would think that they can work without rest, or they would need money, or they would want it… and they would agree to give up their much-needed days off for the sake of the money. I do not think that it was good for them. I know I would rather have my workers well-rested because ship-repair does not go well with stress, you know. I would rather encourage my workers to have some rest and then come to work to do their work right.’\n\n‘Why do you think this sort of policy existed in the first place?’\n\n‘I do not think that it was made to keep people from rest. I think that it was done to compensate the workers who are ready to give up their rest for the benefits of the company. Also, to be honest, I think that it is a pretty common practice. I worked at three places, and it was in two of them. And my son, he is an IT specialist, and his company does the same, which means that it’s not just the maritime industry. Maybe we just never gave it enough thought before our little experiment.’\n\nThe practice of buying days off does seem to be common in different fields and companies of different sizes. Steve is also right in noting that it does not have to be a practice that is flawed to the core; it is reported to have positive outcomes for companies, which get the chance to have more work done, and the employees who accumulate too many vacation days to be able to use them. However, Steve has a point: if the policy results in people having less rest and more stress, both these benefits are likely to be overshadowed by the issues that stem from stress.\n\n‘That is how we decided that buying days off was a bad idea,’ says Steve. ‘And we gave it up. We rewrote the whole policy while keeping in mind our new objective: we needed to encourage our people to have some rest. And – most importantly – we needed to make sure that we would not encourage them to sacrifice it.’\n\nFirst of all, that meant that days off could not be bought anymore; that part of the policy simply got removed. Furthermore, specific types of vacations were now supposed to expire slower than before: 50% of the unused days off could be carried into the next year and expire six months into it.\n\n‘Now, people can get more days off, even if they can’t do it within one year for whatever reason.’\n\n‘Are they paid days off?’\n\n‘Yes, of course! That is the point: if a person gets extra money for missing a day off, they may choose the money. But when they are getting as much money for a day’s rest as for a day’s work, more people will gravitate towards rest. As a result, we decrease the chances of workers giving up on rest.’\n\nHowever, Steve and his co-workers did not stop there; apart from encouraging people to take days off, the new policy also introduced the practice of mandatory days off. In the final version of the policy, five consecutive days between anniversary dates became obligatory.\n\n‘Workers must necessarily take five days off, right?’\n\n‘That is the point,’ notes Steve.\n\n‘Is it not somewhat radical? It means that you force people to have some rest.’\n\n‘Yes, sure, but I do not think that it is radical. Organizational force, as you say, people do a lot of things. There are rules, ethical codes, dress codes… Making people dress in a particular way is not much better than making people rest, I think. I consider it just another rule, a stipulation in our contracts with the workers. If they do not like it, they can always not work with us.’\n\n‘Were there any people who did not like the change? Were there those who did not want to be forced to rest?’\n\nTo both of us, it sounds almost like a joke, and one that Steve laughs at. Then, he considers it more seriously.\n\n‘You know, I suppose that there could be some discontent because the previous policy had some extra opportunities to earn some money. But my department did not have such attitudes. I would know. All the formal and semi-formal feedback that I got was positive. People liked the change; a few told me that they felt like it was a major step forward, and two said that they felt like the company was caring about them.’\n\nHere, it should be mentioned that by helping the employees achieve work-life balance, managers are likely to foster dedication and engagement, which, in turn, tend to result in increased productivity (Roelofsen, 2002). That is why a company needs to show that it understands and respects the need and rights of its employees to achieve the balance. Eventually, this human-oriented approach is good for a company’s image and brand. The employees who are respected by an organization are more likely to respect it in turn, which is a necessary condition for their loyalty and dedication to the company’s vision, mission, and objectives. Thus, by demonstrating that it cares, Steve’s company improved its image in the eyes of its employees, which is the most important outcome.\n\nSteve with his co-workers, however, wanted to see more specific and tangible results, and they devised a way of measuring the impact of the new policy. Here, it should be noted again that a person with a good work-life balance is healthier, happier, and less stressed, which is why they can perform better (Chen et al., 2014; Roelofsen, 2002). However, these factors are not very easily assessed, which is why the managers did not attempt to involve them in the evaluation process. Instead, they focused on absenteeism and turnover rates. According to the company’s reports, after the introduction of this new policy in 2014, the employee turnover rate was reduced by about 12%. The absenteeism rates also decreased with the unpaid days off falling from 3.28% in 2013 to 0 in 2016.\n\n‘Does that mean that the employees started to rest more or get stressed less?’ I ask just to make sure.\n\n‘I would think so, yes. Absenteeism is connected to stress, and so is turnover. It is reasonable to assume that our approach worked. Also, we did not have any other major policy changes during that time, and you cannot explain the twelve-percent reduction in turnover by mere chance, especially since previous years did not show anything similar.’\n\nAgain, Steve is correct: as we have mentioned, turnover and absenteeism are proven to be the common outcomes of occupational stress (Banerjee & Mehta, 2016), which are also easily measurable. While the company did not manage to assess the levels of stress in its employees or the specifics of the changes in their performance, it has found an appropriate substitute and made the only logical conclusion: unsurprisingly, the policy which encourages employees to rest, makes them rest and lowers their stress levels, which gets reflected in the reduction of common stress outcomes.\n\nChanging the Organizational Culture\n\nWhen discussing the policy, Steve wanted to make it clear that he is not the only one to be blamed for the new policy’s success.\n\n‘It was not just my idea; I do not think that it could work other than through a collaborative effort. We shared opinions and experience, we brainstormed, we drafted the policy, and wrote and rewrote it. We were convincing the skeptical people; we had to fight some of the higher-ups, explaining and explaining the concept all over again. But after the experiment, it got easier: we now have solid proof that our policy is better in the long run. What I mean is that changes are not simple, and they need a collaborative effort. If you want to do something similar in your organization, the first thing that you need to do is engage your people. They are going to be a tremendous help.’\n\n‘It looks like you are encouraging our readers to undertake something similar to your experiment,’ I tease.\n\n‘That is precisely what I do,’ Steve responds seriously. ‘I think that by now we should view those other policies as old-fashioned. They are not just about ineffective policies; they represent a specific mindset – mostly in managers, but eventually, in the organizational culture itself. This mindset tells you that a good employee is an employee who works as much as they can and rest as little as they can. This mindset just does not work. It breeds stress, and I think that it is the core of the problem. If we introduce new policies, we will make people reflect on that mindset. Eventually, I think that we will cause a shift in the mindset.’\n\n‘Do you observe this shift in your company?’\n\n‘I do. This whole experiment was only possible because a few of us started to reflect on this old-fashioned perspective. Now, there are many more people – among employees too – who recognize that you cannot work your human resources into the ground.’\n\nThe process of changing organizational culture is exceptionally complicated, but Steve’s approach to it has its merits.\n\nOrganizational culture can be identified as common and normative patterns of behaviors, beliefs, values, and attitudes that are present within an organization. My interviewees often refer to different “unspoken rules” – for instance, those that prevent people from taking days off. Such rules are an example of an element of an organizational culture, which can be connected to different values and beliefs. For instance, the idea that an employee needs to devote as much time as possible to their work could be one of them. As you can see, organizational culture is a powerful force; it can affect the behaviors of employees and managers.\n\nAccording to Alvesson and Sveningsson (2015), despite the rather frequent coverage in literature, in practice, organizational culture is more often neglected than not. This issue is especially problematic because, as noted by the authors, it is very difficult to find an organization without a culture. Organizational culture is created through the interactions between employees; therefore, if the members of an organization interact, they are likely to eventually develop a form of culture with unified beliefs and norms (Gover, Halinski, & Duxbury, 2015). Even if a company’s management does not expend efforts to develop one, most definitely, culture is still present in an organization. Quite often this culture can be detrimental too; take, for instance, the above-discussed issue of the unspoken rules that prevent people from taking a few days off, and you will get a vivid example.\n\nOrganizational culture is often mentioned when considering organizational change. Depending on whether the culture supports the change or not, it may become a facilitator or an obstacle to the point where it can ensure the failure of change efforts. Just like an organization is extremely unlikely to be without a culture, any change is extremely unlikely not to be affected by the said culture in any way. As a result, it would be helpful to consider and take into account a company’s culture when a change is being planned and executed.\n\nOn top of that, organizational culture can be altered and, in fact, sometimes needs to be altered (Gover et al., 2015). Take, for instance, Steve’s illustration: while he (together with his coworkers) introduced an approach to vacations that would encourage employees to have some rest, the change would not be particularly effective if the managers had proceeded to stick to the previous methods and informally discourage resting in employees. However, when conducting their change, Steve took this factor into account and undertook the actions that would help to reduce this barrier – in other words, the actions that would eventually remove the norm of disrespecting the employees’ rights and need to rest. As a result, his company succeeded in modifying the organizational culture to the point where it could support the new approach to vacations.\n\n‘As I said, we fought tooth and nail,’ says Steve. ‘There were a lot of arguments, especially from the higher-ups. But at the core of the dilemma was this failure to understand that people don’t work that way – humans need rest.’\n\n‘Humans are not machines,’ I agree.\n\n‘See,’ he says, ‘I am fine with the notion that humans are a resource or a form of equipment because it can help us to explain what is wrong with this mindset. You can’t expect, say, a computer to work without some source of energy; you won’t be mad at your computer if it does not work without energy. But with humans? We are constantly mad that they won’t work in insecure environments or for a small fee or under immense stress. The point is that a secure environment, decent salary, rest, basic respect – those are the conditions necessary to keep this particular piece of equipment running. But, boy, does it take some effort to make some people recognize this fact.’\n\nAs shown by the research on the topic, it does take some effort to change the culture (Gover et al., 2015). However, in certain instances it is necessary. Come to think of it, how often do you encounter harmful beliefs at your workplace? The first things that come to my mind are bigotry, disrespect toward low-ranking employees, and, yes, expecting people to work like machines until they break. Bringing such perspectives down would do wonders to our stress levels I think, and Steve’s example will always serve as inspiration for me.\n\nParental Leave: The US Perspective\n\n‘If we are talking about a work-and-life balance, we need to discuss paternity leave,’ Monica tells me using a very strict tone. I am quick to agree; it seems to be a critical topic, especially for the US, as far as I know. Monica is a 37-year-old HR manager who has been working for the same company in the maritime industry for the past eleven years, and she claims that she has many stories to tell.\n\nMonica proceeds somewhat patronizingly to explain that the US is the only developed country that has no paid maternity leaves. ‘There is no OECD country that would not have a paid parental leave of at least 12 weeks. But the US does not offer the same option.’\n\nMonica is correct; I checked it on the website of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), which unites developed countries and reports important information about its members. According to the OECD (2016), the US is the only member of this organization that does not provide paid parental leaves (the days off that a mother or father can take to care for their newborn).\n\nThe approach to parental leaves is very different across nations; for instance, while every other OECD country offers maternal leaves, not all of them have paternal ones. In other words, fathers might not be eligible for staying at home with their children for some of the OECD members. Furthermore, some states, including Estonia, Poland, and Mexico pay 100% of the parents’ salaries throughout parental leaves, but other ones offer a part of that sum or pay different sums during different periods of leaves. The length of parental leave also varies; some countries offer several years of paid leave while others make a few weeks available. An average paid maternity leave in the OECD consists of 37 weeks. However, for the US mothers and fathers, none of that is possible.\n\n‘You have to understand that it is very important,’ explains Monica. ‘Mothers need time off not only to get better after childbirth – although that is crucial as well – but also to take care of newborns who are particularly vulnerable and in need of attention. As it is, though, if a mother cannot afford to stay at home, she has to leave her child and get back to work. It can cause significant stress, especially if this woman is not yet recovered after giving birth.’\n\nMonica highlights the fact that the poorer women are the ones to take the brunt of this inefficient system, pointing out that socioeconomic inequalities make the situation even more unpleasant. A relatively wealthy mother can afford to stay with a baby for longer, but for a poorer one, to do the same would be a luxury that she cannot pay for. Furthermore, according to Monica, many women have to get to work sooner even though – or because – their children have health problems.\n\n‘Children who are weaker and more prone to sickness need their mothers to be with them. Logically, a woman would rather stay at home and care for children. But poorer women may simply not have the option to claim that luxury. I know several women who had their babies born prematurely but could not afford to stay at the hospital … even though they were extremely worried about their child’s well-being. Can you imagine how stressful that is?’\n\nAll the descriptions of maternal leaves in the OECD countries refer to the requirements that are mandated by the law. In other words, an individual organization might offer improved benefits for mothers and fathers in different countries, and the same is true for the US: particular states or organizations may be more considerate with their working mothers. However, since the government does not mandate any benefits in the US, parents who work in the country are not guaranteed to have any paid leaves. That aspect puts parents at a disadvantage. As Monica insists, American parents typically do not get those benefits and have to use unpaid leaves instead.\n\nIn addition to her discussion of socioeconomic differences between various groups of parents, Monica notes the lack of fathers’ engagement. According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (2018), women in the US are still underpaid when compared to men; for instance, in 2016, the weekly earnings of women amounted to only 82% of those of men. Annual earnings came even shorter at 80.5% and were greater for women with children (Sheth et al., 2018). One of the potential causes for that, as I have mentioned, is the increased demand for women to focus on the family part of their work-life balance. In the case of unpaid maternity leaves, the situation is very similar. In the US, women have to spend money on unpaid leaves to get some rest after childbirth and take care of their newborn while men are not expected to and sometimes cannot afford to do the same.\n\n‘We talk about the way women’s reduced pay is often affected by them being loaded with housework and with caring for children. We talk about the way this issue perpetuates gender inequality. But what do we do to change that?’ Monica inquires. ‘Paid paternity leave could help.’\n\nIn the US, many fathers cannot contribute because both parents might not be able to take unpaid leaves and days off simultaneously without getting into some serious financial trouble. The problem is present in many OECD countries as well: maternity leaves are typically longer than paternity ones, and in general, many nations do not even consider offering the latter at all. OECD (2016) specifically points out that, even in the countries that offer paternity leaves, they are not commonly used. The popular misconception that children are the responsibility of women prevents men from actively engaging with their newly born children. Either way, the imbalance is prominent, and it results in increased concerns and the unshared responsibility for women, which means additional stressors for them.\n\n‘On the other hand,’ proceeds Monica, ‘fathers might want to help. We had a fair share of stories here when fathers wanted or even needed to help – say, because their wives had complications after birth, which is not that uncommon, you know, unfortunately – but we could offer them only a few workable options. A lot of people cannot afford a nanny. A lot of people cannot ask a grandma or someone else to help. A lot of people need to be paid parental leaves,’ she adds with an air of finality.\n\nMonica has many personal stories to discuss, but in general, her argument boils down to one simple statement: without paid parental leaves, stress levels in the maritime industry can become a problem. Some of the issues that she connected to the lack of paid leaves for new parents included the lack of life-work balance, the need to return to work soon after giving birth, the lack of fathers’ support, and the fact that some parents are forced to use up all their days off after childbirth.\n\n‘They do not get much rest then – if you have ever spent any time with a newborn, you know that it is not exactly a vacation,’ she highlights. ‘And afterward, they cannot afford to get some. If rest is required for a stress-free employee, the first thing to consider is parental leaves in addition to normal days off. Parental leave is not an opportunity to rest – mostly, it is an opportunity to be a good parent, to do your duties as a parent.’\n\nAs the literature on the topic has already established, the supposed failure of being a parent is one of the most problematic stressors experienced by employees; it is even more prominent than perceived or actual failures in doing one’s job (Britt & Jex, 2015). Consequently, the discussion loops back to role conflicts and responsibilities that cause occupational stress: the lack of paid parental leave is connected to at least a couple of them, which shows just how essential it is for many American workers.\n\nThe position of the US is not truly unique: it is not the only country in the world that has not introduced paid leaves for its new parents. However, it is the only developed country to have such a shortcoming, which opens a unique opportunity for it: the US can use the experience of other developed countries to change this situation and introduce a piece of legislation that would support employees in their attempt to be good parents. President Trump’s budget of 2018 made use of this opportunity, and they proposed some provisions that would establish state-supported parental leaves with the rationale that this change would help to support families and children (Office of Management and Budget, 2017). Unfortunately, the proposition was criticized because of the inefficiencies of the developed system and worries about the ability of states to support it (National Employment Law Project, 2018). In the meantime, individual organizations can make their propositions for their employees, but according to Monica, it is not a very common plan.\n\n‘I have been fighting tooth and nail for mothers here, and we do have somewhat sympathetic management, but that is not a solution. The more I look at our situation, the more I think that we need to make businesses accept a simple fact that parental leaves are necessary. And that can only be achieved by the government.’\n\nThis book is not here to start any revolutions in the field of US parental leaves policies. I just thought that it could be a remarkable thing to consider for employees and, especially, employers. Meanwhile, let us take a look at the other country that I had experience with and discuss the approach to parental leaves that Singapore has.\n\nSingapore and parental leaves\n\nSingapore is not a part of the OECD, but the country has both maternal and paternal leaves. There are a few simple rules on who is eligible for those, which make up a relatively complex system. I will not tire you with all the details, but general principles seem to be interesting and of importance for our topic. Firstly, a parent who wants a parental leave must have worked at least three months before taking one. Secondly, an employer needs to be aware of an employee’s decision to take parental leave at least one week before the event. These conditions make perfect sense since parental leave is paid by an employer (although the government provides partial reimbursements).\n\nHowever, more factors are also significant: the coverage, the citizenship of a child, and the number of children that you have. The government only pays maternity leaves for mothers with children who are citizens of Singapore. Employers do not have to pay for maternity leaves after the second child, although they still can offer such benefits if they choose to. Also, a mother of a child who is a Singapore citizen can have up to 16 weeks of paid leave while that of a child who is not a citizen can have 8 weeks of paid leave and additional 4 weeks of unpaid leave. As for unpaid infant care leaves, shared parental leaves, and paternal leaves, they are only available for the children who are citizens, and they are generally shorter than maternal ones. A father of a Singapore citizen, for example, can take up to two paid weeks of paternity leave. Overall, the system is not very simple, and there are a lot of factors to be considered, but the website of the government of Singapore is there to help a confused mother or father to determine if they are eligible.\n\nTo sum up, there are a few conditions that can be especially important for the non-native workforce, which, as you probably remember, is very widely employed in the maritime industry of Singapore. I was interested in checking how the system works in practice. A few of my interviewees were hopeful about parental leaves, pointing out that it is a recent development.\n\n‘I find that it is still a work in progress,’ Rebecca, a finance consultant, states. ‘We’ve recently introduced it, and we are still learning. Did you know, the mother’s entitlement to paid leave is no longer connected to being lawfully married to anyone? I think it’s awesome! We are getting the hang of it.’\n\nAccording to Rebecca, as gender equality progresses all over the world, the attitudes toward women change for the best. Before 2017, women who were not married to the father of their child received reduced support (only 8 paid weeks at best – if a baby qualified as a citizen) and were entitled to only 12 weeks of total leave (4 of them unpaid). Today, the Ministry of Manpower (2018) points out that marriage does not matter anymore; even unmarried mothers can have up to 16 weeks of paid leave.\n\n‘I think that it was a perfect example of double standards and was, well, discriminatory,’ Rebecca points out. ‘Discrimination is stress-inducing, right?’\n\nIndeed, discrimination, for example, when it is associated with moral judgments against women’s sexuality, can be stress-inducing. On top of that, unmarried women are not any less likely to experience stress and issues related to childbirth. The new approach to maternity leaves promotes equality and gives women in Singapore an improved opportunity for taking care of their children.\n\nHowever, despite enthusiasm about having parental leaves (and the concern for their American counterparts), my Singapore interviewees also had a lot of complaints.\n\n‘I am grateful for the time that we are given,’ says Rebecca, ‘But a couple of months is not that much. Three or four months are better, of course, but I’d love to have more because it is so scary to leave a four-month-old baby to another’s care. Stressful, yes, using your words – it is stressful. A year would have been so much better – I think some countries offer you a year, right?’\n\n‘I disagree that it is just about leaving your child,’ another mother notes. ‘I think that there is a much more important problem: young children need regular visits to doctors and a lot of care. I believe being absent during the first year of your child’s life is problematic because you cannot fulfill your obligations as a parent. This kind of failure is especially damning.’\n\n‘I think that the leave for fathers is rather short,’ Khim points out, although she is a little hesitant to admit it. ‘I understand the reasoning, I suppose, but it seems restrictive to me because we can’t have my husband stay at home, even though both of us want that. Mostly, I worry about my position, and I think that the attitudes of my boss are not going to get better if I leave work for a couple of months. That is one of the main reasons why I hesitate to have children: I think that my career might be damaged as a result.’\n\nAs we have noted before, the maritime industry is a male-dominated one. This fact suggests that parental leaves may be of greater interest to this book, but on the other hand, it also has a great impact on the job security of young mothers, which is a major stress-related concern. Women in the maritime industry can encounter sexism and hostility from employers, and as suggested by Khim, the possibility of female workers to have paid parental leaves – disappearing from the workplace for a few weeks while being financially supported by their company – makes them less desirable as employees. Khim believes that she has to make a greater effort to keep her job as compared to her male coworkers, which can be partially attributed to the fact that her employer might be incredibly unwilling to pay for her maternity leave. According to Khim, the reimbursements do not necessarily cover all employers’ expenses (which is true), and, accordingly, employers have an incentive not to promote this practice. Khim’s opinion is that, even though Singapore parents are entitled to parental leaves, they might still not get one because of a variety of concerns.\n\n‘I know for a fact that there are cases when employers find the means of discouraging people from taking parental leaves,’ reports Gemi, who is a financial manager, supporting Khim’s suspicions. ‘Note, it is illegal, but it is difficult to prove, especially when the prohibition is implicit. I also think that it is stressful. A woman might know that she has the right to maternity leave, but if her employer is bent on not letting it happen, she can only get one through the court. Do you think that a pregnant woman or a woman with a recently born baby is going to have the time and strength to go to courts?’\n\nIn both the US and Singapore, parental leaves are a source of stress, even though the reasons for this stress are different. While in the US, parents are mostly concerned about money and time, in Singapore, parents are worried about their ability to get their legally-protected leave without causing much damage to their career. Multiple sources of stress are observed: the interviewees report worrying about their spouses (mostly wives) and children and feeling that they need to perform their parental and spousal duties. Moreover, they are also concerned about job opportunities and relationships with their superiors. Either way, work-life balance crises appear to be most prominent when newborns are concerned.\n\nReasons for and against parental leaves\n\nMy interviewees noted a few reasons for and against parental leaves. I was fortunate to ask Steve about this topic, wondering if his organization was also advanced enough to offer this type of paid leaves to its employees. When explaining the situation, Steve made a very good point:\n\n‘From what I know, businesses, especially small ones, are very hesitant when maternity leaves are considered. A governmental mandate could resolve the issue, sure, but we need to pass such a bill first. And many people would be against it, you know?’\n\nDespite their very modern approach to paid leaves, Steve’s company does not offer paid maternity leaves – at least, not directly and not in this phrasing.\n\n‘We find solutions, and we do support the mothers who work for us,’ he insists. ‘But officially… no, we do not have maternity leaves and not paternity ones.’\n\nAs pointed out by Steve, parental leaves are not cheap, especially if they are paid by employers. In Singapore, for example, the government reimburses the payments, yes, but there is a lot of fine print to this stipulation: for instance, there are maximum reimbursements, even though employers are still obligated to pay full wages to the mothers who take their leave (Ministry of Manpower, 2018).\n\nIf maternity leave is considered from the perspective of the immediate financial gain or loss, it can be daunting indeed, especially for businesses. Additionally, even if the government is the one to pay the bills, its funds are formed by taxes, that is, by taxpayers. Thus, a government that is used not to provide parental leaves will need to balance its budget very carefully. That is what one of the objections to President Trump’s proposals related to parental leaves consists of: American citizens do not consider the proposed budget to be capable of supporting parental leaves and anticipate an increase in taxes. Thus, financial concerns are not just those of employers; average taxpayers might also be worried, even though they can also be interested in the idea of parental leaves. However, the US might not be the best setting in which to consider the actual effects that parental leaves are likely to have. Instead, the real-life experience of Singapore can be revised.\n\n‘Do parental leaves endanger your business?’ I ask Wong, a middle manager in a shipbuilding company in Singapore. He is quick to assure me that it is not too big of a problem.\n\n‘Not really, no. I understand what you mean – there are more than a few ways in which it can be problematic.’\n\n‘First, the payments,’ I suggest, mindful of Steve’s comments.\n\n‘Yes, although we do not pay all of it. It’s not my field of expertise, actually, but I know for sure that we do not pay all of it, and there are reimbursement practices, so it is not that big of a problem.’\n\nWong cannot speak for all of Singapore, but according to him, parental leaves do not differ from any other leaves from the perspective of immediate financial losses. The manager also admits that employees need their rest to achieve a work-life balance. However, there is another feature of parental leaves that sets it apart from other types of days off the duration.\n\n‘Personally,’ Wong states, ‘I am always more worried about losing my workers for some time – as well as finding some kind of replacement for them while they are gone. It can be a real problem in some cases.’\n\nAccording to the legislation of Singapore, expecting and new mothers cannot be fired (Ministry of Manpower, 2018). This article was introduced to prevent employers from avoiding the problems and financial losses of maternity leaves by simply finding a permanent replacement while leaving the fired woman in a vulnerable state without financial protection. However, as pointed out by Wong, finding a replacement for a relatively short duration is more difficult than finding a permanent one: after all, most employees prefer some kind of permanence and stability when looking for a job.\n\n‘There are solutions like dividing the workload between the remaining employees or outsourcing, but these are not always applicable,’ Wong notes. ‘However… well, it is worth it. I would rather want a woman who had her rest and got to spend some time with the baby. I think we owe our mothers that much.’\n\nWong appears to be a passionate supporter of parental leaves, even though he focuses on maternity ones. This perspective reminds me of another issue that has been mentioned by some of my Singaporean interviewees. As the previous arguments have shown, maternity leaves can be problematic. Does that sound like a reason to avoid hiring women?\n\n‘I worry that with maternal leaves, businesses might start finding ways not to employ American women. The maritime industry is already not the most… women-friendly one. At least in my experience,’ Steve adds. ‘It is a very complex topic indeed.’\n\nWong is not happy to admit it, but he also finds that the maritime industry does not need another reason not to employ women.\n\n‘It’s not the only reason, I suppose. We do not have that many women anyway, it’s cultural, I think. But I would not be surprised if someone looking for the ways not to… employs a woman, among other things, to avoid paying maternity leaves.’\n\nSingapore has been promoting women’s rights, but analysts acknowledge the fact that female representation in certain industries and, especially in leadership positions, remains lacking, which is reflected in a wage gap (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2018). The fact that, in Singapore, as well as all over the world, women in the maritime industry remain underrepresented is important for the topic of maternity leaves. After all, at least in the countries where they are offered, they might contribute to the problem, right? Well, Rebecca disagrees.\n\n‘The reason why women are underemployed is discrimination, plain and simple. And if anyone says that maternity leaves may cause women’s underemployment, they are wrong. Discrimination is a stressful cause. Parenting being delegated to women is the cause. Not a measure meant to provide mothers – and fathers – with the opportunity to take care of newborns.’\n\nShe does acknowledge that the outcome is the same: if maternity leave is introduced in the US, increased exclusion of women from the workforce is not out of the question.\n\n‘Still, know that not hiring a woman just because she is a woman is illegal in Singapore. We frown upon discrimination,’ Wong insists. ‘Also, you cannot fire a pregnant woman, and in general, we have laws in place to protect them.’\n\n‘Do they work?’\n\n‘I think they do. But I can also imagine a situation in which they would not.’\n\nNow, this discussion paints a bleak picture, and I feel compelled to point out that not every employer tries to prevent a mother from getting her state-guaranteed leaves. After all, they are people; they may also have kids, and, as Michael has told us, they might also be hard-pressed to find the time to spend with their family. They can be very understanding. Reports have been made about the situations in which organizations offer extended maternity leaves. According to Kok Xing Hui (2017), PrimeStaff, which is a recruitment company in Singapore, saw a decrease of 50% in the turnover rate among the mothers who it employed after an increase of maternity leave to 18 weeks. Another company chose to extend the paternal leave to three weeks, and the practice proved to be of interest to young fathers. The company did not disclose the costs and tangible benefits of the practice, but its spokeswoman pointed it out that the organization wanted intangible benefits: it tried to allow its employees to spend time with their families, which, from her perspective, makes them “very motivated.”\n\n‘I think that social policies – like maternity leave – are a good way to distinguish your organization from other ones,’ Rebecca points out. ‘Organizations also need to be competitive! I guess that it is not true for all positions, but in those that rely on highly educated, highly experienced human resources, being competitive is the key to attracting the best specialists.’\n\nWong agrees with this idea and points out that maternity leaves are an excellent strategy in attracting and retaining female workers while reducing levels of stress for them:\n\n‘Women want children, as a rule. If I am not going to provide them with maternity leaves, they might find another company. Alternatively, they will have a very stressful first year with their baby, which will cause troubles one way or another.’\n\nHowever, the interviewees who I have managed to recruit for this book did not experience extended parental leaves themselves. They admit that the maritime industry in Singapore does not rely on female workers, which might explain the lack of such practice in their workplaces.\n\nWhen concluding my interview with Steve, we came to an interesting conclusion: the situation with parental leaves is identical to that with any other stress-reducing approach. Parental leaves are an investment without direct, visible returns which are motivated by certain moral arguments as much as they are motivated by potential positive outcomes for a company. They are also in place to avoid negative outcomes, including those related to employee stress. As a result, unless a company is interested in supporting its employees and improving their quality of life, parental leaves can seem daunting and cause some employers and other taxpayers to avoid passing relevant legislation or employ the people who might want to demand a parental leave. However, this approach to employees is outdated. It might work for an employer who is fine with having stressed-out and low-performing employees and high turnover rates. It might work for a quick cash-in, but the maritime industry is not made for quick cash-ins. Apart from being morally problematic, this approach is not sustainable, especially in the maritime industry which relies on highly experienced and stress-free workers. Thus, parental leaves – just like any other stress-reducing method – are the point where the moral obligations of an employer meet the bottom line.\n\nThe role of the manager\n\nWhen discussing the role of a manager in handling the problem of parental leaves, it is necessary to keep in mind that the government provides the general guidelines (if any) on the issue. As a result, while it is important to keep the practices legal, the particular solution to the question of how much time off should new parents be provided can be customized depending on a company or even its specific departments. Some areas that employ young people who are likely to get a child may indeed benefit greatly from implementing a liberal paternal leave policy, but other ones that mostly employ older people might not experience a similar need. Additionally, it is necessary to take into account the fact that parental leaves, especially when not supported by the government, are expensive. As a result, when making decisions about parental leaves, customized solutions are the only way to succeed.\n\nHowever, certain general factors can still be considered. First of all, parental leaves are important; this fact is supported by the very limited number of countries that do not support parental leaves. The practice may be expensive, but it is a crucial aspect of ensuring the ability of employees to balance their work and life. The reports of the employees prove that they are very interested in having appropriate options and that their absence is a source of concern and stress. In turn, the managers support the notion due to its ability to appease employees and reduce their stress. Thus, overlooking this opportunity to assist employees in managing work-and-life balance and, as a result, reduce workplace stress is not wise.\n\nSecond, it is not a good idea to refuse to acknowledge the value of paternal leaves, that is, the options for fathers. The experience of the OECD (2016), as well as Singapore, shows that the need for fathers to spend time with their newborns is often considered to be less significant than that of a mother even by governments: paid paternal leaves are often shorter than maternal ones. Also, OECD (2016) reports that fathers can be reluctant to take parental leaves, which may be attributed to several cultural and economic reasons. The general outcome of this tendency that OECD (2016) warns about is the damage to women’s careers, but it should be acknowledged that fathers may still have a need or wish to take care of their baby. As a result, to promote equality and reduce workplace stress, a manager needs to pay attention to the development of paternal leaves options.\n\nAlso, it should be noted that despite the official presence of parental leaves, parents may still feel uncertain about using them. Going back to the Singapore experience of using advanced maternal and paternal leaves, an important issue reported by Hui (2017) is that employees might feel penalized for using them, which can prevent both the employees and employers from enjoying the benefits of those policies. As pointed out by a CEO from Singapore, managers are instrumental in avoiding this, in particular, due to their part in ensuring the working communication between employees and employers. Managers would be expected to acknowledge and support the right of parents to parental leave, communicate the accurate information about their company’s policies to both employees and other managers, and enable feedback options that will ensure the protection of this right. Thus, the role of managers in supporting the work-life balance of their employees through parental leaves is crucial.\n\nOther Methods of Managing Work-Life Balance\n\nThere are some relatively common perspectives on how work-life balance should be managed. A very typical method can be termed as “family-friendly benefits,” which is typically concerned with empowering employees to perform their family duties or ensuring that their job does not have too noticeable detrimental effects on their personal life. Parental leaves are among them, but other options can also be considered. A common example is a flexible schedule; it can be employed, for instance, by a person who needs to combine studies and work. On the other hand, a solution that has been designed specifically for parents is daycare. It can be especially helpful for single parents. Thus, family-friendly benefits are a set of rather diverse interventions that are tailored to the specific needs of employees; they are particularly employee-friendly.\n\nAnother approach that is highlighted by Britt and Jex (2015) as the major achievement in the field is the idea of viewing a work-life balance in a more positive light. Indeed, do the two parts of this balance have to conflict? Britt and Jex (2015) describe the notion of work-family facilitation, in which the two parts of our life can become beneficial for each other rather than pernicious. A good example is an emotional boost that a person can have from some quality time with the family: it can result in a person’s good mood, which, in turn, can be favorable for performance.\n\n‘I do like Fridays because I have more time to spend with my family this day, it is a kind of refreshing for me,’ explains Sonia while discussing her vision of work-life balance. ‘My life is full of stress, but I need some time to relax and think about something else.’\n\nSimilarly, gaining a promotion or generally securing an appropriate salary is a good way of ensuring the well-being of one’s family. Britt and Jex (2015) report that not very extensive research on the topic can still be used to illustrate the idea that people who perceive their family and work life as mutually beneficial and not conflicting are more likely to report improved well-being, which makes this type of work-life balance a safeguard against stress. However, the approach is still new and in need of more detailed research, especially with a focus on achieving this positive balance.\n\nThe role of the manager\n\nWhile the above-presented solutions all hinge on the intervention of a manager, it should be noted that some general principles are not connected to specific strategies, but which can help a manager to carry them out successfully. First, a manager must respect the fact that their employees have a life outside of the workplace. While this statement seems apparent and simple, many managers fail to do so, implicitly or explicitly demanding that their employees dedicate more time and effort than reasonable to their workplace responsibilities. Apart from that, Mike’s example also shows that they do not necessarily do it consciously; if a company does not incorporate the respect towards employees’ time in its culture, the idea might not even come to their minds. Therefore, making the conscious effort to acknowledge this simple truth is important. However, Britt and Jex (2015) note that this rule does not imply that a manager cannot make demands and cannot occasionally intrude during non-working hours (for example, by contacting an employee with an urgent message while they are already at home). They only emphasize the fact that this kind of behavior can be a justifiable exclusion, not the rule.\n\nAdditionally, since Britt and Jex (2015) appear to be very interested in leading by example, they also recommend doing precisely that: striving to find a balance between work and life for oneself. As Mike confessed, even managers can experience difficulties in this regard, and the example of a workaholic manager who does not dedicate much time to their family may cause their employees to assume that they are expected to demonstrate similar dedication. On the other hand, a manager who respects the boundaries between their own life and work can set the correct example (at least, in terms of stress and well-being) and promote healthy attitudes to work. Also, while learning to respect themselves and balance their work and life, a manager is likely to gain a better understanding of this process. As a result of being intimately familiar with the situation, they will be better equipped to help others achieve the same.\n\nSome Concluding Thoughts\n\nCongratulations, you made it to the end of this section! Now, it can do us some good to recap. As you have probably noticed, to make suggestions for the maritime industry, I did have to pick pretty diverse sources, and most of them, unfortunately, were not focused on the maritime industry. I think that it is a shame; my workplace is unique in more ways than one, and some of them are stress-inducing. However, I have to admit that the existing literature can provide advice, which can be applied to the maritime industry.\n\nWhat are the main conclusions we can come to? First, there is a general guideline on how to manage stress: you can prevent it, you can empower employees (or just yourself) to deal with it, and you can deal with the outcomes. If you want more specific solutions, you may need to do some research both into your company and what is commonly done to resolve your problem; tailored solutions are better than generic ones and are more feasible. Also, you need to make sure that the solution works: track it, check its outcomes, and decide if it is worth keeping.\n\nManagers are the ones who are going to be held accountable for stress levels at work; they are also the ones who have the resources and authority to make changes happen. However, it is also apparent that an individual employee can contribute; to name just a few options, they can report issues, propose ideas, or combat the negative elements of a particularly toxic organizational culture. Workplace stress levels are like workplace security (which is also connected to stress): everybody can have an impact, and we can make sure that it is a positive one.\n\nStress is complex, and resolving it is a similarly complex endeavor, which is why it is probably good that it can intersect with things like safety concerns or effective management. Indeed, you can simultaneously review your safety policy and make your workplace less stress-prone. However, occupational stress is also a fact of our life, and we cannot help but search for the means of dealing with it. Hopefully, this book has provided you with some helpful advice and inspirational stories on the matter, and if not, you know the drill: identify the problem and start your research! And do not be afraid to improvise; there is nothing better than a creative solution made specifically for your workplace.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe discussion of stress is, well, a stressful one. When writing this book, I would often find the topics that it covered rather difficult to handle, and I think that a few of my interviewees felt the same. This theme forced me to describe so many problems that even I felt upset by them. I hoped that the second section of the book would be more positive, but as you can see, it required delving deeper into the problems I had mentioned at the beginning. Occupational stress is a problem, or, at least, it is likely to be a problem if it is not managed well. This inherent nature of this topic must have affected what I had to say. However, I want to finish with a more positive outlook on stress, and I can do that by presenting you with a few thoughts that my interviewees wanted me to tell you about.\n\nRemember Steve, the one who knows how to force and manage change in an organization? He is probably one of the most optimistic people I have interviewed (possibly, because he had amazing experiment results to report), and he is not going to stop now.\n\n‘I think life is about change, and change is about improvement. Not naturally, I guess, but that is the beauty of it – in my workplace, I get to control the change, and I am going to make sure that it improves the well-being of my followers. Although my new change project is not related to stress, we are working to improve workplace communication, actually.’\n\nI was happy to tell him all I learned about good and bad management and how miscommunication can cause stressful situations, though, and he wholeheartedly agreed. After all, if there is a lesson I took out of this research, it is that stress is incredibly complex. Is there even a thing in the workplace that is not a potential stressor? At this point, it looks like virtually any improvement might reduce stress, and that is the silver lining to stress being widespread, is it not?\n\n‘I understand that any type of work is associated with the stress of this or that kind, we just cannot avoid it in our lives, but I believe that it is possible to learn how to handle it. My manager works hard to improve our working conditions, and it helps in more ways than one. On the one hand, it just makes my workplace better, and on the other hand, guess how happy I am to have such an awesome boss,’ states one of the respondents.\n\nI am also happy for her because that boss is, of course, Steve, and Steve is awesome. I am so grateful to him for allowing me to tell you a true story of success. I am glad that I was able to report some positive changes in the workplace but to be fair, that was not the only positive story I have heard.\n\n‘Oh, I had some training in coping with stress. The coach explained stuff about different types of stressors, and I think that helps to understand why it happens and how to deal with it. We also got a lot of info about coping strategies. I did not try all of them, but it turns out that jogging is great. That was the most helpful training I ever got, I think,’ told me another very empowered interviewee. And it is stories like these that make me believe that we really can make a difference.\n\nOne of the most inspiring things I heard was a few words that my anonymous Singaporean seafarer wanted me to hear. We were talking about the hardships of seafaring: being torn away from your family for extended periods, having to deal with the dangers of the sea, hard work and sleep issues, and so on. He agreed with some of my points, but when I tried to discuss the problems that many people experience because of the sea – like its noises or the instability brought by it – he told me that for him, it was not that much of a problem.\n\n‘I love the sea,’ he told me with a smile, ‘I love my job.’\n\nMy interviewee wanted to work as a seafarer since he was a child and long before he knew what the job was about.\n\n‘I honestly thought I would be able to go anywhere I want,’ he laughs, ‘but it was not too big a disappointment to learn that I’d be going where I am told to go. The sea is the same.’\n\nHe believes that another job is not “his” and, therefore, would be much less satisfying.\n\n‘I would not want another job, safer or quieter perhaps …,’ he claims, ‘say, being cooped up in an office all the time – I would not manage that. Being cooped up but in the sea is so much better.’\n\nHe believes that another job, especially one where he would be “cooped up,” would be significantly more stress-inducing specifically for him. Some people might find the sea daunting or unpleasant, but for him, it offers an opportunity to do precisely what he wants.\n\nNow, I did not manage to find research on the way doing your favorite job affects your stress levels. I guess, nobody came up with the idea of researching the impact of dream jobs on stress, and that is a shame; probably, “dream job” is too elusive as a concept and too unscientific as a term. However, what is researched rather extensively is the impact of job satisfaction on several things, and that factor does matter. The more satisfied you are with your job, the less likely you are to be stressed. The opposite is also apparently accurate: if you are doing something that you do not want to do, you might get stressed. It is not too much of a stretch to assume that choosing a job you like can become another level of protection from stress. And I met a lot of people who are happy to be where they are.\n\n‘I think I have been dreaming about the sea since my childhood, although my first ship experience was less than ideal. Yes, I got seasick and everything,’ I was told. ‘But it was thrilling anyway, the sea, and so, so beautiful. I am not sick anymore, and I am stressed by my work sometimes, sure, but I chose this job, and I do not think I regret my choice.’\n\nAlso, if you like your organization, that is a good factor as well.\n\n‘I am sure that all performance assessments and supervisors’ questionnaires, you know, indicate a high level of my commitment to my organization, and it’s true,’ told me one of the interviewees with a grin. ‘My company treats us all with respect, so it deserves some respect back. The only problem we have is that sometimes the workload is too much, but that is because we don’t have enough workforce right now; I’m certain that will change soon. Maybe, my work is stressful, yeah, but I can manage this stress to receive real satisfaction from what I am doing here.’\n\n‘I love me some challenge,’ grins another interviewee unapologetically. ‘And that is precisely what I get here, so it’s all perfectly fine in my book.’\n\nI noticed that a lot of people I talked to have a love for their job which helps them in overcoming struggles. Khim, who fights a mostly winning battle against her boss, who is not particularly happy to have her there, does not leave because she loves her job. She has chosen a field of work that she loves and a company she thinks is good for her, and she wants to become successful in it. Steve adores his company, his department, his successful experiment, and all of his employees (followers, he calls them) who made it possible. It is apparent that Monica is ridiculously protective of her department; at the very least, she loves the people she works with, and she is willing to fight battles for them if needed. Together with my humble self, we are in the place where we want to be, and that must make our lives way easier.\n\nThat said, we are not oblivious to the issues that our organizations face. Our investment in our work just might be the reason why we want to see some changes, and a few of us do that: we promote change. We can attempt to make this place more welcoming for newcomers and more comfortable for ourselves. And one way of achieving it is making sure that the problem of workplace stress in the maritime industry is recognized and addressed.\n\nReferences\n\nAlvesson, M., & Sveningsson, S. (2015).

      "Business Ethics and Law Relationships in Examples Essay\n\nWhat is the relationship between ethics and law?\n\nEthics is part of moral philosophy that addresses issues to do with morality. As human beings, we often do we ask ourselves what is good and what is considered evil in today’s society. Fundamentally, ethics is not universal, but situational and dependent on certain types of culture that is considered wrong in Japan may be a well-accepted norm in American society. For example, in certain parts of the world marrying a girl who hasn’t yet attained the majority age may be a norm, while in other parts, it may be considered a taboo. Both ethics and law may sometimes overlap, and what may be considered or perceived as ethical in some instances may be against the law, therefore, ethics and law are not the same things (Green, 10).\n\nThe law may be set by the government or society for some particular reasons but it does not imply that law is always right in distinguishing what is either good or evil. Ethics is simply both implicit and explicit therefore it gives an individual the right to think about what benefits, and detriment may arise as a result of his actions and how they impact not only him/her but also how it will impact the society at large.\n\nOn the other hand, the law is quite specific and rigid, unlike ethical and moral obligations. It is, therefore, good to comply with both the law and moral obligations, which are also called categorical imperatives and serve as the heart of ethics. There are some behaviors that human beings exhibit that is not against the law but on the other hand, they may be very repulsive, unfair, and unethical. Therefore, such a situation leads to a conflict between ethics and the law.\n\nIt, therefore, becomes the duty of an individual to wisely look at all existing alternatives and make a wise decision. But generally, moral principles often are the backbone and heart of ethics. When such a conflict arises, it becomes the duty of an individual to think objectively, respect the customs and culture of other people without compromising his/her own, think of his consequences not only as a part of himself but as part of the society.\n\nFurthermore, an individual should take look at all possible outcomes and ask himself the question, what kind of person is most likely to do such a thing and how would society embrace his action and therefore make his decision within well-known categorical imperatives (Green, 21).\n\nWhat is meant by ethical relativism?\n\nEthics is not only subjective but also relative. Ethical decisions do not only affect a person at an individual level but also affect the society and the immediate environment. Therefore, businesses should not be subjective because subjectivism is selfish and looks at benefits that can only benefit the direct owner of the business, businesses should therefore try and use ethical relativity because if a business carries out a business decision it is likely to affect the public that exists in the society (that is, the investors, customers, prospective customer and employees, media, government, society, competitors and so on).\n\nBusinesses are often compared to games because like games, the business has its own set of rules, rituals, and practices that govern its operations, furthermore, games also have regulations that must be adhered to, and so are a business. In other words, committing a vice in a game may be very costly, while committing a virtue may be of benefit to a business. By thinking that ethical rules and moral obligations of businesses are different from other rules that govern society business may often result in abusing the subject of morality by not attending to it seriously.\n\n“Made in the USA, Dumped…” Case Analysis\n\nThe issue of dumping sub-standard products in the developing world has become a major ethical issue for discussion. In today’s business environment, businesses operate with the sole aim of maximizing profits and reducing costs, without care for morality or humanity. When production errors occur, and products are found to be hazardous or defective for the market, rather than been disposed of they are sold off to unaware individuals mostly in lesser developed countries at a throwaway price, which is quite unfair.\n\nMorality is quite different from the law, morality is a sense of what is right or wrong; morality is a matter of one’s conscience. Although businesses may be driven by selfish ambitions, businessmen must operate with a clean conscience; it doesn’t make business sense for a product that has been found dangerous to human life and banned in the U.S.A, Europe, or Australia to continue selling in any part of the world.\n\nDoes such a move mean that the life of an American child or woman using contraceptives is more important than the life of an African or an Iraqi? It would therefore be right for the pajamas that were banned in a developed country by the consumer product safety commission since they contained the carcinogenic and kidney failure causing agents to be destroyed by the manufacturers in the first place.\n\nEven if the law has a blind spot and allows that the products can be sold in foreign countries, it is not ethical but an evil act to sell the products to other exporters who have the intentions of selling the products to other people, therefore, the innocent lives of the Iraqi’s who died and all those who were injured by the contaminated pajamas are on the heads of all those irresponsible and immoral manufacturers and distributors who were involved in the distribution of contaminated pajamas.\n\nThe same applies to A.H Robins Co of Dalkon that manufactures shield Intra-uterine, device which was proved dangerous but was later sold to a United States nongovernmental aid organization to be distributed to 42 countries. It is also wrong for a humanitarian company to go ahead and validate unethical and immoral practices by supplying defective and dangerous birth control devices that were known to cause uterine perforations, blood poisoning, and other complications.\n\nWhat does Solomon mean by the ‘myth of amoral business”?\n\nMany people have accused businesses of being selfish and greedy and putting profitability as their sole objective in business. Solomon believes that morality and ethics are a mirage for businesses, and therefore leading to the myth of moral business. Many times businesses hide behind the law and continue to carry out unethical and immoral acts. Solomon suggests that business people are somewhat selfish individuals, and therefore may ruin each other in the process of competition.\n\nSolomon further suggests that businessmen, especially those in the corporate world may often employ ruthless Darwinian principles such as survival for the fittest to justify their unethical and immoral behavior. Furthermore, many businessmen may often complain that ethics interfere with their business goals, therefore, implying that business and ethics do not go together.\n\nSolomon’s myth of morals is accurate and true, and now evident in today’s business society as businesses also go ahead to lobby against tough, and stringent rules and laws that the government wants to enforce to ensure ethical business operations go ahead. It has now become a must for the government to intervene due to bad ethical strategy for businesses to know that there are consequences for their behavior; government intervention also makes sure that businesses comply with these rules and laws that make businesses operate with a more ethically oriented approach.\n\nSolomon furthermore introduces the term ‘business scum’ to make it clear that the business world today operates in such a way that they seize an extra dollar from their consumers. Business is, therefore, scum because sometimes because the price of a good is not directly linked and related to the actual value of a good. Business managers are becoming more and more sales-oriented and, therefore, consequently, go the extra mile to maximize revenue streams at the expense of a consumer.\n\nThe principle of saving costs and maximizing revenues has become a backbone of the business society and consequently, businesses will exploit all avenues, for example, employing cheap, labor, and cheap inputs to save on costs. The existence of rules such as the bottom line is there to stop businesses from ethical misbehavior. Consumers need to be protected at unwanted costs furthermore, competition between industries needs to be regulated for a healthy business environment (Green, 79).\n\n“The A7D Affair” Case\n\nAircraft manufacturing is a delicate and sensitive process because the lives of many people will always depend on the safety measures that air manufacturers have installed on the aircraft. It, therefore, becomes necessary that manufacturers remain serious throughout the testing process and make sure that this process is not compromised. Goodrich hired a competitive workforce that included bright engineers and supervisors whose main duty was to come up with brakes for the LTV.\n\nBut instead of securing the interests of their customer and their company and conducting their duties with full disclosure, honesty, and ethics they instead betrayed and destroyed the reputation of the company.\n\nJohn Warren is the project engineer and highly experienced, had the duty to conduct his tests objectively, and ensure that they were a success before certifying the brakes. When Lawson found fundamental faults in the design and functioning of these brakes, he went ahead and reported his findings only to be ignored by both Sink and Warren. Warren’s only concern was that he already bragged of progress to LVT and wanted to finish in time and was, therefore, unwilling to pursue a five-disc braking system model. Sink, on the other hand, felt ashamed interfering with Warren because he was the one who had put him in charge and would therefore make him look bad.\n\nOn the other hand, Vandivier reported his concerns to his boss Gretzinger who was categorical that he would not be part of unethical behavior but later caved into Russell Lines’s demands after visiting his office fearing that he would be sacked. Vandivier and Lawson are the only individuals who showed an effort to bring to light any mischievous operations, while, on the other hand, Warren, Sink, Gretzinger, and Line were part of the falsification and, therefore, should face no leniency but the wrath of the law.\n\nAfter deciding that only Vandivier and Lawson may be entitled to some leniency then, the supervisors would probably receive the harshest form of punishment possible because they being part of leadership and entrusted to make decisions objectively, they went against the interest of both LVT and the company, the project engineer Warren should also face disciplinary measures available because he operated against his profession by performing substandard work.\n\nThe experiments of Milgrim about the “psychology of destructive obedience”\n\nMany individuals may have been horrified and still wonder about the holocaust that was carried out by the Nazis during Hitler’s reign and often would like to know whether it would occur again. Milgram believed that social and institutional forms of pressure to obey are normally reinforced by the fragmentation of knowledge and therefore it is most likely to occur in modern bureaucracy and large organizations.\n\nHe (Milgram) went ahead and conducted a series of experiments by administering doses of a shock to certain subjects to test his thesis of the psychology of destructive obedience. He found that individuals may be forced or obligated to carry out certain orders and tasks even if they do not know the reasons for doing so long as orders come from a hierarchy above them (Green 137).\n\nHis findings suggested that individuals were likely to take place in destructive behavior when there existed some lack of information especially peers were most likely to exert pressure on others into behaving in a certain way, it is because individuals often have the notion that those issuing orders be it a superior or peers normally have valid reasons behind their orders, and therefore the issues of ethics and morality may be ignored at such an instance.\n\nModern-day employees need to be fully informed and up-to-date. Knowledge is power, and empowerment is a key pillar of institutional performance and, therefore, employees often these days demand reasons behind decisions and may end up being psychologically demotivated if the information is withheld from them. If morality and ethics are to be sustained then companies and organizations should make efforts to supply all relevant information to their employees that are related to the decision making the process so that employees know what they are getting into and take a moral stand through their actions.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGreen, Arnold.

      "Lawsona City’s Taxation and Revenue Systems Essay\n\nThe implementation of taxation upon the population benefits many cities because it provides them with an additional source of income that can be used for development. Taking into account the fact that state and local revenue systems “depend on a greater variety of revenue sources (such as property taxes, income taxes, sales taxes, user charges, lotteries, and federal grants),” the use of taxation seems to be justified (Shafritz, Russell, & Borick, 2013, p. 489). Even though some cities do not have all of the mentioned revenue sources, they are to pay taxes to other entities. In the case of Lawsona, the same type of taxation is discussed. In order to identify whether it will benefit the city or not, it is significant to consider both the positive and negative influences of this change.\n\nThe implementation of taxes reveals that the leaders of Lawsona want to stimulate its growth and to turn it into a well-developed place that appeals to its residents. However, it is significant to realize what kind of sales tax is needed to reach expected goals to ensure that the community is properly funded. The population of the city may resist the implementation of this change because they do not understand the concept of taxation. Acknowledging that taxes will be used, many people start revealing their dissatisfaction because they believe that the leaders of the city want to make them pay more and do not care about their financial problems. Nevertheless, sales tax is used to build roads and support public schools, healthcare facilities, and fire departments, etc.\n\nDue to the implementation of sales tax in Lawsona, the city will be developed, and its neighborhoods will become safer. People are likely to have more opportunities to become officially employed. The salary of teachers is likely to increase, and schools can purchase new books. The emergency management employees are expected to be supported by the funds obtained due to this taxation as well, which can affect their ability to benefit the community positively.\n\nEven though the advantages of sales tax are undeniable, it can have adverse influences on the citizens who have low and middle income. These individuals are limited in their funds, and the necessity to pay more is likely to worsen their condition. In particular, the community can be hurt by the flat tax because it presupposes the necessity for all people to pay the same amount of money regardless of their financial state (Moreno, 2018). Unfortunately, many cities prefer using it because of the simplicity associated with its implementation. Moreover, it seems to be the fairest, as people are not discriminated against considering the amount of money that should be paid. However, this fact can be argued when focusing on the presence of both poor and wealthy residents for whom one and the same amount of money can have a different value. In addition to that, the mall may face a reduction in the number of its customers because of the low- and middle-income families will find another place for shopping. It is even possible that they will prefer making purchases in other cities, which means that the economy of Lawsona will be affected.\n\nThus, it can be concluded that the implementation of sales tax will have both positive and negative influences on the city. Nevertheless, it is better to focus on the advantages of this change because it can help Lawsona overcome a budget shortfall and provide more benefits for the citizens. The effects on low- and middle-income shoppers should be monitored so that additional interventions can be developed if needed.\n\nReferences\n\nMoreno, T. (2018). What is a flat tax income system?

      "Start-Ups and Legal Issues in North Carolina Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Discussion\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nStarting businesses is significant to entrepreneurs, though it involves processes associated with challenges and high level of commitment. Therefore, new businesses at the early stage require perseverance, hard work, and risking scarce resources (Hisrich, Peters & Dean, 2010).\n\nDiscussion\n\nNew businesses require permits from local authority, whereby owners are issued licenses that allow them commence business operations. However, issuances of licenses depend on the form of business that an entrepreneur intends to operate, and restrictions in areas where businesses will be operating. In addition, there are different forms of taxes imposed on businesses by government. In this case, businesses are required to make regular payments in form of taxes; thus, entrepreneurs should consult an attorney for appropriate guidelines at state level. However, at local level, entrepreneurs need to consult the local authority to acquire the guidelines regarding tax compliance.\n\nIt has been noted that, in North Carolina, license is not among requirements for starting new businesses. In fact, there are businesses in North Carolina that do not have any license. Nevertheless, there is need to acquire a license before engaging in any business operations; thus, entrepreneurs should consider acquiring tax compliance guidelines for their business structure. For instance, if business involves sales of merchandise, there is needed to acquire tax number for sales called “sales and use tax numbers.” Moreover, business with employees is supposed to register for both NC taxpaying number and Federal Employee Identification number.\n\nBusiness owner prepares to register his or her business using names derived from the business structure, and they can be required to incorporate the business through an attorney. Moreover, names should be unique, while businesses should be registered according to the form of ownership. Moreover, businesses are registered with register of deeds at the county level, and licenses are acquired, hence allowing these businesses to operate legally.\n\nForm of business ownership influences ways of accessing funds, management and taxes paid to the government (Hisrich, Peters & Dean, 2010). Appropriate form of business ownership for S&S Recycling Company is sole proprietorship. In fact, this form of business can be formed easily, and it will be trading on materials that are regarded as waste. In fact, purchasing cost for these materials is low, and this may result to an increased profit margins. According to the business proposal, it is seem like a single individual can have complete control over the business. Moreover, the business will incur low level of tax; thus, this will also ensure that there are high profit margins.\n\nHowever, there is significant risk associated with this form of business, and this may create perceptions that partnership is better form of business compared to sole proprietorship (Hisrich, Peters & Dean, 2010). Moreover, partnership helps in reducing impact of loss suffered by business owners. In fact, there are significant costs that would be associated with starting and co-coordinating garbage correction, and this would reduce level of profitability.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, at the early stage of businesses, owners should focus on meeting business management requirements. Eventually, as an enterprise grow, it becomes difficult for the owner to manage entire business operations; this leads to need for hiring qualified personnel to oversee some operations. Furthermore, with continuous business growth, the company will expand to accommodate chief executive officer, chief operation officer, chief financial officer, chief marketing officer and chief technology officer.\n\nReference\n\nHisrich, M., Peters, M. & Dean S.

      "Accommodation and Exposure Therapy for Couples Report (Assessment)\n\nAbstract\n\nThis paper looks at the possible methods of solving problems that couples go through in their marriages. It uses Robert and Sophia’s situation to contextualize issues that couples face and their possible solutions. In addition to the case study, the paper uses eight sources to back the arguments. The study shows that most problems that couples face are a result of OCD, and goes further to advocate the Accommodation Therapy and the Exposure Therapy as the best solutions to problems among couples.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Family System proposes the division of the mind into three sub-categories. The founders of this theory called these parts, the managers, exiles, and firefighters. Each of these parts plays a role in the formation of the self. The most problematic part is the exile, which entails traumas, pains, and humiliations from an individuals’ childhood. The firefighters and managers prevent exile problems from disturbing an individual (Yahav, 2002).\n\nIn the case of Robert and Sophia, they both have burdens from their childhood. Robert is antisocial because of the alienation he underwent while growing up while Sophia experiences a trauma because her uncle raped her.\n\nDuring my first interaction with the couple, I will ask them to talk about their past lives. I will create an environment that will make them talk freely. Talking about themselves will enable me to detect their tones and moods when they mention certain events about their past lives. These elements of their will expose their burdens. I will then talk to them and convince them to stop keeping their painful experiences within themselves. An intensive talk will serve to make their protectors release the exiles they hold and take up new and better responsibilities.\n\nUsing the DSM-5 diagnostic system\n\nIn handling Robert and Sophia’s case, I will apply the Relationship Distress with Spouse or Intimate Partner approach. The two have poor conflict resolution skills and exhibit dysfunction in behavior, cognitive, and emotional faculties. They frequently quarrel and even fight. In addition, Robert’s behavior has changed drastically. He has an extra-marital affair and does not talk openly to his wife. Sophia, on the other hand, experiences stress due to her husband’s infidelity. The DSM-5 proposes the use of the Relationship Distress with Spouse or Intimate Partner approach in dealing with such symptoms (APA, 2013).\n\nAssessment, Diagnosis, and Treatment of a Couple or Family\n\nSocio-cultural factors\n\nRobert’s unsatisfied childhood needs are responsible for his status. The lack of brothers or sisters and his alienation caused him social problems. He grew up with the fear of socializing with other people. In addition, he experiences fear that is natural and common among most men. According to Harmon et al., men naturally fear failure, criticism, and medication (Harmon, Audra, & Ginsburg, 2006).\n\nHe is afraid of talking about his problems because of his socialization. His culture has different expectations for men and women. Men do not talk about their problems with their wives. Robert is afraid that his wife will consider him a failure, and his colleagues will criticize him. Living in different countries has exposed him to different cultures. His new culture requires him to discuss issues with his wife. This acculturation causes him confusion.\n\nHis wife, on the other hand, is experiencing trauma because of her childhood experience. The trauma makes her oversensitive and hyperactive to Robert’s infidelity. She reacts violently because of her mental disorder. According to Abramowitz et al. (2013), Sophia’s obsession with her molestation causes anxiety, doubt, and avoidance. Sophia expects Robert to reassure him that he is ready to stay in the marriage. The need for reassurance is due to the compulsion that arises from the obsession with her childhood experience.\n\nMy social background, biases, and values might cause me problems in understanding the couple’s situation. The socio-cultural history of America has put women and men in almost the same rank. There is no clear difference between feminine and masculine roles. Therefore, I might find myself forcing Robert to abandon his patriarchal disposition and talk to his wife about his problems. I also do not believe in cheating on one’s partner. This belief may make me subjective during the treatment. Worse still, I may find it difficult to understand why Robert does not share his problems with his wife because I believe in openness in marriage.\n\nEthical issues in assessing and diagnosing a couple\n\nCounselors need to observe ethical standards while handling their clients. The American Counseling Association, ACA, and the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy propose some ethical standards for counselors to observe.\n\nAccording to ACA, counselors should be ready to give back to their communities. Giving back refers to the readiness to serve their people without expecting payment. Sometimes, their clients may lack money to pay for the services. In such cases, the counselors should be ready to offer services to them and not harass them for not paying for the services (ACA, 2014).\n\nSometimes, due to poor romantic relationships with their partners, clients can show readiness to have sex with their counselors. In the case of Robert and Sophia, both clients have no time for each other. They work for long hours and do not find time to be with each other. In addition, Sophia may want to revenge Robert’s infidelity by having sex with somebody else. The counselor should always avoid the temptation of having a sexual relationship with clients (ACA, 2014).\n\nThe AAMFT proposes a two-year avoidance period before engaging in any romantic relationship with former clients. The avoidance prevents either of the parties from taking advantage of their professional relationship (AAMFT, 2012).\n\nAAMFT encourages marriage and family therapists to refer to cases that are beyond them to other experts. They discourage them from struggling with difficult cases or deliberate refusal to refer them. Both ACA and AAMFT propose that marriage and family therapists should seek consent from their clients before referring them to other experts. The therapist should write down the consent or record it to serve as evidence of the client’s involvement. In addition, they advise therapists to come up with ways of helping their clients continue with the treatment before they stop working with them (AAMFT, 2012 ) .\n\nTherapists should also provide services to their clients without discrimination. They should not reject or give unsatisfactory services to clients because of their color, ethnicity, age, or religion. Experts discovered that acculturation is one of the main causes of OCD. Therefore, most of the couples who seek therapy are likely to be of different races, ethnicity, and religions. Therapists should not compromise their services because of these factors (Harmon, Audra & Ginsburg, 2006).\n\nTreatment plan\n\nFocus of therapy\n\nThe therapy for the couple should mainly focus on their obsessions. Robert’s obsession is the fear that their relationship may not work, while Sophia’s obsession is Robert’s infidelity. The best therapies for this couple are exposure therapy and accommodation therapy. Exposure therapy helps them realize the lack of logic in their obsessions (Nolen-Hoeksema, 2014). Each of them will ignore the urge for compulsive responses to the obsessions. Accommodation Therapy, on the other hand, helps the affected people to assistance from relatives, spouses, and friends (Abramowitz et al., 2013).\n\nTreatment goals for the couple\n\nThe major goals for this couple are faithfulness, finding time to talk about their problems, and for intimacy and openness to each other. When Robert starts to talk about his problems with his wife freely, the therapy will have worked. He is not satisfied with the relationship but does not talk about the cause of his dissatisfaction. Accommodation therapy will be very effective in handling this situation. He should make deliberate efforts to involve his wife in his problems. The exposure therapy may also help him realize that it is not helpful to cheat on his wife because of not having time for him (Yahav, 2002).\n\nSophia is very observant due to her lack of trust for men. Her uncle molested her when she was growing up, and this incident caused anxiety in her. Exposure Therapy is the best for handling her problem. The therapist should help her confront her obsession by avoiding situations that may trigger compulsions. The attainment of this goal is when she stops spying on what Robert does with other people.\n\nIntervention methods\n\nSusie Scot argues that therapists must help suppress or eliminate irrational characteristics in their clients. This philosophy is very important in coming up with methods of intervening in a situation similar to Robert and Sophia’s. Scott argues that the responsibility of therapists is regulating rationality (Scot, 2006). Therefore, in the case of Robert and Sophia, the therapist will have to prevent their clients’ emotions from going beyond their normal working conditions.\n\nAs Scot (2006) proposes, the therapist should help Robert realize that getting another woman was an overreaction. He should go through the CBT and be in an environment that allows him to recover on his own. The therapist should also allow Robert and Sophia to interact with anxiety triggers repeatedly. They will realize that the triggers are not important, and will eventually stop worrying about them.\n\nReferences\n\nAbramowitz J. S., Baucom D. H., Wheaton M. G., Boeding S., Fabricant L.

      "Health Care Finance: Tools and Techniques Essay\n\nRecent healthcare reform (The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act) has affected not only patients but also healthcare organizations. Healthcare organizations are now relying on payments from patients to maintain their facilities and pay their workers. The creation of new insurance plans has increased the number of patients who pay for their health care costs out of their own pockets.\n\nThis situation has been aggravated by high rates of unemployment and the introduction of self-directed health care plans in the American health care system. The result of such reform has been the active involvement of patients in the daily decisions of their care. On the other hand, it has compelled health practitioners to improve their strategies to collect payments from patients through the development and adoption of strategic plans.\n\nWhen patients fail to pay accounts receivable, the cash flow dwindles, bad debt accumulates, and the long-term growth of the organization is compromised. The enhancement of patient pay accounts receivable is the most effective way of improving the operations of health care facilities. My plan to enhance out-of-pocket accounts receivable would include the implementation of policies to encourage prompt payments and the utilization of technology to improve payment processes.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nPoor payment processes are major causes of the mismanagement of patient receivables (Newby & Carr, 2013). Patients’ inability and reluctance to pay their out-of-pocket health care expenses is affecting many health care facilities that are already stretched financially (Fordney, 2017). Effective plans to enhance patient pay accounts receivable involve patient engagement and accounts management. Educating patients on organizational financial policies could reduce the incidence of missed payments. An increasing patient accounts receivable could signify ineffective front-desk processes and poor communication regarding the organization’s financial policy (Paterson, 2014).\n\nMy plan to enhance patient-pay accounts receivable would comprise two main components: implementation of policies to encourage prompt and full payment and the use technology to streamline payment processes and remind patients of their financial obligations. Policies that offer cash discounts, time-of-service discount, and impose fines if payments are made late would be implemented (Baker, Baker, & Dworkin, 2017). Discounts would also be offered for cash payments. Many patients make promises to pay their bills but fail to keep them. In that regard, a fine would be imposed for late payments (Baker et al., 2017). A policy that imposes fines would encourage patients to pay on time and avoid extra charges.\n\nThe second component would involve using technology to improve payment processes, remind patients of their obligations, and increase the number of payment options available. According to Fordney (2017), technology enhances the process of educating patients and verifying their insurance eligibility. Using technology for check-in enhances upfront payment collection (Paterson, 2014). Technology would also facilitate credit card billing, hence maximize payments and shorten the time taken to collect debt (Marcinko & Hertico, 2013).\n\nFacilitating automated credit card payment would eliminate the possibility of late payments (Paterson, 2014). Patients would be informed about their upcoming payments and insurance eligibility through automated reminder calls.\n\nSummary\n\nHealth care reforms have resulted in high health care costs that have increased out-of-pocket payments. As a result, patients are incurring higher premiums, co-payments, and deductibles. Healthcare providers are getting more of their revenues from out-of-pocket payments. Therefore, it is imperative for them to develop plans to enhance patients’ out-of-pocket accounts receivable. Studies have shown that ineffective and limited payment processes are among the major causes of low out-of-pocket patient payments. My plan to enhance patient payments can be summarized as processes and technology.\n\nProcesses can be improved using technology, and technology can be used to educate patients. The plan would not employ aggressive methods such as the involvement of a debt collector because they would damage personal relationships with patients. Technology is used to remind patients of their obligations and improve payment processes. Moreover, it would be used to verify the insurance eligibility of patients. Many patients fail to make payments because of limited availability of payment methods. Part of the plan is the use of technology to allow patients make payments any time from whichever location. Reminding them of their financial obligations ensures that they do not incur extra charges for late payments.\n\nThe plan’s main objective is to make it easy and comfortable for patients to make payments and clear outstanding balances without any coercion. Moreover, the plan is also aimed at avoiding rocking relationships between patients and the staff. The implementation of the aforementioned plan would increase revenues and improve the provision of health care services.\n\nReferences\n\nBaker, J. J., Baker, R. W., & Dworkin, N. R. (2017).

      "Policy for Vehicles with Automated Driving Systems Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Public Comment on the Proposal\n 3. Environmental Implications: Positive and Negative\n 4. Concluding Remarks: Personal Opinion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe policy proposal “Removing Regulatory Barriers for Vehicles with Automated Driving Systems” examines the future of automobiles with automated driving systems (ADSs) and why new considerations should be accepted to promote this modern technology. The benefits and drawbacks of innovation have attracted the attention of many policymakers, engineers, and politicians. This paper gives a detailed analysis of some of the issues revolving around the policy.\n\nPublic Comment on the Proposal\n\nThe emergence of modern technologies has led to the production of superior vehicles that support people’s transportation needs. The proposed policy seeks to promote new guidelines to accommodate the production, safety, and use of driverless vehicles. Firstly, this move will encourage more innovators and engineers to produce superior vehicles that can improve the way people move from point A to B. Secondly, the power of technology is something that cannot be ignored by any government (“Removing regulatory barriers,” n. d.). The acceptance of the new technology will create the best environment for producing superior automobiles that conform to every testing, compliance, certification, and verification process.\n\nMoreover, the production and use of these cars will result in reduced accidents and traffic jams.\n\nExperts have also acknowledged that fully automated vehicles have the potential to support various environmental conservation initiatives (“Removing regulatory barriers,” n. d.). That being the case, existing regulatory barriers such as the failure to recognize the effectiveness of driverless cars and the absence of evidence-based testing procedures should be removed in an attempt to support this new technology.\n\nEnvironmental Implications: Positive and Negative\n\nMany analysts believe strongly that self-driving vehicles will have numerous impacts on the environment. Current technologies in vehicle manufacturing have been associated with reduced fuel consumption. These autonomous cars will, therefore, minimize carbon emission and protect the environment. Heavy traffics and jams are associated with increased gasoline consumption. The proposed technology will minimize such jams, thereby reducing carbon emissions (Greenblatt, 2015). On top of that, the technology will maximize road usage and at the same time minimize the need to construct more highways. Chances are high that these gains will protect the natural environment. Eco-technology will also minimize most of the materials required to produce targeted cars. These aspects show that the proposed technology will not only increase safety but also protect the natural environment.\n\nOn the other hand, autonomous cars might result in the need for advanced features such as televisions and gaming tools. These attributes are likely to make such vehicles unsustainable and inefficient. Such resources might put much pressure on the natural environment. Greenblatt (2015) believes that driverless cars might encourage people to travel frequently. Physically impaired, elderly, and underage persons will need such services. Moreover, these needs will affect the sustainability and efficiency of such cars. Increased demand for self-driving cars might inflate the need for natural or fossil fuels. This means that the negative environmental implications of the technology are equally important and must be analyzed from a critical perspective.\n\nConcluding Remarks: Personal Opinion\n\nI believe that there is a need for the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) to revise every existing law and policy in an attempt to accommodate this innovative idea. The important thing is to develop appropriate standards for compliance, testing, and certification of these vehicles. The collaboration of different stakeholders will result in better standards and address every existing barrier. When the existing obstacles are removed, companies such as Uber Technologies and Google Incorporation will be empowered to produce advanced cars that fulfill every requirement. They will also be willing to minimize emerging negative environmental impacts.\n\nReferences\n\nGreenblatt, J. B. (2015). Automated vehicles, on-demand mobility, and environmental impacts.

      "Tesla’s Strategic Plan for Leadership in Energy Sector Research Paper\n\nThe global automotive industry faces increasing competitive pressure to diversify into eco-friendly car models that meet sustainability demands/policies. The purpose of this report is to analyze Tesla’s strategic plan of technological leadership in the energy segment to strengthen its competitive position. The report begins with an overview of Tesla’s products/services, competitive strategy, and financial performance. The next section will involve an in-depth analysis of the automaker’s strategic/competitive position – internal and external environments – using SWOT analysis. Subsequently, Tesla’s overall strategy and recent strategic initiative will be analyzed and a conclusion based on the findings provided.\n\nCompany Overview\n\nProducts/Services\n\nTesla is a vertically integrated American automaker producing electric vehicles (EVs) with the potential to replace gasoline-powered vehicles. The firm designs manufacture and sells electric vehicles through its subsidiaries in N. America, Asia, and Europe (Tesla, 2017). Its main electric cars include high-performance and stylish Model S sedan and Model X SUV installed with an autopilot functionality (Tesla, 2017). Tesla also launched a low-priced sedan model that will be released for mass consumption by the end of 2017. There are also plans to produce commercial electronic vehicles in the future. The EVs superior benefits include recharging flexibility, high-performance (autopilot software), and better energy efficiency than hybrid cars.\n\nIn the energy segment, Tesla provides energy storage systems (lithium-ion batteries) for residential and business premises. Examples include the small-capacity Powerwall 2 suitable for home use and the high-capacity (200kWh) Powerback system designed for industrial use (Tesla, 2017). It also offers proprietary solar energy systems and dual motor power trains to other automakers, namely, Daimler and Toyota (Stolze, 2015).\n\nStrategy for Attaining Competitive Advantage\n\nFirms can pursue any of the five generic competitive strategies – low-cost provider, broad differentiation, best-cost provider, focused low-cost provider, or focused differentiation (Thompson, Peteraf, Gamble, & Strickland, 2015). Tesla utilizes a focused differentiation strategy that entails targeting the high-end market (middle and upper-income clients) through high-performance EVs fitted with unparalleled autopilot systems. Tesla Model S car retails at a premium price compared to Nissan or Ford models.\n\nA focused differentiation strategy is characterized by a narrow market niche with product features tailored to client needs/preferences (Thompson et al., 2015). Tesla is committed to providing EVs and energy storage systems and does not compete in other market segments. In the energy sector, Tesla’s innovative offerings include battery systems and solar energy systems. The basis for Tesla’s competitive advantage lies in a strong in-house R&D department (over $900m invested) that develops innovative designs and proprietary technologies (Tesla, 2017). Other companies cannot imitate Tesla’s innovations; hence, it has few competitors in this segment.\n\nFinancial Performance Overview\n\nFinancial performance indicators are important measures of a firm’s strategic goal attainment. Tesla has reported sustained revenue/profitability growth since 2012. Its revenue grew by 73% in the 2015/2016 period, up from 27% in the 2014/2015 fiscal year (Tesla, 2017). The energy generation and storage category was the fastest-growing segment in 2015/2016. Revenue from this segment increased by 1,153%, compared to 63% growth reported in the automotive segment over the same period (Tesla, 2017). Its profitability growth remained unchanged between 2015 and 2016 at 22.8% with the energy generation and storage segment accounting for only 1.7%, partly due to costly R&D investment (11.9% of revenue in 2016).\n\nThe financial ratios of Tesla indicate that the firm is in good financial health. Its working capital stands at $591m, implying that Tesla has the liquidity capacity to meet its operating expenses. With a current ratio of 1.88, Tesla can pay its debt obligations with its assets. Its return on investment (ROI) grew to 307.14% in 2016, up from -2.97% in 2015 fuelled by maturing investment gains in the energy segment (Tesla, 2017). In the US, Tesla’s market share grew to 30% in 2016 largely driven by competitive Model S and X luxury cars.\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nAccording to Akpoyomare, Adeosun, and Ganiyu (2012), a SWOT analysis gives a framework for evaluating a firm’s strategic direction. An assessment of Tesla’s internal and external environment is given in the following section.\n\nStrengths\n\nA firm’s strengths lie in its internal capabilities/resources from which it derives its competitive gains (Thompson et al., 2015). Tesla’s primary strengths in the EV industry include:\n\n 1. High-performance vehicles – Tesla provides quality products in terms of capabilities (autopilot systems) and stylish car designs.\n 2. Proprietary technologies – Tesla has strong R&D capabilities, accounting for over 203 cutting-edge technology patents for its EV designs, solar batteries, and power train components (Mangram, 2012).\n 3. First-mover advantage – Tesla was the first automaker to provide superior quality electric car (Model S) for racing.\n 4. Strong capitalist relations – the firm can access capital markets and has strong partnerships with investors, e.g., Google, which promotes technology sharing.\n 5. Innovative distribution network – it owns stores in strategic locations in N. America, Europe, and Asia to target high-end clients. Also, Tesla sells through an eCommerce platform, doing away with the franchise dealership (Stolze, 2015).\n 6. A good brand reputation – Tesla is renowned for fuel-efficient EVs and innovative energy storage systems in the high-end segment.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nThe company’s major weaknesses (internal liabilities) in the EV industry include:\n\n 1. Immature EV industry – the electric car market is in its infancy; hence, the demand is low.\n 2. Limited economies of scale advantages – Tesla’s small sales volume and costly R&D investment/production mean that it cannot produce for the mass market (Mangram, 2012).\n 3. Limited brand recognition in the low-end market segment – the premium-priced luxury EVs may not be popular with the regular consumer (Stringham, Miller, & Clark, 2015).\n 4. Limited capacity – rapid demand increases for sedans may affect supply because of the firm’s low production output (Stringham et al., 2015).\n 5. Rising consumer concerns – potential customers harbor fears over the availability of charging stations for EVs in their regions.\n\nOpportunities\n\nFactors, external to the company, provide opportunities for Tesla to grow its market share. The main opportunities for Tesla in the EV market include:\n\n 1. Significant entry barriers – EV production is a capital-intensive industry. It is also characterized by a high failure rate, e.g., Aptera (Mangram, 2012).\n 2. Innovation in automobile battery technology – Tesla is a leader in producing high-density battery packs. Opportunities exist for upgrading the battery capacity and performance for Model S EVs.\n 3. Increasing environmental awareness – consumers are moving towards eco-friendly or fuel-efficient cars (EVs) and products due to global warming/climate change concerns.\n 4. High gasoline prices – regular spikes in oil prices are driving demand for alternative sources of power (solar batteries) upwards.\n 5. Pro-green energy policies – most governments are committed to reducing per capita carbon emissions through EV subsidies and tax rebates (Stringham et al., 2015).\n 6. Niche markets – EVs in the sports/luxury car market has few competitors; hence, Tesla can focus on this segment to grow.\n\nThreats\n\n 1. Availability of substitutes – multiple substitutes for luxury EVs exist, including hybrid cars, hydrogen-powered vehicles, and fuel-efficient cars – Ferrari.\n 2. Increasing competition – the number of players (hybrid car automakers) in the EV industry is rising, posing a threat to Tesla’s market dominance.\n 3. Fluctuations in oil prices – gasoline subsidies result in the easing of high oil prices, reducing demand for EVs.\n 4. Economies of scale – the entry of larger MNCs (GM) with adequate capital to develop innovative battery technologies may erode Tesla’s competitive gains.\n\nEvaluation of Company Strategy\n\nOverall Strategy\n\nThe automaker’s overall strategy is to create a foundation for EV growth through luxury/premium car models/products and value chain ownership (Connett, 2015). The first aspect of Tesla’s overall strategy is an emphasis on high-end models. Its flagship car, the Roadster model, was premium priced ($109,000) to target the high-end segment. Further, the two other EV models – Model S and X lines – target the middle to upper-middle income clients. The second aspect of this strategy relates to proprietary rights. Tesla leverages proprietary electric power-train components, partnerships, and battery technologies to accelerate the growth of the EV industry. It sells its electric power-train parts to Toyota and Daimler (Stolze, 2015). The third aspect of the overall strategy is the distribution chain and charging infrastructure ownership, which helps minimize costs related to a franchise dealership.\n\nRecent Strategic Initiative\n\nRecent initiatives by Tesla indicate that the automaker’s strategy is to diversify into the energy sector. In 2015, Tesla entered into the stationary power market with its “at-home Powerwall and Powerback (210kWh)” (Tesla, 2017, para. 16). Also, the firm won a tender to build a Powerback station that could power over 2,500 households in the Mira Loma area (Tesla, 2017). In 2014, Tesla, in partnership with Panasonic, began building the Gigafactory plant in Nevada to produce and supply battery cells (Tesla, 2017). These initiatives indicate that Tesla is committed to producing energy storage systems/batteries for EVs and homes as a business strategy.\n\nWith the rising demand for zero-emission vehicles, investment in high-performance batteries will accelerate EV adoption rates. The establishment of the Gigafactory will improve Tesla’s capacity, reduce production costs, and find a solution for its battery shortage challenge. Thus, Tesla will begin to benefit from the economies of scale due to improved production efficiency. Further, through technology sharing and partnerships with Panasonic, Toyota, etc., Tesla has been able to leverage available industry expertise to grow. The strong relationships with technology firms suggest that Tesla is using a defensive strategy to ward off threats from new entrants.\n\nVertical integration is also evident in Tesla’s ‘new energy’ strategy. The firm’s two segments, i.e., energy storage systems, and EV cars are vertically integrated. The aim is to control and secure the EV market for its output Tesla owns its distribution network, which helps reduce operational costs related to dealership commissions. Therefore, establishing a vertically integrated supply chain enhances production efficiency and market control. By producing energy storage components and batteries for its EVs and other automakers, Tesla has competitive advantages in the EV industry and is poised to revolutionize the energy sector.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis report has examined Tesla’s internal capabilities and liabilities through a SWOT analysis to illuminate its overall strategy in the EV market. Tesla’s competitive advantages lie in its in-house technology, focused differentiation strategy, and emphasis on renewable energy systems. The firm has revolutionized the auto-making industry through eco-friendly EVs and battery systems that have allowed it to diversify into the energy sector.\n\nReferences\n\nAkpoyomare, O., Adeosun, L., & Ganiyu, R.

      "The Entry and Withdrawal of America’s Troop in Iraq Essay\n\nA lot of concerns have been raised on the entry and withdrawal of America’s troop in Iraq. It is believed that United States of America’s invasion of Iraq in 2003 was a mistake, and so was its withdrawal in 2011. 1 Numerous opinions have been provided regarding this assertion. However, US’s act to invade Iraq and its subsequent withdrawal is criticized because instead of building Iraq, US-Iraq war led to numerous problems in the country.\n\nAs such, after the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq, it is likely that a breakup of the Iraqi state is inevitable. According to a report released by the United Nations, many people in Iraq lost their lives after the withdrawal of US troops in Iraq following the protests of Sunni against the central government. This came at a time when the government of Iraq was supposed to start a process of reconciliation and inclusion. 2 Since then, the country has experienced numerous political unrests and conflicts.\n\nPartly, such cases are attributed to fact that the Sunni community is still marginalized since the supposed inclusiveness was never achieved. However, the question that many people have been searching for answers is the reason for Iraq’s state of turmoil.\n\nIt has been argued that the withdrawal of US from Iraq and the shutdown of Sunni protest camps in Iraq led to entry of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS), which is linked to the feared al Qaeda group, in Iraq. The ISIS, in a previous version formed a great percentage of the insurgents in Iraq that the Americans were fighting against during the US-Iraq war. The regrouping of the ISIS and other terror groups in Iraq has increased the number of conflicts in Iraq and its borders.\n\nFollowing the withdrawal of the US’s troops from Iraq, such groups became strong, and have led to the extension of such fights to Iraq and Syria’s border. 3 The grievances of the Sunni community are yet to be met and this has contributed to a great extent to the fights in Iraq. While the government of Iraq is struggling to deal with the ISIS, it still receives a lot of opposition from the Sunnis since they consider the ISIS as partners-in-arms against a common enemy.\n\nAs such, it can be seen that the continuous fights in Iraq are yet to end given the magnitude of the demands from both the Sunnis and the ISIS. For this reason, it suffices that the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq has been instrumental in the state of Iraq, since it occurred before the country could stabilize. 4 Such a move gave the ISIS a chance to reenter Iraq, and the Sunnis to continue with their fight in opposition to their marginalized state and the fulfilment of their grievances. If such a condition remains, a breakup of the Iraqi state is inevitable, given that the civil war in Syria has adversely affected Iraq in various aspects of the country’s economy.\n\nThe current state of Iraq in terms of social, political and economic affairs has been largely influenced by the antagonistic relationship that exists between the Shia and Sunni. 5 For example, the central government has lost control over Fallujah and Ramadi regions, which has led to the rule of ISIS militants, local police who are tribally-influenced and the Sunni militiamen. Such a state of affairs prevents any form of development in the country, as all resources are channeled into stabilizing the troops and working towards eliminating any threats. Nonetheless, Iraq has been struggling to gain its national identity.\n\nIts main aim as a country is to ensure that the identity obtained can help in solving the differences that exist between its Kurds, Arabs and other minority divisions. 6 Altogether, Iraq has come to the realization that it must focus on the development of a new government and economic structures as well as social order after it has gone through a period of sanctions, dictatorship, war civil conflicts and occupation conflicts since the late 1970s.\n\nFor Iraq to attain the required level of peace and unity, it must be in a position to cope with the ever increasing changes in population, political and economic conditions. 7 In addition, it must be involved in the diversification of its economy which is heavily relies on the exportation of petroleum products. However, the struggle to attain the above benefits may lead to more civil wars and further divisions in the country, as evident in the regions of Fallujah and Ramadi. 8 Nevertheless, the political stability in Iraq has high chances of being recovered since the fact that it has numerous cases of violence does not mean that it can never succeed in the establishment of security, better life and stability for its people.\n\nThe tension level between the political, parties and the major ethnic groups in Iraq has been rising. The main aspects of conflict have been the control, autonomy and authority over the natural resources in Iraq that have led to strenuous relationships between individuals from both sides. All the groups have been suspecting one another and the strength of competition for dominance has been increasing.\n\nHowever, the withdrawal of the US forces together with the diminishing role at international level has led to the likelihood of new cases of civil strife and internal violence. The participation of international relations reduced at a time when the region was facing the crisis of declining aid and political instability. As a result, various issues have led to the constant testing of the Iraq government. For instance, the implementation of the Erbil power-sharing agreement of 2010 has been the main area of focus by those testing the government.\n\nThe current occurrences in Iraq increase the tension between the factional groups and the central government has led to the feeling of lack of authority from both the political and economic systems of Iraq. In reality, the tension leads to factions between the political and ethnic groups in Iraq that lead to threats by Kurds and Sunnis over the withdrawal of their support to the government as the crisis in the political arena seems to be unavoidable. 9\n\nThe domestic challenges of Iraq are involved in interactive relationships with the extensive models of instability within the region. For a long time, Iraq has been caught up in between the political fights of other countries as evident in the case of US and Iran. 10 In addition, Iraq is drawn closer to the civil conflicts that are constantly experienced in Syria.\n\nEven though the government of Iraq has been active in trying to eliminate ISIS militants in the country, the present civil war in Syria has adverse effects on the stability of Iraq. The crises experienced within the boundaries of Iraq have a lot of impact in the future of Iraq, as well as the interest of other countries in the region. However, the role played by the US in Iraq is far much better than that of Iran. For instance, US’s presence in Iraq was entirely to prevent the influence of Iran over Iraq.\n\nFor instance, US claimed that it is the major source of income for Iraq, and helps in training the security officials of Iraq and the provision of other forms of assistance through the use of information operations. However, the main goal of America in Iraq in 2003 was not only to contain the influence of Iran, but also to help in the creation of a stable democratic government in Iraq. It further aimed at ensuring that the country was in a position to defeat the remaining insurgent and extremist groups, have self-defense against threats from foreigners, participate in the development of a sustainable society and finally develop effective relationship with other countries.\n\nUS forces in Iraq since 2003 up to 2011, had been very instrumental in the partial suppression of the extent of the internal challenges in Iraq that affected the economic, political and military aspects of the country. This can be attributed to the fact that there were increased tensions in Iraq following US’s withdrawal, which was an indication that the presence of US’s forces in Iraq prevented the terror acts of the Sunnis and the ISIS. 11\n\nThe increased cases of civil conflicts and war in Syria have undermined the plans to form a stable government. The coalition government was expected to be formed in 2012, alongside setting up of strategic plans in Iraq to deal with the economic, political and military challenges in the country. Nonetheless, the withdrawal of US troops in Iraq was followed by the revival of the fight for power between the Sunnis and the central government, and the increase in terror attacks from extremists groups such as the ISIS. 12\n\nPresently, the struggle to gain power still continues and is now more divisive and violent. Concerns have been raised that point out to the possibility of a collapsed democracy in Iraq and complete breakup of Iraqi state if such political situation remains unresolved, as evident in the current civil war in Syria.\n\nBibliography\n\nAl-Hamid, Raed. “The American Withdrawal from Iraq: Ways And Means for Remaining Behind”.

      "Food Corporations’ Damaging Influence Research Paper\n\nThe production of food has changed through the years with the ever-growing human population and its mounting needs. Moreover, the principles of producing, purchasing, and cooking food have also evolved under the influence of people’s cultures and lifestyles. The industry of food corporations is now filled with cheap pre-made meals and inexpensive products that can be used at any time of the day. Television programs and social media channels show how to prepare meals quickly and efficiently, appealing to people’s need for comfort.\n\nThe food industry rooted in the principle of cheap and available products often undermines many ethical principles that should surround a business directly impacting people’s health and the environment. For example, Schlosser notes that workers in the food industry have dangerous jobs with inadequate or missing safety standards and a general disregard for human life and safety (420). Animals suffer from food corporations as well, as the latter do not give them any ability to live a healthy life, confining them to small spaces, limiting their mobility, and lowering the quality of their food (Pollan 418). Various corporations try to portray these conditions as a positive outcome of raised efficiency, disregarding the ethics of food production.\n\nFood corporations and the general direction of the food industry have three distinct negative features. First of all, the production of food such as meat and dairy is often marked by manufacturers ignoring any ethics of raising animals for meat and attempting to reduce the price of meat by lowering its quality. Second, the conditions in which many employees of the food industry have to work are unsuitable not only for providing them with adequate pay but also for keeping them safe. Finally, the sector of food production with a focus on effectiveness and speed influences people’s cooking habits, making them less selective in choosing proper and healthy ingredients.\n\nThe course of actions in the food industry is affected by the growing number of people and their changing priorities and demands. The chosen path towards efficiency can be explained by the fact that humans need more and more food every day. However, this approach poses a threat to the environment and its inhabitants, as food corporations often ignore the quality standards of producing food. Here, meat and corn production can be a viable example of corporations damaging the environment.\n\nThe influence of raising demands can be seen in the production of corn and the use of its waste products. According to Pollan, the excessive use of corn as a feeding base for animals has made the industry of meat production much cheaper as it lowered the costs for animals’ care (418). In reality, corn was never a part of the animals’ diet before the corporations decided to use the waste from cornfields to feed the livestock. Cows and pigs may now be raised in “confined animal feeding operations” that limit animals’ walking space and use low-quality food (Pollan 417). Such unethical conditions perpetuate animal cruelty and produce cheap products with little nutritional value.\n\nThe production of meat is a complicated process in the industry for many reasons. The environment ravaged by intensive farming suffers many non-recoverable losses. However, animals are not the only ones who suffer from inadequate conditions in the food industry. Employees of various manufacturing companies often encounter bad working environments as well. These places pose a threat to their well-being and do not offer sufficient social or financial support.\n\nMeat production may be one of the most dangerous industry sectors where people can work. For example, Schlosser describes many accidents that can and have happened at meatpacking firms that hire contractors to clean their factories (420). The safety standards for these crews of workers are practically non-existent, and their lives are not valued enough by their employers to change the established system. Therefore, employees may get injured and even die because of such conditions. Companies’ need to lower production costs drives them to endanger people who cannot find another job.\n\nHowever, even when the product enters the market, the influence of food corporations does not stop. The industry also dictates cooking habits for people through marketing and media. As people’s priorities change, so do their purchasing and cooking preferences. The scope of influence reaches people’s entertainment and education as well, which can be seen in the example of cooking shows.\n\nMany of the currently existing cooking shows depend on pre-prepared meals and ingredients (Buford 355). The hosts of these programs may advise the audience to buy convenience foods to save their time while cooking. Industrially produced foods may not offer the same amount of nutrients and healthy ingredients (Scholliers 5). This trend changes the way people perceive food and nutrition, focusing on the speed of food preparation more than on its quality. Moreover, the obsession of people with cooking shows also skews the view of food as they often fail to use or present ingredients in their natural form (Buford 356).\n\nFood corporations significantly affect the way people produce, purchase, cook, and consume food. Their impact can be found in every step of the process, starting with manufacturing and ending with meal preparation. Furthermore, all sides of the process suffer from the industry’s focus on efficiency and low prices. Animals are fed low-quality waste and raised in confined spaces, workers are endangered and mistreated, and consumers are influenced to make less healthy purchasing decisions with a questionable appeal of saving some time during cooking.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBuford, Bill. “TV Dinners.” Eating Words: A Norton Anthology of Food Writing , edited by Sandra M.

      "John Winthrop’s Model of Christian Charity Essay\n\nIt is evident that John Winthrop, the first governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, never shown any respect and compassion for the tradition of democracy, rather, he hated democracy as well as did not support religious tolerance. A Model of Christian Charity is a short sermon that was written to summarize and arrange the ideas relevant to living in the Puritan colony, which wanted to be successful in the ‘new world’. The sermon began with explaining why God created people of various ranks (rich, powerful, poor, and powerless) because different strengths are needed and because all ranks should have respect for one another (Winthrop 6).\n\nWinthrop warned the Puritans that they had created an agreement with God and therefore, are forced to show kindness. If they did the opposite, God would punish them. The sermon concluded with the statement that in the ‘new world’ Puritans would create a shining “city upon the hill”, setting an example for everyone how a religious community can be created and sustained. There is a strong idea that aimed to become an example for the rest of the world community which remained an ideal used by many American leaders.\n\nDuring the voyage to America, Winthrop preached the idea that the Puritans were going to the ‘promised land’ to shield themselves and their future generations from the corruption and other threats that followed them in the old world. The “city upon the hill” idea is nowadays commonly used by conservatives when invoking the “American exceptionalism” notion as well as its superiority of military power and wealth.\n\nIn my opinion, such a reference often suggests a national self-congratulation worldview as well as supports an attitude inherent to liberals – the attitude of complacency. However, the modern interpretation of Winthrop’s quote is not at all what was meant originally. Instead of suggesting that the new settlers are superiors to the citizens of the ‘old world’, rather, Winthrop wanted to underline the notoriety of their actions. For Winthrop, the image of the “city upon the hill” related to the concept of “preeminent responsibility” (Signorelli par. 3).\n\nEdwards’ Personal Struggles\n\nSinners in the Hands of an Angry God by Jonathan Edwards represent three major themes: sinners will face punishment, God’s righteous wrath cannot be foreseen, ‘the day of mercy’ can only be extended if the sinners obey. The theme of “city upon the hill” is also reflected in Edwards’ sermon – sinners are described as helpless and precarious human beings corrupted in their nature, so they must be punished. Thus, the shining city will be only available to those living by God’s rules. However, Edwards went to a much further detail when discussing the wrongful versus righteous behavior – he used the metaphors like “grasshoppers” and “worms of the dust” to describe those not obeying God (Edwards 17).\n\nThe exploration of religion and sinfulness is also present in Edwards’ Personal Narrative , which is can be regarded as a self-reflection on religion. The negative attitude towards sinners is supported by Edwards’ personal relationship with sin, which he wanted to suppress through maintaining the righteous way of life, which also, subsequently, failed. Despite trying the intellectual approach towards the matters of spiritual life, Edwards was not satisfied with the outcome. The main conclusion drawn from Edwards’ individual experiences is that spiritual righteousness could have only been accessed from the outside of one’s mind.\n\nSin pulled him down while joy lifted him up. Edwards described his nature as a sinful individual and spoke hyperbolically about his disobedience to God’s word. He called himself wicked since he felt the horror, which his sins caused. The joy was evoked from his love of God, seen in his hatred for himself as a sinner. When analyzing the essay, it is evident that the large portion of the writing was dedicated to the joy in God in order to make up for the sinfulness and self-loathing, getting approval from God. Whatever the purpose of the Personal Narrative was, the outcome related to the emotional rollercoaster that ranged from joy to sin, from ecstasy to horror (Stratford par. 4).\n\nWhile Edwards used many abstract notions when writing his Personal Narrative, he stated that no words could explain the “inexpressible” experience of God’s presence (Edwards 12). Additionally, Edwards compared God and the wonders of nature through expressing his awe with them at the same time reflecting on the experiences he had as a believer.\n\nTherefore, despite Edwards promoting the sin-free and righteous way of life to become a true citizen of “the city upon the hill”, his personal experience is far less righteous than he, personally, wanted it to be. The obsession with being approved by God in one’s deeds is reflected in the American conservative tradition that dates back to the times of Winthrop. Living righteously is also sometimes regarded as a feature of the American nation’s significance or superiority over others.\n\nCrevecouer’s Exploration of the American Identity\n\nLetter III “What is an American” from the Letters from an American Farmer by Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur was written from a perspective of a Frenchman that moved to America and settled there. The third letter described the merging of various population groups, which came together to become an American nation together and American citizens individually. Furthermore, the author of the letter analyzed the strong bond that existed between the land and men as well as how this relationship affected human behavior.\n\nTherefore, there are themes of individual spirituality and the bond by land. Because the majority of Europeans came to the promised land in a search for a better life, they all wanted to become new people. This argument is supported by the following statement “We are nothing but what we derive from the air we breathe, the climate we inhabit, the government we obey, the system of religion we profess, and the nature of our employment” (Crevecoeur 56).\n\nAs evidenced by the statement above, humans are greatly dependent on what surrounds them; thus, they will change as their surrounding environment changes. The Europeans were trapped in their oppressive surroundings and changed to become completely different people. This relates to the question of who is American. An American, according to the writer, is a person that has found new freedom through living the old way of life behind.\n\nTherefore, the “city upon the hill” is created when the old burdens are disregarded and the new way of life is adopted. In the analysis of the works of Edwards, Winthrop, and Crevecoeur, a conclusion can be made that the American “city upon the hill” was created through the righteous way of living, obeying the rule of God, punishing sinners, and leaving the old burdens behind.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCrevecoeur, Hector St. Jean de.

      "Nutrition During Pregnancy and Childbirth Essay (Book Review)\n\n“Improving clinicians’ understanding of effects nutrition can have on maternal health and fetal and neonatal development can have a considerable impact on achieving a healthy pregnancy and reducing childhood morbidity” (Symonds and Ramsay 3). It is the statement from the book Maternal-Fetal Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation by Symonds and Ramsay that reflects the authors’ main idea. This book is very useful for people who are somehow connected with pregnancy such as mothers, doctors, nurses, and others. In the book, the authors are concentrated on demonstrating that nutrition during pregnancy and lactation is extremely important with the focus on nutritional requirements, the physiology and phycology of pregnancy, and factors that affect the nutrition during pregnancy and lactation.\n\nThe book is divided into three sections. The first section refers to nutritional regulation and requirements for pregnancy and fetal growth. The second section is aimed at describing nutritional requirements for lactation and infant growth. The third section is called Specialized requirements, and it is devoted to such topics as teenage pregnancies, vegetarianism during pregnancy and lactation, and multiple pregnancies.\n\nIt can be said that the authors present the essence of main topics. For instance, Symonds and Ramsay state that nutrition is important even in the early stages of pregnancy, and they support this idea describing the process of the placenta formation and emphasizing the key role of nutrition during this process (4). In their book, Davies and Deery pay a lot of attention to micronutrients and macronutrients (33). Symonds and Ramsay also investigate this topic and underline that micronutrients and macronutrients contribute to supporting mother’s vital activity and the development and growth of her baby (48). As it is described by the Healthline, “micronutrients are dietary components, such as vitamins and minerals, which are only required by the body in small amounts; macronutrients, on the other hand, are nutrients that provide calories or energy” (“Nutritional needs during pregnancy” par. 2). In the first section, Symonds and Ramsay support this definition and describe main macronutrients that should be included in a woman’s daily diet such as protein (for the proper growth of fetal tissue), calcium (for building fetal bones), iron (to supply enough oxygen to the fetus), folate (to reduce the risk of neural tube defects), and others (56).\n\nIt goes without saying that the authors follow their strategy to remark on the effects that nutrition have on maternal health and fetal. They analyze gathered information and make connections between the nutritional requirements and different stages of fetal development and growth. It is worth mentioning that the authors fulfill the following task and success with their objectives in the book. In the second section of their book, the authors consider breastfeeding and highlight key factors related to it. A lot of authors such as Aune et al, Kornides and Kitsantas, Victora et al argue that breastfeeding protects children from many diseases, and Symonds and Ramsay agree with them (67). Besides, in the last section of the book, Symonds and Ramsay analyze and pay a lot of attention to some specific problems that occur during pregnancy.\n\nTo sum up, in the book Maternal-Fetal Nutrition During Pregnancy and Lactation , the authors illustrate the idea of the connection between nutrition and pregnancy. They accentuate the idea of the importance of nutrition during pregnancy and lactation. This book is an excellent guideline for doctors, health-care workers, scientists, and pregnant women. The authors fulfill the following task and reveal why nutrition plays a vital role in the development and growth of the fetus.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAune, Dagfinn, et al. “Breastfeeding and the Maternal Risk of Type Two Diabetes: A Systematic Review and Dose–Response Meta-Analysis of Cohort Studies.” Nutrition, Metabolism and Cardiovascular Diseases , vol. 24, no. 2, 2014, pp. 107-115.\n\nDavies, Lorna, and Ruth Deery.

      "American Agriculture in “Food Inc.” Documentary Essay (Movie Review)\n\nWhich film did u choose to watch and why?\n\nI chose the film Food Inc. for this assignment. My decision to use the film for the assignment was based on the fact that I had watched it before and was highly influenced by it. Additionally, I found it very relevant for the assignment.\n\nWhat did you learn most from the film?\n\nThe film is among the most perspective-altering documentaries ever produced. It exposes how agricultural production has been revolutionized from small family farms to big agribusinesses with dire consequences to consumers. I learned many valuable lessons from the film. The most important and shocking lesson I learned from the film is that food is a political issue in our country. Policymakers and those who are meant to protect us do not protect us. Instead, they work in collusion with the owners of the agribusinesses. I have also learned that all is not lost. We can correct our mistake my boycotting unhealthy products and promoting those produced naturally.\n\nHave you been influenced by the film to change the way you act as a customer? Why?\n\nThe film has influenced my consumption pattern greatly. I have relied on quality assurance labels on products as a means of approving their safety before purchasing for many years. However, after watching the film, I have come to realize that those standards are not genuine. The stringency that once characterized regulations and inspections has been eroded and agricultural products that are below acceptable quality reach shelves. As such, I have made it my responsibility to buy products from small scale farmers but not those of big brands. I have decided to boycott products of companies involved in poor agricultural practices since only diminishing demand for their products can change the situation.\n\nDescribe three areas that were most influential to you\n\nArea 1\n\nI was influenced greatly by the power the film gives to consumers like me in the end. It shows us that despite the conspiracies surrounding agribusiness in the country, we can still make a difference by boycotting products disguised as low-cost products in the market because they are unhealthy for human consumption.\n\nArea 2\n\nI was also influenced by the link between many emerging diseases and the unhealthy agricultural products produced by the big agribusinesses. The film claims that new products such as tomatoes with very long shelf lives, chicken that matures in days, and indestructible soybeans have led to increased cases of E. coli bacteria that are responsible for over 73,000 cases of sickness in the country annually sometimes leading to death and widespread obesity. Unlike in the earlier days when obesity was considered a condition for adults, even children are victims currently due to these unhealthy products.\n\nArea 3\n\nJoel Salatin’s case influenced me a lot. He is involved in sustainable farming and raises various animals such as pigs, cows, and chicken. Salatin does not rely on the methods and processes employed by the big farms. Instead, he uses traditional or natural methods of farming on his farm. Interestingly, we also see him succeeding with his eco-friendly approach to the business thereby convincing us that sustainable farming is also viable. This episode made me know that if we buy from farmers involved in sustainable agriculture, they can do well and we will be safe because it is possible and viable.\n",

Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to Webber (1), the communicable disease is one that can easily be passed on from one person or animal to another directly or through an intermediate host. Ostensibly, the transmission of communicable diseases depends on an individual being vulnerable to imminent attacks.\n\nA communicable disease differs from a non-communicable disease because of the presence of an organism involved in the transmission process. By and large, communicable diseases spread through body fluids or the air.\n\nThis paper presents a discussion about HIV/AIDS, a communicable disease that is widespread in the present-day society.\n\nHIV/AIDS\n\nHIV is an acronym for human immunodeficiency virus. Drawing from a study by Ngatchou (9), the choice of the word human is linked to the fact that the virus only causes disease in human beings. Similarly, the word immunodeficiency was selected because the body’s immune system responsible for shielding an individual from illness is weakened. HIV is a minute organism that transmits illness to living creatures and makes replicates itself.\n\nThe Organism that Causes HIV/AIDS\n\nHIV is the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). The study by Ngatchou (9) further indicates that AIDS is a group of illnesses that come about due to an individual’s weak immunity. Generally, people with HIV appear healthy during the first few years after being infected with a virus. Later, the HIV viruses in their bodies lead to AIDS. As noted by Jamison (238), AIDS was first considered to be a disease during the 1980s and later spread very fast to become one of the world’s killers diseases.\n\nHow HIV/AIDS is transmitted\n\nIn most cases, HIV is spread when an individual is involved in unprotected sex with an infected person. Arguably, this makes it very difficult to control the disease associated with HIV (Jamison 238). However, HIV can also be transmitted through blood transfusion or using dirty medical equipment. To avoid transmission as a result of blood transfusion, patients should donate their blood days or weeks before a scheduled operation.\n\nSymptoms of HIV/AIDS\n\nCommon symptoms of HIV/AIDS include but are not limited to fever, sweat, fatigue, loss of appetite, loss of weight, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, cough, and short breaths (Chopra, Niyogi, and Katyal 66). However, these symptoms are not specific. They may also be encountered by people suffering from illness other than HIV/AIDS. According to Sonenklar (10), people with HIV often display flu-like symptoms a few days after being infected.\n\nSymptoms Appear how Long after Someone is Infected with HIV/AIDS\n\nAs has been explained in the preceding section, HIV/AIDS symptoms appear a few days or weeks after one has been infected. Based on a study by Kalichman and Evian (32), most people infected by HIV/AIDS seem to be alright during the first five to ten years. After a lengthy period of HIV infection without notable symptoms, a person later becomes sick. The earliest signs may include fever and fatigue.\n\nShort and Long Term Complications of HIV/AIDS\n\nBy damaging the body’s immune system, HIV slowly weakens the ability of the body to fight off infections. An infected person thus becomes vulnerable to what are commonly known as opportunity infections. Eventually, a person’s condition progresses to AIDS. Short term complications include tiredness, nausea and vomiting, sleep problems, and sexual problems among others. The long term complications of HIV/AIDS include the presence of abnormal fat deposits in a person’s body and development of heart disease.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nChopra Parul, Rageshree Niyogi and Gauri Katyal.

      "Immigration and Refugee Protection Act for Women Annotated Bibliography\n\n“ Even though gender is not specifically referenced in the refugee definition, it is clear that gender can influence or dictate the type of harm, or persecution experienced, and the reasons for that treatment. The main problem facing women asylum seekers within Canada is the failure of decision makers to incorporate gender related claims of women into the interpretation of the existing enumerated grounds and their failure to recognize the political nature of seemingly private acts of harm to women. To remedy these difficulties, Canada has established Guidelines for women refugee claimants fearing gender related persecution. So far, the intent seems to be working.”\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past few decades, there have been changes in the international migration trends in which more women move from one country to another. This is a shift from the past where women normally moved to join their spouses or family members in the countries. The trend has been termed as the feminization of the international migration. The feminization has brought a new dimension in terms of the implications for the women migrants (Yinger par. 1).\n\nFor instance, with the increase in female refugees and migrants, there are increased challenges that relate gender-related exploitation and abuse of the women. A case in point, gender can dictate the experience of the asylum seeker, such as persecution because women are more vulnerable to many types of insecurities such as gender violence and sexual abuse (Freedman 4). As such, International Refugee Board has provided directives to host countries in order to protect women who genuinely seek asylum. In Canada, the legislation regulating refugees and migrants is the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) that was amended in 2014 (Colaiacovo 122). The act enumerates grounds under which a woman seeking asylum can be protected.\n\nGender Persecution and Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)\n\nMany women lack state protection on arrival to their destinations despite their vulnerability. For example, women find themselves being forced to abide by their countries’ of origin customs that they are not comfortable with. Other forms of persecution are due to religion, political opinion, nationality, race, and gender rated violence. Even though these are the same challenges encountered by men, women face the persecution differently. As such, International Refugee Board and UNHCR have attempted to devise guidelines to be used by member countries to protect women (Ramirez 5). The aim of the guidelines is to provide a legal framework and a procedural guidance that can be applied to analyze gender-related claims raised by the women. In 1993, Canada became the first country to come up with guidelines to address claims made by women refugees. The guidelines are provided in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).\n\nThe Act defines the different classes of immigrants and the enforcement that pertains to the classes. According to Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, the Act does not explicitly refer to gender-based persecution (14); however, it requires the decision makers to come up with reasoned justifications by following guidelines as provided for by the Canadian Immigration and Refugee Board. The guidelines commonly referred to as ‘Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution’, outlines that women are entitled to ‘belong to a gender-defined social group’. These guidelines to extent provide a haven for the women as they form the basis for attaining Convention refugee status in Canada. The guidelines stem from directives issued by the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB); the guidelines are not binding authorities, but they are persuasive. In the case of Canada, the federal court has supported the use of the guidelines in cases involving women claimants who allege persecution due to being in a particular social group, religion, race, or customs that may discriminate against them.\n\nSummary of Cases\n\nThere are various allegations made by women as they seek protection from different forms of persecution. Some of the claims may have a positive outcome, which allows the women to apply for permanent residence and others have negative outcomes. Processing of the claims and determination is made by Refugee Protection Division (RPD), and in the case of claimant’s dissatisfaction, an appeal can be made to Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) which does the adjudications to determine whether RPD followed the laid down procedures in coming up with its decisions. The following is a summary of six cases and the determination (See Appendix A).\n\nCase no. 97077 involved an appeal by a Haitian woman who had claimed that if she were to go back to her country, she would be mistreated or threatened by people who attacked her in the past and could be raped, but RPD denied her Convention refugee. In the appeal, RAD pointed out that the RPD did not consider the harmful elements that may befall the lady and the truthfulness of her story. Therefore, RAD noted that RPD had failed to conduct sufficient analysis; RAD determined that the lady was a Convention refugee. The second case (no. 93012) is about a Nigerian lady who claimed that she feared going back to Nigeria due to violence from her spouse threats and by a chief. These claims were found not to be credible by RPD; thus, she was requesting RAD to set aside the decision made by RPD. However, RAD found that the appellant was not a Convention refugee and did not require protection.\n\nThe third case (no. 94385) involved a woman from Greece who alleged that she was being abused by her Canadian boyfriend she had visited in 2013. She feared going back to her home country because she feared her ex-boyfriend. RPD determined that she was not a Convention refugee as per provisions of section 96 of IRPA. The fourth case (no. 90749) entailed an appeal by citizens of Afghanistan after their claim of fear of persecution by a man believed to be a member of Taliban was denied by RPD. They alleged that the Taliban man would force the female appellant to marry him and kill the other appellants, based on IRPA guidelines RPD found their claims to be insufficient. On the appeal, RAD stated that the appellants were Convention refugees.\n\nThe fifth case (no. 83459) was about a Haiti woman who sought protection under section 96 and 97 of IRP act. First, she alleged fear of persecution because of being a member of a social group, i.e., being a woman and secondly, she feared persecution due to her family ties in which the father had imputed political opinions. Even though the possibility of persecution was found on the basis for belonging to a particular social group, RPD did not find the Haitian claim credible based on her familial affiliation; hence, the allegation was rejected. Finally, the sixth case (no. 96287) involved an appeal by a citizen of Cameroon against RPD’s decision to deny her asylum. She had claimed her ex-husband and his brother had threatened to kill her if she dared report the abuse they had subjected. The abuse included partner swapping and prostitution. RAD allowed the appeal and referred the case to RPD for redetermination. Appendix B is a further analysis of some of the cases.\n\nAnalysis of Four Cases\n\nIn the case no. 97077 (CA IRB) RAD noted that RPD had failed to conduct sufficient analysis as provided in subsection 111(1) of IRPA; RAD determined that the woman was a Convention refugee. In this case, RAD invoked different provisions that are provided under the IRPA subsections 99 (3.1), 111.1(1). As a result, the appeal incorporated gender-related claims of women into the interpretation of the existing enumerated grounds which brought into perspective the possibility of persecution. Therefore, based on this case, I agree with the statement. This is because at first the woman was denied protection but on appeal, proper guidelines were used which found her deserving the protection. Just as in the first case, case no. 90749 (CA IRB) the adjudication relied on provided guidelines of IRPA section 111(1) (b) to come to a conclusion that the Afghans required protection. It is important to note that in Canada, the protection of the refugees is not confined by legal or technical rules of evidence.\n\nThe basis for the determination is informed by the rationale that a claim may be considered credible based on the circumstance; the Refugee Board cannot reject a claim because it is based on hearsay, it has the mandate to provide evidence to disqualify story (Gerard and Pickering 339). In the incidence that the claimant swears an affidavit that the facts being provided are correct, it compels the board to have the presumptions that the said claims are true. Disqualification of such evidence should be based on valid reason. Credibility can be based on the manner in which a claimant has narrated a particular story; therefore, it can be seen that credibility for protection is anchored on balance of probabilities, in this case, RPD made a mistake in the determination of credibility. However, RAD applied reason and used the IRPA provisions to set aside the RPD decision.\n\nThese two cases with positive outcomes signify a milestone in protecting women from harm. Even though the women were found not to deserve the protection, the appeals applied the necessary guidelines that took into considerations the circumstances facing the women. The cases denote that Canada has taken appropriate measures to address some of the problems facing women asylum seekers. Therefore, to some extent, it can be argued that the country has recognized the political nature of the seemingly private acts of harm to women by establishing guidelines for women refugee claimants fearing gender-related persecution. As such, so far, Canada’s intent seems to be working.\n\nIn the case no. 83459 (CA IRB), RPD denied the woman a Convention refugee on basis that there were no credible evidence as provided in the IRPA sections 96 and 97. UNHCR asserts that a refugee should have a well founded fear of being persecuted based on reasons of religion, political opinion, membership to a particular social group, nationality or race and cannot return home because of such fears. Further, the Canadian guidelines acknowledge that a person is in need of protection if the Refugee Board finds that denying such person the asylum; it will expose him or her to grave danger of being persecuted. For example, if that person is likely to be tortured, or at risk of cruel or unusual treatment, she ought to be protected.\n\nIn this case, the tribunal found that there was a high possibility of persecution due to being a member of a particular social group, but went ahead to reject her appeal. The tribunal overlooked the provisions of IRPA section 97. On this basis, I hold the view that the statement is partly applicable to this case. For instance, it shows the inability of the “decision makers to incorporate gender-related claims of women into the interpretation of the existing enumerated grounds and their failure to recognize the political nature of seemingly private acts of harm to women.” On the other hand, the fact that the tribunal acknowledged the possibility of serious persecution due to her gender affiliation showed that there are efforts to remedy the challenges related to gender abuse.\n\nFinally, in the case 94385 (CA IRB) there is evidence that the required guidelines were followed, and hence it fully conforms to the assertions provided in the statement. It is worth noting that for one to enjoy the protection, she must qualify the definition of a Convention refugee, and in this case, the circumstances under which the woman sought asylum did not provide grounds that Greece cannot protect her from the ex-boyfriend.\n\nConclusion\n\nCanada provides refugee protection to people who fear persecution and other related dangers that they are likely to face in their home countries or just in Canada. The persecution may be torture or unusual treatment. It is provided that a woman who seeks protection from gender-related fear of persecution should be able to determine the linkage to gender affiliation; the said persecution should be based on the enumerated grounds in IRPA section 96 and 97. It is worth noting that Canada does list gender as one of the grounds for granting a Convention refugee status. However, women with well-founded fear of being persecuted due to the combination of the laid down grounds can be protected. From the analysis of the four cases, it can be deduced that parts of the statement apply and parts do not depending on the circumstances. For instance, decision makers especially the RPD tribunal erred in examining some circumstances that warranted protection while in others it was correct in its determinations.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCenter for Gender & Refugee Studies.

      "Bank of America’s Diversity Management Strategy Essay\n\nA Strategy for Managing Diversity in My Organization\n\nFor the last few years, I have been working for the Bank of America. The bank began its business in the mid 20 th century (Marcus, 2009). Currently, the organization has more than 300 branches in the US and 8 branches abroad. Being one of the largest banks in the world, the Bank of America is said to be among the most diverse global companies. Recent researches indicate that more than 45% of its management members are women. Some researches indicate that more than 40% of the members are from minority groups. In the 1970s and 1980s, men from the majority groups in the US-dominated the organization’s management.\n\nDiversity in the Bank of America is exhibited through the employees’ dissimilarities and similarities. This implies that diversity is not only a race, ethnic, or gender, issue, but comprises of other complicated issues that bring out the differences of the employees. Based on Thomas Roosevelt’s definition, in Bank of America, we have a finite number of diversity mixtures (Thomas, 2006). In the organization, we have diverse mixtures based on racial, ethnic, gender, profession, age, and religion. Our workforce compromises of individuals from various racial and ethnic backgrounds. We have employees of Caucasian, African American, Asian, and Hispanic backgrounds. All these individuals come from different cultural and religious backgrounds. These individuals come from various religions such as Christianity, Islam, and Judaism. Notably, the employees have diverse ages and professions.\n\nThe Bank of America’s diverse workforce has been able to surpass the company’s expectations increasing productivity. Despite these successes, our management has had to deal with numerous issues associated with the number of diversity mixtures. These challenges are racial, ethnic, gender, religious, profession, and age difference hostilities.\n\nAppropriate options for dealing with the above diversity tensions\n\nRoosevelt asserts that there are specific steps for tackling these diversity tensions. In the first step, Roosevelt urges managers to recognize diversity mixtures in their organizations. In doing so, managers should be able to identify themselves with various diversity mixtures in the organizations. The managers assigning themselves parts of the responsibilities of the ongoing tensions will achieve this. In the next step, the managers should be able to scrutinize the mixtures and their associated tensions. Through this step, our managers will be able to widen their outlooks and establish the effects the mixtures and their related tensions have on their capabilities to satisfy the organization’s objectives. In the third step, our manager will be required to choose a suitable response. Through this step, our managers would be able to evaluate their alternatives. After these steps, our managers should be able to settle on one specific approach based on their findings and conclusions.\n\nBased on the above specific diversity tensions unique to the Bank of America, our managers should select the following approaches. These approaches involve assimilating diversity, suppressing diversity, increasing diversity, building relationships, and fostering mutual adaptation. In our organization, there are workplace departments where diversity should be increased. For instance, the minority races are not appropriately represented at the executive level. This implies that there is a need to increase diversity at this level. Another level that needs an increase in diversity is the level where manual jobs are done. At this level, the minority races are heavily represented. I believe that there is no specific race suited for a particular job. In this regard, the management should be able to allocate jobs at these levels for all individuals regardless of their religious, racial, or gender backgrounds.\n\nBy assimilating language diversity, our managers should be able to insist that English, the official language, be spoken in the workplace. All other languages will be prohibited around the workplace. This will help in addressing issues related to language mixture. To eliminate issues related to gender mixture, religion mixture, and racial mixture, our managers should be able to suppress consciousness related to these diversity mixtures. For instance, individuals in the workplace should be able to perceive themselves as persons rather than as women and men. Similarly, they should be able to perceive themselves as workers of the common organization rather as being an Asian, Caucasian, African American or any other racial group. There should be a directive to prohibit workers from discussing issues concerned with their race, religion, or political affiliation in the workplace.\n\nThrough building relationships among the employees, our managers will enable the employees to understand and appreciate each other’s social, religious, or racial backgrounds. This can be achieved by offering the employees with regular seminars, workshops, and other social events. Through this, they will get to know one another better enhancing mutual respect. Lastly, our managers should foster mutual adaptation in the workplace to end issues related to religious mixtures. Through this initiative, every employee will be required to adjust his or her religious doctrines for the benefit of developing an appropriate work environment suitable for all religious groups.\n\nThe plan I would advocate for the organization to create meaningful diversity\n\nFor my organization to enhance a meaningful diversity, it should adopt an approach suggested by Roosevelt. This approach asserts that a meaningful diversity can be achieved if managers talk, think, and walk their talk. Concerning this, our managers should think critically to be able to manage a diverse workforce. By thinking, they would be able to come up with innovative ways of using the workforce diversity to the advantage of the organization and the employees. They should be able to think about how to position every employee to maximize their potential. For instance, African American salespersons should be sent on assignments in areas where the African American community is popular. Similarly, other salespersons from different races should be sent out to places they would be able to associate with the cultures in place. This will enhance their interactions with the members of the society improving on their work environment and increasing the much-needed returns.\n\nBy talking with the employees and other managers in different organizations, our managers can enhance our workforce diversity. They should be able to talk freely with the employees. Through this, they would be able to identify major diversity issues in the subordinate levels. By talking with other managers or mentors, they will be able to compare different approaches to enhancing diversity in the workplace.\n\nTo walk their talk, our managers should implement everything they utter. For instance, when they say diversity is a major factor in the success of our company, they should embrace diversity at the executive level. Both the minority and the majority group members should be represented equally at all organizational levels under the directive of our managers (Thomas, 2006).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it should be noted that diversity is a major factor behind the success of several multinational companies (Weeks, 1994). In the Bank of America, there are several diversity mixtures. These mixtures are based on race, age, religion, and profession. These diversity mixtures have fueled the success of our organization. Despite their importance, these mixtures have fueled animosity between employees from different backgrounds. Our managers should assimilate diversity, suppress diversity, increase diversity, build relationships, and foster mutual adaptation, to end the animosities resulting from workplace diversity.\n\nReferences\n\nMarcus, G.

      "The Impact of Demand on College Tuition Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. College enrollments\n 3. The dramatic rise in the price of a college education\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the last 30 years, the real price of college education in the United States has increased remarkably. At the same time, the number of high school graduates seeking a college education has increased. Faculty wages, administrative staffing and capital costing have also increased remarkably while government spending on universities has been reduced. In as much as these changes have been observed, the major determining factors are demand and supply of college education services.\n\nCollege enrollments\n\nCollege enrollment increased in the United States accompanied by a dramatic rise in average tuition. This contradicts the law of downward-sloping demand which states that, if the price of a good or service falls, with all other economic factors held constant, then the quantity demanded increases (Deepashree, 2006, p.3-7). The price of a college education is the tuition the students are required to pay while the quantity demanded is represented by the number of enrollments. In this case, however, the higher number of enrollments is not a result of a reduction in tuition. Therefore, if other influencing factors like population increase are held constant, then the change observed does not follow the law of demand. According to microeconomics, the number of enrollments would have risen if the average tuition fell to obey the law of downward-sloping demand.\n\nThe dramatic rise in the price of a college education\n\nAs noted earlier, the trends in quantity demanded and the price of college does not follow the law of downward-sloping curve. The major reason is that other factors have a greater influence on demand and supply. Thus, the dramatic rise in price can best be explained by considering other influencing factors such as administrative expenditures, capital costs and faculty wages among others.\n\nSupposing that the market was initially at equilibrium and the demand and supply was determined by the market price, a fall in price would cause an increase in demand and a decrease in supply (Keat & Young, 2009). However, other factors have caused the whole market to shift. In this case, these factors are not held constant meaning that price and quantity demanded can rise simultaneously. That is there are shifts in demand and supply.\n\nA shift in demand occurs when there are changes in factors other than the price of a good which affects the quantity purchased (Samuelson & Marks, 1999). Demand increases or decreases when the quantity demanded at each price increases or decreases. As elements underlying demand change, the demand for a college education is affected and the demand curve shifts rightward as shown below.\n\nA shift in supply occurs when there are changes in factors other than the price of a good which affects the quantity supplied (Samuelson & Marks, 1999). Supply increases or decreases when the quantity supplied at each price increases or decreases As elements underlying supply change, the supply of college education is affected and the supply curve shifts rightward as shown below.\n\nAt every instance of the shifts, the demand for a college education is higher than the supply causing a rise in the price. Therefore, the failure to achieve equilibrium as the demand and supply shift has resulted in a dramatic rise in the price of a college education over the years.\n\nConclusion\n\nAn increase in college enrollments and the accompanying rise in tuition does not reflect the law of downward-sloping demand. The rightward shift in both the demand and supply curves causes a rise in price. Over thirty years, this increase is nothing but dramatic.\n\nReferences\n\nDeepashree. (2006).

      "Golds Reling Company: Customer Satisfaction and Marketing Essay\n\nMethods forGolds Reling, Inc. to effectively measure customer satisfaction for the new product launch\n\nTo measure the customer satisfaction rates for the new product launch, Gold Reling, Inc. should consider such methods as carrying out personal interviews among the target audience and sending questionnaires to the company’s clientele via e-mail. Though each of the specified methods is used quite actively as a means to measure customer satisfaction, one must admit that surveys sent by e-mail are often ignored or sent to the trash box – or, worse yet, to the spam box. Therefore, while being hasty, personal interviews can be considered a perfect solution. For this purpose, the organization could follow the process of customer identification and gathering data through customer surveys (Iacobucci, 2014).\n\nTo create an application for the iTunes store, which will enjoy popularity, one will have to carry out several surveys among the target audience, as well as to conduct several tests that will help identify the current demands. As a result, a deep analysis of the customers’ needs and demands can be carried out, and a better understanding of the tendencies regarding the demand can be provided.\n\nMarketing strategy options for Golds Reling, Inc.\n\nGold Reling, Inc. may adopt the strategies call-to-action marketing and direct marketing (Iacobucci, 2014). The latter will help spread awareness among the target clientele at the same time, providing the customers with enough options for learning about the new application, its benefits, pricing, etc. The former, in its turn, will have a more subtle, yet just as impressive effect, as it will encourage the potential customers to consider buying the product after they have learned about it from direct marketing carried out by the company.\n\nSeeing that Facebook has become a corporate giant and dominates the social networking market is not only the United States but also in a range of other countries, creating a marketing strategy that will allow a company to compete with it is not an easy task. The strategy aimed at stressing the characteristics of the new network that Facebook lacks may become an opportunity. In this case, the social network in question should be marketed to the target audience not as a rival of Facebook, but as an entirely different concept, the unique phenomenon that people have not seen yet. Also, it will be reasonable to advertise the new network with the help of so-called search marketing. Google is not only a search tool, but also a powerful marketing tool, and one must not underestimate its potential.\n\nThe most important concepts in the Marketing course\n\nAmong the key concepts that have been learned over the course, the phenomenon of customer satisfaction and the theory of consumer buying behavior deserve to be mentioned (Iacobucci, 2014). A closer look at the strategies that a range of modern SMEs use for attracting new clientele shows that the significance of customer satisfaction is often underestimated by a range of minor organizations, which leads to their untimely and inevitable demise. The information learned during the course has not only shed some light on the issue but also provided instructions on achieving customer satisfaction comparatively easily.\n\nAnother essential concept to be born in mind, the theory of consumer buying behavior must be put on the list of peculiar issues to consider. While the very idea of determining buyer behavior seems rather dubious, one must admit that the assumptions provided by the authors of the theory are worth taking into account. Though, in most cases, the buying behavior is determined by the customer’s personal needs, current trends do have a tangible effect on the buying behavior, which may help locate a strategy for increasing the company’s sales.\n\nReference List\n\nIacobucci, D.

      "International Business Machines: Leadership Development Proposal\n\nIntroduction\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) is a computer technology company with a special interest in information technology. The company principally deals in manufacturing of computer hardware, software, and consultancy. This paper will analyze IBM from a leadership development perspective (De Wit & Meyer 2004).\n\nOver the years, IBM has evolved to be the number two desktop manufacturer and seller in the world after Lenovo. Market analysts and experts argue that IBM is likely to trounce Lenovo in the recent years to be the number one seller of desktops. It is also notable that its affiliate businesses are performing quite well (Castells 2011). The company has acquired various strategic competitors and strategic partners in its bid to be the best producer and seller of a host of products. The most notable merger, and arguably the most strategic, was the acquisition of Nokia’s Smartphone division. Happening against a backdrop of the hosts declining appeal the world over and a shakeup in its internal operations, IBM was quite a shock purchaser of the division. However, it quickly turned this misfortune into profits and fortunes (Drury 2007).\n\nIn light of previously commendable acquisitions and mergers, IBM has continued this business practice in various countries. The company’s desire for global presence is the most compelling factor in this endeavor. Hence, the company continues to acquire small and strategically placed players in local markets where they shift. The practice is quite helpful with amalgamation into the local markets and eventual appreciation of its products in those markets. Entry into new markets from a local position is easier than from main headquarters (Chase & Aquilano 2006).\n\nIBM ought to take action and reform its leadership styles. Research has shown that effectiveness is measured depending on the people’s achievements, their skills, and behavior. IBM has vast resources at its disposal. By contrast, IBM has been losing billions of dollars in paying fines arising from careless management. The amount of loss can be reduced if the company employs a management team that exercises visionary leadership, does things the way they are expected, understands the business and its key drivers, and can locate resources according to appropriately laid down procedures. The new management should be able to undertake innovation duties accurately, adapt and respond to market changes appropriately, and anticipate problems before they happen. Moreover, it should handle problems that arise unexpectedly with sufficient care. Leaders that use these techniques are transformational.\n\nIBM’s management failed to be responsible following inadequate appreciation of past mistakes. Transformational leaders are good at learning from the past. To solve the challenges sufficiently, the company should employ transformational leaders. The frequent rate at which suits are filed against IBM demonstrates the inability of the current leaders to take charge of the company’s operations. According to prominent leadership theories, an effective leadership must have control over its followers and develop proper communication channels (Gray & Larson 2008). The leader must be able to share his/her vision with the entire team efficiently. Moreover, effective managers need to have the ability to switch flexibly from one model of management to another, depending on the needs of different people and the situation. Besides, effective leadership requires understanding of exceptional methods of influencing employees to operate according to laid-down policies and regulations. The leader should earn the respect of other employees because of the effective ways of performing tasks (Haberberg & Rieple 2007).\n\nResearch Question and Objectives\n\nResearch Question\n\nThe global business environment is filled with dynamism and change with globalization and technological changes affecting many businesses. Due to these changes, it is necessary that firms establish the best strategies that can sustain their objectives in the future rather than making them quit the market. Following these challenges, firms have increased competitiveness using strategic planning with the management establishing existing business conditions in the business environment that are used to establish the best strategies that can increase competitiveness of the firm after their implementation. This paper will look into strategic management’s contribution towards tipping sales at IBM. The paper will look at strategic management from a leadership development perspective.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThis study is aims to:\n\n  * Find out the organizational leadership dimension of IBM Company,\n  * Establish the efficiency of the organizational leadership of the company.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nThis section will analyze literature regarding leadership development theories and IBM.\n\nTransformational Style of Leadership\n\nThe leadership style looks into levels high in Maslow’s hierarchy of needs, which are associated with a basic outlook on life. A strategic plan involves various components that are significant to an organization. To begin with, the plan should have a mission and vision statement. These two are critical components since they stipulate the purposes of the firm both in the immediate short period and in the long term. The two components indicate the objectives of the firm. With these components, the firm is able to review them regarding their achievements continuously (Sarros & Santora 2001).\n\nEnvironment Scan: The other component is the scan of the environment that involves the establishment of various challenges existing in the business environment together with the opportunities that a firm can exploit in order to meet its set objectives. Under this component, the firm collects, scrutinizes, and provides information related to formulation of strategies from the environment. The scanning of the environment may involve SWOT and PESTEL analyses that analyze both the internal and external environments of the firm. The scrutiny of the environment should be continuous so that a clear picture of the factors affecting the firm both internally and externally can be established and accurate strategies formulated (Scott-Halsell, Shumate & Blum 2008).\n\nStrategy Formulation: This feature of a business plan is significant since it is related to the existing challenges and opportunities of the firm closely. Through this process, the firm decides the best strategy that it can take in order to meet its set objectives and therefore end up attaining its set purpose. The common strategies are corporate, business and functional strategies that have to be incorporated in the business plan (Hitt & Hoslisson 2008).\n\nStrategy Implementation: Under strategic management processes, implementation of a strategy is one of the important steps toward achievement of company goals. Formulation of strategies does not stop there. There is need to implement the strategies through stipulated measures in order to attain set goals. As the strategy is put into action, the firm may implement various things such as designing its structure, manufacture and distribution of products, development of the process of decision-making and managing human resources among others (Sher & Lee 2004).\n\nMonitoring and Evaluation: it is another significant step in planning where the implemented strategy has to be monitored to ensure that it is implemented as stipulated in the strategy guidelines. In addition, effective implementation will ensure that set objectives are achieved. As the final step of strategy management, evaluation involves appraising the strategy in terms of internal and external factors that form the root of the strategy (Eeden, Cilliers & Deventer, 2008). Through evaluation, a firm ensures that the formulated strategy and its implementation meet the organization set objectives. All these steps are conducted in a chronological order to ensure efficiency and attainment of the company’s purposes (Harris & Bromiley 2007).\n\nPersonality is the constant realignment of the psychological systems within an individual that determines his adaptations to the immediate environment. It is reflected by external traits or internal manifestations demonstrable by external acts. The extensive studies on personality have led to the concept of personality theory. This concept states that an individual’s inherent characteristics are demonstrated through their behavior in a consistent manner over time. However, the consistency thereof is sometimes affected by structures, cultures, beliefs, norms, and environments within which the individual is operating. The typology of personality traits has resulted in five major personalities of individuals. They include a concoction of factors ranging from creativity, hard work, anxiety, and goal orientation. Other typologies are quite specific or unreliably broad. They include a four-factor rating that breeds sixteen personalities and a broad measure that arrives at Type A and Type B personalities respectively.\n\nTim Johnson demonstrates Type ‘A’ Personality. These individuals have an unsettled mind when it comes to making and implementing of decisions. Additionally, they would want to see changes effected immediately when they settle their mind to do something. Tim, having realized the disorganized nature the company was operating in day one, went to sleep having a headache. The next day he woke up early to see for himself what the morning staffs do before office hours. This is a sign of empathy. This completely contrasts to the previous CEO who took no interest in the affairs of the workers. Hence, the previous CEO had a type B personality. The current CEO of IBM has a Machiavellian belief that guides his attention to details, which is why he rearranges the details of the workers, and comes up with job descriptions and work procedures. He believes that ‘ends justify means’. The previous CEO, on the other hand, is a classical narcissist. She did not care about her staff and never really got interested in what they did. Since the company was making huge profits, it follows that she would only concentrate on impressing her bosses. This demonstrates the fact that she was arrogant to the staff, had a high sense of self-importance, and was constantly looking to hurt others in order to justify it. In addition, it shows she was excessively looking for recognition and could not stand any competition (Eeden, Cilliers and Deventer, 2008).\n\nTransactional Leadership Style\n\nThe leadership style pays attention to rewards and punishments in realization of organizational goals. Different researchers present varying definitions of a leader’s value. However, ultimately it can be summarized as a combination of evaluative and unwavering beliefs that act as a guidance in personal preferences for courses of action in everyday situations. Hence, values are a moral compass that informs an individual on what is right or wrong. Most individuals develop these values early and this makes them stable and true in their life. Although values are hard at forming typologies, researchers have made harried attempts at this, which has arrived at two broad categorizations. The categorizations are the Rokeach Value Classification and the Schwartz Values Circumplex. There is a direct link between values and personal behavior. However, their application is based upon the situation. For example, there must be a reason for us to apply values to situations that present a case or remind us of our values hence leading to a compelling need for application (Manzoor 2012).\n\nThe case study presents a situation where the two CEOs have to apply values they believe in. former CEO comes out as a person whose values are motivated by impressing her superiors. Hence, the club amasses huge profits but leaves huge lacunas in the management of human resources. This leads to hospitalization of a number of them because of accidents at work and stress related absenteeism. However, the other CEO takes on an empathetic route. He takes an active role in ensuring that employees get the best from their work and are adequately motivated. However, he personally believes that employees are not only motivated by money hence he does not take that route. Rather, he embarks on reconstructing the structures of the company as relates to employees. For example, he develops procedures, which clearly demarcates various job positions, puts in place job descriptions, and sets up worker protection policies (Hansen, Mowen & Guan 2007).\n\nIBM and Leadership Styles\n\nIBM is a global company with presence in many countries. In some of the countries, the company has regional operations. Global penetration has been the model of operations, which had helped the company to trounce major players in the tech industry such as Dell, Lenovo, and Apple Inc. However, since the global economic downturn, the company has experienced major reshuffles in its operations strategy to remain relevant and competitive. The company has developed two business groups with different focuses. One focuses on the developed market while the other focuses on the emerging markets (Masdoor 2011). The two market groups are christened the mature market group and the emergent market group respectively. The former covers traditional markets such as United States and Australia. The latter covers emerging markets such as Brazil, Africa and a huge part of Asia. Using this two-pronged strategy, the company has continued to localize its operations. The localizations have gone a notch higher whereby the company is producing some of its products in certain nontraditional countries such as Russia and Brazil. According to the company’s strategy, this is to cater for localized markets and to retain local jobs, which is what immediate governments need. This ultimately creates loyalty and drives sales levels of IBM’s products (Kay 1993).\n\nThe magnitude of IBM’s operations requires a coordinated and focused supply chain. The company is decentralizing operations with the view that this will strengthen the supply chain even further (Schreyögg & Busse 2006). The company’s long-term focus is to be the best producer of a range of technology products in terms of sophistication of design and engineering. Hence, the company taps into innovative resources such as research and personnel. In recognition of the ever-growing interest in other gadgets, apart from PCs, and the declining nature of appeal of personal computers in traditional and emerging markets, the company has intensified its productivity and creativity to create relevant products (Mintzberg & Ghoshal 2003). The company’s tablets and smart phones are featuring second in the global market with a notable appreciation outside the traditional markets (Radón 2012). Hence, the company needs to continue its steadfast adherence to operational efficiency to understand the performance of all these products in the various markets (Davenport & Brooks 2004).\n\nIBM has recorded a continued rise in sales for the past five years. In the 2012/2013 financial year, the company recorded a 12% increase in total sales bolstered by the exemplary performance of the tablet and Smartphone markets. Although the company’s destination of sales cannot be singled out, tremendous growth in the market for tablets in China is notable. The company came in second in tablet sales in China after Apple. The company also recorded a steady performance in PC sales. Although there was not significant growth in traditional markets, the sales of PCs in emerging markets was quite notable (Johnson, Whittington & Scholes 2011). For example, shipments in Asia, Middle East and to some extent Africa increased. The trend is likely to continue as more governmental effort is directed towards improvement in digital penetration across those nations. In future, it is likely that IBM will record more and more sales of PCs in these emerging markets (Barney 2002).\n\nRegarding the sales of tablets, smart phones and other technology leaning gadgets that replace PCs, traditional markets are the main attractions. However, in emerging markets IBM is excelling in the sales of its new gadgets (Chapman, Hopwood & Shields 2006). First movers such as Apple and IBM have entrenched themselves in these markets with notable authority. Hence, it is incumbent upon IBM to continue its two-pronged approach towards market penetration to tap into these markets exhaustively with its new products (Ahrens & Chapman 2007).\n\nTheories of Leadership\n\nFunctional Theory\n\nThe above theory predicts and identifies the behaviours of the leaders that contribute to organizational success. The theory suggests that a leader’s primary aim is to observe that all that is necessary for the success of the group is attained. Functional leadership is often used for the study and improvement of team leadership. Organizations have also applied the theory in a broader, more inclusive, concept. A leader, according to the theory, performs vital functions. Some of them include environmental monitoring, secondary activities, and coaching.\n\nPositive Reinforcement\n\nModification of behaviour produces a positive reinforcement to people’s ideas and performance, which occurs because of the positive effect of leadership. Reinforcements provide a suitable stimulus to evoke the best performances of people. For example, when an employer decides to praise and appreciate an employee whenever he comes on time, it will have positive effect on him. The employee, in return of this stimulus, will show up on time regularly in order to gain this praise. Positive reinforcement is now a significantly successful practice in influencing behaviours of subordinates. It motivates people to deliver their best. Many large and successful companies have used positive reinforcement successfully to gain advantages.\n\nMethods\n\nIn statistical research, we use sampling on many occasions. It would be hard to engage a whole population in a study because of the costs and time associated with such a census. However, in many a sample, there is the possibility of errors. Statistically, these errors result in bias. We also infer results by using methods such as hypothesis testing and estimation, which may not be entirely true in the entire population. In this case, IBM is an all-inclusive sample that helps the researcher to make a conclusion. To collect data, the researcher will use interviews. Interviewing is a method of collecting data from human beings by asking them questions for which they answer verbally. It is a systematized way of talking and listening to people in order to get information regarding a particular topic or phenomena. In interviews, the respondent provides the primary data for the study and the views of the researcher are not important as most of the information comes from the respondent. The respondents are able to give their conceptualizations and interpretations regarding the topic under study.\n\nInterviews have the following advantages\n\nMore Information\n\nThey allow for probing, follow up, and it is possible to get in-depth information on a topic. They also have many disadvantages, which include consumption of time and expensive administration. They cannot be used with a large number of people as they are quite taxing and take time to complete. Chances of interviewer bias are also high especially in close-ended interviews. Analysis of data may take time. In a situation where data from open-ended interviews is involved, respondents may not remember key information. In this study, the sample of the study will be workers.\n\nEqual Chance of Selection\n\nThere is a random selection of people to involve in the study. This ensures that every member of the population under study has an equal opportunity of selection. Hence, a well representative sample. Issuance of questionnaires to the participants will follow. Each questionnaire will have five questions each seeking to get different information related to the study. Four questionnaires will be issued to the participants. Each questionnaire will take approximately ten minutes to complete.\n\nConfidentiality\n\nThroughout this study, utmost confidentiality of the participants will be ensured. All information gathered during this study will also be treated with utmost confidentiality. No names or any other information that can be used for identification will appear on any of the materials that will be used during the interview. Each respondent will be given an identification number that will be used in all interview materials. Researchers will use tape recorders to record conversations. They will be destroyed after they have been transcribed and analyzed to ensure that nobody else, apart from the research team, accesses the information in them (Ragin 2005).\n\nResearch Design\n\nThe research is a qualitative study that uses semi-structured interviews to study an organization’s worker in their natural settings. The idea is to make sense of, or to interpret, phenomena in terms of the meaning these people bring to them. Qualitative approach allows researchers to understand the point of view of the research participants. Qualitative research makes the study contextual and reflective. The main benefit to be obtained from this qualitative study is gaining knowledge about an organization from workers’ roles in their workplace (Holliday 2007).\n\nData Collection and analysis\n\nQualitative analysis as the process of systematically searching through and arranging interview transcripts and other materials that have been accumulated, to increase the researcher’s understanding of them (Hay 2010).\n\nResearch Ethics\n\nGiven the nature of this qualitative research, ethical considerations are closely linked to the deontological view (Creswell 2003).

      "The “Paper Sons” Practice – Legal or Not? Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nThe end of 19 th century was characterized by the intense immigration of Chinese people to the US. The reasons were various, but the tree of them might be distinguished as major. First, the discovering of gold in California. Numerous amounts of people seeking for wealth started to move to the Southwestern coast of America, and Chinese among them (Portes 45). Second, the economic situation in China was hard as China was dominated by the British Empire providing fewer opportunities for common people to earn money and support their families. Third, for all the immigrants America has been a not another place to live or earn money, it was a symbol of opportunities, freedoms, ways to fulfill their potential, live another, better life, change something into a good and prosperous way.\n\nIn 1882, the United States government faced a serious problem not capable of conducting a large number of immigrants from China attracted by Californian Golden Rush. In attempts to regulate this constant flow, the Congress issued execution laws that forbade people from China, “Mongolians” to gain American citizenship through naturalization (Hsu 47). That was the first step in preventing Cheese from becoming rightful Americans, leading to their isolations, and unification within communities, making strong international bonds and providing support to people of the same nationality (Kanazawa 801).\n\nLater on the legal practice together with common treatment of Chinese immigrants began leaning towards separation from other American community, as a governmental policy was to mark them as strangers, people of other way of life, people, people that will never be understood by Americans, people that will never accept the American way of life (Lau 14). A good example of disregarding attitude can be demonstrated by the fact that the testimony of Chinese people witnessing against the white man who committed serious crime were not taken into account as the intellectual development of people of this race were considered beyond a certain point (Joo 353).\n\nThis neglecting deepened as Chinese began to be considered as threat, due to economic depression and a limited number of working places. And the neglecting and suspicious attitude stayed even decades later when authorities continued to be reprehensible towards Chinese people when providing them with American citizenship (Lai 51)\n\nIf to evaluate the situation from the point of legality, it might be considered as violating the Fourteenth Amendment of American Constitution. The Chinese had a full right to apply for the right to stay, work, and later apply for the citizenship, as well as representatives of other nationalities. However, their general right, according to the American laws was disrupted by American authorities themselves.\n\nThe only adequate respond Chinese immigrants could come with was introduction of “paper sons” system. As the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees that the people who were born in the United States will gain the citizenship, false paper pieces of evidence and documents were made-up by Chinese immigrants. As the person who proved his or her right to be called American by the right of birth, could bring all his family to America providing them with new life and possibilities.\n\nThis activity required close cooperation, solidarity and unity within Chinese immigrant society, as the complete strangers should have had provided the relative-like evidence for the newcomers they saw the first time in their life. As the scheme functioned successfully, it brought new complications and the problems for American authorities dealing with immigration issues, by making the procedure of Chinese people registration more complex and extended.\n\nThe “paper sons” system, invented by Chinese immigrants was the only response to the violation of their rights guaranteed by the American Constitution. Moreover, the fact that the violation was performed by American authorities does not make this act legal in any case.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHsu, Madeline. “Gold Mountain Dreams and Paper Son Schemes: Chinese Immigration Under exclusion.” Chinese America: History and Perspectives 11 (1997): 46-61.

      "Ethical Awareness Inventory in Psychology Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nEthical Awareness Inventory is a program designed to identify people’s ethical style based on the kind of characters they are. Normally, we are used to evaluating other people and their actions according to our own moral views and ideas. Ethical Awareness Inventory employs a general set of qualities and principles that helps to determine individuals’ deeper virtues and describe their ethical characters.\n\nThe Role of Personal Ethics in Psychology, Principles and the Code of Conduct\n\nPersonal ethics is highly crucial in interpersonal relationships. It helps individuals to see the importance of integrity, wisdom, and honesty (Ethics Awareness Inventory 2011). In psychological professions, for example, it serves to assist the experts in dealing with their clients in the most appropriate and moral manner. Personal and professional ethics help experts with the decision making that agrees with the standards of their specialties and respects the rights of every client.\n\nAs stated by the Williams Institute for Ethics and Management, the Code of Conduct cannot make an individual behave in an ethical manner; in order to make ethical decisions, an individual must be intrinsically moral (Ethics Awareness Inventory 2011). Therefore, the inventory helps people transform their characters with the purpose of proving their integrity. The transformation is provided by means of viewing one’s character as evidence of ethics.\n\nEffects of Applying Ethics on Psychological Principles in Personal, Spiritual, Social and Organizational Issues\n\nEthics Awareness Inventory exhibits the value of ethics as an example of spirituality instead of self-righteousness. The inventory is meant to use the character in order to help with the growth of spirituality. The program opposes rule-following at the expense of qualities such as honesty, wisdom, and integrity. These features should be learned and applied willingly through various experiences instead of being a result of simple rule-following.\n\nThe creators of the Ethical Awareness Inventory advocate dealing with everybody according to the fundamental beliefs and current definition of ethics within interpersonal relationships. Individuals should avoid judging other people and, instead, help them understand the exact meaning of ethics (Ethics Awareness Inventory 2011).\n\nIn organizations, the Ethics Awareness Inventory proposes considering an individual’s rights before moving to the rights of the institution. The management teams should not impose their decisions on individuals. They should allow the employees to make their choices without interference. Bringing individual approach, freedom, respect, and new opportunities to the organizations are one of the most important workplace policies (Ethics Awareness Inventory 2011). In other words, all the decisions of the organization should include every employee’s input.\n\nEffects of Ethics on Psychological Knowledge and Personal Growth, Health, and Development\n\nPersonal growth is the ability to know and do what is right as opposed to blindly following existing rules. Therefore, an individual attains personal growth when they reach a point where their actions follow the moral standards of society. This means that individuals struggle to streamline their behaviors in the process of growing up. Development entails the capacity to differentiate between right and wrong. This ability is a characteristic of mature human beings, and, therefore, is very crucial in determining whether an individual has developed fully or not; the society normally considers one’s ability to make such decisions before declaring them as fully developed.\n\nEthics may also affect the existing principles of health. For example, some of the doctors may consider seeing the nakedness of patients of the opposite sex unethical. At the same time, clients may also find it difficult to undress in front of the doctors of the opposite sex. If the hospital does not have enough doctors, such patients would have to wait for a long time before getting treated.\n\nAdvantages of Psychology as a Degree Choice\n\nPsychology studies human behavior and mental processes. It also covers topics that include perception, motivation, stress management, dreams, mental disorders, and harmful behavioral patterns. Psychologists focus on solving emotional and behavioral issues of the society. Psychological issues directly affect the life of human beings. A professional with a degree in psychology is always wanted in modern society due to the stressful and harsh conditions modern people have to live and work in.\n\nUnderstanding of the importance of psychology and the impacts it creates for a society made me choose this field as my degree course. Psychologists acknowledge that every individual perceives the world differently. This approach makes the profession of a psychologist very complex and challenging. A natural interest in psychology, its massive meaning for the whole world, and love to help people made me choose to pursue a degree in this area in spite of all the obstacles it contains.\n\nConclusion\n\nEthics is very crucial for an individual and the interaction among people. It is also essential in decision-making within an organization. Everyone needs to be ethical when dealing with other people. In addition, people in authority must respect the views of their subjects, and their decisions should represent all their subjects’ opinions (Plante 2011). It is also important to evaluate the ethical impacts of various professions before choosing a career.\n\nReference List\n\nEthics Awareness Inventory. (2011).

      "Child Sex Abuse Impact on Adult Psychopathology Essay\n\nSummary of the Topic\n\nThe article by Roth (2012) addresses the issue of gene-environment and the important role it plays in determining the functions of the brain. According to Roth (2012), the changes taking place during the early stages of development in a human being, especially those taking place in sensitive areas, may result in alterations in the genes. However, the changes do not necessarily affect the structure of the DNA. According to Roth (2012), some of the behaviors found in children result from DNA methylation and histone acetylation. The two are biomechanical processes known as epigenetics. The behaviors referred to here are especially those emanating from stress, parental care, and abuse. In the article, Roth (2012) also analyzes neurobiological changes. To this end, epigenetic mechanisms are believed to affect developmental changes in neurobiology and behavior.\n\nHuman memory stores a lot of information from the past. According to the article by Roth (2012), the individual can learn from some of these recollections. Different experiences, such as those to do with prenatal stress and infant separation, may interfere with the formation of associative fear memory. The interference affects the ‘filing’ of some of the experiences in the memory. As such, the individual may get affected any time they recall those experiences stored in the brain (Roth, 2012). According to Roth (2012), epigenetics explain how adulthood stressors can change the functions of the brain. Change in the behavior of the brain may lead to psychiatric disorders. The reason is that the alterations are brought about by dysregulation of epigenetic mechanisms in the body.\n\nIntroduction to Child Sex Abuse and its Impacts on Adult Psychopathology\n\nAs a social problem, child molestation is brought about by a number of factors. In some cases, analysts have shown that parents play a direct or indirect role in the sexual harassment of their children. Loss of self-esteem and trust are some of the impacts that go beyond childhood. Others are a sense of guilt and mixed feelings (Breedlove & Watson, 2013). A number of biological changes are likely to occur in the brain of the minor. Such developments change their behavior depending on the intensity of the situation (Beach et al., 2013).\n\nChild sex abuse may also lead to epigenetic changes in the DNA of the individual. However, it is noted that the changes do not affect the structure of the DNA (Ducci et al., 2008). On the contrary, they only alter how it expresses itself in the body. Reduction in gene expression is induced by DNA methylation. The condition leads to the development of a disease in the area of DNA (Roth, 2012). If the methylation happens to occur in the brain, then the individual is likely to have problems relating with other people (McGowan et al., 2009). The DNA methylation process is used to explain how the brain can be affected by incidences of molestation at childhood. Consequently, Beach et al. (2013) used a model to test parents and children from families associated with symptoms of antisocial personality disorder.\n\nMethods and Results\n\nMethods\n\nBeach et al. (2013) used adoptees and adoptive parents recruited from Iowa region. During the experiment, Beach et al. (2013) gathered information from various medical centers in Iowa. They used data pertaining to patients who had visited the facilities with problems related to sex abuse. Beach et al. (2013) used data starting from 1975. Additional information was gathered from psychiatric centers. Names of the people who received help from these establishments in Iowa were noted to support investigations during the experiment.\n\nInformation from inmates in the State of Iowa Correctional Centers was used to show what contributed to their behaviors. Records from the medical centers were used to show the symptoms and problems associated with these people. The records were also used to tell of any substance abuse. If instances of substance abuse were identified, Beach et al. (2013) tried to establish whether they were related to childhood sexual molestation.\n\nBeach et al. (2013) also gathered information from structured interviews conducted with the participants. The interviews were used to determine the extent to which the respondents were affected by depression (Ducci et al., 2008). The responses provided during the interviews were used to determine the activity in the brain of the participant. Biological measures were also used to determine genetic activities among the participants. Half of the biological parents were considered positive for genetic load (Beach et al., 2013).\n\nResults\n\nThe research activity carried out by Beach et al. (2013) was meant to ascertain the impact of child sex abuse on the brain. The experiment showed that the effects varied between male and female participants. Beach et al. (2013) put these down to variations in emotional weaknesses between the two sexes. According to Beach et al. (2013), CSA was reported 10 times more by female than by male participants.\n\nMost of the female respondents reporting sexual abuse at childhood tended to be associated with antisocial personalities. The affected participants lacked empathy towards other people, something that was clearly brought out in the experiment. The individuals were reckless and tended to engage in antisocial behaviors. According to Beach et al. (2013), most of these manifestations are associated with activities in the brain. From the experiment, Beach et al. (2013) established that the brain was one of the major parts of the body affected by child sex abuse.\n\nBeach et al. (2013) focused more on child sex abuse involving family members. It was found that the problem was reported more by females than by males. In addition, Beach et al. (2013) found that many children were abused by their family members or close relatives. Due to fear and guilt, the participants were unable to receive or access any help after the abuse.\n\nIn addition to focusing on epigenetic changes, the experiment aimed at highlighting the effects of substance abuse on the lives of children. It was found that alcohol and other drugs were abused by many adoptees in Iowa. The problem was also common among inmates in the State of Iowa Correctional Center (Beach et al., 2013). The experiment also analyzed how female participants were affected by substance abuse (McGowan et al., 2009). According to Beach et al. (2013), substance abuse is one of the impacts of child sex abuse. Most of the affected participants tended to resolve their problems and their feelings by using drugs. The practice affected their general wellbeing, especially with regards to their way of thinking.\n\nIn the study, Beach et al. (2013) found that child sex abuse was driven by perpetrator’s access to the subject and not the characteristics of the victim. A possible explanation for the phenomenon was provided. Some of the major impacts of this form of sexual abuse were substance use and depression. It was also found that parent psychopathology or genetic load contributed to the epigenetic changes reported among the participants (Beach et al., 2013).\n\nAnalyses from the experiment showed that most of the participants were suffering from depression and stress. From the information gathered, it was found that the participants did not seek any help after the abuse. Lack of assistance aggravated the situation. Most of them were afraid of the outcomes. The problem continued to cause stress and depression due to the guilt they felt. Most of the Iowa adoptee participants and parents who were afraid to seek help were women. Male participants were more likely to seek assistance than their female counterparts (McGowan et al., 2009).\n\nThe incidences occurred to the participants when they were between the ages of 12 and 16. Only two of the respondents recorded to have sexual contact with a non-family member. Analysis from the interview also showed that the condition of most of the participants deteriorated as they grew older. Failure to seek medical help saw most of them abuse drugs like alcohol and bhang. According to Beach et al. (2013), the participants used the drugs to overcome the guilt and the stress on their mind due to the abuse.\n\nRecords from the psychiatric centers in Iowa showed that the affected persons were associated with drug abuse. Others were addicted to the substances. Failure to seek help in advance contributed to the problem. Biological measures were conducted on ten participants to confirm this. The results indicated that the abuse of the drugs affected the brain and the genetic functioning of many individuals. The analysis confirmed that genetic changes were not caused by the sexual abuse. On the contrary, they were as a result of other activities that individuals engage in, such as drug abuse (Beach et al., 2013). Instances of high blood pressure among some of the participants were observed after they were sexually abused. Smoking and excessive consumption of alcohol among the participants also contributed to the raised blood pressure.\n\nA number of persons in the correctional centers were responsible for some of the sexual abuses. The history of most of them indicated that they were once abused at childhood. Due to the maltreatment they got, most of them resorted to drugs. It was found that the substances affected part of their brains. The drugs did not get rid of the trauma they had experienced. Records from State of Iowa Correctional Center indicated that most of the inmates engaged in sexual abuse to revenge for what they had gone through in the past. Beach et al. (2013) concluded that if these patients had received help on time, the effects of abuse on their brains could have been reduced. Consequently, they could have been able to lead normal lives without stress.\n\nA Critique of the Experiments\n\nThe biological measure, the interview, and analysis of records from the correctional and psychiatric centers in Iowa gave similar results. Most of the people who were affected by the problem did not seek any help immediately as required. The approach adopted by Beach et al. (2013) helped to identify various ways through which the problem can be resolved. One of the ways entails seeking psychiatric help immediately after the sex abuse. It is noted that most psychiatric centers are doing a good job in protecting victims of sex abuse. The research by Beach et al. (2013) helped to show that most victims remain silent after the abuse. The silence is the main reason behind the various mental challenges (Roth, 2012).\n\nDifferent surveys indicate that most cases of suicide among the young people are caused by sexual abuse (Ducci et al., 2008). Some people resort to suicide as they are unable to deal with the problem. The deaths can be prevented by seeking early psychiatric help. Psychiatric assistance helps the victims to control the situation calmly without resorting to negative activities like drug abuse. The research by Beach et al. (2013) showed that social support restores the self-esteem of the victims. The help gives them the strength to survive the ordeal (Roth, 2012). Counseling could have helped majority of the victims in the correctional centers to resolve their problems. In addition, medical intervention can go a long way in reducing cases of sexually transmitted infections.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe impacts of child sex abuse are adverse. The subject has attracted a number of scholars to this field. Research conducted on this topic shows that most victims are affected both psychologically and physically. Studies show that some of the problems associated with the abuse can be prevented by seeking psychiatric help. Incidences of child sex abuse have increased in the modern society. Some of the perpetrators have mental problems.\n\nThe gene environment is responsible for some of the behaviors adopted by individuals at adulthood. Epigenetic changes determine the development of genes. Studies in this field show that most of the children affected by psychiatric and brain disorders suffer from cognitive dysfunctions. Suicidal behaviors are associated with changes in the brain’s genetic structure. However, psychiatric interventions can help such individuals deal with the experiences stored in their memory. Child sex abuse is one such experience that can change the functions of the brain. Addressing the problem can reduce its effects on the brain and ensure that the structure of the genes is not tampered with. Future studies can provide more information on this.\n\nReferences\n\nBeach, S., Brody, G., Lei, M., Gibbons, F., Gerrard, M., Simons, R.,…Philibert, R. (2013).

      "International Law and Its Regulations Essay\n\nInternational law is commonly demarcated as the set of guidelines and standards, which control the actions that take place beyond the pale of the legal limitations of countries. For the most part, to be precise, it is the regulations that spread on to three transnational relations: affairs between nation-states, relationships between entities (counting companies) and extraneous states, and relationships between entities from not the same countries.\n\nInternational laws administer party-political and financial dealings between states. The companies that are based in the United States and are directing their commerce further than the nationwide precincts are dependent on an assembly of host-state regulations and the internal rulings of the United States along with the international agreements and contracts. While obedience to these laws and regulations may not promise effectiveness, it is able to ease some of the encounters of conducting business in a foreign country.\n\nThe foundations of transnational regulations consist of treaties, transnational levies, universal doctrines of law as documented worldwide, the verdicts of state and lower courts of law, and academic studies. These resources are the constituents and practices that serve as the basis for the guidelines and ideologies amendable for the transnational public. They have been prejudiced by a wide variety of party-political and legitimate principles.\n\nCustomary international commandment represents those features of international law, which originate from traditions. As well as the overall ideologies of regulations and agreements, the customary international law usually is deliberated by the International Court of Justice, jurists, the United Nations, and its associate countries appear to be amongst the principal foundations of transnational regulations (Koskenniemi 48).\n\nThe massive preponderance of the administrations worldwide agrees to take as a standard the actuality of customary international law, even though there are a lot of opposing attitudes towards what regulations are delimited in this law.\n\nPublic international law distresses the construction and comportment of independent and autonomous countries; similar units, such as the Holy See; and international administrations (Dinstein 53). To a less significant point, international law is able to have an impact on international companies and personalities as well, an influence progressively developing further than internal legal clarification and implementation.\n\nPublic international law has augmented in custom and significance immensely over the last hundred years, as a result of the upsurge in worldwide commerce, ecological worsening on an international stage, the consciousness of human rights defilements, swift and massive escalations in intercontinental transference and prosperous development in universal public services.\n\nThe area of learning of the public international law syndicates two leading subdivisions: the commandment of states (jus gentium) and transnational arrangements and resolutions (jus inter gentes) (Anderson and Taylor 17).\n\nThe Italian jurist Sir Alberico Gentili was the first to conduct a study on public international law. It is typically eminent from ‘private international law’ that distresses the determination of encounter of regulations. In its foremost common sense, international law “consists of rules and principles of general application dealing with the conduct of states and of intergovernmental organizations and with their relations inter se, as well as with some of their relations with persons, whether natural or juridical” (McKeever par. 4).\n\nThe encounter of regulations frequently referred to as ‘private international law’ in civil law dominions, is eminent from the public international law for the reason that it administers engagements among private individuals rather than nations (or added transnational figures with upright) (Dollar 81).\n\nIt distresses the issues of which prerogative should be allowable to perceive a lawful disagreement among private entities, and which authority’s regulation should be implemented, consequently bringing up the questions of international law. Nowadays, the companies progressively possess the ability to shift their wealth and industry resource chains across their precincts, along with making transactions with other international organizations.\n\nThis phenomenon upsurges the number of arguments of an inter-state essence beyond an incorporated legal agenda and increases the significance of matters towards the enforceability of regular performances. Accumulative numbers of industries apply profitable adjudication under the New York Convention 1958 (Blanplain 41).\n\nA lot of doctrines in international law are consent-based ascendancy. This term implies that a public associate is not gratified to put up with this kind of international law, except in the cases when it has specifically agreed to a specific sequence of comportment. This is a subject of the dominion of the nation.\n\nOn the other hand, other features of international law appear to be not consent-founded but still are mandatory upon national and non-national entities, for instance, customary international law and dictatorial standards (jus cogens). Several of the customary international regulations upsurge to the rank of jus cogens by means of approval by the worldwide public as non-derogable privileges, despite the fact that other customary international regulations could be merely implemented by a minor assembly of nations.\n\nThe majority of nations are normally assured by customary international regulations irrespective of whether the nations have arranged these regulations internally or by means of treaties. For this reason, international law could be applied in order to explain the success of the Statecraft simulation.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAnderson, Margaret, and Howard Taylor.

      "UAE’s Main Economic Challenges Essay\n\nThe United Arab Emirates (UAE) is made of seven emirates which form the federation. The federation is rich in oil and natural gas, which happens to be its major exports and foreign exchange earner. Despite the economy prosperity of the rich oil country, the UAE faces some domestic and external challenges. The paper evaluates UAE’s main economic challenges, domestic issues, and its relations with the rest of the world.\n\nThe UAE was not adversely hit by the global financial crises like most of the developed states as its economic growth has been steady but slow. The UAE’s 2013 economic report shows that the property market was affected after property prices declined amid the downturn (Audi Saradar Group 1). As a result, its GDP declined although it has since increased, albeit at a slow pace. In 2012, the CPI for the UAE had increased by 0.7 % as a result of sustained growth of the UAE’s Central Bank foreign assets (Audi Saradar Group 1).\n\nHowever, Dubai Statistics Centre (DSC) has reported that increase in processing of electricity, housing, water, and gas, hotels, transport, and furniture increased consumer prices (Emirates News Agency 1). Additionally, Economic Report 2013 shows that in 2012, the total CPI had reached 117.29%, which represented a 0.5% increase compared to 2011 (Audi Saradar Group 2). The economy was also affected by inflation of 0.7%, which was a result of increased food prices.\n\nThe UAE labor market largely depends on foreigners from all walks of life. Since the 1990s, immigrants have been a major driver of the UAE’s economy as most of the domestic laborers lack the required skills to undertake available jobs (Malit and You 1). For this reason, most of the UAE nationals do not find employment in the skilled labor market. As such, the federation is affected by unemployment issues. For example, in 2011, the unemployment rate in the United Arab Emirates was 11.8% for UAE nationals compared to 1.9% for non-nationals (Abu Dhabi Government 1).\n\nMoreover, the unemployment rate in the total UAE labor force in 2011 was 2.8%, which has so far increased to 4.3%. According to Albuainain (2), the unemployment rate of UAE nationals is higher compared to that of foreigners. This is because most of the nationals are excluded from the workforce as they lack the required skills and expertise. The unemployment rate in the UAE has negative effects on economic growth as the government is forced to spend more on social benefits (Albuainain 1).\n\nThe UAE enjoys positive relations with the international community and the rest of the world. For example, the UAE is the largest consumer of U.S goods in the region. A report released by the Congressional Research Service on October 17, 2013, has established that “in 2012, U.S. firms exported nearly $22 billion worth of goods to the UAE. Over 1,000 U.S. companies have offices there, and there are 60,000 Americans working in UAE” (Katzman 26). This means that the UAE positively relates well with major economies like the U.S. Moreover, most of the UAE’s workforce is composed of foreigners from developed and developing nations. Additionally, its foreign policy supports the establishment of peace in the region. However, the UAE has been criticized for its deteriorating human rights situation and trafficking (Katzman 26).\n\nIn conclusion, the UAE’s domestic challenges have affected its GDP and economic growth. The global financial crisis affected the growth of the economy, although it has since started to grow steadily. The UAE has a large unemployment rate among its nationals compared to foreign employees. Also, the UAE has positive relations with the international community and the rest of the world, although it has been criticized for its deteriorating human rights situation.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAbu Dhabi Government.

      "Student Diversity in School Classroom Essay (Article)\n\nResearch questions\n\n 1. What is the effect of classroom climate on the development of interracial and intergroup relationships among students?\n 2. What are the effects of cultural diversity in the classroom on academic performance?\n 3. What are the effects of diversity in undergraduate institutions in influencing student outcomes?\n 4. What can Cafeteria seating patterns tell us about intergroup relationships in students?\n 5. How does racial discrimination affect African – American adolescents in schools?\n 6. How can diversity courses influence student attitudes towards racial discrimination?\n\nAbstract\n\nRacial discrimination is a challenge that affects several individuals all over the world. To minimize the problem, schools need to develop a classroom climate, which facilitates high interaction and establishment of interracial and intergroup relationships among students.\n\nFurthermore, countries need to embrace and utilize the concept of racial and cultural diversity since it offers positive results and productive ideas. Diversity is also very important in undergraduate institutions as it provides a platform where students can exchange ideas and attain academic excellence. Some of the initiatives that are useful in curbing racial discrimination include engagement in diversity courses.\n\nClassroom Climates and Students’ Intergroup Behavior\n\nIn relation to findings from past research, students, who study in informal classroom climates, have good intergroup and interracial relationships as opposed to those, who study in formal classrooms. The article focuses on the importance of employing a classroom climate that provides great interaction opportunities for the students. Evidently, the article is very practical in coining the aspect of an informal classroom climate as an important setting that augments the level of interaction among students (Serow & Solomon, 1979).\n\nThe article argues that formal classroom climates are teacher dominated, and thus, minimize interactions among students. Remarkably, the article explains that amplified student interaction helps develop good interracial and intergroup relationships.\n\nIn the hypothesis of the article, informal classroom environments are likely to yield positive interracial and intergroup relationships, unlike their formal counterparts. Some of the assumptions that the study made include the assumption that there were no changes before and after observations and that everything was the same before the research.\n\nSome of the important details from the population studied comprised their varying levels of desegregation. The article sampled 13 schools that composed varying students from minority groups and 12 actively desegregated schools. By selecting the population and using it in the study, the article effectively acquired diverse levels of expertise in the concept of student behavior and classroom climates.\n\nSerow and Solomon (1979) explain that the results of the research ascertain that positive interracial and intergroup relationships develop in classroom climates that facilitate increased interaction among students.\n\nMoreover, the findings also indicate that teachers have a role to play in instilling the values that support and encourage good relationships among heterogeneous students. Conclusively, it is paramount to understand that informal classroom climates can yield positive results when combined with other factors that include encouragement of cooperation and friendship among students.\n\nCultural Diversity in the Classroom and its Effects on Academic Performance\n\nIn some places such as Switzerland and Germany, there is a belief that immigrant students lead to decreased academic performance and quality of education in schools. Evidently , some people in these countries believe that immigrant students initiate low-quality education and affect the overall performance of schools (Konan, Chatard, Selimbegović, & Mugny, 2010).\n\nAs a result, the article tries to ascertain the authenticity of the belief. Imperatively, the article elucidates that unlike the beliefs held by these individuals, the presence of diverse students in a school yields positive outcomes and high performances. The article asserts that the concept of diversity in culture and race leads to a wide spectrum of ideas, and hence, an overall increase in the performance of students in schools.\n\nThe important details on the population sampled include the high number of participants involved. According to Konan, Chatard, Selimbegović, and Mugny (2010), the article sampled almost 0.25 million students during the research, a factor that was very instrumental in expanding the level of knowledge concerning the issue. Moreover, the high number of respondents increases the credibility of results obtained as opposed to the use of a few respondents.\n\nThe research concluded that indeed, the belief held by some people in continents such as Europe is false since the presence of immigrant students in learning institutions increases the performance and quality of education. From the findings, it is clear that immigrant students demonstrate higher performance and do well as opposed to the belief that they are responsible for the poor performance experienced in various learning institutions.\n\nDiversity at Undergraduate Institutions and their Influence on Student Outcomes\n\nThe article seeks to address findings from past researchers, who argue that diversity has a range of positive results in undergraduate institutions. From the article, it is apparent that several scholars used findings, which were not accurate and concise. As a result, some of the findings are erroneous and require corrections (Gottfredson et al., 2008). The presence of errors in past findings compelled the research in the quest to get authentic results that reflect the actual state of affairs.\n\nSome of the assumptions that the article made include the notion that the findings reflect the overall state of affairs in all undergraduate institutions. The research assumes that the results will be useful and applicable in all undergraduate institutions all over the region. The article points out that, indeed, there is a significant influence related to the presence of diversity in undergraduate institutions.\n\nTo ascertain the relevance and credibility of findings, the article outlines two methods that were useful in data collection. The implication of two data collection methods is an increased amount of respondents and enhanced feedback. Moreover, by using a considerable amount of respondents, the research is practical and gives findings that are near perfect. Gottfredson et al. (2008) assert that the findings explain that there is a strong influence in undergraduate institutions that have pronounced diversities as opposed to homogeneous institutions.\n\nFrom the findings, it is clear that institutions, which have heterogeneous students, demonstrate increased impacts concerning influences on outcomes that are associated with diversity. The article concludes by stating that the concept of influence and diversity requires more research so that the validity of diversity and its impact on the outcomes of students becomes achievable.\n\nSame Spaces, Different Races: What can Cafeteria Seating Patterns Tell Us about Intergroup Relations in Middle School\n\nPast studies have recorded that students demonstrate considerable segregation in their sitting arrangements at the cafeteria. Although the schools offer high levels of interaction and boost the chances of interracial relationships, students associate with members of their races. Therefore, the research sought to understand the causes of segregation and the authentic nature of the findings.\n\nNotably, the findings highlight that students from marginalized communities can, at times, sit together in a cafeteria, whereas the majority cluster themselves in another location of the same room.\n\nThe article is certain that, indeed, segregation in school cafeterias is real and practical. Conversely, it elucidates that segregation is a result of marginalization and limited contact that takes place outside the school (Echols, Solomon, & Graham, 2014). As such, the research focused on ascertaining the level of truth in the hypothesis presented in the article.\n\nSome of the important details pertaining to the population studied comprise its heterogeneous nature and small socio-economic diversities. In essence, the focus on heterogeneous population occasioned because of the need to understand the presence or absence of segregation in school cafeterias. Moreover, the use of a population that has minimal diversity in socioeconomic status was because the study wanted to obtain findings that had little influence related to socioeconomic backgrounds.\n\nThe results of the research outlined that there is some kind of segregation in schools. Echols, Solomon, and Graham (2014) highlight that students like associating with others, who are members of their race. Additionally, it was apparent that there are instances where marginalized students, such as Latinos and African – Americans, sit together in a cafeteria. The act of crossing boundaries between the Latinos and African – American students is due to their marginalization.\n\nSchool Diversity and Racial Discrimination among African-American Adolescents\n\nThe research occasioned from the findings of past studies, which state that the level of diversity in schools leads to differences in the magnitude of racial discrimination among African – American adolescents. From the findings, many African – American students experience racial discrimination, a factor that seriously affects their mental health and performance in school.\n\nAccording to Seaton and Douglass (2014), the article explains that several adolescents from African – American societies believe that the rate of discrimination is high in schools that have a pronounced a number of whites. The main hypothesis developed by the article is based on the concept that the higher the diversity, the higher the level of discrimination. The article highlights that the chances of racial discrimination are high if the school has a majority of individuals from a singular community or race.\n\nThe major factor that is dominant in the population sampled transpires from the level of objectiveness demonstrated by the article. In the article, African – American adolescents gave their responses concerning racial discrimination encounters and their backgrounds (Seaton & Douglass, 2014). The relevance of the population studied is evident since the use of African – American adolescents is practical in the achievement of results that reflect the reality in various schools around the country.\n\nPrincipally, the adolescents gave an account of the instances that they have experienced racial injustices and by doing so, increased the level of understanding of the concept of research. In the article, the research found out that although African – Americans advanced high levels of racial discrimination, other communities, such as Latinos and Asians, had different experiences based on diversity.\n\nUnderstanding What Students Bring to the Classroom: Moderators of the Effects of Diversity Courses on Student Attitudes\n\nIn response to research based on the interactions among students in schools and the level of racial discrimination that students experience, the study sought to establish the relevance of diversity courses in resolving the challenge. Cole, Case, Rios, and Curtin (2011) elucidate that the article explains that the courses focused on reducing the attitudes and actions that triggered racial discrimination in schools.\n\nNotably, the article states that schools are places that witness high levels of racial discrimination, and hence, by ensuring that the students go through the process, the challenge diminishes. In its hypothesis, the study highlights that diversity courses are very important in curbing the challenges associated with racial discrimination and segregation in schools.\n\nThe most outstanding factor that concerns the studied population is the use of a sample that comprised students. The use of students in the category of respondents is very suitable since schools are places characterized by frequent interactions and high chances of racial disparities (Cole, Case, Rios, & Curtin, 2011).\n\nThe implication of the chosen sample population is increased credibility and practical nature of the findings. Fundamentally, the results from the study affirmed the hypothesis, and the article elucidates that the courses had a positive impact on the level of racial discrimination. The positive results transpired as those who went through the program understood the importance of respecting individuals in society regardless of their race.\n\nReferences\n\nCole, E., Case, K., Rios, D., & Curtin, N.

Lethal Dose 50\n 6. Legal and Ethical issues surrounding animal testing\n 7. Conclusion\n 8. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nVivisection or what is described as animal testing is an old practice. It could be dated back at a time of the primitive man, who could feed new food to some wild dogs to determine if it would be edible. Importantly, some princes utilized human guinea pigs to test whether their food was suitable for consumption (Rowan 194).\n\nThe act of animal testing is dated back to Greeks. 1n 450 BCE a Greek philosopher Alcmaeon did a vivisection and interfered with the dog’s optic nerve, which was essential for physicians to evaluate the cause of blindness in human. (Watson 11). In the third and fourth centuries BCE, Aristotle (384-322 BCE) and Erasistratus (304-258 BCE) utilized animals for their experiments (Watson 11).\n\nIn the second century Rome, Claudius Galen, a physician experimenter performed dissections on goats as well as pigs to get knowledge of muscles and nerves and thus is renowned as the father of Vivisection (Watson 11). Moreover, in the twelfth century, another Arabic physician, Avenzoar dissected animals and established animal testing experiment in testing surgical processes prior to their application to man.\n\nHistorical milestones due to animal testing\n\nIn later centuries, William Harvey, a British surgeon evaluated the circulation of blood through animal testing, whose work triggered many researchers to engage in animal vivisection. Later, Anktoni Van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723), had a microscopic study on animal tissues. Several historical milestones can be attributed to animal testing (Watson 12). For instance, in 1796, Edward Jenner, an English physician got sample from a cow with cowpox infection, inherited it into a boy and a vaccine for small pox was achieved.\n\nMoreover, Louis Pasteur a French Chemist was the initiator for anthrax, rabies, cholera vaccine using animal tests m (Athanasiou & Darzi 208). The practice established in the seventeenth century when Jeremy Bentham, a philosopher, discarded the theory of Rene Descartes, which pointed out that animals could not reason, thus lacked pain or distress. However, Bentham stated that animals have feelings and their reason is not crucial in determining ethical issues surrounding their treatment (Watson 12).\n\nAnimal testing to safeguard public heath could be dated at the time the Romans, who came up with a public health mechanism to inspect food products while protecting the aqueducts from pollutants. Following the collapse of the Roman Empire, public health procedures were not systematically used up to the 19 th century. Systematic animal testing on synthetic item for safety measures established in the 20 th century when vaccines and biological therapeutic measures were being developed (Rowan 194).\n\nIn England, Cruelty to Animal Act of 1876 passage aimed at regulating animal testing where its notable that in 1921, just twenty thousand animals were utilized in biological therapeutic e.g. insulin bioassays, hormonal tests and vaccine testing. Prior to the Second World War however, 365,000 animals had been used for testing since 1921. This figure increased by 400% to over 3.5 million animals used by 1975 especially for toxicity and new drug testing (Rowan 194).\n\nCosmetic animal testing\n\nCosmetic animal testing involves using animals to test efficacy and safety of sanitary, hygienic and beauty products. On cosmetics, animal testing initiated in 1933 when a female utilized Lash Lure mascara to highlight her eye lashes. Following the act, her eyes got burnt followed by blindness and ultimate death. After then, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) passage of Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act of 1938, aimed to safeguard citizens from dangerous cosmetics (Rowan 196).\n\nDraize test\n\nThe most significant tests conducted include Draize test used in the 1940s to evaluate skin and eye products as a directive given to John Draize by FDA. It include having the sample dropped in the eyes of an animal mostly albino rabbits and monitoring the response. It may lead to swelling, shock, bleeding, convulsions, iris inflammation, blindness, paralysis, or death depending on the concentration of the sample.\n\nLethal Dose 50\n\nLethal Dose 50 (LD50) was used first by J. W. Trevan in 1927 to evaluate the effectiveness of digitalis extracts and insulin as a toxicity measure. It is incorporated through forceful feeding on several animals with the sample, till half of them die. It may involve injections, ingestion, application and fumigation. The test is crude and inhumane since animals suffer in turn (Rowan 197). Charles River Laboratories are among other breeders of test animals.\n\nLegal and Ethical issues surrounding animal testing\n\nToday, many cosmetic firms are utilizing animals to test their products hence triggering several legal and ethical issues surrounding the procedure. These agencies that handle humane treatment of animals include The John Hopkins Centre for the Alternatives to Animal Testing established in 1981. Since then, cosmetics firm such as the U.S Revlon and Avon stopped testing its products on animals in 1989. However, many cosmetic firms’ today still use animals for testing for the sake of public health and to evade related litigations.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, utilizing animals as man’s surrogate is not only unethical but is also inaccurate and deteriorating to the environment. Therefore, alternative procedure such as cell culture, which is reliable, cheaper, and triggers no ethical or legal issues should be employed (Schmidt & Weber 89). Many animals suffer due to medical and cosmetic testing and may even die as a result. These testing for example, involves shaving fur of animal’s and applying corrosive samples on it.\n\nIrrespective of such procedure, scientists asserts that animal testing cannot actually be relied on to safeguard human from dangerous products. These testing cause skin irritations, acute toxicity, skin sensitivity, eyes irritation, photosensitivity, mutagenicity, among other harmful effects to the animal, which is a violation of animal rights. As a result, animal testing should be banned as has been in the European Union countries such as UK and Netherlands where sale of such products is illegal\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAthanasiou, Thanmos and Darzi, Ara.

      "Fayol Principles and Stauffacher’s Leadership Essay\n\nHenry Fayol believed in division of work to ensure that specific persons handle specific jobs. Job specialization, according to Fayol, was a clear way of not only increasing volume of outputs, but also producing quality products. Organizations that apply division of labor in their operations pay special focus on the specific portion of the task. Under authority, Fayol believed that an organization that has a center of control from which employees receive commands, is highly likely to succeed in achieving its goals and objectives.\n\nThis presents a unity of command from a specified direction. In such a scenario, wielding authority comes with accountability and full responsibility for all tasks in a firm ( Henri Fayol’s 14 Principles of Management par. 2). Besides, discipline in organizations ought to be applied cautiously and lawfully to prevent destruction of employees’ attention from work. In addition, successful organizations have to define a common objective to enable all stakeholders to work towards the specified direction.\n\nFor continuity in business, the management has to make an organization’s interests supersede the interests of an individual. In providing remuneration to employees, the management has to take into concern the overall success of the firm, cost of living, as well as supply of experienced personnel. Fayol also proposed that a manager could decide whether to adopt centralization or decentralization management system depending on the nature of an organization.\n\nHowever, he added that centralization lowers the significance of the subordinates’ roles, while decentralization increases their significance within an organization. To enhance orderliness within an organization, in terms of coordination and efficiency, Fayol recommended that all strategic and non-strategic resources have to be treated with same level of urgency ( Henri Fayol’s 14 Principles of Management par. 6). In order to enhance equity among workers, managers have to treat them equally.\n\nAn attempt to contradict the principle will automatically lead to rebellion and low work-output. Another principle of management holds that managers should make it their priority to hire and retain highly skilled employees to ensure sustainable development and progress in future. Fayol hypothesizes that retaining such employees is a clear way of enhancing workforce productivity, as they work on their areas of specialization.\n\nTherefore, managers should have an already available recruitment and selection funds to continue building a strong team. It is the duty of the management to reinforce employees’ behaviors; motivation instills in employees the urge to achieve both the organizational and personal goals. Managers must make it their role to keep the workers active in order to deliver on their expectations.\n\nManagement systems that take this initiative give employees a clear direction on the way forward. It becomes easy for such organizations to achieve their strategic business goals and objectives. Fayol summed up that a successful organization must have a management that encourages peaceful co-existence and good feeling among its workers (Crainer 77).\n\nFrom the descriptions of Fayol’s 14 management principles, it is evident that he desired an organization with an orderly and focused management, which gives employees and other stakeholders a clear direction.\n\nStauffacher, on his part, believed that employees develop purpose for their responsibilities if the organization’s leadership gives clear descriptions of the desired destinations and expectations of employees. According to Stauffacher, workers follow leaders who respect them, engage in ethical deals and practices, and outline a clear sense of direction for the firm (Sidious par. 2). Three key leadership provisions are purpose, direction, and motivation.\n\nUnder purpose, an effective leader explains to employees the reason for engaging in such ventures. When employees comprehend the significance and reasons of doing something, they become dedicated to achieve the objectives. A leader has to come up with the vision of an organization in deep consultation with all stakeholders of the organization. Markedly, involving employees and other stakeholders in designing the company’s vision motivates the stakeholders, as they feel as part of the organization.\n\nThey feel valued by the management team, as their contributions are included in the company operations (Sidious par. 3). Stauffacher adds that engaging employees in coming up with the firm’s vision does not only binds them, but also instill confidence and trust among the stakeholders. Managers, therefore, have to assist employees to comprehend the firm’s overall corporate and business stratagems.\n\nThe second aspect is direction. Leaders have to guide employees to prioritize their goals for the organization. In this line, an effective leader act by example in setting priorities and standards so that the subordinates can follow suit. Giving directions on what an organization has to achieve remains the duty of the management. According to Sidious, proper leadership helps employees to comprehend how they help in meeting an organization’s objectives (par. 5). Leaders also have to provide complete motivation to workers.\n\nMotivation comes in two distinct categories – intrinsic and extrinsic. When an organization recognizes the contributions of its employees, the employees feel appreciated, cared for and needed by the organization. Apart from caring, motivation of employees develops a strong cohesion between employees and the management. The resilient link that emanates from the organization further strengthens the firm’s focus to achieve a common goal.\n\nMotivation makes all stakeholders responsible and accountable for their actions in the organization (Crainer 83). In case an employee fails to adhere to the stipulated company policies, it is the role of the leaders to apply an understandable punishment to alter such behaviors. Rewards and punishment, if well administered on employees, can make the staffs surpass their organizational goals.\n\nLeaders should not apply rewards and punishment selectively since such moves could result in organization’s failure. Proper performance appraisal techniques and methods should be used to avoid instances of favoritism in allocation of rewards.\n\nAccording to Stauffacher, a leader who knows himself/herself and seeks improvement, as well as proficient in his/her line of duty has high chances of being successful in achieving an organization’s objectives. Leaders should not only accept responsibilities, but should also go steps ahead to seek such responsibilities. This shows a kind of leadership that is determined to venture in new areas in pursuit of success and sustainable development (Sidious par. 11).\n\nWith such readiness to venture in new zones, a leader must make timely and sound decisions. A leader must also know the welfare of his/her employees in order to build a strong team, which cares for each other. In the management process, leaders have to update their subordinates on recent developments on a frequent basis.\n\nEmployees who are informed on changes within an organization have minimal chances of refuting or thwarting such alterations; subordinates work with full knowledge of any impeding change, thus enhancing work delivery (Sidious par. 13). Just like in Fayol’s principle, Stauffacher held that managers have to ensure that their followers comprehend their tasks fully; they should supervise tasks’ progress to their completion stages.\n\nMoreover, leaders have to set targets that are consistent with the capabilities of the firm. Overrating an organization’s projections beyond its capabilities can be a demoralizing factor to employees (Sidious par. 14), as they strain to meet the impossible targets.\n\nIn my real life experience, Fayol’s principle of order was present in the management style of Steve Jobs at the Apple Company and Bill Gates at the Microsoft Company. The two companies command large customer loyalty due to the effective leadership that the management offers. Even though Steve Jobs allowed decentralization at the company to allow innovations, he ensured that a centralized management system remained in place ( Leadership Styles of Bill Gates and Steve Job s par. 4).\n\nThis was to make it possible for the firm to develop inclusive applications under the instructions of the management. At the same time, Stauffacher’s team building is evident at the Microsoft Company; Bill Gates involves all stakeholders in decision-making to enable the firm achieve the objective from a unified and common dimension ( Leadership Styles of Bill Gates and Steve Job s par. 8).\n\nFrom my personal experience, Fayol’s management principles and Stauffacher’s leadership and principles have been evident at my workplace – the banking industry. As an IT specialist, the bank management posted me at the IT department in order to ensure the security of the institution’s systems.\n\nClearly, issues to deal with customer relations and teller services do not require the services of an IT specialist, but require services of a human resource expert. Specialization improved the overall performance of workers at the financial institution. Additionally, the bank management system kept updating all departments of changes that were yet to occur; this improved the bond between employees and the executive team. The situation increased customers’ satisfaction.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCrainer, Stuart. The ultimate business library: the greatest books that made management . Oxford: Capstone, 2003.

      "Terry w. Terry v. State of Ohio Criminal Case Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Facts\n 2. Issue\n 3. Decision\n 4. Discussion\n 5. References\n\nFacts\n\nThe Terry vs. State Of Ohio case gave a landmark ruling that defined how the fourth amendment affected unreasonable searches and seizures in America. The case involved a police officer who searched and arrested John Terry (the petitioner) for having a concealed weapon. The arresting officer did so after noticing the petitioner pacing along a street, suspiciously.\n\nAt the time of the arrest, Terry was with an acquaintance. They occasionally peeped through a store window and conversed in low tones. When the two men followed a man they had talked to, the officer walked up to them and searched for a concealed weapon. He believed they intended to commit a crime. The search showed that one of them had a weapon. The officer charged him for this crime.\n\nIssue\n\nSince the arresting officer searched the petitioner without probable cause, it was important to understand if the fourth amendment protected the suspect from an unwarranted search and seizure. Therefore, the main issue in the case involved understanding if a search for weapons without probable cause was unlawful, or not.\n\nDecision\n\nMajority View: The US Supreme Court ruled against the plaintiff by saying reasonable searches were lawful if officers believed that a person was armed (Martinez, 2014). The Court believed that denying officers the right to search suspects would burden their work and compromise their security, or that of the suspects they want to protect.\n\nDissent: Justice William Douglas did not support unwarranted stop and searches (without probable cause) because he believed giving this power to police officers would be excessively empowering them. He argued that even magistrates did not enjoy this privilege. Therefore, he believed officer empowerment was tantamount to totalitarianism.\n\nFirst Concurrence: Justice John Harlan supported the majority view. However, he highlighted the need to have conditional searches. He said it was important for officers to have reasonable cause to stop and search people (Martinez, 2014).\n\nSecond Concurrence: Justice Byron White similarly supported the majority view, but he equally highlighted the need to have conditional searches. He said searches should only occur if the officers believed the persons were potentially violent (Martinez, 2014).\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe above case shaped how the American police conducted searches on suspected criminals. Since violence could have occurred if the arresting officer did not act, how he did, the safety of both the officer and the targeted victim took center-stage in the proceedings. Based on this focus, the judges had to make sure they protected the safety of all parties (officers, suspects and potential victims). Although the court ruled against the plaintiff, it recognized the need to respect the suspect’s right.\n\nIn this regard, it required police officers to act with integrity when conducting searches. Comparatively, Saint Leo’s Core Value of Integrity requires honesty and consistency in how people relate within the institution (particularly regarding how employees and students undertake their duties). The Terry vs. State Of Ohio case underscores the principles of this value. Concisely, the case involved a petitioner who believed a police officer did not undertake his duties diligently.\n\nSince the police service requires all its officers to practice high standards of integrity, the Supreme Court had to mediate this case and, as shown above, found out that the officer acted within the law. As Saint Leo’s core values stipulate, integrity should guide how people undertake their duties.\n\nReferences\n\nMartinez, M. (2014).

      "Comparison of Indian and Chinese Art Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe most suitable definition of Art is yet to be found. In the recent past, numerous books, as well as journal articles, have argued over the basics of what is meant by calling something art (Michell, 23). Art is generally a vehicle that has been used since time immemorial by mankind, to express and communicate ideas and emotions (Crouch, 44). In the past, people would express their feelings or ideas through paintings on rocks or caves (Doniger, 77).\n\nHowever, as time went by, people learned that art could be expressed via different platforms and mediums, for instance, through sculptures, carvings, graffiti, architecture, and so forth. Different cultures have also had distinct artworks which have been expressed in various forms. Two cultures which have had some rather interesting artworks in the past, and whose art is still widely recognized, are the Indian and Chinese art (Mitter, 101).\n\nDiscussion\n\nBrief History of Indian Art\n\nThe history of Indian art is said to be as old as the Indus Valley civilization itself where each period in history has provided the nation with unique modes of expression, as well as unique forms of art (Stokstad, 30). India has always been well linked to the outside world via land and sea routes, bringing into the nation a wide variety of traditions and cultures.\n\nThese influences of cultures of foreign lands always have and mostly been felt in the art of India. The influences have in turn enhanced the nation’s art in the years, and in the 21st Century, it is quite possible to observe these influences in Indian fine arts (Clark, 93). In India, historical art forms are seen as expressions of individuals who belong to distinct culture as well as social groups of the country.\n\nSince Indus Valley scripts have not yet been translated, whatever understanding people have of it has its foundation on artifacts, ruins, and sculptures left behind (Michell, 24).\n\nAdditionally, Indian art as it has been indicated previously is the result of numerous influences from different cultures such as Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam, and Jainism; it is more of religious art (Crouch, 46). Art in the Indus valley civilization generally depicted animal figures that had been created in abstract modes with high level of sophistication.\n\nBrief History of Chinese Art\n\nIn the past, China was the only source for porcelain and that is why the name ‘china’ is commonly used when referring to porcelain (Doniger, 78). The history of Chinese art dates back to the Neolithic era, where artists used to paint on earthenware (Stokstad, 31). In the course of the Shang Dynasty, China was already making emerald carvings together with cast bronze that existed among grave products.\n\nAncient China produced numerous forms of beautiful artworks where different dynasties and eras had their specialties (Mitter, 103). It is believed that the Chinese religion, in addition to philosophy, greatly impacted the artistic styles as well as themes. The main perfections in Chinese art were calligraphy, painting, and poetry.\n\nAncient Chinese saw writing as an essential art form where calligraphers would spend years learning to write perfectly, and with style (Stokstad, 32). Poetry eventually led to painting as an inspiration, combined with calligraphy (Clark, 94). Majority of ancient Chinese paintings were landscapes featuring birds, homes, water, mountains and other animals (Crouch, 47).\n\nDifferences and Similarities of Images of Animals in Indian Art and Chinese Art\n\nUnlike in the Chinese culture, animals tend to play an important role in Indian culture where they assist in framing the human society (Michell, 25). Hindus tend to adore numerous animal gods, and such can be seen in Indian art. One of the deities that are worshipped in the Hindu religion and commonly depicted in Indian art is Ganesh, a popular Hindu god with features of a short, stout man possessing one-tusked elephant head (Crouch, 48).\n\nThis particular god is not only considered to be an excellent teacher, but also a remover of hindrances. The Lion at Sarnath is another animal depiction that can be seen in Indian art and is considered a national symbol of India; it is a sculpture of 4 Indian lions standing back to back (Doniger, 79).\n\nThe Lion is believed to be one of the animal sculptures representing the various steps of Lord Buddha’s life, the Lion specifically representing his accomplishment. Another image in Indian art that can be seen is that of Vishnu as the Boar Varaha from Udayagiri and is depicted in the archer’s posture with his right leg extended (Mitter, 105).\n\nHis left leg is bent and rests on a lotus that is being held up by male and female snake figures which have human bodies from the waist up (Stokstad, 34). The incarnations of Vishnu are numerous, and the Boar happens to be number three on the list. Cats are also represented in Indian art, for instance in The Cat and Elephants from Mamallapuram. Mamallapuram art is a creation on a celebration of Hinduism conquering Buddhism (Clark, 95).\n\nIt is a time when artists adopted the use of stone as a medium for sculpting in situ rock faces rather than using wood (Michell, 26). Cats and elephants were depicted in Indian art to represent the inspirational continuity that is found in all living things.\n\nCats are well-recognized symbols of hypocrisy, for instance, the Ascetic Cat, which is usually incorporated in the majority of Indian art (Stokstad, 35). The Ascetic Cat is a true Indian story about a cat that pretended to be ascetic by standing in a yogic posture all day long outside the cave housing a family of mice (Mitter, 106). The mice grew to trust this particular cat and believed it to be vegetarian, given the fact that it was ascetic.\n\nHowever, as the days went by, and as the number of mice decreased steadily, the mice soon realized that the cat was a false yogi. In any given religion, ascetic way of life is seen as a way of self-humiliation where injury to others is not allowed. Looking at the Ascetic Cat as depicted in Indian art, we can see that the cat was willing to self humiliate itself to get food, which in this case was the family of mice.\n\nAll systems of religious thought that have been in existence in India have been greatly influenced by the philosophy as well as terminology of asceticism, and it is therefore not surprising to find this depiction in the majority of Indian art.\n\nImages of animals in Chinese art usually represented the achievements and historical events of the empire. It also, to some extent, represented the nation’s beliefs for instance, The Flying Horse which symbolizes a perfect horse that can gallop so fast as to outrun the wind (Crouch, 50).\n\nHousehold animals in Chinese art tend to represent positive interrelations between humans and animals, while wild animals represent the undomesticated character of mankind. Mythical beasts are an artistic imagination and represent future potential as well as magical, endless resources (Doniger, 80).\n\nThe Horse and the Cavalryman from Qin Shihuagdias tomb is another image of animals in Chinese art representing a stand-in for Empire Qin’s real army (Mitter, 107). The horse and the cavalryman are well detailed and defined where the clay warrior is holding an actual bronze weapon, suggestive of his protective role.\n\nDuring the Qin Dynasty, China managed to increase its trade, military security, and agriculture, having direct control of the masses. The Camel Carrying a Group of Musicians is a piece of Chinese art that is based on the Tang appeal with the Turkic cultures (Stokstad, 36). Three of the five bearded musicians riding on the camel are central Asian while the other two smooth shaven ones are Han Chinese (Clark, 96).\n\nThe illustrations provided above regarding images of animals in Chinese and Indian art provide a few similarities as well as differences.\n\nA key difference that is quite noticeable between these two arts is that while the images of animals in Indian culture represented Indian religion and beliefs, those found in the Chinese culture were a representation of various achievements and historical events in China, particularly during the Qin Dynasty (Michell, 27).\n\nAnother difference that can be observed is that images of animals in Indian culture were depicted as also possessing parts of the human body, such as that seen in Ganesh and Vishnu as the Boar Varaha (Crouch, 52). On the other hand, a few similarities that can be observed in both Chinese and Indian art are that both cultures created art that was committed to their respective religions.\n\nBoth believed in the reincarnation of individuals, and this was expressed in their respective artworks, for instance, Vishnu as the Boar Varaha from UdayagiriI in Indian art and The Horse and the Cavalryman from Qin Shihuagdias tomb in Chinese art (Doniger, 81). In Indian art with regards to Buddhism influence, Buddha was not usually represented in human form.\n\nHowever, following the adaptation of the religion by the Chinese, Buddha came to take over the artistic world. Buddhism developed the idea of a Buddha of the future where he was depicted as being clad in a monastic robe (Mitter, 109).\n\nConclusion\n\nArt, being an expression of feelings, ideas, and emotions of individuals, has been well depicted in the course of history and particularly in the Indian and Chinese cultures. The differing image of animals tells us about the Indian and Chinese religious, social as well as economic values that were held by the respective cultures. Both Indian and Chinese art has made significant contributions to a special chapter in the history of man’s civilization.\n\nModern day Chinese art can hardly be differentiated from Indian art upon looking at it initially. In the recent past, China adopted Buddhism into their religious beliefs, and Chinese artists have taken it upon themselves to express this new religion through art. It is, therefore, not a wonder to observe that modern day artists are looking up to ancient works of art such as those found in Chinese and Indian arts for inspiration and innovative ideas.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nClark, John.

      "Cultural Context of the Play “Poker” by Zora Hurston Essay\n\n“Poker” is a play that was written around the 1930s. The Play was written by Hurston an African American woman and a trained anthropologist. Around the time she wrote the play, she was living in a town near New York. The play is set in a shotgun house in New York.\n\nIt revolves around a group of men who are playing poker. The play opens with Nunkie playing the piano. He is then called over by Tush to join in the poker game. Nunkie seems to be the most outspoken of them all and dominates most of the conversation.\n\nAt one time, he likens a succession of cards to events in his life. When the men are playing cards, Aunt Dilsey enters the room and takes a moment to express her disapproval of the poker game. She then tells the men that if they do not stop it, they will all go to hell for it (Hurston 1).\n\nWhile she is speaking, the men are pulling out aces they have hidden in their sleeves. Hell breaks loose when Sack turns up four aces and a king and claims to have won the game. Several of them turn up other aces of their own and it then becomes clear that this has not been a fair game.\n\nThe commotion ends up in a shooting that wakes up Aunt Dilsey. After witnessing the bloodshed, she laments that they did not listen to her. This play is reflective of the cultural context of the time in many ways.\n\nDuring the time this play was authored, America was going through the great depression. This was a time when money was hard to get. This is probably why almost all these men were prepared to do anything for money.\n\nEven though the poker game was supposed to be a simple affair, several men came with hidden aces just so they can outsmart their counterparts. They do this without any emotional difficulty as portrayed by their normal conversation.\n\nDuring the time of the great depression, many Americans could barely afford food (Goldston 5). Any extra dollar earned was a welcome relief. These men were not leaving this eventuality to mere luck. This is why they all come prepared not to lose any of their hard-earned cash.\n\nThe play was most likely set in Harlem New York. This neighborhood was predominantly an African American neighborhood at the time. It was also a crime hub and that is why most of these men carried concealed weapons. The weapons are for either protection or perpetration of crime.\n\nNunkie implies in his conversation that his pretty Mama wants to cut his throat (Hurston 1). This further indicates that violence is a common occurrence in this neighborhood. Even to date, Harlem New York still has high instances of crime and violence.\n\nThe portrayal of men in this play is undoubtedly negative. The author of this play was a woman born in 1891. By the 1930s, the tensions between men and women had taken several dimensions. First, women used to be paid lower wages than men were, and for the same amount of work (DuBois 26).\n\nIn addition, the society was largely dominated by men with women having little to no say when it came to family affairs. Finally, during this civil rights era most African American men were heavily burdened therefore seeking solace in drinking and gambling dens.\n\nThis did not sit well with the African American women who had to stay at home and wait for a share of the meager earnings the men made. These tensions may be the reason for the negative portrayal of men by the woman playwright.\n\nShe probably felt that even though women knew better, men did not take time to listen to them. When Aunt Dilsey tells the men to stop playing poker, they reply by telling her to go back to sleep and get some rest (Hurston 1). This implies that the women were to get out of men’s way when they did their business.\n\nThe language used by the characters in the play is colloquial. This language also passed as the slang of the day. It was associated with the lower class and uneducated members of the society. This class of people was associated with poverty, ignorance, crime, and violence.\n\nThe event at the end of the play where one of the poker players is shot is itself another crime. The “smack” talk used throughout the play lacks any substance neither does it address any tangible issues. Just from their language, one can be able to assign these men a social class.\n\nThe author was herself an educated woman therefore; one does not expect her to have an in-depth understanding of the class she portrays in the play. This is because throughout the play she shows no such efforts. Moreover, she probably had never spent any time with members of this class.\n\nThis play was set in the 1930s and it revolves around the culture of African Americans at the time. It is also influenced by several cultural attributes of the time. These attributes can be witnessed throughout the play.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDuBois, Carol.

      "“Feminism, Peace, Human Rights and Human Security” by Charlotte Bunch Essay\n\nSummary\n\nThis article has put a lot of focus on gender, human rights, and peace. In terms of gender, most of the discussion is directed on women since it is believed that they are more likely to be affected by conflicts than men. There are many organizations like the United Nations that are advocating for peace.\n\nHowever, this has not helped to solve the frequent conflicts being witnessed in different parts of the world. A lot of effort is being directed towards developing weapons of mass destruction. This implies that peace cannot be achieved easily.\n\nConflicts between different nations have resulted in the rise of dangerous activities like the September 11 terrorist attack in the United States. Armed conflicts cause additional abuse of the right of women, especially where men seem to dominate all the key areas.\n\nAt times, male dominance starts from home whereby women are simply referred to as property. Many Non-governmental organizations have tried to establish strategies that can be used to realize international peace and reduced abuse of human rights.\n\nThe author of the article asserts that many men do not show any interest of discussing some of the issues that affect women. In addition, they do not recognize the contribution made by women in trying to build peace (Bunch 8).\n\nThe above events and practices have led to quite a number of questions that require immediate attention. These questions include the following:\n\n 1. What can be done to end gender-based violence and abuse of the rights of women?\n 2. Which steps can be put in place in order to realize permanent peace?\n 3. What is the contribution of Non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in realizing international peace and security?\n 4. What can be done to achieve gender equality?\n\nMetaphors of Globalization\n\nThe first part of the article contains a detailed description of what the author observed when he visited London. Other sections of the article focus on globalization and its effects. To help understand the concept of globalization, the author uses the scale, contradictions and the uncertainty associated with globalization.\n\nThe author provides a strong description of globalization by linking it with other practices that trigger the globalization process. Globalization is represented in different forms such as the Kapoor’s structure. However, the author does not find the essence of explaining globalization through sculptures.\n\nHe advocates for the use of other alternative methods of explaining globalization. The author adds that the variables applied by economists cannot be used to provide a clear explanation of the social costs associated with globalization.\n\nMany economists believe that the data on consumption, real wages, employment, and exports can be used to explain the social cost. However, the author does not agree.\n\nThe article also discusses globalization metaphors. A medical condition like HIV/AIDS is used to explain various globalization phases. The rising cases of individuals being infected by this disease help to portray some of the dangers brought about by globalization.\n\nIn the last section of the article, the author tries to explain how modern sociology came into being during the 19 th century (Lowe 38-59).\n\nFrom this article, several questions can be extracted. These include the following.\n\n 1. What should be done to prevent the spread of dangerous diseases that defy national boundaries like HIV/Aids?\n 2. What are the best variables that can be used to study the social costs associated with globalization?\n 3. What are the alternative methods that can be applied to demonstrate globalization?\n 4. What are the effects of modern sociology that emerged in the late 19 th century?\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBunch, Charlotte.”Feminism, Peace, Human Rights and Human Security.” Theory and Practice 22.1 (1998): 6-10.

      "Issues in Non-Point Source Pollution Critical Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Summary\n 2. Main Points\n 3. Authors’ Position\n 4. Critique\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nSummary\n\nIn recent years, environmental protection has been one of overriding issues for environmentalists, academics and policy makers. One of the most dominant issue in the domain of environmental protection concerns non-point source pollution of water resources (Donlon & McMillan, 2004).\n\nIn their article titled “Use of Special Surrogates to Assess the Potential for Non-Point Source Pollution in Large Watersheds”, Moltz et al (2011) aimed to identify key areas within the United States portion of the Rio Grande Basin that were likely to produce non-point source pollution loads resulting from soil erosion and surface water runoff. Geographical Information Systems (GIS) was utilized to collect primary data for the study.\n\nMain Points\n\nThe study found that high topographic factors leading to non-point source pollution occur on steep slopes and where water flow has accumulated over longer expanses in the Rio Grande Basin.\n\nAdditionally, not only was rainfall erosivity values highest in the downstream sections of the Rio Grande Basin, but soil erodibility was found to be highest in the upper sections of the basin, lessening towards the lower sections of the basin. Lastly, the study found that water runoff considerably reduces in extensive areas of grasslands and shrubs, and increases in urban areas and barren lands (Moltz et al, 2011).\n\nAuthors’ Position\n\nThe authors’ take the position that many non-point source pollution prevention programs fail to remain sustainable because stakeholders never take time to determine the location of priority areas in a manner that could allow successful implementation of the programs in a cost-effective manner.\n\nThrough their study, the authors also demonstrate that, for large water resources, validated analyses can be undertaken using coarser datasets that present an initial identification of key sections displaying conditions favorable to generating huge amounts of non-point pollutant loads (Moltz et al., 2011).\n\nCritique\n\nThe authors’ have taken great effort to back up their claims with many sources that are grounded on primary research. They ostensibly demonstrate the relationship between soil erosion and water quality impacts in downstream water bodies, as well as the relationship between ground cover and slope gradient on the one hand, and rainfall erosivity and soil erodibility on the other.\n\nAdditionally, the authors demonstrate the consequences of non-point source pollution due to sedimentary/soil erosion to include a reduction in water transparency, degradation of aquatic habitats, and a reduction of the operational life and water storage capability of reservoirs generating hydroelectric power.\n\nMore importantly, the authors advise stakeholders that any intervention or prevention program aimed at reducing non-point source pollution must take into consideration the location of priority areas (Moltz et al., 2011).\n\nHowever, the authors could have taken more time and detail to explain their methodology as it is unclear to the reader how GIS was employed to come up with the samples. Additionally, the authors assume that readers automatically know what non-point source pollution entails and therefore see no need to define the concept.\n\nThis is rather unfortunate as many readers would want to understand the dynamics behind a concept before engaging in further reading. The authors are also silent on illuminating what ‘watersheds’ entail.\n\nFrom additional reading, it has been established that nonpoint source pollution is the contamination of ground water, waterways and oceans arising from day-to-day activities, and watersheds include lake and ponds, rivers and streams, wetlands, estuaries and groundwater (Donlon & McMillan, 2004).\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, it can be argued that the article is well-researched and written, but the methodology section, in my view, could have been more detailed and easily understandable to the general readers to enable for a more elaborate analysis of the article.\n\nReferences\n\nDonlon, A & McMillan, B.

      "John D. Rockefeller – Standard Oil Monopoly Argumentative Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller made one of the most influential decisions of monopolizing the petroleum industry. John D. Rockefeller was born at Richford in New York in 1839. He lived a humble life and while still young, he used to sell candy. Additionally, he could make money by giving the neighbors loans.\n\nAt around the age of sixteen years, he was employed as a bookkeeper receiving fifty cents in a day (Gunderman and Gregory 1). In 1859, he collaborated with Maurice B. Clark and started a wholesale business followed by an oil refinery after including Samuel Andrews in the business.\n\nAs the demand for oil increased, Rockefeller bought the refinery from his partners after borrowing money. Later, he bought as well as build other oil companies. In 1870, John D. Rockefeller collaborated with his brother and established the Standard Oil Company at Ohio.\n\nStandard Oil Company gave John D. Rockefeller the strength of driving away other owners of refineries by procuring their business premises (Baylor 1). At around 1880, the Standard Oil Company was refining approximately ninety percent of the United States oil.\n\nThe company controlled all the oil refining processes and marketing procedures in the United States. As a result, John D. Rockefeller had a strong influence on the quality of oil products produced and the market price. In 1890, John D. Rockefeller retired as the president of the company and Theodore replaced him.\n\nDuring the reign of Theodore, he initiated antitrust actions, which led to the collapse of Standard Oil Company into other small companies. According to Gunderman and Gregory, John D. Rockefeller survived in the business environment because of monopoly (1).\n\nMonopoly is a Greek word meaning alone or single. Monopoly exists when a particular business enterprise is the only supplier of a specific commodity (Baylor 1). The characteristic of monopoly is absence of competition to produce that commodity and a viable alternative product.\n\nAs a result, monopoly has a significant market power and it usually control the prices of commodities. For instance, monopoly can increase the profit margin by producing goods in small quantities and selling them at higher prizes.\n\nStandard Oil Company was a monopoly. John D. Rockefeller used unethical business practices to monopolize Standard Oil Company.\n\nThe Six Unethical Practices of John D. Rockefeller\n\nReducing the Prices of Oil and Its Products\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller reduced the prices of oil and its products temporarily (Baylor 4). His competitors could not keep up with the reduced prices because they had not planned for the same.\n\nAs a result, most of the business people who were dealing with oil and oil products ventured in to other types of enterprises. Those who could not survive in the competitive business environment sold their enterprises to Standard Oil Company.\n\nThe lower prices of oil attracted many consumers, hence, Standard Oil Company managed to establish a strong customer base. According to the theory of economics, low prices more often than not reduce the profit margin of a business and can even make it collapse.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller was not interested in the profit, but in monopolizing Standard Oil Company by driving away his competitors. He managed to stabilize Standard Oil Company at the expense of the profit. F\n\nor instance, between 1880 and 1890, the price of processing raw oil dropped by one cent while that of refined oil by twenty six cents per gallon (Baylor 3).\n\nBy cutting down the prices of oil, John D. Rockefeller did not only win local consumers but also the international traders. Baylor stated that, in order for the Standard Oil Company to compete with the Russian Oil in the Asian and European Countries, John D Rockefeller subsidized the foreign prices of oil (5).\n\nAdditionally, he supplied free products in order to establish a universal customer base. For instance, in 1870, Standard Oil Company supplied kerosene lamps to the interior parts of the globe and taught people how to use them.\n\nProcuring the Components Required Making Oil Barrels\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller purchased the components required to make oil barrels and as a result, his competitors were unable to transport their oil to the consumers (Baylor 3). This is because his competitors could not change the raw oil into refined products that the customers can consume.\n\nThus, Standard Oil Company was the major supplier of refined oil products and it gained fame all over the world.\n\nWith time, Standard Oil Company started producing barrels and selling them at a reduced price in order to attract many consumers (Baylor 3).\n\nFor instance, John D Rockefeller was selling a barrel at one point five dollar while external suppliers were distributing at a price of two point five. This difference of one dollar facilitated the monopoly of Standard Oil Company because it attracted many consumers.\n\nSecret Deals with Railroad\n\nThe major advantage of Standard Oil Company was its ability to get reduced rates from the railroads. John D. Rockefeller used the fame and prestige of Standard Oil Company to form an alliance with railroads, which gave it rebates in privacy (Baylor 4). Hence, the railroads reduced the shipping charges of Standard Oil Company.\n\nThe reduced prices enabled the standard oil company to compete effectively with other business enterprises that were charged high rates for the shipping. Some business enterprises could not cope up with the competition and they allowed the Standard oil to be a monopoly.\n\nJohn D Rockefeller secured special considerations from railroads via giving them some amounts of oil. For example, John D. Rockefeller used to give railroads sixty carloads of oil every day in favor of shipment from other oil businesses (Baylor 3).\n\nRailroads could carry oil from Standard Oil Company only instead of collecting supplementary products from other oil refinery companies. As a result, Standard Oil Company dominated the market by interfering with the supply chain management of other small refinery companies.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller won his railroads consumers by building an oil loading facility next to the train station, renting his oil tanker and taking responsibility for any accident on a property that belonged to railroad (Baylor 4).\n\nThis allowed Standard Oil Company outdo Pittsburgh Refineries because they could not receive any discount from railroads. Therefore, standard Oil Company managed to monopolize the market by maintaining reduced prices.\n\nBuying Competitors Secretly\n\nGunderman and Gregory stated that John D. Rockefeller borrowed money and bought other oil refinery companies in secret (2). He then sent some of the workers from the procured company to find out the business deals of other oil refinery companies.\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller used the report of the findings to take caution against a competitive business deal. For instance, if an oil company plans to reduce the price of oil products, Standard Oil Company would lower their prices further.\n\nSome competitors that John D. Rockefeller had bought established oil companies and other refineries joined them. The aforementioned business development created competition with the Standard Oil Company.\n\nAs a result, John D. Rockefeller secretly hired the managers of the competitors companies and gave them high pay so that they do not produce any oil product (Baylor 2).\n\nThe refineries that produced small amount of oil maintained an expensive skeleton team. Standard Oil Company acquired approximately ninety percent of the refining industries.\n\nIn order to facilitate monopoly, John D. Rockefeller secretly bought dominating oil refinery companies but did not change their names to standard oil company.\n\nFor instance, Baylor stated that John D. Rockefeller bought Creek Oil Company in Pennsylvania but he did not change the name to Standard Oil Company (5). As a result, the workers of Standard Oil Company and Creek Oil worked collaboratively.\n\nThe sales of Standard Oil increased because customers who were against the company were still buying the oil because they thought it belonged to Creek Oil Company.\n\nBuying or Creating Other Companies That Sell Oil Related Products\n\nJohn D Rockefeller created companies that sell oil related products like pipelines as well as engineering firms that operated independently but gave Standard Oil Company rebates.\n\nIn 1879, Standard Oil Company became a monopoly in the oil transport industry after John D. Rockefeller created an oil pipeline company (Baylor 3). Although Tidewater Pipe Line Company tried to compete with Standard Oil, it did not succeed.\n\nThis is because John D. Rockefeller bought an exclusive chatter to construct its industry where Tidewater Company had planned to build one. As a result, Tidewater Company entered into an agreement with the Standard Oil Company so that they could survive in the competitive business environment.\n\nSince Standard Oil Company had control over the market, it restricted the pipeline business activities of Tidewaters to eleven point five percent and retained the remaining percentage.\n\nStandard Oil Company managed to form secret collaboration with the South Improvement Company. Thus, South Improvement Company proposed the secret cartels of the Standard Oil Company and gave them rebates while raising the charges for the other refineries industries (Baylor 2).\n\nOn the other hand, the South Improvement Company used to get rebates from other oil refinery industries as well as information about the prices of their products. John D. Rockefeller would be given the abovementioned information and he was able to regulate the oil prices and underpin his competitors.\n\nMoreover, Standard Oil Company used to ship their barrel on the Standard Oil Company railroad in exchange of a discount of forty cents per barrel. As people became aware of the dirty games of John D. Rockefeller in the oil industry, he had already acquired twenty two out of twenty six of his competitors in Cleveland.\n\nUse of Thugs\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller used thugs to coerce competitors who could not be persuaded to collaborate with him. Ida Tarbell, an European competitor tried to attack Standard Oil Company by arraigning the impact of John D. Rockefeller on other oil refinery companies.\n\nWhen John D. Rockefeller realized the mission of Tarbell, he tried to engage him in an agreement. Tarbell refused and John D. Rockefeller send the owners of small refinery companies to destroy his oil pump and well by burning or smashing them (Baylor 3).\n\nThe aforementioned tactic ensured that standard Oil Company remained a monopoly.\n\nThe Net Worth of John D Rockefeller and Carlos Slim Helú\n\nJohn D Rockefeller net worth was six hundred and sixty three point four billion dollars as of February (Ash 171). He got his money from oil businesses. He operated standard oil company for twenty seven years before retiring in i897. He is the founder of Rockefeller and Chicago universities.\n\nHe was generous and supported tertiary institutions like Harvard, Yale and Columbia.John D. Rockefeller founded the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and the Education Board in order to increase the opportunity of people to learn. He was a philanthropist.\n\nCarlos Slim Helú is the richest person in the world with a net worth of sixty nine billion dollars (Ash 171). He gets his money from his telecommunication, retail and mining business enterprises. Some of them include Conglomerate, Telmex and Grupo Carso. He is the chief executive of Telmex.\n\nEvery one dollar that each person in Mexico spent, twenty cents belongs to Helú. It is predicted that in the next five year, the net worth of Helú will increase by approximately thirty billion dollars if he maintain the same race.\n\nConclusion\n\nJohn D. Rockefeller made one of the most influential decisions of monopolizing the petroleum industry. He used unethical business practices to monopolize the Standard Oil Company.\n\nOn the other hand, he was generous and made sure that he donated ten percent of his dues every month. He is the richest man that has ever lived with a net worth of sixty three point four billion dollars as of February.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAsh, Russell. Top Ten of Everything.

      "A critical Evaluation of a Second language Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Major features of the assessment\n 3. Methods of language assessment and their degree of effectiveness\n 4. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere has been an increase in language testing and evaluation in the world due to globalisation. There has also been a wide acceptance of second language training in many countries in the world today. Therefore, there is a high demand of a common language that can aid in the interaction of people in tourism, technology, trade, science and research, international relations, and media. It is also common in various governments today to adapt a second language of communication in official matters.\n\nAccording to Berthele (2012, p.453), adaptation of second languages, which are foreign languages in most cases, has increased the need for rigorous training, testing, and evaluation. Inclusion of second languages in various academic education curriculums has also increased the need for training, testing, and evaluation in languages.\n\nBerthele (2012, p.454) points how language assessment mainly focuses on the evaluation of first language of study, the second language assessment, or any other language that the learner takes in various institutions of learning. Language assessment and evaluation may take the form of listening skill test, speaking skill tests, reading skill tests, writing skill tests, and cultural comprehension tests.\n\nTaylor (2005, p.154) argues that an evaluation seeks to test the ability of the learner to understand how the language works and to test the level of proficiency in that particular language. This paper discusses and critically evaluates language testing and assessment in a school educational environment.\n\nMajor features of the assessment\n\nLearners of languages should be part of the process of teaching and assessment. For a clear and standardised evaluation and assessment, the teacher and the learner should be ready to work together and to play their rightful role.\n\nAccording to Taylor (2005, p.155), the purpose of language assessment and evaluation is to discover the level of knowledge that the learner has on a particular language and his or her ability at that stage. Assessment and evaluation of language is important in the learning process.\n\nAll stakeholders in a school situation approve that evaluation is important. For example, teachers want learners’ ability in language evaluation. Lockwood (2012, p.107) observes that teachers implement the language assessment plans of the administrators.\n\nIn the evaluation, teachers should know the previous level of performance together with what was to be done next. The teacher should also know what the students already know and/or do not know. The teacher makes a language program successful or not.\n\nLockwood (2012, p.107) observes that school administrators would want learners evaluated to gauge the level of performance of the institution.\n\nThe administrators provide the school institutions with human resources and finances. For administrators to understand the resources needed in the institution, they have to be well versed with language performance of the learners. The administrators also plan for changes in academic programs if they realise that the language learners are not achieving the expected success\n\nParents would want their sons and daughters evaluated to enable them know the ability of the learner. The students would want their language skills assessed to enable them gauge themselves. Parents are usually very anxious in knowing the results of their sons and daughters whenever they take them to school.\n\nParents will therefore depend on language teachers and administrators to know the results of their children. Jeong (2013, p.345) affirms that parents also trust the teachers to set the evaluation standards for their children, administer the tests, mark, and to analyse the results. Such results make parents more dedicated to the academic development of their children.\n\nThe students would also want to know their results occasionally. Learners would like to be assessed to know their level of development. It is also in the interest of the learners to evaluate themselves and to compare themselves with other learners. Language learners would also want to know their achievements at various stages of learning. Assessment and evaluation of learners’ language level would enhance their confidence and satisfaction level.\n\nLanguage assessment results should be issued to learners in a supportive environment. Wrong environment and context may make the language learner develop a negative attitude towards the examinations and examiners. Teachers should therefore be supportive to learners in a bid to make them understand that the evaluation is meant to make them develop their skills. In most cases, negative implications of the evaluation and assessment result from aggression of the assessors.\n\nLearners feel humiliated by such degrading acts especially when they come from teachers, for example, when such teachers issue negative results to learners in the public or when they comment negatively about the results of a certain student in the presence of other. In most cases, problems in language evaluation result from different aspects of evaluation that the teachers adopt. The method of evaluation used may also influence the results of language evaluation.\n\nMethods of language assessment and their degree of effectiveness\n\nIn language evaluation and assessment in a school level, assessors base their evaluation on learners’ situation. The method of assessment should be developed according to the learning situation. Assessment should also be wholesome based on the complete evaluation of the learner’s situation. Assessment should be distinguished from testing. Jeong (2013, p.345) affirms that testing is usually based on one occasion, is given in a short-answer form or multiple choices, is one-dimensional, and time based.\n\nMoreover, Price (2013, p. 207) argues that testing takes place in a formal environment, which in most cases is similar for all the candidates. The assessor issues similar testing materials. Tests are given in a similar way. On the other hand, Scarino (2013, p.309) observes that assessment is broad and more inclusive. Evaluation encompasses gauging the learners’ ability and knowledge.\n\nDuring assessments, the assessor applies a variety of information gathering methods to collect information about the student. In addition, assessments take both formal and informal methods. The assessor will also carry out the evaluation exercise at varying times and situations. Assessment is also progressive. The assessor searches the degree of progress that the learner depicts in a certain area of study for example in language.\n\nTeacher’s assessment is another broad method of evaluation. Stoynoff (2012, p.523) affirms that teacher’s assessment method estimates the learner’s achievement in language development. In most cases, the estimates of the teacher are normally accurate or near accurate. The most common method of teacher’s assessment is observation. The teacher observes learners during the lessons and or during discussions with other learners.\n\nDavin (2013, p.303) asserts that teachers observe the work of the learners, for example, their assignments and class presentations. Price (2013, p. 207) argues that linguistic researches indicate that teacher’s assessment of his or her students’ results in a better method of evaluating the learners relative to testing.\n\nThe teacher is able to understand the strength and weaknesses of individual learners in language knowledge and application. In this method of evaluation, the teacher should be very keen on observation.\n\nContinuous assessment is also a method of language evaluation. In this method of evaluation, the assessor continually observes and keeps records of learners’ performance. All grades that the learner achieves in the course of learning are brought together and entered as the final grade for the learner.\n\nMansor et al. (2013, p.101) affirms that continuous assessment is not based on a single examination or activity. It is also not based on one occasion when the learner does a certain activity. The assessor collects information on how the learner fairs both in examinations and in practical activities and then brings them together to get the results. In various occasions, continuous assessment has been issued in the form of a report and not a grade.\n\nAnother method of evaluation is self-assessment. Under self-assessment, Ortis (2013, p. 226) asserts that learners are empowered in a way that they can carry out personal evaluation in an accurate and clear way. The assessors agree with the learners on the methods that they will use to evaluate themselves long before the training. In some instances, learners and teachers agree on the method and criteria of assessment.\n\nThe method of weighting the results is also agreed on. With correct and adequate information, Rea-Dickins (2000, p. 376) argues that learners are able to assess themselves accurately. This method of evaluation is also advantageous since learners are likely to become more responsible in the way they handle their performance in language. Since they are exposed to the methods of evaluation at an early age, they are therefore likely to make very few mistakes.\n\nThe method is therefore said to yield better results if learners are trained to avoid self-bias. The most commonly adopted criteria of testing in this method of assessment are non-referenced and criterion-referenced tests. Mansor et al. (2013, p.101) affirms that criterion-referenced test is carried out based on a particular standard of language testing. In most cases, schools adopt this kind of testing since it is fixed and easy to carry out comparisons.\n\nSeveral schools may come together and adopt a certain criterion-referenced assessment for testing their students in language. The advantage of this method is that it can be used to compare several learners and/or schools performance in languages. Pesco and O’Neill (2012, p.421) assert that the non-referenced test has also been applied in comparing one group of learners with reference to another. In this method, other learners use one group as a reference point.\n\nThe performance of individual learners in language is also rated with reference to that of another student. The method is advantageous in that poorly performing students can set their language targets with reference to better performing ones. However, the method is also limited in scope since it limits its standards to that of another individual. Stoynoff (2012, p.523) affirms that the individual-referenced assessment has also been adopted in language assessment.\n\nThis testing method makes use of the individual learner’s previous performance as a reference. The learner is therefore made to assess his or her performance with reference to his or her past results and his or her ability. For example, in language assessment, the learner can evaluate the number of words he or she could write during the end of the last learning season and compare it with the number of such words that he or she can pronounce.\n\nDavin (2013, p.303) asserts that individual-referenced testing is advantageous in that learners can be able to set individual standards to measure their level of growth. Learners can also take stock of their language development from one season to the other.\n\nOrtis (2013,p. 226) asserts that, when a learner knows that a certain act, utterance, or a way of writing will make him or her fail in the evaluation, he or she is likely to avoid it. In this way, learners are able to make accurate evaluations of their assessments.\n\nLanguage ability and knowledge are also assessed through portfolios. Rea-Dickins (2000, p. 375) argues that, when using portfolio method of assessment and evaluation, various portfolios that learners do within the course of their studies in school are collected. Such portfolios comprise projects, term papers, assignments, and activities that the learners engage in during the period of learning.\n\nThe learner or the teacher collects and files all these materials. It is from these portfolios that the learners’ ability and knowledge in a particular language are evaluated. Collection of all these items forms the basis on which the learner is evaluated. Individual portfolios account for certain marks or grades.\n\nPesco and O’Neill (2012, p.421) affirm that the use of a portfolio is also advantageous because there is continuity in evaluation. The learners’ ability and knowledge in a certain language may change over time. It is therefore necessary to use a method of assessment that accounts for the entire period.\n\nReference List\n\nBerthele, R. (2012).

      "Power, Memory and Spectacle on Saddam Hussein’s Death Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Hussein’s background\n 2. Rise to power\n 3. Maintaining power\n 4. Government support\n 5. Leadership model\n 6. Political repression\n 7. Relations with the Middle East\n 8. Conclusion\n 9. References\n\nHussein’s background\n\nSaddam Hussein was born in Tirkrit in the year 1937. He later got married and had three children three of which were girls and two boys. His academic profile is quite impressive despite the hardship of his academic story.\n\nHe finished his secondary education in Egypt in 1962 and later he joined a school of law in Cairo where he studied law. He furthered his studies and his studies and received an honorary degree in master of Art in military science. He also received a doctorate in law at the University of Baghdad.\n\nThese achievements were fundamental in launching his career in the political scene and most importantly in the global political arena. His political career began with the Arab Baath Socialist Party ‘A.B.S.P’ in 1956 (Lucy & Mickler, 2006). While he was still a student, was in prison for at least six months. This was due to his involvement in political activities that were in rebellion to the then regime.\n\nAbdul-Karim Qassim was the Prime Minister by then and the revolt intended to oust him from power. Saddam was actively involved in this operation and consequently arrested for his role in the revolt. Saddam received gunshots severally by the prime minister’s bodyguards and nursed serious wounds. He was later sentenced to death although he was not yet in the custody police (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nRead this led to his sentence in absentia. He was to be detained later in Iraq later for his leadership in Baghdad but while in prison, he continued with his studies and completed his first year’s study (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nHe was chosen to be the leader and later the secretary general of the Arab Baath Socialist Party while still in prison. In 1967, Saddam Hussein escaped from police custody and resumed his role in the revolt against Ahmed.\n\nRise to power\n\nSaddam holds the record for being the best known but most hated Arab leaders for the last few decades. He was the leader of Iraq for at least two decades and the Iraq government under his leadership was characterized by acts of terror (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nHis government was most feared by its citizens than by the rest of the world and he used violence to maintain his political influence in the region. Saddam was one leader who would do anything just to remain in power no matter how much it would compromise the well-being of his people.\n\nThe best word that best described his style of leadership was a dictator (Lucy & Mickler, 2006). His approach of inflicting fear on the people scared away the human rights activist and silenced the media (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nThese helped him advance his influence since no one within his boarders would dare speak negatively about his governance lest they lose their lives. Immediately he gained power and became the president of Iraq, President Hussein’s first action was to eliminate all of his rivals. His rational was that the only way to unite the country was to eliminate the elements of division who in his opinion were the opposition.\n\nHe maintained that his actions had the best interest of the country but in the real sense, his actions were driven by a personal vendetta fueled by greed for power. Saddam’s solution for political dispute eliminated simple and clear the enemy. His terror rule was far much, beyond what a country could take and his influence was quite enhanced.\n\nWhile he was still hated for his terror even to his own people, Saddam was still admired for his defiance of the western influence and resisting the Israeli. These things gave him great support from the Arab people. However, globally he was a terrorist. The war against Iran was another factor that gave Hussein a great following within his borders although some protested against his actions severely.\n\nSaddam’s strategy for rising to power was by killing and eliminating anyone who threatened his autonomous and dictator rule. Saddam rose to power as fast as he was promoted as the general in the Iraqi armed forces in 1976 (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nHis role became even more prominent with the condition of the then head of state Ahmed Hassan. Being unable to perform his duties as the leader of government, Saddam quickly assumed responsibility as the head of sates under de facto terms.\n\nMaintaining power\n\nCleverly, Saddam while serving as the vice president under General Ahmed Hassan crated a secret security force that was always in the gap while the government and the armed forces were in conflict.\n\nThis gave Saddam great support within the military and hence he was able to influence military actions against the prime minister. He was capable of overthrowing the government anytime he wanted to and had the necessary resources to do so (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nThrough his security forces, he was able to stabilize the government in a period when the country was very prone to coupes from different rebellions. He nationalized oil resources and all the financial institutions were under his authority.\n\nWith the rich oil deposits in Iraq, the country was quickly recovering from the war and the money they remitted through the exportation of oil as quit useful in rebuilding the government (Lucy & Mickler, 2006). With all the financial muscles of the country under Saddam, he was able to take control of the country in all departments (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nBy this time he was acting as a de facto head of state under the authority of the then ailing president. Nonetheless, he had already mounted significant support from the military and the citizens already besides his control over the country’s financial systems. In 1979, he was officially the new president of Iraq taking over from General Ahmed Hassan.\n\nIn his de facto headship years, Saddam had suppressed many militias and groups who wanted to overthrow the government while the general was ailing. His actions proved advantageous when he rose to power because he had already reduced these groups into powerless organizations hence they did not pose a threat to him or his government.\n\nGovernment support\n\nIt was not until the aftermath of the September 9/11 did the world come to the knowledge of Saddam’s associations with the Al- Qaeda terror group (Kellner, 1989).\n\nGovernment officials maintain that an extremely enigmatic connection existed between ex- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the drastic Islamist revolutionary group Al-Qaeda. Through a succession of meetings allegedly connecting the Iraqi Intelligence Service, the government received intelligence\n\nSupport from the terror group. In the lead up to the Iraq War, U.S. President George W. Bush suspected that Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and combative faction al-Qaeda might scheme to instigate revolutionary attacks on the United States hence the government justification to go to war. Iraq attacked Iran, first violating Mehrabad Airport of Tehran and then toward the inside of the oil-rich Iranian land of Khuzestan.\n\nThe elimination of Saddam Hussein from authority in Iraq was, in the approved manner, was one of the most important goals of the U.S. government. In view of the fact that the assault of Kuwait in August 1990, the United States saw Saddam as a violent, daring, and megalomaniacal leader.\n\nSteadiness and harmony in the state could not be built but in his absence. Saddam was a dictator and a difficult leader who did not have respect for the rule of law.\n\nHe was entire in support of militia groups and the terror organization. Saddam’s supporters were mainly the Arabic countries and the Muslim populated countries around the world such as Libya and Egypt. He was forced to let some of his detained opposition leaders free due to the cutting edge sanctions imposed on Iraq by the international communities.\n\nLeadership model\n\nEntirely, Saddam’s policies were meant to modernize and develop his country. The only problem was that he was using measures that were quite brutal violating other people’s rights (Bromley, 2004).\n\nHe was responsible for formulating policies that gave more rights to women, which was a positive gesture on his leadership. Nevertheless, unfortunately, he also sanctioned the murder of ethnic minorities in the country dividing the state into tribal lines (Kellner, 1989).\n\nDividing the nation brought unimaginable harm to the natives and violence broke up leaving the country in civil war (Bromley, 2004). The Kurds were the greatest affected ethnic group of killed in thousands using chemical weapons. These actions were direct orders from the president himself.\n\nHe also had the ambition to take over Iran through military action although the Iranian government was very prepared to oppose him. He lost the battle to conquer Iran. Even after Saddam offered a cease-fire to the Iranian government during the war, they declined and continued the war. They wanted to go on fighting to see that the Saddam administration was overthrown (Bromley, 2004).\n\nBy that time, Iraq was still occupying a large portion of the Iranian land but the Iranians were determined to fight Saddam off their land. Saddam’s model of leadership therefore is a confrontational style of governance. His name in effect to that means “the one who confronts.”\n\nWhen he ordered his troops to take over Kuwait, the Americans responded in defense of Kuwait (Kellner, 1989). The war was very expensive in expressions of the public dead, infrastructure damaged and the amount outstanding acquired, mutually for the two countries (Kellner, 1989).\n\nIran’s fatalities numbered at in excess of millions while Iraqi fatalities were apropos half a million and this is not together with an anonymous figure of nationals’ deaths. Iran and Iraq both acquired amount overdue of in excess of 600 billion US dollars, and a great deal of Iraq’s oil manufacture infrastructure were in a wreck (Kellner, 1989). In addition, all of this was for nil defensive expansion for each country.\n\nPolitical repression\n\nThe Iraqi government led by Hussein allowed and supported the country’s division along tribal, religious and ethnic grounds. Saddam’s influence was supported by the Sunnis while. His ambitions saw him initiate nuclear enrichment, which became a major concern of the United States (Bromley, 2004).\n\nThe Americans were not very comfortable with the reality that Iraq was developing nuclear weapons, which led to the conflict between America Iraq. Iraq under Saddam Hussein became a world enemy.\n\nThe Americans mobilized the world against Iraq and its leader and consequently this led to sanctions that brought the country’s economy down (Kellner, 1985). The united nation enforced sanction against Iraq and the dire measures the country suffered greatly.\n\nSaddam had various political pursuits one of them being to capture Kuwait. However, the Americans were keen to question his ambitions and they were restlessly monitoring his military actions against Kuwait (Kellner, 1985). Politically, it was questionable. Both sides maintain they had victory in the war.\n\nSaddam had fruitfully seized in Basra all the way through the conflict and Iran had beaten the original Iraqi assault and if they had conquered the Battle for Basra, would have achieved to cease Baghdad (Kellner, 2003).\n\nBoth sides were unsuccessful to attain their affirmed objectives. In Iran, the Islamic rebellion had developed ever more radicalized over the path of the conflict (Kellner, 2003).\n\nTheir leaders by no means stopped thinking about US support of Saddam, blaming it for devouring them of conquest (Kellner, 2003). Saddam Hussein dangerously miscalculated the Iranians. The Iraqi bombardment moved forward profoundly into Iran, both countries cities in danger of nightly bombing raids.\n\nOn March 20, 2003, alliances of nations, guided by the United States, launched a major martial operation against the government of the Iraqi tyrant, Saddam Hussein (Kellner, 1985).\n\nBranded an alliance of the willing by the community association advisors in the authority of the US administration, merely three nations, the US, the UK, and Australia, in the accounted 49 affiliates of this league, dedicated considerable armed forces to this preliminary variance of “emancipation (Baudrillard, 2003).\n\nEven though the administration of the three nations were unwavering in their longing to attack Iraq and oust Hussein (Kellner, 2003). Their conclusion flashed the biggest pacifist remonstration from the time when the disorderly period of the Vietnam battle (Baudrillard, 2003). A number of survey coverage showed as many as 70 per cent of the inhabitants of the UK and Australia is different to an independent “martial exploit.”\n\nIn a mode comparable to the misinformation crusade that came with many of the conflicts of the 20 th , governments struggled to give good reason for their position, looking for a way to encourage rather doubtful public of the inevitability of distribution military to a “pre-emptive” conflict (Bromley, 2004).\n\nRelations with the Middle East\n\nPoliticians from all nations spoke by means of equally persuasive confidence and polemical strength, discuss Iraq’s management of armaments of mass obliteration in addition to the probable intimidation that Iraq masquerades to both its instantaneous neighbors as well as to the Western world (Kellner, 1985). Communal globe transversely filled the world with descriptions of anguished Iraqis (Kellner, 1985).\n\nThe media were a combat zone, with the principles all over in search of purchase inside the intellectual, scientific engine that assist to define the world past the territory of instant occurrence (Baudrillard, 1996).\n\nBoth antiviolence politicians as well as the neo-conservative advocates of the assault were engaged in a clash of representation supervision, in parable making and strengthening, chasing one of the basic goals of government, the influencing of approval (Baudrillard, 1996).\n\nWhile the circumstances in Iraq have changed considerably since then for the most part unsuspecting and victors’ manuscript circulated by the conventional commercial media in the months straight away foregoing and subsequent to the attack, the recitation media performance of early 2003 was just the subsequent episode of a story first fashioned in 1991 (Baudrillard, 2003).\n\nEntitled the Gulf War, at least by the Anglophone information media, this disagreement assisted to institute the moral standard, and the visual modus operandi. This was to be used by the international media in elucidating the 2003 Iraq combat to audiences, portraying a lot of the same leading role and environmental settings, and employing comparable edifying codes of excellence and wickedness (Kellner, 2005).\n\nAlthough the prompt for this prior divergence were debatably quite unlike those that were initiated by the union attacks 12 years later, audiences of the 2003 Iraq War were by now proverbial with the border and reportage techniques. The tag of a lunatic of the Middle East and “megalomaniac” are repeatedly attached to Saddam but no confirmation or proof he suffered from a psychotic problem (Baudrillard, 1996).\n\nHe is not reckless, only acted after well thought-out deliberation, and could be tremendously enduring. Indeed, he used time as a bat (Baudrillard, 1996). While he was sensitively in touch with authenticity, he was often politically out of stroke with reality (Kellner, 2005).\n\nSaddam’s humanity analysis was thin and indistinct; furthermore, he had negligible knowledge outside of the Arab world. His only persistent familiarity with non-Arabs was with his Soviet armed forces advisors, and he apparently had merely gone outside of the Middle East on two occurrences, a concise trip to Paris in 1976, and one more trip to Moscow (Kellner, 2003).\n\nIn addition, toadies, frightened by Saddam’s well-founded status for viciousness, encircled him and who are scared to disagree with him (Baudrillard, 1996). He had brutally eliminated superficial intimidation to his power and associates censure with treachery.\n\nWhen he completely assumed the reins of Iraqi headship, one of his first acts as earlier noted was to put to death 21 high-ranking officials whose allegiance were questionable (Baudrillard, 1996).\n\nThe staged meeting was captured on film while the officers were being executed and Saddam himself was in a luxurious room watching the proceedings while smoking cigars (Lucy & Mickler, 2006).\n\nSubsequent to the forced declaration of guilt by a planner whose family had been detained, the remaining higher-ranking officials produced the effecting squads. In 1982, when the war with Iran was going very badly in Iraq and Saddam desired to end the warfare, Khomeini, who was personally absorbed on Saddam, insisted there could be no tranquility until Saddam was detached from the authority (Baudrillard, 1996).\n\nAt a cabinet assembly, Saddam asked his ministers to give their recommendations honestly. The Minister of Health recommended Saddam to for the time being to step down, to take up again the government after tranquility had been established.\n\nSaddam purportedly thanked him for his frankness and prearranged his arrest. His wife beseeched for her husband’s return, demonstrating that her husband for all time had been dedicated to Saddam. Saddam assured her that her husband would be brought back home. The following day, Saddam her husband’s dead body was brought back in her home in a black canvas paper bag, sliced into bits.\n\nThis mightily enhanced the awareness of the other ministers who were indisputably in their persistence that Saddam should stay in power. Sometimes he wanted forthright recommendation, but it is hard to tell at what time he beyond doubt means it.\n\nThe careful penchant was to give him the counsel that he would most probably want to hear (Baudrillard, 1983). Saddam had a propensity to harm people and once his mind was made up, nothing would make hike him think otherwise.\n\nThe effect of his actions made the leaders to be afraid of him and they rarely would offer candid counsel even when he truthfully needed (Baudrillard, 1983). Misguided counsel mainly caused his gross miscalculation of political agreements from the panel of intimidated cabinet members. He was a psychopath and would do anything as long he found pleasure in doing it.\n\nHe disregarded other people and thought only about himself. His greed and pursuit of power was beyond a normal human understanding capacity. His personal belief was that he was destined to lead the country by GOD and that he was the destiny of the country.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe attempts by the Americans to oust the reign of Saddam leadership were successful although it took quite a long time to find him. This only shows how the leader was well connected and had utmost support. This leaves the question in the face of the anti-terror commitment.\n\nAssuming Saddam Hussein was getting support from other countries, which countries are these (Baudrillard, 1983). In the effort to fight terrorism, I believe finding and fighting the supporters of Saddam Hussein is vital for national and international security.\n\nHowever, the challenge could be more than meets the eye. The countries and heads of states that supported the insurgent Iraqi president could have had a valid reason to do so (Baudrillard, 1983).\n\nConsidering his behavior and rational, Hussein could have threatened his supporters and blackmailed them into complying with his demands. This is a possibility since his actions were clearly evil to all human standards. The world may never ever experience such a reign in future thanks to the American invasion into the country and bringing the dictator to justice.\n\nThe great Saddam Hussein will always remain on the books of history but with the dominant factor being his insurgency. Very little or none at all can be remember of the fallen hero or the east. His death alone is the worst way of death that has ever been witnessed for a leader of such magnitude.\n\nWhat does the future hold for Iraq with the death of its longest serving leader? Things are moving forward in better trend although some people argue that Saddam was instrumental in creating a national defense force to defend his country.\n\nMany people fear that Iran might take control of Iraq soon with their nuclear technology since the Saddam backed military was almost swept away by the American troops during the invasion to apprehend the insurgent leader. The country is prone to attacks from the surrounding nations Iran proving to be the immediate threat to the peace in Iraq.\n\nReferences\n\nBaudrillard, J. (1983). Simulations .

      "Information Sources Useful In Completing RBV Analysis Coursework\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Economic Value Added\n 3. Resources\n 4. Intangible resources\n 5. Distinctive capabilities\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nResource based view is an approach used by management as a tool to formulate its business strategy using its core competencies from its unique resources and capabilities (Henry, 2007). This is an approach that regards a firm internal environment rather than the external factors. Using the SWOT analysis, it highly considers the Weaknesses and Strengths rather than the Opportunities and Threats.\n\n“SWOT Analysis is a useful technique for understanding your Strengths and Weaknesses, and for identifying both the Opportunities open to you and the Threats you face.” (Mind Tools, n.d.).\n\nThe advantage of using the Resource based View is that a firm is able to concentrate of the factors that are in its internal control and thus the management can manipulate these factors to ensure that the firm achieves the set targets (Comeford & Callaghan, 2011).\n\nThis paper presents the information resources that are necessary in completing RBV analysis. It looks and analysis the Economic Value Added (EVA), and resources and a firm’s distinctive capabilities that separate it from other firms in the quest to have a competitive edge over them\n\nEconomic Value Added\n\nEconomic value added is defined as a measure of a firm’s financial performance based on the residual wealth which is obtained by subtracting the cost of capital from the operating profit (investopedia.com). This seeks to obtain what is the true economic profit of a company. It is obtained by the formula:\n\nNet Operating Profit After Tax (NOPAT) – (Capital* cost of Capital)\n\nThis measure is the most successful metric of performance since it considers cash as the key point in all its measurements. The approximations are few and this ensures that it gives a clearer picture of the firm’s financial performance.\n\nResources\n\nResources are the key inputs into a company’s production processed. This is because resources occur in all stages of company’s operation (Connely, 2010). They may be tangible or intangible. Examples of tangible resources are physical, financial, and human resources.\n\nPhysical resources are resources that are made by man through his abilities. They include Buildings, equipment etc. a company that has physical resources usually is able to minimize its costs of production thus having quality product to the customers at a lower price than the competitors or having high value products at the same market prices (Zahorsky, 2009).\n\nFinancial resources are the most important physical resources that a company may have. A firm that has enough finances will often have low debt capital and this ensures that it has high returns on investment.\n\nHuman resources are a key part of a company’s resources. This is because a firm that has skilled human resource will always have better quality products than the competitors. A firm should pursue to have skilled human resource as this will ensure that its production process is manned by qualified personnel and thus result to high quality products that will ensure that customers derive quality for their money.\n\nIntangible resources\n\nThese are resources that are not visible but are important in a company’s production and subsequent quality goods. They include Technical resources, Intellectual resources, and goodwill.\n\nTechnical resources are the resources that a company has in its technological operations. A company takes advantage of technical resources where it has personnel who have great expertise in areas of production. This expertise knowledge enable it to produce unique products to the market thus take advantage of the inability of the competitors to have similar knowledge in production.\n\nIntellectual resources are available to a company that has carried research and came up with an intellectual product that it reserves the intellectual rights. Such intellectual resources are not available to other companies thus giving the firm a competitive advantage over others (Henry, 2007). The firm is able to uniquely employ these resources to increase its profitability and thus add to its EVA.\n\nGoodwill is an asset to any company. It helps a company to be able to operate at an advantageous position relative to the competitors. Good will comes through convenience locations of businesses, first presence in a market such that a company enjoys the first mover advantage, and also customer loyalty. Goodwill is an important resource to a firm since enables a firm to operate at a better position than the competitors.\n\nDistinctive capabilities\n\nA company uses its distinctive capabilities to carry out production in a manner that is superior to other companies in the market. This enables the company to produce at low costs or to produce high value commodities. They include architecture, reputation, and Innovation (Comeford & Callaghan, 2011).\n\nArchitecture provides a company with a multidimensional view of business capabilities and all other operations that ensure that the company’s products are of high quality (investopedia.com). It includes governance, structures, value chains etc. it is therefore an important tool that ensures the company has a holistic approach to production (Zahorsky, 2009).\n\nThis is important as the company is viewed as a single large unit that operates as a whole structure. Reputation is the overall view that various stakeholders hold on a company. This is usually due to its past ways of handling things and also the expected future behavior.\n\nThe advantage of reputation is that suppliers will always want to do more business in the future with the firm, and also the firm can charge a premium on its product (Connely, 2010). This increases the firms EVA. It can however be easily tarnished when competitors expose the abuse of the firm’s reputation through their marketing and advertising strategies.\n\nInnovation is the ability of a company to come up with new or improved products that better appeal to the consumers. Companies that opt for innovation often experience high profits since they modify their products in such a way that they are providing higher utility to consumers than other substitute products.\n\nInnovation can however be imitated and this may cause a company losses more so when it marks up its products prices to cover the cost of research and development.\n\nReferences\n\nComeford, R., & Callaghan, D.

      "The Impact of School Governance on School Leadership Term Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Defining school leadership and governance\n 3. Policy reforms on school governance in Australia\n 4. School governance and leadership in Australia\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nSchool leadership is now a priority issue in all schools around the world. As focus shifts on schooling and school results, leadership is now a mandatory issue of concern not only in Australian schools, but in all schools around the world (Pont, Nusche & Moorman, 2008). Nevertheless, school leadership is influenced by the various educational policy reforms that have been initiated in the recent years.\n\nSome of these policies include changes in school governance, standardized tests, school funding arrangements, use of ICT in schools, and equity and social justice. These policy reforms have, to a greater extent, influenced school leadership especially in Australian public schools. Over the recent years, there have been shifts on policy concerning school governance in Australia towards devolution.\n\nBut how has these governance changes impacted on school leadership? In this paper, I have tried to investigate the impact of school governance on school leadership. My paper presents an analysis of the various governance changes that have occurred in Australian schools since 1960s and culminates into a discussion on how the current school governance system have impacted or is likely to impact on school leadership.\n\nDefining school leadership and governance\n\nBefore I engage deeper in this discussion, I will start by defining the two important concepts; leadership and governance. Leadership and governance are not new concepts. The terms have been used in institutions, organizations and even in schools. Leadership and governance are two closely related, but different concepts as will be seen shortly.\n\nLeadership is a relative term with no clear definition. In this regard, Cuban (1988) stated that, despite there being more than 350 definitions of leadership, explicit understanding as to what distinguishes leaders from non-leaders is still lacking (p. 190). Cuban (1988) defines leadership in the context of schools to refer to “people who bend the motivations and actions of others to achieving certain goals; it implies taking initiatives and risks” (p. 193).\n\nIn simple terms, leadership is more concerned with influencing people’s attitudes and motivations towards achieving certain goals. I will thus define school leadership to involve influencing teachers’ and students’ motivations, behaviours and attitudes towards achieving high academic performance. As we have seen in our schools, leadership is primarily the responsibility of school principals/head teachers.\n\nSchool principals thus have to play administrative and managerial in addition to their role as practicing teachers. In most cases, the word leadership is used interchangeably with management and administration in school context (Pont et al., 2008). However, these three words are different.\n\nWhile leadership involves influencing other people’s attitudes and behaviours, management is more concerned with maintaining current processes (Pont et al., 2008). Nevertheless, school leadership encompasses both management and administration. School leaders often undertake managerial and administrative tasks in their leadership process.\n\nGovernance, on the other hand, involves decision-making and implementation process. School governance involves the use of power, authority and legitimacy to oversee expenditures on facilities and resources within the school (Obondoh, Nandago and Otiende, 2005). As stated in ACER (2008):\n\ngovernance is concerned with notions of legitimacy, representativeness and accountability, and how educational institutions interact with ‘ civil society’, described as: ‘ the network of mutually supporting relationships between government, business and industry, education and other public and private sector services, community, home and voluntary agencies and institutions (p. 27).\n\nSchool governance as I have used in this paper involves the use of power and authority to influence decision making on such important issues as: the dos and don’ts; accountability and information sharing; policies, laws, plans and budgets; power relations; determination and enforcement of rules and guidelines; and allocation, utilization and generation of resources (Obondoh et al., 2005).\n\nPolicy reforms on school governance in Australia\n\nThere have been major reforms in school governance in our schools since the 1960s as I will discuss shortly. In the 1960s and 1970s, Australian public sector witnessed structural pressures driven by its rapid expansion and growth making it difficult to manage schools from the central government. There were also changes in attitudes and values towards greater involvement of teachers and students in school decision making (Ainley & McKenzie, 2000).\n\nI attribute the policy changes in school governance in the 1960s to the growing number of non-government schools. The 1970s further witnessed intense devolution pressures triggered by the need to redress educational disadvantage while embracing community involvement in addressing learning needs as well as the need to update existing curricula to cover new curriculum areas (Ainley & McKenzie, 2000).\n\nOne such important move towards devolution and head teachers’ autonomy was witnessed in South Australia in 1970, when the then Director of Education Department sent the Freedom and Authority Memorandum to school heads. This memorandum gave school heads the legitimate power to make decisions on school rules, implementation of curriculum guidelines, and school ethos issues (Thomson, 2010).\n\nIn terms of devolution, the Freedom and Authority Memorandum led to the establishment of local School Councils and decentralization of non-salary budgets to individual schools. In the 1980s, school governance focused more on accountability. Curriculum development was also moved back to central authorities as pressures mounted for stronger curricula. Another school governance characteristic of the 1980s was the emergence of state-wide assessment programs.\n\nThe 1990s continued with the centralized curriculum control and tight accountability, but with some form of devolution of school governance as outlined by Ainley & McKenzie (2000). First, the control over personnel matters and operating budgets were decentralized to school principals and councils. Second, both the central authority and the local community demanded accountability from school leaders.\n\nThird, leadership enhancement interventions were sort through equipping schools with proper management tools. Fourth, professional qualification of teachers were recognized beyond state borders, qualification tests standardized and tertiary entrance scores made fair across states (Ainley & McKenzie, 2000).\n\nThese governance elements of the 1990s are still present in today’s school governance. The need to devolve school governance to school principals and elected or representative boards featured clearly in Schools of the Future, 2003 initiatives in Victoria (ACER, 2008).\n\nThese initiatives characteristic of Victorian schools aimed at decentralizing school governance to individual schools and embracing schools’ autonomy. Another important policy document to guide school leadership and governance in this millennium is the Melbourne Declaration of 2008, which seeks to promote equity and social justice in Australian schools and to ensure that young Australians get access to quality education.\n\nWhile this document does not directly touch on school governance, it calls for strengthening of accountability and transparency; the most important components of school governance (MCEETYA, 2008).\n\nIn this regard, Melbourne Declaration states that “parents, families and the community should have access to information about the performance of their school compared to schools with similar characteristics” (MCEETYA, 2008, pp.16-17). This presents a devolved system of school governance where by accountability is not only provided to the central government, but also to the local community and school councils.\n\nHaving outlined the main changes in public school governance in Australia since 1960s let me now elaborate the discussion to present the main structural features in school governance in Australia. Just like in most countries around the world, education in Australia is considered a state and territory responsibility. However, there exist differences in the governance structure of both primary and secondary education across different states and territories.\n\nThe traditional school system in most states and territories took the form of the old public administration with school governance highly centralized in the Ministry of Education and the Education Department (ACER, 2008). This old trend has, however, changed mainly due to the rapid growth of non-government schools on one part and devolution of decisions on day-to-day school operations and staff appointments on the other part (ACER, 2008).\n\nWhile government schools have some commonalities across states and territories, non-government schools differ across states and territories in terms of mode of funding, autonomy, school leadership, and governance (ACER, 2008). Catholic schools, for instance, are funded and governed by catholic authorities.\n\nSchool leadership in such schools is guided by catholic values and guidelines on service. Nevertheless, there exist some similarities in both government and non-government schools concerning school curriculum. This is because the central authorities retain the powers to specify broad curriculum guidelines while individual schools retain the autonomy to fill in curriculum details.\n\nBoth government and non-government schools alike are also required to comply with the various state educational legislation, regulations, and guidelines. For instance, both school systems have to provide accountability on performance through the national standardized tests.\n\nSchool governance and leadership in Australia\n\nAs I have already mentioned in the previous section, Australia consists of varied school governance structures. Each governance structure has an impact on leadership either in a positive or negative manner. Even so, the current school governance in Australia is characterized by devolution with strong elements of accountability, market forces and organizational learning.\n\nIn spite of the structure of governance in place, principals as school leaders are vested with the responsibility of management, accountability, and educational leadership (ACER, 2008).\n\nHowever, effective school leadership requires the sharing and distribution of leadership responsibilities among other staff members with significant leadership roles (ACER, 2007). Distributing leadership responsibilities ensures broad leadership skills base, role interdependence, improved coordination and problem solution, and complementarity of skills (ACER, 2008, p. 27).\n\nIn the old public administration system, our school principals were charged with the responsibility of providing leadership in the operation of individual schools, but governance of schools remained the responsibility of the central bureaucracy. In such governance systems, school principals had clearly set roles while teachers operated in isolation (Pont et al., 2008).\n\nThe school heads were considered the bureaucratic administrator with the overall authority within the school. The school principals had to ensure that individual schools comply with the set state or territorial guidelines, regulations and legislation. The school heads also remained accountable to the central authority for resource utilization within the school. School leaders’ work was more of managerial with less teaching, while teachers were considered experts who needed not to be supervised in the classrooms.\n\nThis approach to governance has, however, changed as our public sector is now moving away from the traditional bureaucratic form of governance to a decentralized form of governance.\n\nOur schools are now being run by autonomous head teachers who have legitimate powers to influence decisions on important day-to-day operations of the schools and who are held accountable both to the community and the central authority. Nevertheless, the implementation of a devolved system of governance has not been easy, especially in Australian public schools.\n\nDevolution of school governance has been defined by its proponents as “significant and consistent delegation to the school level the authority to make decisions related to allocation of resources” (Thomson, 2010, p. 11). From a decentralist perspective, devolution means deregulation and local governance of schools (Eacott, 2011).\n\nHowever, devolved decision making seems to be more rhetorical as major decisions on school reforms in our nation continue to be made by those holding high offices following the old bureaucratic education system. This is in congruent with the social theorists like Foucault (1977) and Bourdieu (1977) who both argued that the roles of local powers in devolved governance rarely feature when major decisions are being made from the central authority.\n\nThe state control over major decisions on education in Australia traces its roots to the constitution, which places education a responsibility of the state government. For this reason, the state government, despite rolling out school autonomy, still has to play its mandate of providing quality education to Australian citizens. This includes setting of guidelines, rules and regulations governing important aspects of schooling.\n\nFor instance, we have the national testing regime and the national school curriculum that schools have to adhere to while at the same time trying to roll out school autonomy. This only means that school leaders’ role is reduced to implementation of decisions made by those in high bureaucratic offices. School leaders have to use the curriculum guideline as decided, but can only add in a few details. This situation is also made worse by the standardized tests policy.\n\nWith the national testing regime, school leaders only have to influence the teachers and students alike into achieving the national required academic performance standards leaving schools with very little autonomy concerning governance of its academic performance.\n\nThese policies directly affect head teacher’s autonomy both in government and non-government schools thereby impacting on leadership. The situation for government schools is even worsened by the fact that they entirely rely on federal funding hence they remain accountable to the federal authority, despite their autonomy.\n\nAs our country move away from the old public administration to embrace the new public management approach to governance, elements such as market forces for quality control, performance measures, participation, global competitiveness, and accountability are becoming the cornerstone of education policy (Eacott, 2011).\n\nThese elements were captured in the Blue Print for Government Schools , 2003 and mirrored well in the Melbourne Declaration , 2008 and are now the driving force behind the development of a national education curriculum to go hand in hand with the national standardized test policy. Our education system is currently being viewed from an economic perspective as a vehicle for building a strong economic background for the nation.\n\nIn this regard, the market demands for highly skilled labour are being captured in schools’ strategic plans for quality and performance control. The increased need for performance outcome is not only presented in the Melbourne declaration, but also necessitated by the standardized testing program. School leadership thus has to be directed towards quality and performance improvement.\n\nOne important aspect of our current school governance system is head teachers’ autonomy. The devolved system of school governance has granted school principals the legitimate authority to make important decisions on the day-to-day operations of the schools.\n\nHowever, as John Walker once warned in his speech to school principals at a dinner held in North Adelaide Hotel when he stated that: “We are going to give you freedom-freedom till it hurts” (Thomson, 2010, p. 7), head teachers’ autonomy can easily be abused to the detrimental of school leadership.\n\nFor instance, granting head teachers the powers to hire and fire school teaching staff may be a good move, but in my opinion head teachers can use such powers to fire teachers on the basis of personal differences and not performance outcome as should be the case.\n\nHead teachers autonomy was viewed as a landmark move towards granting school principals the freedom to run schools without any interference authority, but some states were a bit hesitant to embrace the new autonomy, except for Victoria and South Australia that even introduced school councils. New South Wales, for instance clang to the ‘command and control’ form of governance whereby the school principal remains the overall commander and controller.\n\nAs our schools shift to decentralized governance systems, community involvement as well as participation from both the teaching staff and students has become inevitable. But what impact does participatory governance under the devolved system of school governance has on school leadership? Under the traditional school governance system, schools were locked out of community participation in decision making.\n\nHowever, devolution has opened schools to involvement of both parents and the wider community in the management process. Integration of the community into the school system and making schools accountable to the community in my view is a positive move towards ensuring democracy and accountability in schools.\n\nParents’ involvement in school management differs across states in Australia, but parent representation is often done through state-level bodies that are consolidated into the Australian Council of State School Organization (ACSSO) at the national level. ACSSO has the right to participate in the decision making process of educational policies with direct influence on schooling. The body also has the mandate to demand information on school performance.\n\nThis thus has a significant impact on school leadership in that our school principals now have to provide leadership beyond the school border to the community to ensure that parents are empowered enough to play active role in key decisions on schooling policies (Pont et al., 2008). Further, our school principals also have to engage more in information dissemination, co-operation and coalition building to ensure that the local community is well integrated into the school system.\n\nAs Pont et al. (2008) pointed out, decentralized school governance requires school leaders to “develop strong networking and collaboration skills and to engage with their peers and with intermediate bodies throughout the local education system” (p. 23).\n\nSuch a system ensures that teachers, students, parents and the wider community are all represented in the school decision-making process, but school leaders are left with the burden of integrating the top-down demands from bureaucratic offices, internal demands from students and the teaching staff, and external demands from the local community and parents in the final decision made (Pont et al., 2008).\n\nAs such, our school principals’ work has become more political in trying to integrate and influence forces from within and without the school borders. Such levels of participation in school governance may also make schools vulnerable to local political influence leading to decisions that only reflect the interests of the local community, but may impact negatively on performance outcome.\n\nThe fact that schools now have to be accountable not only to the central authority, but also to the parents and local community is changing leadership approaches in our schools towards a participatory form of leadership where leadership roles are distributed among those with professional leadership skills.\n\nSchools are now moving away from the traditional form of leadership in which school heads retained all the leadership powers to a situation whereby leadership is being distributed among teachers and school councils. Take, for instance, the state of Victoria’s Schools of the Future program whereby schools are considered autonomous and school heads are required to develop and implement strategic plans for performance improvement with the help of teachers and school councils.\n\nLeadership in Victorian schools is guided by the Learning to Lead Effective, 2006, which has been closely interlocked with the Blueprint for Government Schools , 2003 reform agenda for decentralized governance of Australian schools. In this regard, I consider Victoria State a successful case study in the rolling out of devolved governance in Australian schools.\n\nThe state has managed to decentralize school governance to the local municipalities and schools, while at the same time focusing on improved school leadership with such important issues as accountability, quality and performance control, and participation closely paid attention to.\n\nUnder devolved systems of school governance, aspects such as operational budgets, recruitment of personnel and instructional delivery are all decentralized to individual schools. However, school leaders remain accountable both to the local community and the central authority in terms of resource utilization and performance outcome.\n\nIt is for the sake of accountability that the Commonwealth government of Australia introduced the standardized testing policy and is currently working on a national curriculum. The demand for performance accountability is also spearheaded by parents and the local community as the Melbourne Declaration grants them the right to hold schools accountable for the performance outcome of their children.\n\nHence, school leaders have to yield to pressure from all levels and provide documented evidence of school performance whenever needed. School leaders thus have to motivate teachers and students alike to achieve the high performance standards required. In such a situation our school principals are now being forced to supervise teachers in the classroom contrary to the old public administration system where teachers were considered to be experts and school principals needed not to supervise their work.\n\nThe increased demand for accountability also requires that school principals maintain up-to-date records on resource utilization, performance outcome, and personnel recruitment. As OECD (2001) noted, the devolved system of school governance is slowly evolving the role of school principals “from the practicing teacher, with added technical and administrative duties, to the full-time manager and developer of human, physical and financial resources” (pp. 20 and 24).\n\nMost Australian schools now recruit school leaders and the teaching staff through the school councils as a way of ensuring transparency and accountability of the recruitment process. Under the Schools of the Future program in Victoria, school leaders are expected to submit school annual reports the state education authority as a way of ensuring quality assurance, despite the schools’ autonomy in terms of management.\n\nAccording to a study conducted by Caldwell (1998), the Schools of the Future program reveals close association with school curriculum and learning outcomes, but has very little association with improvements in school achievement. The findings of this study only proves that while such systems of school governance may be beneficial in ensuring learning outcomes, they may have a negative impact on school leadership hence hampering performance improvement.\n\nConclusion\n\nI have managed to draw the link between school governance and school policy in this paper. From my discussion, school governance in Australia and most countries around the world have evolved over the years from a centralized bureaucratic form of governance where the state and territorial authorities retain all the powers to make all decisions concerning school governance to a decentralized system where the state and territorial authorities delegate some decision-making powers to the local authority and schools.\n\nHowever, the devolved system of school governance has also come with increased demands for participation, accountability and performance improvement. As such, school leader’s role has changed with the changing governance policies. School leadership in the current governance system has added more responsibilities to school heads than was the case in the old public administration form of governance.\n\nReferences\n\nACER (Australian Council for Educational Research) (2008).

      "An Exploration of Structural Changes in the Economy And Labour Market Essay\n\nAnthias (2007) and Griffith (1998) argue that, post-industrialization marks the transition where service sector offers more revenue than the manufacturing sector in specific nations. In the 19 th century during the industrial age, Britain was the leading nation in industrialization. Britain had founded its empire on the mercantilism era where it emphasized on in-side trading and suppressed any rival empires.\n\nThe mercantile economic theory was founded on the principle of ensuring collaboration between the merchants and the Britain in order to enhance private wealth and political power by segregation of other empires. In order to enforce the mercantile theory, the British government sheltered its merchants and segregated others through regulations, trade barriers, and subsidiaries of local industries. These measures favoured local industries and suppressed foreign industries.\n\nHowever, as time elapsed there was a need to collaborate in trading. The emergence and propagation of globalization favoured other nations that were more recipient to the changing economic evolvement. Nations such as Germany, United States and Japan overtook Britain in the international trading.\n\nThis happened during the Fordism period where many industries evolved from large static organisations with stable markets to small dynamic firms with specialized markets. The shift-attracted mass production and economy of scale became the competing factor.\n\nAccording to Held (1999) and Herman (1999), the continuous proliferations of globalization lead to an increased competition because of consumers’ access of many varieties of products/services. Of late, there has been a great evolvement of the trade policy pursued by the EU.\n\nThe EU has continuous loosened their tight regulations by tariffs and quotas to embrace non-tariffs barriers to trade, as well as single market. The EU trading policy are known for being committed towards specific policy issues that entail gender relations, social policy, labour protection and environmental sustainability that greatly curtail free trade international.\n\nThe demand for high quality, low costs and shorter period for production because of globalization and market liberalization has called for outsourcing of some services as well as high participation of women in the labour market.\n\nWhereas Herman (1997) associate American firms in opting for outsourcing most of their services in response to the current stiff global competition, Hurrell (2000) argue that firms in Europe and particularly the UK respond by attracting young and educated personnel from foreign countries to come and boost their slow economy.\n\nThe Europe economy is slow because of low birth rate associated with high level of older working population, which is too slow to support the inactive group. Nonetheless, there has been great trade integration worldwide despite the EU reluctant participation (See appendix 15)\n\nIdentifying and discussing features of UK economy and how structural changes have affected the labour market and HR policies\n\nAccording to Boeri & Ours (2008) and Kahanec & Zimmermann (2010), UK has experienced economic and labour market changes in the recent past. As at 2011, the country had a nominal GDP of $2.480 trillion and a GDP average growth of 0.6%. Various features signify this economy.\n\nThese range from labour markets to trade among other prominent factors. From this context, it is evident that the country has endeavoured to expand her economic prowess through numerous means. The country’s economy is built massively by the service sectors, trade, agriculture, industry, and minimized mining activities. Labour market provision forms a critical component of the economic growth.\n\nThe economy experienced an inflation of nearly 3.5% with unemployment rate of approximately 8.2% as at 2011 (OECD 2011; appendix 1). This trend is inconsiderable to the labour market. Since economy builds largely on the service sector, it is apparent that structural changes in the economy and other sectors have immensely affected the labour market, HR policies, and other practices within organisations.\n\nConsiderably, labour market forms a critical provision in the UK’s economy as indicated earlier. Due to numerous structures that define economy, labour markets have experienced tremendous reforms in the realms of policies, equality, and other probable features. Currently, UK’s labour force consists of reasonable number of females compared to the past records (See appendix 3).\n\nThe establishment and ratification of Single Equalities Act (2010) has helped in promoting fairness in the labour markets belonging to various sectors of the economy (Great Britain 2010). The aspects of race, gender, and culture are no longer significant threats in the labour markets. Evidently, the need to incorporate equality in the building of the UK’s economy has necessitated the restructuring of the human capitals and reformation of the HR policies applicable in numerous organizations within the territory.\n\nThis is a prominent phenomenon when considered critically. There have been considerable economic and labour market changes and developments in the recent past. These followed the economic downturn that affected the country recently. Nonetheless, UK is restructuring its labour market provisions and providing equitable working provisions in most of its economic sectors.\n\nMost organizations have restructured their labour policies to enact the aspects of equality and eliminate prejudicial acts that have affected the UK’s labour markets as indicated before (Prasad 2002). Observing the aspects of equality, reasonable pay, preferable working conditions, and other prominent factors have contributed massively to this aspect.\n\nUK sluggish economic growth since 2008’s recession-Organisations and HR functions\n\nThe economic recession that engulfed UK since 2008 is evident in the realms of its impacts and aftermath events. The recovery has been slow as evident by the 0.6% average GDP growth in 2011. Nonetheless, most organizations in the region have endeavoured to restructure their operational mechanisms in order to address the situation.\n\nEvidently, recession is characterized by high values of unemployment rates, inflation in the prices of products, reduced productivity, and other economic variables relevant in this context. To address the aspects of employment in the region during the recessional period, organizations resolved to augment employment opportunities and other provisions that could create equality and enhanced chances for numerous people\n\nin the job market (Kew&Stredwick 2010). Restoring the aspects of employment is one of the ways through which a country can respond to its economic downturn and other characterizing features. In order to increase the income of majorities during the mentioned recession, concerned organizations strived to address other prominent economic factors.\n\nCreating equitable employment provision in the labour market mattered massively (Prasad 2002). From this context, the aspects of gender, race, and other factors were considered by numerous organizations in order to eliminate inequalities in the labour market.\n\nThe HR sectors have managed to set the minimum wages for employees in order to standardize their earnings to the global gauges. Providing considerable working conditions, diversifying numerous labour sectors to accommodate more employees, adopting the policies set to enhance equality within the workforce, and embracement of best practices in the labour market are some of the moves that the concerned HR sectors and organizations have managed to enact (International Labour Office 2011).\n\nThese help in realizing remarkable changes and curbing the recent recession noticed within the country. From this context, it is evident that numerous sectors within the country have managed to help in the restoration of the economy and reestablishment of HR functions in order to meet various labour market demands globally (Smith 2003).\n\nSourcing for appropriate, competent, and capable employees regardless of their sex, race, religion, and other factors are other contributory factors in this context. Expertise in the workforce helps massively in enhancing the economy of the state. The responses given by organizations and HR functions in response to the situation have been considerable in various situations (Sachs 2004)\n\nIdentifying if economic circumstances since 2008 have had a detrimental and disproportionate impact on any particular groups of workers and jobseekers\n\nEvidently, the economic hitches since 2008 have had a detrimental and uneven impacts on the female workers, other racial groups, minority groups, and jobseekers in the labour market within UK and beyond (Goos& Manning 2007). The noticed economic hitches interfered with the job opportunities since most businesses halted their operations and the few ones, which were operating, registered minimal production rates. Eventually, they reduced their recruitment processes and the resultant employee intakes.\n\nThis reduced employment rates considerably leading to the witnessed unemployment hitches. Nonetheless, the condition has restored considerably compared to the past. Precisely, the witnessed economic hitches affected the job market remarkably (Shimer 2010). The rate of jobseekers increased tremendously and the issues of inequality increased in order to favour particular groupings in the labour market. This is a prominent consideration in various contexts.\n\nIt is agreeable that recession have devastating impacts on the labour market. It distorts employment opportunities and renders the job market miserable especially to job seekers and contracted workers. In the contexts of gender inequality, unemployment created by recession can affect the vulnerable groups considerably.\n\nStudies shows the percentage employed, unemployed and inactive for the ethnic minority groups. The lowest percentages of employment were for the Bangladeshi and Pakistani groups, being 43% and 46% respectively. Indian group had the highest percentage employed at 70.9%.For the Bangladeshi ethnic group the percentage inactive stood at 44.5% and for the Pakistani group 43%.\n\nThe reason for inactive in these groups was to look after family (appendix 1). The UK indicate a biased pay rates and level of employment for diversified groups with the whites being the most favoured grouop in employment and payment rates as indicated by table 12.\n\nFrom the studies, it is evident that the UK’s workforce has incorporated the aspects of equality in various ways. The number of women plunging into the labour market is increasing tremendously compared to the previous years (appendix 3). This is a lucrative observation with regard to how the recent economic challenges have affected the concerned vulnerable groups. Precisely, the reduction of job opportunities has been detrimental to the entire scenario in the realms of labour market development.\n\nNotably, the levels of employment have increased among women with the annual growth remaining considerable. Consequently, it is appropriate that inequality within the labour market is decreasing tremendously. This is an important provision in the economic growth of UK and beyond.\n\nThe country endeavours to eradicate the aspects of inequality by enacting Single Equalities Act, which demands equitable distribution of opportunities regardless of the gender, age, race, religion, or other prejudicial factors that might limit the prosperity of the nation (Irvin 2008). The findings from the study indicate that there is a massive increase employment opportunities for the marginalized groups and the aspects of inequality are diminishing remarkably.\n\nTechnological changes and globalisation play some important role in driving income inequality. Technological change has participated to a rise in income inequality among full-time workers.\n\nThe impact on inequality reproduce that the technological change reduces the demand for medium-skilled workers who carry out routine tasks that can also be accomplished by computers, while increasing the demand for low and high skilled workers who tend to focus on respectively abstract and manual non-routine tasks that are harder to replace by machine. European economies show that the income inequality trend continues. In UK, there is a positive average inequality of 0.37 as reflected in appendix 9.\n\nRodrik (1997) and Rosenau (2002) posit that globalisation may also widen the dispersion of labour income, for example through, greater outsourcing of tasks from richer to poorer countries. The UK has a greater economic growth and lower unemployment rate than other Europeans countries as shown in appendices 13 and 14.\n\nTherefore, globalization and liberalization of trade should facilitate greater integration of trade among the EU member states. However, the great labour market regulations exerted by the UK does not allow free labour market. Thus, greater regulation in employment opportunities against other EU members from the perspective of the poorer countries, labour demand will become more skill intensive in both poorer and richer countries, thus increasing inequality in both groups of countries.\n\nSection Two\n\nLondon economy and labour market (Extent of inequality and its disadvantages within the region)\n\nLondon is one of the massive business centres globally. It has a substantial economy with diverse labour markets meant to enhance its economic growth as seen in appendix 2. Its economy thrives among the largest ones in the world including New York City and Tokyo among others.\n\nIts economy grows through service industries, transport ventures, manufacturing, and construction endeavours. The levels of employment opportunities are reasonable in the city despite the challenges. Considerably, the number of women in the job market with regard to this city is less compared to men (charter 3, appendix). However, the numbers are growing tremendously on a daily basis. The city has one of the thriving economies globally as mentioned earlier.\n\nThe needs to augment this provision to escalated levels have necessitated the creation of various job opportunities to help in curbing the labour market challenges. The key features of the economy are that it is supported credibly by the service sectors besides other economic activities within the city.\n\nKapstein (1999) posit that globalization should ensure a cross-border sharing of labour. However, Edwards & Wajcman (2005) claim that the issue of ethnic diversity is evident in London. This is a notable provision in the workforce eliciting some prejudicial moves and other discriminative provisions in the labour market.\n\nThe labour market of London varies considerably in numerous provisions. Evidently, generation Y (employees born as from 1980s) have flocked the labour market compared to those above the age of 50s as seen in appendix 10. This means that the London’s labour market has energetic, strong willed, innovative, and dynamic employees who have induced the aspects of change within the labour market and beyond.\n\nNonetheless, London has a high level of unemployed young people of 23% in comparison to 18% in the rest of UK as reflected in appendices 7 and 8. Unemployment of young people in EU and particularly in UK has persisted as reflected in appendix 11.The aspects of inequality within the workplace are evident; nonetheless, the rate is considerably reducing having enacted various laws to govern HR functions and operations of numerous organizations within the territory.\n\nWhile still considering the labour market features, the London’s labour market has considerable number of women compared to earlier years (Mazumdar&Sarkar 2008). Additionally, the city has both a highly skilled and highly paid workforce compared to other cities in the country.\n\nIt has also attracted some of the highly qualified workforce from various parts of the world. This renders the services provided in this city quite competitive compared to others in the similar category. It is also evident that the aspect of pay varies considerably within the city. There is no equality in the remuneration; nonetheless, this depends on the kind of job that one does and the level of expertise offered. Various industries differ remarkably on the kind of pay they offer to the labour market (Table 4, appendix).\n\nThe aspects of inequality are considerable in London. Gender, race (Bama or non-Whites), disabled, expertise, and other factors have exhibited higher levels of inequality (Kahanec& Zimmermann 2010). See appendix 10.Although women had limited chances in the labour markets as demonstrated previously, the trend is continuously changing. Inequality is devastating in various contexts. It deprives honest people their opportunities.\n\nAdditionally, it reduces the economic growth of the city and UK at large since potential people in the labour market might be locked out. It equally hinders the aspects of talents and other prominent provisions in this context. Britain is experiencing a high inequality between the rich and the poor.\n\nCauses of Inequality and Disadvantages-Impact of Equality Act (2010)\n\nCauses of inequalities are numerous as evident from numerous contexts. Firstly, one’s starting point in life might favour him or her ahead of others. People born in families with various opportunities and networks will hardly compete favourably with others. Another aspect is the constitution. If the law gives room for inequality to reign, most people will not bother to eradicate the vice.\n\nThis has forced UK to enact the Equality Act (2010) to help in fighting the vice. It is through policies that the mentioned inequality can be eliminated within the country. National economy equally contributes to the aspects of inequality. If the economy is wrecked, most people will mind their own affairs thus denying others opportunity to survive in the similar situation. Since economic meltdown creates uncertainties, it eliminates the aspects of trust and other conventional provisions.\n\nOther causes include global influence, tax and policy among others. Disadvantages of inequality are numerous and devastating. As indicated before, inequality denies competent people opportunities they deserve. It eventually affects the economic growth of the country and wastes human resources. Potentially, Equality Act (2010) will eradicated inequality and ensures equal opportunities in the labour market and in the workplace (Great Britain 2010; Oman 2000,).\n\nKey future developments in the London’s economy and labour market (up to 2016) and what the implications of these could be for national and regional policy makers\n\nAccording to Stallings (2001) and Strange (2002), the London’s future economy and labour market will increase considerable come 2016. Despite the current economic hitches, the city is opening up its operations, employment opportunities and eradicating inequality, which has been a massive hindrance to the growth of the city.\n\nThis is an evident phenomenon when scrutinized critically. It is from this context that various aspects the labour market and economic prospects rest. Introduction of various services within the city and being an international business hub is a critical provision that will help in propelling the city tremendously. With the establishment and ratification of Equality Act (2010), the city’s labour market will increase considerably.\n\nCompetent employees will cease various opportunities within the city come 2016. Additionally, prejudicial acts in the workplace and labour market will eventually reduce remarkably. Since London provides the highest job opportunities and even pays within UK, the trend is predictable to continue for decades to come.\n\nEmployees in London receive higher remuneration rates compared to other cities in the same territory. Precisely, London has a bright future in the realms of economic enhancement and labour market prowess come 2016. This is supported by its status in the world and the opportunities it offers to masses globally.\n\nA conclusion built on responses and highlights\n\nOrganizations located in London and other various parts of UK should embrace equality and harness the rich labour market that the region contains. This is only\n\npossible if the aspects of inequality are eradicated. Additionally, this will help in boosting the economy of the city tremendously (Boeri & Ours 2008). HR departments should establish integrity within their endeavours by avoiding the acts of inequality and provide opportunity based on merit and not any other prejudicial factors.\n\nThe future developments of London require considerable organizations and HR departments, which can propel the city into a bright future. The concerned stakeholders must have specialised knowledge, relevant skills/competencies, and other constructive qualifications.\n\nList of References\n\nAnthias, F.

      "Delivering Effective Oral Presentations: How to Succeed in Public Speaking Essay (Article)\n\nThe essay is a commentary on an article titled “Delivering Effective Oral Presentations: How to Succeed in Public Speaking” written by Geraldine Eliot and published in 2008.\n\nThis is accomplished by giving a summery of the author’s main points and a reflection on the article that includes good take-away, useful learning and interesting ideas. The author contends that in presentation one aim to pass or share information with an audience and for that matter there is need to think about the audience.\n\nThere are five sections discussed by the author. These include planning phase which entails collecting necessary information followed by organizing them in a logical sequence.\n\nThe second phase is designing of the presentation that focuses on how slides are to be developed. It is advised to use bullets and short sentences. Using a topic slide is also emphasized (Geraldine par. 2).\n\nWhen images, graphs as well as other forms of graphic are to be used, then they opt to be clear. The stage of delivering the presentation is also vital and calls for the presenter to hook up the audience from the beginning. Emphasize the central points of the presentation and actively engage the audience.\n\nAdditionally maintaining eye contact is vital. One needs to be prepared to tackle questions and make it clear when the questions will be asked either before the close. The last phase is ending the presentation. The author contents that a strong ending of a presentation will be a plus as it will leave an impact to the audience (Geraldine par. 4).\n\nThis can be effectively done by giving a summery of main ideas and calling the audience to take actions. Lastly with regards to final tips, there are a number of them which include being smart, avoiding use of slangs as well as manners that distract one while in stage.\n\nThere are a number of things that I have learned and will try to put in practice. This includes designing an appropriate presentation which are audible and when graphics will be used there is need to adequately label them.\n\nAdditionally, being fully informed by carrying out an in-depth information searching is of paramount significance in coming up with an effective presentation. On the same note looking smart coupled with a smile while presenting is a plus to successful presentation to whatever kind of audience.\n\nIt is also sounds good when one stick to the time limit and this can be accomplished by practicing in advance on how to manage time and being familiar with the presentation. Of interest to me was avoiding use of slangs as well as manners that will distract the presenter.\n\nAccording to Geraldine par. 5 majority of people have a fear or panic when presenting. To curb this, the ability to relax and taking a deep breath will work well in ensuring that one manages to effectively present.\n\nKnowing the audience will help one prepared adequately in terms of the content as well as how to respond to questions. With regards to ending of a presentation, I was wondering how to end it strong.\n\nThe article has indeed given me insight on how to do it. For instance one can use the opportunity to summarize the main ideas or points, call the audience to take action or even use memorable quotes. The article is a good read to those who which to sharpen their presentation skills.\n\nWork Cited\n\nGeraldine, Eliot.

      "Quantitative Data for Research Coursework\n\nIn research whether qualitative or quantitative the most important section is data analysis. This section has been seen by a number of students to be challenging. Data analysis thus needs to be done in a manner that will not mislead the various interested stakeholders.\n\nThe essay critically looks into elements of descriptive statistics as well as their significance and the concept of central tendency and the reason why it is important in large scale sampling (Neuman, 2005). Lastly issues relating to inferential statistics are also covered in the essay.\n\nDescriptive statistic is a category of statistics analyses that summarizes, describes and explains a set of information. This kind of statistics is indeed the first to be carried out during data analysis.\n\nAmong the elements of descriptive statistics are frequency distribution which are presented in tables, graphic representation which entails bar graphs, line graphs, scatter plots, histograms.\n\nAdditionally, central tendency made up of mode, median and mean, measures of variability encompassing variance, range standard deviation and analysis of relationships between variables through, regression, correlation, unstandardized difference between means and effect size indicator (Christensen et al., 2010).\n\nIt is worth noting that descriptive statistics are not only of significant in research but always provides the targeted audience with a glimpse of what the entire work is about. Additionally, this category of statistic are the best in trying to summarize the general characteristics of a given sample study.\n\nGoing through it since they are in form of tables, and graphical representation one can easily deduce the major characteristics or attributes of the study without reading between the lines (Neuman, 2005). For instance frequency distribution tables provide the number of occurrence and percentages of an event or variable. Through scatter plots, regression and correlation relationships between variables can be succinctly shown.\n\nAccording to Christensen et al., 2010 central tendency helps in describing and understanding of data. A measure of central tendency “is a single numerical value that is considered most typical of the values of a quantitative variable”.\n\nThe measure include mode which is the number that appears most frequently, mean the average number and median which is typically the center point in a set of numbers arranged either in ascending or descending order. It is no doubt that measure of central tendency helps in summarizing the set of data obtained from a larger population.\n\nGenerally speaking, all the three aspects of central tendency help the audience establish whether the population from which the data was obtained from is normally distributed or not. Normal distribution is when the values obtained from the three aspects are the same. Additionally, measure of central tendency help give more insights with regards to information obtained from a larger population sample.\n\nBeing a researcher that has been bestowed with the responsibility of establishing the relationship between perceptions of professional standards and the school district’s professional standards, there are a number of variables to be categorized as descriptive statistics. The number as well as the gender of the teachers that are taking part in the research will provide one set of descriptive statistics.\n\nThis can be depicted by using charts or a frequency distribution tables (Christensen et al., 2010). Additionally, the mean, mode and median of these teachers which is a measure of central tendency will be considered as being descriptive statistics. The standard deviation as well as the range of teacher’s views on the relationship between the two variables also constitutes descriptive statistics.\n\nIt is worth noting that these teachers do teach different subjects, for this reason the subject each teach will contribute to descriptive statistics. More importantly, the frequency of the responses to the statements they are asked to rank can be categorized as descriptive statistics.\n\nInferential statistics are set of statistical analysis that centers on making inferences about a population based on a selected sample data. To ensure that the research question is answered; analysis that will test the association between the two variables teaches’ perception of professional standards and the school district’s professional standards, then there is need to use scatter plot, correlation or regression analysis.\n\nAdditionally, to test whether there is a relationship or significance differenced between teachers gender and their perception, t-test analysis will be carried out. The later will be used to test the strength of the regression and correlation relationships (Christensen et al., 2010).\n\nReferences\n\nChristensen, L. et al., (2010).

Appendix\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmong the varieties of phases in art development, it is not always easy to pick out one period and prove that it is the most outstanding and captivating issue to deal with. Each period of art has its own peculiarities, characteristics, social conditions, and impacts on people. For this paper, two different periods from different epochs are chosen for the analysis and evaluation: the classical art period and the middle age art period.\n\nThe peculiar feature of these two periods is the purpose to teach and to help people comprehend this life, its rules, and orders. However, the classical period of art introduced lessons about gods and goddesses, leaders and ordinary people, and the medieval period, in its turn, focused on religion and its significance for people.\n\nClassical and medieval periods of art demonstrate the power of the idea to continue traditions such as teach people and share the basics of life on the one hand, and the necessity to react to the previous periods like the change of the main themes in order to prove the possibility to develop, be improved, and become deeply aware about nature on the other hand.\n\nClassicism in art as a powerful example of form and order\n\nThe first recognized period of art was dated from 480 B.C. to 500 A.D. and called as Classical Art. This period of art was usually attributed to the Greeks with their magnificent skills to introduce their interests and beliefs by means of sculptures, paintings, and other types of art works.\n\nBeard and Henderson (2001) admit that this period “has made itself the crucial episode in the story of ancient art: it saw the first attempts to produce a critical analysis of painting and sculpture, and the invention of the ‘artist’ as a figure of fame” (p.3). As any type of art period, classical art has a number of characteristics that attract people’s attention, prove the significance of this time, and introduce clear ideas according to which people become able to evaluate artworks and contribution of ancient people to the sphere of art.\n\nFirst, artists focused on the idea of harmony: they tried to delete all extra issues, things, and details in order to represent the essence. Second, the vast majority of works is devoted to human nudity (Figure 1) and the beauty of the body. To underline this beauty and idealize the world, artists could use robes or other type of clothes that demonstrated preferences in culture, style, and even social status.\n\nSome other characteristics of the period are body conditions (usually active and athletic), calm faces (absence of emotions provide people with a chance to think over the current conditions), particular occupations of characters (heroes, writers, thinkers), presence of backgrounds of paintings (attention to sense and perspective).\n\nSocial conditions inherent to the chosen period were closely connected to the style of life demonstrated by the Greek people: wars which helped to gain recognition, power, and space; loving affairs which unite gods and people; faith in supreme powers that was the reason of human weakness in front of gods; and finally, changes and improvements of living conditions that prove how ancient people strived for inventions and novelties.\n\nThe classical period of art is a unique combination of power and faith, humans and gods, trust and betrayal. This period represented an edge according to which people tried to live, love, and survive. Artworks of classicism serve as the best and the most effective proves of the prosperity of the chosen period.\n\nMedieval art as a result of population prosperity and stability\n\nThe medieval art or the art of Middle Ages is a kind of successor of the above-mentioned classicism. It is usually dated from 500 C.E. to 1300 C.E. and spread mostly over the European society. Sekules (2001) explains that there was “a perverse tendency among artists and patrons to overturn the rules and confound expectations in order to keep viewers thinking hard about the possibilities of single meaning, multiple meanings, or lack of meaning” (p. 3).\n\nThe analysis of this art period proves that the representatives of the medieval art did their best to create a proper continuation of the traditions and ideas offered during the classical period. Though a number of distinguished tendencies were inherent to the medieval art, all these differences had powerful grounds and clear explanations.\n\nAmong the variety of specific characteristics of the chosen period, it is necessary to define the following: religious nature of all artworks that demonstrated Jesus’ role in society, impact of saints and other characters from the Bible; identification of major and minor characters of paintings (major characters were bigger and brighter); absence of nudity that was so inherent to classical works (Figure 2); bright colors preferred; and faces full of serious emotions and confidence.\n\nTo represent a proper continuation of traditions, it is important not only to rely on the achievements and inventions but also to prove that society was able to change and choose other aspect to respect and consider.\n\nThe representatives of the medieval art were known as those who preferred warm colors and gold in particular (Figure 2). They truly believed that such attention to colors could make them closer to Jesus and religious they believed in. A great number of medieval artists aimed at teaching people about the ways of how to respect the supreme power, what kind of effect this power may be used on people, and why religion became so crucial for human lives.\n\nSimilarities and differences between classicism and medieval art\n\nThe idea to keep traditions turns out to be important for the sphere of art during a long period. It is not enough to present a new art approach and define it as a new era of art. This is why it is necessary to continue traditions as well as to reflect on the existed achievements.\n\nThe representatives of the medieval art tried to use the same material that was used by the representatives of the classical period to admit that the chosen material was really strong and appropriate for the chosen sphere.\n\nWith the help of backgrounds and centralizing of figures (that came from classicism), medieval artists introduced the works and pay more attention to main images by means of decreasing the necessity of the minor characters. Respect to gods (classicism) had much in common with religion (medieval art) because both tendencies demonstrated human dependence on power.\n\nConclusion\n\nAll these differences and similarities of two different periods of art serve as a good example of how people are able to develop, teach, evaluate, and analyze their lives. The idea to use the basics of classicism and improve the medieval works sounds perfect because this is how continuation and creativity should cooperate.\n\nThe historical significance of the medieval period of art of the world art in general lies in the fact that people proved how they could use their knowledge and experience in order to create magnificent works, sculptures, and paintings, and teach a future generation how to succeed in development.\n\nReference List\n\nBeard, M. & Henderson, J.

      "The Legal Environment of Human Resource Management Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nThe aim of this paper is to examine the legal environment of human resource management. Here, the paper will discuss various legal issues influencing human resource, as well as the various recommendations to counter those legal issues.\n\nIn addition, the paper will explore the various rules and laws that govern human resource management including employee ethics. Specifically, the paper will explore discrimination, sexual harassment, and disability as some of the legal issues that need to be considered in human resource management.\n\nIntroduction\n\nDue to the globalized competition and the advancement of technology, most organizations are currently operating in an unpredictable environment. They need to put into consideration the legal environment of human resource management in order to undertake their operations within the scope of recommended legal standards.\n\nIndeed, human resource is a very important asset in any organization; therefore, every organization needs to manage it properly. Human resource refers human capital, work force, or talent, which normally includes the skills and knowledge that employees working in a given organization possess (Holton and Trott, 1996).\n\nTherefore, human resource management is the process that involves the attraction, selection, training, assessment, and proper management of employees in business enterprises or organizations.\n\nIn addition, human resource management is wide in scope and includes other functions such as rewarding or compensating employees as well as offering leadership and mentorship programs to employees in accordance to employment and labor laws.\n\nThis paper will assess and discuss the legal environment of human resource management including issues such as hiring and firing, sexual harassment, employee safety and security, and accommodation.\n\nThe Legal Environment\n\nHuman resource was born from the civil or people movements during the early years of 20 th century, where scholars started to find ways off creating business worth and value via the use of strategic management of workers.\n\nDue to technological changes, environmental differences and global interactions, today’s human resource has evolved to include talent planning, work succession, labor relations and even industrial diversity (Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005).\n\nManagers need to understand the legal environment of human resources under which they operate, given that different laws and regulations have different implications to their continued operation. Indeed, this understanding and compliance to legal requirements is mandatory, since human resources are always required to perform all their duties as required by law.\n\nGenerally, the HR makes decisions based on the following. Firstly, it is important to consider legal issues while hiring employees and the benefits to offer them. Secondly, the human resource must consider accommodation to be offered to employees and the procedure to follow when firing employees. Thirdly, he or she must consider whether to compensate or not, and if so, the policies and procedures to be follow.\n\nOther issues to consider include sexual harassment, disabilities, absence from work and workers safety policies. Lastly, the HR should take into consideration the importance of discrimination policy in the organization, as this tends to be a very sensitive issue in human resource management (Jonathan, 2010).\n\nThere are various changes in law, which have caused human resource personnel to make poor decisions. The next part of this paper will discuss some legal environment issues in human resource, which include, discrimination, sexual harassment, hiring laws, hostile working environment, health conditions, and accommodation policies (Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005).\n\nDiscrimination\n\nEmployment discrimination may be described as the practice that involves treating some employees differently or an employee differently from others. This discrimination may be based on gender, race, religion, age, tribe, nationality, or even cases of disability. Here, the persons who face discrimination may be denied employment, promotion, or they may even be demoted without reasonable cause.\n\nAgain, discrimination may occur in form of poor working conditions and even failure to accommodate employee who qualify for accommodation due to the reasons of their affiliation.\n\nThis kind of discrimination is very harmful in an organization, as it tends to break down relationships due to differences and barriers created. Other forms of discrimination occur due to class status, where people are treated based on their assumed class; however, the most common discrimination practices are based on color, race, sex, religion, tribe, and nation of origin.\n\nIt should be noted that, discrimination is a criminal offence (although this also depends on the country in reference) according to international labour laws. Therefore, managers should avoid discrimination in the work place with the help of the following federal employment laws applicable in the US (Thompson, 2011).\n\nFirst, Civil Rights Act plays a big role in the employment environment as it aims to promote an all-inclusive employment in the US. Indeed, the international labour regulations call for equal treatment of all employees in organizations regardless of their physical, social, economic, or political affiliation or status.\n\nSecondly, the Age Discrimination in Employment Act tends to protect people of all ages and especially those above the age of 40 years against being overlooked in employment. This is because most organizations resist employing people of this age in preference of younger people due to a number of reasons, among them being the cost of labour and energy/enthusiasm level.\n\nThirdly, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act is an important legislation that protects pregnant women from discrimination because of their condition in job status, promotion, hiring, and compensation.\n\nThe Older Workers’ Benefits Protection Act on the other hand tries to give more protection to workers during difficult conditions, especially after retirement when they are too old to access further employment opportunities.\n\nLastly, the Disabilities Act prohibit discrimination against people living with disability in all areas of employment including hiring, promotion, compensation, working conditions among others (Walsh, 2012).\n\nIt is also important that, when faced with discrimination problems, the human resource managers should first consult legal professionals to provide legal counsel. These may include specialized lawyers and even experts in the employment laws or employment tribunals.\n\nSexual Harassment\n\nEvery organization is required by labour laws to have a sexual harassment policy that guides its employees on matters of sexual harassment. Generally, illegal sexual harassment is any unacceptable and uninvited sexual advances or actions/words that make the recipient of such actions uncomfortable; it can be either male or female.\n\nIndeed, sexual harassment is an illegal activity or a criminal offence punishable by law. When such cases occur in employment, it is important for one to submit to the employment terms and conditions as required by law. This is because such conducts always cause problems in the work place, leading to poor performance and later bringing hostile working environment.\n\nIt may also lead to loss of talent, as the affected persons may decide to quit because of harassment. Again, it is important for the human resource manager to consider the frequency of such conducts in the work place, as well as the main culprits.\n\nIn most cases, sexual harassment occurs when sexual favors may be demanded in return for getting or retaining a job or a job-related benefit (Thompson, 2011).\n\nHowever, the Civil Rights Act is very clear on matters of sexual harassment; therefore, any aggrieved party may report or sue under Civil Rights Act. Sexual harassment guidelines are also provided in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act of international labour laws.\n\nAccommodation\n\nIn cases of accommodation, the human resource manager should ensure that proper and reasonable accommodation is given to employees for higher work output including provision of hardship allowances. While considering this, the nature of the job and size of the company should also be put into consideration.\n\nAgain, the workers’ terms of agreement should also be put into consideration, as this cannot be ignored. Here, the Civil Rights Act and Equal Employment Opportunity Act requires “employers to make reasonable accommodation to facilitate employment of disabled individuals” (Jonathan, 2010), unless there is reasonable cause to show that such a move would have severe and adverse effect on financial position of the employer.\n\nNevertheless, it is important to provide an environment where both the employee and the employer feel comfortable in performing their roles in the organization (Jonathan, 2010).\n\nHiring Employees\n\nWhile hiring employees, it is important to treat all of them equally as provided in the Equal Employment Opportunity Act. The law prohibits discrimination against any person based on their status; indeed, the HR should use merit when hiring employees. Here, the best-qualified candidate should get the job without any bias, even if the candidate is living with disability or she is woman (yet the employer prefers men).\n\nAgain, age factor should not be used to deny a qualified candidate the job. In addition, job termination and promotions should be done as provided for in the laws. Lastly, when hiring new employees, it may be important to request for proper health records where necessary, but health conditions or body physical appearance should not be used to prevent a qualified candidate from getting the job (Walsh, 2012).\n\nFiring of Workers\n\nWorkers are an important asset in any business firm or organization. Therefore, in cases of their hiring and firing it is important that legal procedures be put in place and be considered prior to firing employees in order to ensure that this process take place effectively and successfully.\n\nFor example, in cases of scandals on one of the employees in the work place, it is always important that legal procedures be adhered to while firing them. Again proper legal counsel must be consulted to establish the truth of all the allegations made against the employee in question.\n\nAgain, when the employee is found to be wrong it is good that his or her firing be done in accordance with the organization’s policy as well as in accordance with both national and international labour laws (Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005).\n\nEmployees’ Safety and Security\n\nAll organizations or employers are required by law to provide a safe and conducive working environment to all their employees. This is provided for in the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 commonly known as OSHA Act, which stipulates that all employers need to provide working environments that are free from danger or harm to their employees.\n\nIn addition, where occupations tend to have high risk of danger, employees are supposed to be provided with protective gear at all times they perform their duties. Where employees feel the conditions under which they work are not safe enough, they have an obligation and right to call upon OSHA authorities to come and inspect the premises and environment they work in.\n\nTherefore, it is the obligation of the human resource managers to have a policy that provides for workers safety and ensure such a policy is complied to at all times to avoid being in conflict with OSHA guidelines.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the discussion above, it is important that human resources managers comply with labour laws as well as other legal requirements related to human resources in order to ensure employees work in a conducive environment. This will also allow all parties to realize and understand the limitations of their work as well as gain knowledge about legal departments in their business sectors.\n\nThe understanding of the legal environment will also help human resources managers to concentrate on matters that are pertinent to the growth of business rather than wasting time in court battles related to violation of labour laws (Ulrich and Brockbank, 2005).\n\nThe discussion above has looked into the discrimination issues encountered in work places, which are based on the grounds of gender, sex, color, nation of origin and age; this should be addressed effectively, as labour laws prohibit any form of discrimination and terms it as an offence.\n\nIn addition, people living with disability should never be discriminated against in accordance with the Equal Employment Opportunity Act.\n\nVarious legislations related to human resources include the Civil Rights Act, Family Act, Equal Employment Opportunity Act, Occupational Safety and Health Act and.Pregnancy Discrimination Act among others. All these legislations have special regulations that managers are required to comply with at all times in order to ensure that they provide proper working conditions to all their employees.\n\nReferences\n\nHolton, F.E., & Trott, J.

      "Reflection Paper: “Blood Diamonds-The True Story” by Schmuddelginger Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe film, Blood Diamonds-The True Story, is an assertive and fascinating documentary which explores infamous historical events. The film is an eye opener to the global population on little-known truth regarding the diamond trade. The key issues regarding civil wars in western and central Africa are attributed to the hefty money from the diamond trade.\n\nThe film offers an appealing exploration of the evils involved in diamond trade which have resulted to civil wars. The director of the film equates diamond trade as a smuggler, fisherman, and syndicate of businessmen aiming at possessing priceless diamond.\n\nLack of leadership, regulations, transparency, and good will in the diamond trade is attributed to falling states in central and western Africa. Paul Collier’ ideas are replicated in this film, where he argued that poorest countries are falling due to corruption and bad leadership in dealing with natural resources.\n\nThe film has drawn national and global attention on the civil conflicts and economic backwardness of African states. The diamond trade is at the center of the debate, where it is associated with rising conflicts. The high returns gained from the sell of the valuable diamonds are used in funding rebel groups.\n\nThis is an issue of global concern since the lives of poor citizens are put at jeopardy. The case of Sierra Leone civil war has been shown as a good example of the evils of the diamond trade.\n\nDespite the efforts of multilateral negotiations aimed at ending the war, nothing significant has been gained. This is attributed to the lucrative diamond trade, in which the syndicates use the hefty profits to fund rebel groups (Schmuddelginger, 2012).\n\nThe diamond trade is featured as a major setback in realization of peace and stability in poor nations. This is only an insight on the adverse effects of other natural resources on national peace and cohesion. In reference to Collier’s insights, poorest nations will continue to drag behind (Collier, 2008).\n\nThis scenario is demonstrated in the film through the chaos brought up by the diamond trade. The obstacles of development cannot be focused to the diamond trade alone, but rather on other issues like bad governance and corruption (Schmuddelginger, 2012).\n\nThis gives an insight on the value knowledge offered by Collier on the challenges of poor nations. Collier argued that bad governance, corruption, and trade policies play a key role in enhancing the challenges of the poor nations (Collier, 2008).\n\nDiamond trade is viewed as a threat to national and global peace as well as an ecological disaster. This is because mining is done in a very careless and exhaustive manner. Diamond mining has resulted into deforestations and badlands.\n\nPoor countries are expected to tackle natural resources as a whole so as to attain sustainable development (Schmuddelginger, 2012). Suggestions for proper military interventions, trade policies and good governance have been made to resolve the problems of poor nations and realize economic, ecological, and social development (Collier, 2008).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe film is commendable due to its distinctive focus on the diamond trade and other infamous events. The film offers an exploratory overview of the evils of diamond trade, which lead to civil wars, poverty, corruption, and ecological degradation. The insights offered in the film are in line with Collier’s ideas, that the natural resource trap is a major factor hindering development in poor nations.\n\nReferences\n\nCollier, P. (2008).

      "Meetings and social better for business Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nTechnological advancements in many fields have continued to revolutionize our day-to-day lives. Communication is one of the most advanced items in terms of technology.\n\nIn the space of a few years, people have greatly changed the way they communicate be it in the social or business circles by embracing technology.\n\nThis has largely been contributed to by convenience, reduced costs and many other associated advantages that come with technology. On the other hand, global and local economies continue to face challenges especially in finances and time management.\n\nCutting costs has become a principle mechanism for virtually all businesses in a bid to survive the tough competition and the modern operating environment. This essay discusses the future of large face-to-face meetings in the advent of virtual meeting technologies.\n\nIt is almost certain that face-to-face meetings in the business arena are set to be replaced by technological options in the coming days. This has largely been contributed to by convenience, low costs and sheer superiority of these technological options.\n\nTo begin with, the aspect of cost is very important to businesses. Face to face, meetings have with time proven costly to many businesses.\n\nThis is because they involve people coming together and in the process inquiring expenses like transport, lunches and drinks among many other accompanying costs.\n\nIndirect costs of face-to-face meetings include wastage of time travelling or getting the venue ready. Even when such meetings involve people working in the same building, it still takes some time for all people to get to the venue.\n\nOn the other hand, social media and other means of communication like conference calls and Skype cost much less and waste very little time.\n\nAll it takes is a onetime investment on communication gadgets like computers, phones and internet networks, which are usually present in many businesses anyway.\n\nIn today’s world with traffic jams, flight delays and high costs of hiring hotel conference rooms, paying employee’s night outs, shipping materials and many other accompanying costs, virtual meetings and instant communication through social networks make a lot of business and common sense.\n\nToday, there are computer programs designed to enable virtual meetings to be just like face-to-face meetings. People can choose what they want to listen to, how they participate and interactions appear like real face-to-face meetings.\n\nFuturistic technological advents are uncertain, but if past trends are something to go by, communication sector will definitely become better with time.\n\nIt is undeniable that face-to-face meetings offer the best environment for connecting with clients, partners or other people. They certainly appear more real and convincing to many people, but with the current circumstances, virtual meetings and events appear more convenient and most preferable.\n\nWith continued use, they will become a part of people psyche and will be a big determining point of whether businesses survive tough times or not.\n\nIn conclusion, it is very clear that technological advancements are making virtual events not just replacements for expensive face-to-face meetings but also superior ways of doing business.\n\nJust looking at today’s trend is enough to show one the direction that future business environments will take. Thus, it is undisputable to say that virtual meetings and social networking will be the more preferred means of doing business by far as opposed to face-to-face meetings.\n",
      "Four Freedoms by President Roosevelt Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Discussion\n 2. Conclusion\n 3. References\n 4. Footnotes\n\nThe study of our history marks the first step in understanding our earlier period which usually helps us to have a perceptive of the happenings and events that have taken place over years which can also facilitate improving the future. In this research paper we shall review the four freedoms which were articulated by President Roosevelt in the year 1941 (Crowley, 2010) [1] .\n\nThroughout the discussion we shall elaborate the four freedoms in a broader way for better understating; we shall also describe the several measures that were put in place in order to ensure the four freedoms are fully achieved for the better of US administration and for the wellbeing of the entire population as well.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe four freedoms reflect the goals and objectives of the American state. The four freedoms were spoken by President Franklin D. Roosevelt on 6 th January the year 1941 (Crowley, 2010) [2] . During a gathering of the State of the Union Address, when President Franklin Roosevelt was giving his speech he mentioned the four freedoms which he argued are basic for the humanity and all the population in the world ought to enjoy them across the planet.\n\nAt this particular time the congress had made a gathering to discuss the necessary measures of protecting the state of America which they argued had been facing the worst security threat of all times. In the speech, Roosevelt started by declaring that there is a greater need to tighten the means of security for America because of protecting its citizens in the future days to come.\n\nIn fact, he said that “in the future days, which we seek to make secure, we look forward to a world founded upon four essential human freedoms” (Crowley, 2010) [3] which according to the US administration is the only ultimate solution for a better secured future. The four chief freedoms are; freedom of speech and expression, freedom to worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear (Wwnorton.com, 2011) [4] .\n\nThe first freedom of speech and expression advocates that, all human-beings should be able to expresses themselves through speech freely anywhere in the world without any restrictions, while the second freedom represents the freedom to worship; it advocates that any individual should be at liberty to worship based ones believe any where in the world regardless of nationality (Wwnorton.com, 2011) [5] .\n\nThe third freedom from want is a freedom policy seeking humanity liberation which if when translated into earthly terms it refers to the world-wide or global economic unity which when put in place can be able to secure economical stability, peaceful life and health life among others necessities for the entire humanity in the world (Wwnorton.com, 2011) [6] .\n\nLastly, the fourth freedom policy is the freedom from fear which also when described in worldly terms it calls for global reduction of weapons such as missiles, military force, and nuclear arms among other deadly armaments of mass destruction to such a point that, no nation or state can be in any position of committing national threat or actual physical damage to their neighbors around the planet (Wwnorton.com, 2011) [7] .\n\nAs elaborated the four freedoms are policies to promote national unity, international peace and enable human development for a better society. As such, the four freedoms were accepted and welcomed unanimously by the congress based on the fact that they would improve the lives of the citizens and make progressive changes to the administrative system. Most importantly, the four freedoms can be argued as the basic liberty policies which when implemented will enhance the world wide security since they oversee harmony.\n\nBased on the fact that the four freedoms were seen as a positive quantifier in the attempt to integrate safety measures in the planet, the US administration took this as a challenge in a way of fulfilling its promise to the humanity and as a mark of loyalty to the peace mission by keeping Franklin Roosevelt’s dream alive and honoring it (Eggers, 2010) [8] .\n\nUp to date the four freedoms have been honored for social change. The following discussion will broadly elaborate the numerous means and ways which Roosevelt’s dream was honored during those days and how it has continually been kept alive up to date both at the international and domestic levels.\n\nImmediately after implementation of the four freedom speech in the 1941, America was now under a new order. To honor the four freedoms, President Roosevelt influenced the introduction of the United Nations Honor Flag which marks the first step to honoring the freedom speech by Roosevelt in his execution of the duty to the citizens. As such, the “The Four Freedoms Flag” (Eggers, 2010) [9] was adopted in the year 1948 and was declared to be a universal mark to symbolize all allies of the Second World War and their commitment to the goals of the Four Freedoms.\n\nIn honoring this progress, the flag was designed and accorded the name United Nations Flag which was unanimously accepted world wide as a way to promote unity and peace (Crowley, 2010) [10] . Additionally, with the implementation of the Flag of The United Nations, all the associates’ nations made an agreement in which they also signed a treaty as a sign of commitment to the Four Freedom goals (Raskin and Spero, 2007) [11] .\n\nFurthermore, to indicate the level of commitment to the goals and meeting the objectives of the Four Freedoms, the US administrations and other associates nations made a universal crusade across the globe to advocate for the freedom policy. One such way is through keeping the recordings of President Roosevelt speech which have been preserved up to date (Crowley, 2010) [12] .\n\nThe recordings were also distributed for communication through the various forms of mass media such as the print media, the TV and even through the internet to ensure that every individual could at least have an access to the message of freedom.\n\nApart from this, the Four Freedoms were also widely communicated through work of art by several individuals in an attempt to ensure effective communication of the message to promote the concept of liberty; a factual example of the case is the paintings of the freedom of speech, freedom from fear, and freedom of worship by one renowned artist known as Norman Rockwell among others who carried the art as a campaign strategy and as a way of thanks giving to the liberty policies (Bhikkhu, 2002) [13] .\n\nToday, the magnificent paintings are available in the library, museums, and national archives and even in the mass media to facilitate universal access.\n\nThe foundation of the modern America was formed from the comprehensive struggle and determination to honor the freedom from fear which the civilians and US federal army schemed a strategy although it was painful considering what the commanders and the state men went through in order to conquer the fear of the ordinary Americans and achieve the numerous victories (Bhikkhu, 2002) [14] .\n\nToday, the US is enjoying the same freedom which can be attributed to Roosevelt’s motivational speech and the war victories America has achieved over years.\n\nOn the other hand, the Americans have always honored the liberty policies by keeping every freedom alive. For instance, the freedom of speech and freedom to worship is one notion that has been endorsed over time. In America people are at liberty to worship according to ones believes.\n\nIn fact, the modern America has a variety of religions raging from Christians, pagans Buddhist, and even American Muslims among others. Alternatively, the freedom of speech and expression is one among the other freedoms that has been honored and is very crucial in US up to date (Raskin and Spero, 2007) [15] .\n\nConclusion\n\nGenerally, the speech by President Franklin Roosevelt marks the first step towards global realization regarding humanity and rights. To the US, the speech was a mark of tribute to the many struggles by fearless individuals who seek independency.\n\nToday, America has continually honored the goals of the four freedoms by the fact that US administration stands in the front line to integrate peace; as such American government has always campaigned for the world wide peace by ensuring that mass weapons and other deadly armaments are not among the technological changes in the planet. The recent sanctions against Iran and Korea mark the signal that US is still committed to the four freedoms for a better society.\n\nReferences\n\nBhikkhu, T. (2002). Freedom From Fear .

      "Utilitarian Analysis and Stakeholder Analysis Term Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nUtilitarianism deals with the need to give an answer to what is right that a man has to do. According to utilitarianism, an act ought to the best consequences possible. At the core of utilitarianism is the question of morality especially from a religious point of view.\n\nOn that note utilitarianism beliefs argue that morality is not about pleasing God rather it’s about doing what makes one happy so long as the action does not have negative consequences on the rest of the people (elements of philosophy, p. 97). The social reformers and philosophers who were the forces behind utilitarianism believed religion was too rigid and curtailed people’s freedoms effectively denying them happiness.\n\nThey alleged that blanket belief in God and the following abstract moral rules set by religion was not right (elements of philosophy, p 98). In effect, they advocated for the prevalence of the free will of human beings in pursuit of happiness. Utilitarianism thinking can be applied on numerous controversial issues that affect human beings on everyday life. The controversy stems from the conservative approach that has informed the beliefs that govern such issues.\n\nThe include drug abuse like marijuana smoking, homosexuality and treatment of non-human animals. In business, some business ethics can be analyzed through utilitarianism and stockholder and stakeholder analysis (Cosans, 2009, p. 391). The theories advanced by Freeman and Friedman can be jointly analyzed especially when utilitarianism is concerned in making profits and treating company stakeholders (Moylan, 2005, p. 33).\n\nCase study\n\nHomosexual employee\n\nHomosexuality remains a controversial topic in western societies. Religion, politics, and social life have different looks on the issue. Unfortunately, the attitudes towards homosexuality have trickled through to the corporate world where homosexuals may be treated according to the ideology that governs the particular corporation or industry.\n\nThe analysis of the case will be done on two levels, utilitarianism/stockholder analysis, and stakeholder analysis. Human habits greatly determine the success of the endeavors they engage (Covey, 2004, p. 20). Similarly, the habits of employees affect the success of business firms.\n\nUtilitarianism/Stockholder Analysis\n\nManagers are not owners of businesses, stockholders are. Managers act on behalf of the stockholders and sometimes stakeholders to help the business generate revenue (Friedman, 1979, p. 309).\n\nThough employees have individual freedoms, issues like sexual orientation may easily attract unnecessary attention that adversely affect business. John’s case is unique. He is an accomplished middle level manager who also is gay. Before a business decision is made, it is important to consider the utilitarian approach to this issue as well as the interests of stockholders.\n\nAccording to prevalent culture, homosexuality is not permissible as it’s is unnatural. The conservative environment that the business operates does not make things easier. Furthermore, the law prohibits such practices in the state. According to tradition and religious teaching, what john dopes is unacceptable.\n\nAccording to utilitarianism, John has not committed any wrongdoing. He is simply pursuing his happiness and his actions have not so far affected anybody including his job. According to Mill (1859) as quoted in (elements of philosophy, p. 101), utilitarianism will approach John’s situation b asking what alternatives are available to him. Being heterosexual cannot make John happy which limits his sources of happiness.\n\nIn the contemplation of firing John, one will consider the morality of homosexuality, which is the case in point. According to Bentham as quoted in (elements of philosophy 1967, p. 100), the religious believes that the people around the company’s operation have embodied do not make sense when looked at critically.\n\nIt is not fair for their religious beliefs to condemn homosexuality while that is the only way of life that John feels happy to follow. Though John’s actions are not morally upright according g to the prevailing opinions, his way of life makes him happy and that is what matters. Utilitarianism will protect John based on the three most tenets that informs it. John’s actions are to be judged to be right or wrong based on their consequences. On this front, there are no proven negative consequences of John’s actions so far.\n\nHowever, there may be backlash form some sections of the client base towards the company for retaining a gay employee. Nevertheless, firing John may still fail to persuade some of the clients who may think the company knew all along but hid it from them. Firing therefore will not solve the problem. Utilitarianism also believes that consequences of an action like John’s homosexuality should be judged on the amount of happiness or unhappiness that it’s has created (elements of philosophy p. 109).\n\nJohn’s actions are likely to make some people unhappy, but personally, he is happy and that is what counts. Besides, firing him may not make colleagues and stockholders happy which gives the manager less reasons to fire him. Finally, utilitarianism believes that each person’s happiness counts the same (elements of philosophy, p. 109). In this case, the happiness of the customers and that of John count the same. For that reason, he should retain his job.\n\nOn the other hand, the stockholders who own the company are in pursuit of profits and anything that acts contrary to that is a derailment. Freeman (1984, p. 409) says that stockholders must be granted certain rights and privileges and rights by the management since they are the owners of the firm. Freeman further argues that management should always aim at reinforcing the primacy of stockholders.\n\nSince the main objective of stockholders is to make profits, any action therefore that will adversely affect the operations of the company will be in contravention of stockholder interests. John is a priced asset of the company. He has experience, has helped close lucrative deals for the company besides blending well with everybody in the work environment. The company stands to lose all the above plus possible negative effects on the rest of the workforce.\n\nStakeholder Analysis\n\nFreeman defines stakeholders as those groups that can lay a stake in the firm or business. They include employees, customers, suppliers, and the local community that surrounds them (Freeman, 1984, p. 410).\n\nAccording to Freeman, each of the above groups has a right to be treated importantly because they in one way or the other help the in achieving success of the company. According to Beth (2005), the actions that a company takes in regards to stakeholders is somehow influenced by the company’s corporate social responsibility policy (p. 56).\n\nIn this case, the employees of the company, John being one of them, the local community that is overly conservative, the suppliers and the stockholders are important in their own ways. its important to note that the main point of this stakeholder analysis will be examine to whose ultimate interest the management of the firm will be carried out.\n\nThough the role of stockholders in determining the direction of the firm has been constrained lately, the interests and roles of customers, employees, and local community are still subordinate to those of the stockholders (Freeman, 1984, p. 410). The local community may be disgruntled over the company’s decision to retain a gay employee but stockholder interest superseded their views and that may help John retain his job.\n\nAccording to Bowie & Hogue (2005, p. 90), the survival of the company is determined the stakeholders. They can be divided into two groups. Those that determine the survival of the company, and, those that whose actions and those of the corporation affect each other (Freeman, 1984, p. 415).\n\nThe owners who own the company through stocks and bonds are the main financial backers of the firm. Their interest must therefore be catered for since the operations of the firm can easily ground to a halt. Employees on their part are the owners of skills and the stockholders compensate them for their skills.\n\nAccording to Freeman the stockholders are supposed to cater for the welfare of the employees by taking them through the most difficult times (1984, p. 411). In this case, the stockholders are expected to stand firm with John especially considering his productivity.\n\nSuppliers help the firm in supplying with raw materials in whatever sense that help it producing products. The most important of all stakeholders according to Freeman, are the customers. These same people comprise of the local community that in this case is very conservative. Freeman further says that the customers are the lifeblood f the firm (1984, p. 412). Before John is fired, its important for the manager to consider who the most important of these groups is. Stockholders and customers come first.\n\nEmployees with the same skills and suppliers with same quality materials can easily be replaced (Bowie & Hogue, 2005, p. 86). Retaining John is likely to drive away a significant portion of the clientele away. The stakeholders may not risk such a move. Though the employees like John are important, the cost of losing one experienced employee is less compared to losing a significant portion of the client base.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs a manager, its will be a painful decision to fire John but when looked at from the stakeholders’ point of views, it will be necessary to safeguard the interests of the company. Additionally, the manager would not have committed any gross violation of the laws of the state.\n\nReferences\n\nBeth, K. J. G. (2005).

      "Feasibility Study Of KSA Sports and Leisure Club Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis feasibility report is prepared for the information and knowledge of the promoters of KSA Sports and Leisure Club, proposed to venture into the activity of sports and leisure in the outskirts of Jeddah, in the country of Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The proposed venture will offer the facilities of four indoor sports stadiums, two soccer fields, multipurpose halls, health and fitness club and swimming pool. A food and beverage kiosk will provide service to members and non-members in the club premises.\n\nThe demand for the various service offerings was estimated using telephone surveys and interviews with local sporting organizations. Other information like the demographic details of the city of Jeddah and the estimated population growth helped the compilation of the estimated demand.\n\nThis feasibility report provides detailed information on the design, concept of the facilities, marketing strategy, target customer groups, programs and services and financial details of the project.\n\nThe report discusses the implementation plan for the proposed project and the details of the capital cost along with the management and organization structure of the organization. The study extended to the technical evaluation of the proposed facilities and actions required to be taken by the club to become environmentally, economically, and socially and culturally sustainable.\n\nThe estimated capital costs of the project are SAR 38.9 million of which the promoters propose to provide for SAR 25 million with a shortfall in the funding of SAR 13.9 million.\n\nBased on the current pricing and cost structures, the project generates cash of SAR 497,000 in the first year after charging SAR 500,000 out of the total licensing fee of SAR 2,500,000 being the licensing fee payable to Nike for a period of 5 years. The licensing is expected to promote the club as a premium club, which will add to the revenues and reputation of the proposed venture.\n\nThe estimated demand and the quality of the proposed facilities, as revealed by the design and concept outlined in this study will make the project a grand success and this is evidenced by the financials presented as a part of the report. Any organization or individuals interested in investing in the project are sure to be serviced by the good returns that can be expected from this prestigious Club.\n\nApart from the financial partnership, the person/organization can expect to have association with one of the prestigious sports club of the Kingdom. There will be drastic increase in the number of members within a short time necessitating the expansion of the proposed facilities.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report elaborates on the feasibility of KSA Sports and Recreation Club, proposed to be located very near the outskirts of Jeddah, which is the second largest city in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia next to the capital Riyadh. The city has a population of more than one and a half million people and it is an active industrial and commercial center. The objective of this chapter is to provide the background information, the objectives of this feasibility study and the methodology engaged for drafting the study.\n\nBackground\n\nThe health club and resort business industry is showing an upward trend in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, with few of the fitness and recreation club taking advantage of the boom in the market. In order to take advantage the favorable market conditions, the promoters of KSA Sports and Recreation Club have embarked upon the formation of a ultra modern club housing, sports theater, gymnasium, boxing ring, swimming pool and soccer filed with world-class quality and up to date technological equipments.\n\nSince clubs of this type housing all facilities under one roof is rare around Jeddah area, the promoters are confident about the membership of the club and its feasibility. Moreover, there is good market potential with more percentage of youngsters in the Saudi Arabian population.\n\nThe propose project includes building a multi court sports theater, outdoor swimming complex, soccer playing fields, boxing ring, health and fitness gymnasium and a multi cuisine food and beverage club. This report was prepared using the approach of estimating the demand accurately to determine the major market segments. “In aquatic facilities this includes lap and fitness swimming, recreation and aquatic play, aquatic education and therapeutic recreation” (Simply Great Leisure).\n\nA careful assessment of the existing competition and forecasted market demand for “weights based fitness, cardio suite and group fitness classes” was made to study the feasibility of heath, and fitness club membership. The report took into consideration the number of teams and range of sports, which are keen in using the facilities for assessing the demand for indoor sports.\n\nAfter the estimation of the demand for the facilities, the appropriate designs are to be developed. Based on the proposed concept and design, the report has estimated the likely capital costs for the project. The concept, design and capital cost estimates provide the basis for the preparation of detailed management and marketing strategies to run the club successfully. A financial model prepared based on the estimated revenue and expenditure will provide the information on the long-term feasibility of the proposed project.\n\nStudy Aim and Scope\n\nThe feasibility report aims to determine the feasibility of KSA Sports and Recreation Club project covering the proposed sports and recreation facilities of\n\n  * Multi court sports theater\n  * Swimming complex\n  * Boxing ring\n  * Soccer playing field\n  * Health and fitness gymnasium\n  * Multi cuisine food and beverage club\n\nIn addition to the outcomes and recommendations, the report will provide the readers and investors critical information concerning the concept, design, capital costs, facility, and asset management considerations. The feasibility study will provide the basis for approaching potential investors and institutions to raise necessary funding for implementing the projects.\n\nThe scope of the feasibility study includes\n\n 1. Preparation of a report on the feasibility of the proposed sports and recreation facilities; this report will include the description of the proposed facilities and rough estimates of the floor space and finish of the floors\n 2. Review and analysis of the background information and planning undertaken until the date of preparation of this report\n 3. Preparation of a comprehensive report presenting the recommendations for determining the feasibility of the project including suggested management models\n 4. Preparation of a concept plan including the design of the facilities\n 5. Preparation of financial reports to support future funding requests for implementation of the project\n\nThis feasibility report relates to KSA Sports and Recreation Club project.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor compiling the feasibility study, a multi-disciplinary consultant team was formed with people having skill and experience in their respective fields as members. There were different phases adopted in the preparation of this final feasibility study. They were:\n\nPhase 1: Appointment of consultants and project inception meeting\n\nIn this phase, the consultants for studying the feasibility of the proposed club project were appointed and a meeting to appraise the members on the project outline.\n\nPhase 2: Planning for the feasibility Study\n\nPlanning involved a review of the relevant studies and reports and meeting of the project members to discuss the planning for the preparation of the study.\n\nPhase 3: Consultation and draft feasibility study\n\nDuring this phase, an operational review of the existing facilities in the proposed site was undertaken, followed by interviews with key informants. A market research was undertaken and focus group interviews conducted to estimate the likely demand.\n\nA demographic analysis was done based on the information obtained from government authorities on population and demography of Jeddah. The team made a comparative assessment of the industry trends over the past three years and based on the information gathered a demand analysis report was prepared and presented to the promoters.\n\nPhase 4: Consultation on draft feasibility study\n\nElements of design brief, concept design, cost estimates and preparation of financial information formed part of this phase. A pre-final draft feasibility report was the outcome of this phase.\n\nPhase 5: Finalization of feasibility study\n\nIn this phase, the feasibility study was finalized for presentation to the promoters after shaping it presentable to the prospective investors. Suitable modifications were made to the pre-final report.\n\nOrganizational Philosophy\n\nThe organizational philosophy encourages initiative, leadership and responsibility among the members. The club will provide an “environment designed to teach both the physical skills of the sport as well as emphasizing the teamwork, sportsmanship, discipline, sacrifice and leadership that are integral parts of participating in the sport and to also teach how these skills translate into lasting and valuable life skills beyond the sport itself” (Seattle Asian Sports Club).\n\nThe activities of the club are entirely athletic and recreational in nature. The Club will determine and devise its own rules for membership from the public, who are willing to participate in achieving the aims of the Club. However, the Club will not make any discrimination based on gender, race, or disability.\n\nThe fundamental purpose of KSA Sports and Leisure Club is to function as a sporting organization, within which “the members can actively participate in promoting self-esteem, discipline, friendship, cooperation, contribution, and sportsmanship” In order to support the main purpose, the Club will strive to achieve the following purposes.\n\n  * The club will apply its quality values to all levels of sports and leisure programs and to the membership including “directors, board members, administrators, program coordinators, coaches, program participants, and general membership.”\n  * The club will design and implement activities that will support the communities of Saudi Arabia.\n  * The club will design all the sports programs and its other endeavors as a means of developing the skills levels and for providing continued opportunities for contributing to community development,\n\nThe feasibility study is structured to present different chapters dealing with the\n\nproposed activities of the club. While Chapter One laid down the aim and scope of this study, the market analysis is presented in the Chapter Two. Chapter Three, deals with justification for the proposed activity.\n\nChapter Four presents a detailed description of the design and the concept on which the proposed club facilities will be constructed. Chapter Five presents the draft management plan including the organization structure, financial model and estimated costs and revenue from the project. Target groups, programmes and services, marketing strategies and pricing form part of the Chapter Five.\n\nChapter Six discusses the capital costs of the project and the proposed sources of funding for the project. Chapter Seven deals with the sustainability aspects and the actions that the Club needs to take to achieve environmental, economic, and social and cultural sustainability. Chapter Eight summarizes the salient aspects of the study and makes the recommendations for the potential investors and lenders.\n\nMarket Analysis\n\nKingdom of Saudi Arabia, although distinct in terms of its culture, has a different orientation towards sports, recreation and leisure than other GCC countries.\n\nWhile Dubai has spearheaded the development of leisure industry, the industry is proliferating in the Kingdom also. Even though the cultural boundaries of the country might place some restraint on the development, the growth will be slow and steady and the industry is sure to sustain over time. According to the CEO of Gold’s Gym, a multinational organization “KSA is one of the top 20 countries in the world in terms of foreign investment; it is very much opening the market for investment.”\n\nAnother positive factor in the KSA market is the demographic structure of the Kingdom, which consists of more than 60% of the people being under 25 years of age. This youth population provides for huge opportunities in the sports and leisure industry. This implies that the business developers in the industry have to focus on the residents rather than tourists.\n\nOperating within the cultural barriers imposed on them, sports and leisure professionals have the opportunity to present tailor-made product and service offerings to meet massive existing demand of the youngsters who wish to do “something”. This trend is witnessed already among the health club and spa outlets opening up in major cities of the Kingdom, while for sports clubs, the opportunities are wide open.\n\nWhen a PES T (Political, Economic, Societal and Technological factors) analysis of the leisure and sports industry is done, in the Saudi market, it evolves that the government appears to have not imposed any restriction on the running of such sports and leisure clubs so long as they are not against the cultural values of the country and the region.\n\nSince Jeddah is a large and commercial city, there are number of youth belonging to rich and high income families live in the city. These young people become the target market for the proposed venture. In the absence of any other international or local organizations offering all the facilities under one roof, the existing demand would be sufficient to run the proposed venture successfully.\n\nThere is a huge potential in the Kingdom as the country is having the largest population in the Gulf region with 60% of the population in the age group of around 25 years. Riyadh and Jeddah are the two cities having large opportunities because of the population base and economic conditions of the people living in these cities. There are cultural restraints in attracting the women, as members, as the Kingdom has stricter regulations concerning the free movement of women in the society.\n\nHowever, there are changes in the cultural perceptions of Saudi Arabian Women, in which some of the working-women look for facilities where they can work out, if there are facilities like “women’s only Spa.” The proposed venture by specifying certain hours of the day exclusively for women can cater to this demand from women and add them to its clientele.\n\nJustification for the Proposed Facility\n\nThe sports and fitness industry is showing strong signs of growth. There are only few first class sports and fitness facilities, which provide a healthy trial for others to follow. However, for the industry to grow a major leap in the awareness among the people about the fitness is the top most requirement.\n\nThe general tendency among the youth to pursue the fitness trend shows a steady increase with the number of international fitness clubs opening in Riyadh and Jeddah with increasing number of members. The effect of internationally renowned Gold’s Gym will only help improve the awareness among the youth in Jeddah about fitness. With no other renowned facility to cater to the existing demand, the proposed venture is most likely to cease the increased demand.\n\nWith the increased participation of Saudi Arabia in the Olympics and other international sports events, there is an increasing tendency among the youth in the Kingdom to participate in different sports activities like soccer and swimming. With lesser recreational facilities in the country, the youth will be attracted towards the sports and fitness clubs.\n\nEspecially in a city like Jeddah, where there is large population of youngsters the target market seems to be large and this justifies the proposed venture. The absence of competition makes the proposed venture as the first mover to the industry, which provides great advantage to the Club in terms of market share and large contingent of membership. This ensures a sustained growth for the proposed club.\n\nConcept Design\n\nThis chapter presents a brief description of the design features of the club, including the concept and staging sequence of the facilities.\n\nBased on the market research done for the preparation of the feasibility study, there is an existing demand for\n\n  * Health and fitness center catering to 300 to 400 members. The capacity may have to be increased, as there is potential for the existing demand to grow in the future. Spaces will have to be provided for cardio equipments, weight exercise hall, group fitness and lockers and rest rooms\n  * Swimming pool complex catering to 200 to 300 members including dressing and changing rooms\n  * Indoor sports theater consisting of four different arena including boxing rings and the space should provide for other sports like table tennis, badminton and tennis courts\n\nThe design should be in such a way that there is a common entrance for health and fitness halls and swimming pool and a separate entrance for the indoor sports theaters. The sports halls should be at least 36.6 m x 40.25 m x 7 m to accommodate the courts for different indoor games and sports. There should be spectator accommodation in tiered seating along one side of court having three tiers. Dividing net to be installed between each court. There should be provision for the installation of boxing rings.\n\nThe health and fitness studio should consist of a gymnastics hall of the dimension of 600 square meters. The group fitness studio should have a floor space of approximately 250 square meters. Personal training and multipurpose area including personal lockers and rest rooms must be approximately 100 square meters.\n\nThe facility will house multipurpose rooms of approximately 800 square meters providing for\n\n  * Large meeting room for accommodating around 200 persons having an area of about 300 square meter\n  * Kitchen and dining area for the Kiosk having an area of about 200 square meter\n  * Multiple lockable storage area of about 100 square meters, two times for the two soccer fields\n  * Offices for manger and staff of approximately 100 square meters including reception area\n\nDetailed floor plans showing the locations of each of the facility will be prepared in due course and presented for approval by local authorities.\n\nAccording to the preliminary proposal, the development of the club will take place in stages, depending on the availability of funds and the extent of demand for the product and service offerings. The staging of the construction and the provision of facilities will be determined by the promoters depending on the funds availability and estimates of demand.\n\nDemand for soccer fields, health and fitness club and indoor stadiums including boxing rings currently exist and it will be profitable to work on the development of these facilities in the first stage. In the second stage, the swimming pool complex and the food and beverages kiosk can be developed. Space for support services and administration may have to be provided at each stage of development. For example, storage areas with lockable space will be constructed at each stage of development.\n\nTechnical Evaluation\n\nThe following are some of the technical points, which need to be considered in the development of various facilities offered by the club.\n\n  * All indoor sports theaters need to be air-conditioned, as they have to meet the humid climate of the Kingdom. There should be adequate flow of ventilation.\n  * The surface of the floor space must be made suitable for games like volley ball, tennis and other indoor court sports\n  * The floor of the boxing ring has to made according to international standards\n  * The lighting arrangement should meet lux standards prescribed by each sport for national and international level competitions\n  * Provision for natural lighting is to be made in such a way that it does not act as a disturbance to the conduct of the respective games\n  * The areas for health and fitness club is to be air-conditioned and the area should have sufficient flow through ventilation\n  * There must be a provision for raised stage for conducting group fitness programs\n  * Floor area for weights area must be concreted with heavy rubber matting to absorb the sound of the weights dropping down\n  * Floor area for conducting group fitness programs should “have a timber, sprung floor or flooring with similar characteristics.”\n  * Swimming pool should have mechanical heating facility\n  * The swimming pool is to be provided with air handling system to circulate air in the pool to minimize the water getting condense during winter\n  * There should be water treatment plant of required quality to meet the international guidelines for water quality in swimming pools\n  * “All plant, equipment and electrical fittings and fixtures to be energy efficient”\n  * The possibility for recycling of backwash water and use for gardening purposes is to be examined\n  * All areas in the multipurpose area need to be air-conditioned and there should be provision for adequate ventilation\n  * Wall dividers must be provided in the meeting rooms to make them flexible\n  * All office areas, support and service areas need to be air-conditioned with provision for adequate ventilation. In these areas, also it is essential that all equipments and power devices are energy efficient.\n\nImplementation Plan\n\nIn order to achieve the goals of this project and to progress from this feasibility study stage to the operational stage, it requires a careful approach to be carried out step-by-step. At each step of the project, the promoters have to consider the risks involved in proceeding to the next step and make intelligent decisions based on information collected on the progress and the likely course of future events.\n\nThe first step is to review this draft feasibility study, makes comments and suggests revisions to finalize a presentable business case for securing the shortfall in funds. The next step is to enter into contracts with professionals like architect, planning consultant and agronomist for preparing the licensing application to the government.\n\nSimultaneously the application for building approval from the local authorities needs to be prepared with all supporting documents. The agreement with government for obtaining long-term lease of the land or for acquiring the land outright needs to be entered. If private parties own the land, legal professionals have to be contacted for preparing the agreement for buying the land. The promoters need to finalize their funding arrangements as the next step.\n\nThe next step in the implementation plan is the preparation of detailed plans and building specifications. The advertisements calling for tenders for the construction of the first stage of buildings and facilities need to be drafted and released. A detailed evaluation of the proposals received for building contracts is to be undertaken to decide on the specific firm to which the contracts need to be awarded. Advertisement for recruiting the manager and few other administrative staff needs to be finalized and released.\n\nOnce the club starts functioning the operating performance needs to be monitored and sources for funding the second stage needs to be identified for finalizing the funding arrangements for the next stage of building and construction. Once the second stage is developed, the promoters have to monitor the performance of the club at each stage as it develops and the activities grow over time.\n\nDraft Management Plan\n\nThis chapter presents a preliminary management plan for the proposed venture of KSA Sports and Leisure Club. This chapter addresses the management structure, staffing, marketing strategy, financial plan and strategies for implementing the project.\n\nThe draft management plan assumes that the facility will be operated to its full capacity and it will extend all the facilities to the prospective members.\n\nManagement Structure\n\nThe facility will be managed as an independent body, with a single entry and reception area for all the proposed facilities. For the purpose of this feasibility report, a thorough analysis of the management models was undertaken. Considering the lack of sophistication in the legal aspects of management/leasing contracts, it is proposed not to offer any management or leasing contract to outsiders.\n\nInstead, a management team consisting of the representatives of the promoters and professional managers will manage the club to take care of the running of the club efficiently. The management of the day-to-day operations will be entrusted to a manager, who will be assisted by an assistant. In addition to the manager, the following staff will be appointed to run the club.\n\n  * Facility Supervisors – 3 Nos\n  * Trainers for Gymnasium – 4 Nos\n  * Boxing Trainers – 2 Nos\n  * Receptionists – 5 Nos\n  * Life Guards for Swimming Pools – 2 Nos\n  * Soccer field Operators – 2 Nos\n\nOther operational staff like cleaners and administrative staff will be appointed on casual basis as and when need arises. While the manager and other administrative staff is likely to be on the permanent rolls of the club, many operational staff including instructors and trainers will be appointed on casual basis.\n\nUse Estimates\n\nThis study used a variety of techniques to assess the use of the proposed facility. The techniques included the results of telephone survey, proposed use projected based on interviews with local sporting organizations, expected use based on use of similar facilities in other GCC countries, demographic details of the city of Jeddah and population projections.\n\nWhile these projections have been developed based on the best available details, the projections have to be considered as best estimates. “Competent, professional or volunteer management will be required to ensure that these estimates are met” (Simply Great Leisure).\n\nThe telephone survey revealed that 24% of the respondents had played an indoor sport in the past 12 months. The participation by respondents of age less than 30 years was more than those aged above 30 years are. The most popular sport event was soccer followed by volleyball. Seventy two percent of the respondents were positive that they would like to use the proposed facility of KSA Sports and Leisure Club.\n\nOut of the 120 sporting organizations functioning in the Kingdom, around 67% of the organizations expressed interest for using the facilities of the proposed venture. Even though they were keen on the pricing, the idea of licensing by Nike has gone well with them and majority of the respondents received the licensing idea enthusiastically.\n\nThis shows significant demand for the proposed services.\n\nThe household telephone survey found that 12% of the respondents only had been using or member of a health and fitness club during the past 12 months. The telephone survey was conducted in Arabic and only with prospective male members. No contacts were made to any female members.\n\nFurther analysis of the respondents revealed that respondents under the age of 25 constituted 57% of the total people contacted and the remaining 43% of the people belonged to the age group of more than 25 years. About 17% of the people contacted replied that they are not interested in the idea of joining any health and fitness club. Seventy six percent of the respondents expressed interest in taking up the membership of the club.\n\nA similar telephonic survey conducted with prospective members for the swimming pool received a good response. There were only 8% of the people, who have been members of some type of a swimming club during the past 12 months.\n\nMajority of the respondents (63%) were interested in taking up the membership for them and their male children. The number of respondents constituted 34% of the age group of above 35 years and remaining 66% represented below 35 years. Twenty two percent of the respondents were not interested in the idea of membership of a swimming pool.\n\nNo specific demand could be identified for specific community festivals and social gatherings. However, there have been problems in finding suitable places to celebrate social functions like wedding receptions and children’s birthday parties, as the hotel charge exorbitant prices.\n\nThe multipurpose rooms proposed in the venture will cater to the demand of this type. It is highly likely that a well-designed and equipped community space will be well received, if appropriately priced. Such gatherings will increase the sales for the food and beverage kiosk also.\n\nTarget Groups\n\nThe primary market for indoor sports and boxing is expected to be the suburbs of Jeddah, although sports events and sponsored programs will attract a large number of people from the other parts of the city. With this target segment, the main groups will be young people in junior sports programs aged from about 10 to 18 years and adults competing in other sports including boxing.\n\nThe clientele may include schools who would like to use the courts for lessons or for competition with other schools. Sporting associations who would hire court space to conduct sports training and to conduct sports competitions.\n\nFor the health and fitness center, the target customers are generation x and generation y adults and high-income earning individuals. For the swimming pool, the Club may expect to have school and college students and adults in transition stage from school and college to employment. Young people belonging to royal families and rich members of the community are the main target groups for the swimming pool.\n\nPrograms and Services\n\nThe sport and recreation programs for the target customer groups will be organized as below:\n\nThe indoor sports program will be offered to the members between 8.00 am and 10.00 am and 4.00 pm and 6.00 pm on all working days. On Thursdays, the evening time will be extended until 9.00 pm. Training programs will be organized based on demand during hours when there are no competitions are organized. Events and tournaments will be organized as and when they are programmed and are likely to be placed at the weekends. School use will be programmed between 9.00 am and 1.00 pm on school days.\n\nActivities in the health and fitness center will include weight training including the use of cardio equipments, group exercises, personal training and specific programs to meet the demands of young teenagers and older people.\n\nBoxing training and tournaments will follow the same schedule as the indoor sports programs and soccer training and tournaments will be organized based on the requirements from other clubs and young members desirous of receiving training.\n\nSwimming pool facilities will be open for use on all working days from 8.00 am to 1.00 pm and from 4.00 pm until 7.00 pm.; Guards will be available during these hours. Training for children will be provided on payment of the prescribed fee to the club. The pool will be open on holidays during the same timings as above, subject to government restrictions applicable to the commercial and leisure establishments.\n\nMarketing Strategy\n\nAt the feasibility report stage, it is not realistic to prepare and present a promotion strategy for the facilities of the proposed club. The following sections present some of the programming and pricing for the facilities.\n\nProgramming\n\nIndoor sports theater is expected to have three major types of activities – “competitions conducted by sports associations, competitions conducted by management and special events, functions and tournaments.”\n\nThe functions and tournaments category will include national, regional and local sports championships and non-sporting events. The non-sporting events include festivals and exhibitions. Experience from the various sporting associations indicates that sporting clubs and associations will occupy considerable proportion of available indoor theater hours.\n\nIt is rather difficult to estimate the precise demand for special events, as they are often awarded through tenders or they are organized by the promoters and sponsoring organizations. During the weekends, the club will conduct sports training programs for junior members. Competitions will be conducted for members of various age groups depending on the members joining such programs.\n\nGroup fitness classes will be conducted by the Club on three time bands: Morning 8.00 am, Mid-morning 11.00 am and Evening 6pm to 8 pm. Personal training will be extended to members to meet the demands from them and will be offered at any time when the weights and cardio facilities are open.\n\nGeneral weights and cardio sessions are available all time the health and fitness studios are open. It is ideal to supervise this area at all times. However, it is more likely to be supervised only during peak periods because of lesser number members only will use the facilities during non-peak hours.\n\nSoccer training will be provided on all weekdays from 4.00 pm to 6.00 pm and competitions will be held on Thursday evenings, and other public holidays based on the demand from other clubs and sports associations.\n\nSwimming pool will be in use as per the timings indicated earlier. There will be extended hours on Thursdays when the pool will be open until 9.00 pm instead of 7.00 pm. Children below 12 years of age are to be accompanied by an adult member. Training will be provided by the instructors appointed by the club on the member making the extra payment to the club.\n\nPricing\n\nA review of the prices of the competing clubs has led to the proposal of the following prices. The prices are subject to review, based on the volume of demand and can be reviewed after a period of six months depending on the patronage from different age groups of members.\n\nIndoor Sports Theater\n\nIndoor sports-theater is charged on either hourly basis or per participant basis. The following prices are the current prices in similar facilities of high quality sports hall.\n\n  * Fees for team games SAR 225\n  * Other sport/hour SAR 100\n  * Other sport training/hour SAR 120\n  * Major events SAR 200\n\nHealth and Fitness\n\nHealth and fitness studio services are charged based on a range of entry prices. The main price categories are indicated below:\n\n  * Annual Membership fees SAR 2500\n  * Monthly Membership fees SAR 250\n  * Casual Group fitness SAR 60\n  * Concession Group fitness SAR 50\n\nSwimming Pool\n\nSwimming pool prices are charged for annual and monthly membership apart from per hour charges. Training is charged extra for a fixed number of classes.\n\n  * Annual Membership fees SAR 1500\n  * Monthly Membership fees SAR 150\n  * Casual entry/hour SAR 20\n  * Training for 8 classes of 8 hours SAR 200\n\nSoccer Field\n\nUse of soccer field is charged per team basis and per hour of usage basis for other sporting clubs and associations.\n\n  * Fees for team games SAR 1500\n  * Major events SAR 2500\n\nIn some cases, the pricing may appear to be relatively high. However, the objective of the Club is to offer facilities of the world standards and for maintaining the standards, the Club may have to charge a premium.\n\nFinancial Viability\n\nA financial model is constructed to assess the financial implications of the proposed venture, which indicates the likely net revenue over the expenditure for the club. The financial model is prepared based on the following broad assumptions.\n\n 1. All income and expenditure are arrived at based on the estimated usage of the facilities and the likely revenue on the indicated pricing mentioned above.\n 2. All components and facilities will be opened and operational at the same time as the club is available for use by the public. In reality, the facilities will be developed over a period as and when the funds become available for expanding the facilities. It is assumed that during the intervening period, the prices for the services and the costs will increase and balance each other out. However, over the time, there will be increased usage of the facilities by the people, as the Club becomes popular and this will lead to increased revenues.\n 3. The revenue generation is considered in respect of the following components and facilities offered by the club to the public and members:- Indoor sports theater for major indoor sports including boxing ring\n    – Health and fitness club\n    – Swimming pool complex\n    – Soccer field\n    – Food and Beverages Kiosk\n 4. Usage of the facilities are estimated based on the market survey and expected demand for the facilities. Kiosk sales is estimated to be 10% of the revenue of the turnover of indoor sports theater, swimming pool, health and fitness club and soccer field usage.\n 5. Health and fitness revenue is calculated at 300 members paying an annual membership of SAR 2500 and Swimming pool revenue is based on the 200 members paying annual membership of SAR 1500 each. This provides for revenue from Health and Fitness at SAR 750,000 and from Swimming pool SAR 300,000\n 6. Indoor sports theater usage is assumed at 2 hours per 4 stadiums per 6 days a week with extra 2 hours on Thursdays totaling to 4x2x6 = 48 + (2×4) = 56 hours. Total number of weeks for the calculation excluding the month of Holy Ramadan is taken at 44 weeks. Total number of hours works out to 44 x 56 = 2464 hours. With the assumed price of SAR 100 per hour the total revenue is 246,400\n 7. Soccer field usage is assumed at 200 events per year per filed from teams paying a total fee of 200 x SAR 1500 = 300,000. For 2 soccer fields the total revenue would be SAR 600,000\n 8. Salaries for staff is assumed as below:\n                                   Salary       \nPosition                                        \n                                   SAR per Annum\n                                                \nManager                            48,000       \nAssistant to Manager               36,000       \nFacility supervisors 3 x 30000     90,000       \nTrainers for Gymnasium 4 x 24000   96,000       \nReceptionists 5 x 18000            90,000       \nLife Guards 2 x 15000              30,000       \nSoccer field operators 2 x 15000   30,000       \nOther Operational and Admin staff  120,000      \nTotal                              510,000      \n\n 1. It is expected that the indoor sports theater might be used for several other social events and programs including community events and cultural festivals. These are regarded as important events; but they are unreliable revenue sources. Therefore, the financial model does not take into account the revenue from these sources.\n 2. Operating expenses are assumed a percentage of total revenue, based on the average percentage of expenses incurred by similar facilities in the city.\n 3. Depreciation has been calculated at 10% of all equipments and at 2% on the investments in soccer fields.\n 4. Depreciation is calculated as below\n                          Value       Depreciation\nAsset                                             \n                          SAR         SAR         \n                                                  \nLand                      25,000,000  —           \nSports Theater Equipment  1,000,000   100,000     \nGym Equipment             800,000     80,000      \nBoxing Ring Equipment     100,000     10,000      \nSoccer Fields             500,000     10,000      \nOlympic Pool              200,000     20,000      \nBuildings                 5,000,000   250,000     \nSports Juice Bar          70,000      7,000       \nHealth Center             200,000     20,000      \nTotal                                 497,000     \n\n\nOperating Income and Expenditure\n\n                                          Amount   Amount   \nParticulars                                                 \n                                          SAR      SAR      \n                                                            \nIncome:                                                     \nRevenue from Health and Fitness Facility  750,000           \nRevenue from Swimming Pool                300,000           \nRevenue from Indoor Sports Theater        246,400           \nRevenue from Soccer Fields                600,000  1,896,400\nRevenue from food and beverage Kiosk               141,640  \nTotal Revenue                                      2,038,040\nExpenditure:                                                \nCost of food and beverage                 100,000           \nStaff Salary                              510,000           \nMaintenance                               311,000  921,000  \nAdministrative Expenses                                     \nTelephone and communication               12,000            \nInsurance                                 15,000            \nAdvertising                               30,000            \nLegal and accounting charges              10,000            \nGeneral Administrative Expenses           24,000            \nTravelling                                20,000            \nBank charges                              10,000            \nMiscellaneous                             20,000   141,000  \nTotal Expenses                                     1,062,000\nOperating Profit                                   976,040  \nDepreciation                                       497,000  \nProfit (loss) after Depreciation                   479,040  \nNike sponsor fees written off                      500,000  \nNet Profit (Loss)                                  (20,960) \n\n\nThe income and expenditure shows a net loss of SAR 20,960 after writing off the sponsorship of SAR 500,000 (calculated based on yearly writing off the total cost of SAR 2,500,000 over 5 years i.e. SAR 2,500,000 divided by 5 years = SAR 500,000). However, being the first year of operation and with the conservative revenue estimates the club is showing a net loss. If we add back the depreciation, which is a non-cash expense the financial model shows that the club has generated cash of SAR 476,040.\n\nNet Loss SAR (20,960)\n\nAdd: Depreciation SAR 497,000\n\nCash Generated SAR 476,040\n\nCapital Costs\n\nThe calculation of capital costs are based on the cost estimates provided by the quantity surveyor. The estimates include preliminary expenses and allowance for potential escalation in costs, contingency allowance and professional and technical service charges.\n\nThe cost estimates are based on the measured areas and quantities to which the current prices and costs as prevailing on the date of this feasibility report have been applied. The costs are arrived based on a competitively tendered project, offered to be bid by large sized contractors using the applicable form of procurement to the context of Saudi Arabia. Professional methods of cost estimation have been adopted in preparing the estimates.\n\nIt must be noted that the following are the exclusions from the capital cost estimates, which may have to be included at a later stage in the overall project feasibility.\n\n  * Costs for demolition and preparing the site for construction\n  * Other sporting equipments as may be required to supplement those already included in the estimates\n  * Legal and holding costs, which are normal to the proposed acquisitions\n  * Loose furniture, kiosk tables and chairs and other kitchen equipments, which have not been included in the report considering the brevity of the report\n  * Cost of murals, paintings, ethnic articles of value and other works of art for making the interior to have rich ambience\n  * Cost of civil, construction or cleaning works to be undertaken outside the boundaries\n  * Costs involved in staging or phasing the activities\n  * Statutory and government fees and charges\n  * Escalation in power costs announced by local authorities\n  * Escalation in cost of each class of assets beyond three months of this feasibility report\n  * Any applicable goods and services taxes or customs duty on items to be imported\n                                 Value     \nAsset                                      \n                                 SAR       \n                                           \nLand                             25,000,000\nSports Theater Equipment         1,000,000 \nGym Equipment                    800,000   \nBoxing Ring Equipment            100,000   \nSoccer Fields                    500,000   \nOlympic Pool                     200,000   \nBuildings                        5,000,000 \nSports Juice Bar                 70,000    \nHealth Center                    200,000   \nLicense fee to Nike for 5 years  2,500,000 \nTotal                            35,370,000\nAdd: Contingencies 10%           3,537,000 \nTotal Capital Costs              38,907,000\n\n\nThis feasibility report assumes that all the proposed facilities will be taken up for\n\nconstruction at the same time although a staging plan has been provided for in the report. The above table presents a summary of the estimated capital costs. The estimated capital costs including 10% contingency allowance works out to SAR 38,907,000.\n\nLicense Fees payable to Nike\n\nNike offers a wide range of shoes, apparels and sports equipment, which have global market and competitive among the available brands. Nike as a brand command high levels of market premiums and the company provides sponsorships to soccer clubs for using its license to market their services. Using the Nike license is a prestigious affair for a club like the proposed KSA Sport and Leisure Club. However, the costs of such licenses are enormous and the Clubs using such licenses would be able to realize high market premium for its memberships.\n\nThe proposed venture contemplates to invest in the licensing of Nike, paying a cost of SAR 2,5 million for a period of 5 years. Even though the initial investment appears to be high, the resulting revenue benefits to the club will also be high, because of the market reputation of Nike. The cost of licensing of SAR 2.5 million, is proposed to be written off over the license period of 5 years in equal amounts of SAR 500,000 each year. This amount has been taken into account in the estimation of the net profits of the club.\n\nSustainability\n\nThis chapter presents a summary of the actions that the club needs to undertake to ensure that the facility is sustainable.\n\nEnvironmental Sustainability\n\nThe facilities of the club can accomplish environmental sustainability taking the following actions.\n\n  * Design and concept has to take into account the advantages and account for the climatic condition of Saudi Arabia\n  * The plant, equipment, lighting, fittings and fixtures proposed to be installed must be energy efficient\n  * The facilities must be made to ensure optimum use of natural light and ventilation\n  * The facilities should provide for recycling of water from internal and external sources\n  * The building materials must be organized as energy efficient and wherever possible potential use of recycled building materials must be procured and used\n  * Proposed construction of buildings should be oriented to maximize natural lighting and ventilation to the extent possible considering the climatic conditions of the Kingdom and minimize the impact of the sun.\n  * The club can consider the substitution by solar energy wherever possible including the heating of the swimming pool and other lighting\n\nEconomic Sustainability\n\nThe club can take the following actions to achieve economic sustainability.\n\n  * The club has to consider the potential demand situation with respect to various facilities and service offerings and price them to ensure that the club takes maximum advantage of the first mover position. This calls for an extensive market survey on a continuous basis, as the industry will become competitive once the second and subsequent players enter the industry. Experience of the soccer clubs in the UK are the fitting example in this case. The club in order to remain competitive must review its pricing quite often.\n  * The capital mix is one of the important elements in deciding the economic sustainability of the club. The more the club funds its operations out of the revenue earned, the more is the chances of the club becoming sustainable. This implies that the club should reduce its exposure to debt funds and use only minimum of debt funds.\n  * The club has to manage the facilities in such a way that each one complements the other instead of competing with each other.\n  * The club should strive to find and appoint a competent manager having proven ability in managing large facilities like this.\n\nCultural and Social Sustainability\n\nSince the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia has stricter social and cultural values, it is imperative that the club formulate its policies meeting these values. In this respect, the club should undertake the following actions.\n\n  * Develop and offer programs and services, which are commensurate with the social and cultural values of the local community\n  * Undertake promotional activities to encourage the youth belonging to local communities and sports organizations to use the facility by possessing higher cultural and quality values to respect the sentiments of the local communities\n  * The pricing policies of the club should not be prohibitively higher to exclude certain local communities. The club should adhere to its organizational philosophies in letter and spirit and earn a good reputation among the local residents and other sporting organizations.\n  * The club should evolve its own ethical policies, which need to be communicated to the management, staff and members of the club so that the club will be able to sustain culturally and socially.\n\nRecommendations\n\nThe feasibility study has identified the potential demand for a range of sport, health and fitness facilities including swimming in the city of Jeddah in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. The feasibility report detailed the concept design and technical evaluation of the facilities including the estimated capital cost of the project.\n\nThe indicative cost of KSA Sports and Leisure Club project is about SAR 38.9 million including the license fee payable to Nike of SAR 2,500,000 for a period of 5 years. The promoters would be able to mobilize SAR 25 million from their own sources and there is the need for the remaining funds of SAR 13.9 million, which the promoters hope to secure through secured borrowing. The financials prepared based on current levels of prices and costs results in an estimated cash flow of SAR 476,000 in the first year of operation.\n\nDespite the estimated demand for all the service offerings by the club, because of the shortfall in funding, the promoters propose to develop and bring in action the swimming pool complex and the food and beverages kiosk in the second stage. Land will be acquired to the extent possible with the own funds to be introduced by the promoters. By paying a holding cost, the promoters can retain the option to purchase the additional land within a period of six months, within which the club has to tie-up the shortfall in funds.\n\nTo sum up, existing and estimated demand for the service offerings by the club, and the excellent quality of the services will make the club function as one of the very successful sports organization in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. This is evidenced by the design of the facilities as outlined in the study and the financials projected and presented as a part of the study.\n\nTherefore, this study recommends that any organization or individuals willing to take financial partnership in this club are sure to be serviced by the spectacular performance of the club and they will have association with one of the prestigious sports club in the Kingdom. The membership of the club will go up drastically in the years to come, necessitating the expansion of the proposed facilities.\n\nTaking into account the possibilities for completing the project within conservative time estimates the following timeline for the implementation of the project milestones is presented.\n\nImplementation Milestones                                                                                                                                                                                        Timescale         \nPromoters to consider the proposal, make comments and recommendation to complete the final report                                                                                                                February 2011     \nDevelopment of the business case for KSA Sports and Leisure Club for securing the shortfall in funding of SAR 13.9 million                                                                                       March 2011        \nAppointment of the professional team to develop                                                                                                                                                                                    \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nAgronomist to conduct pitch inspections for soccer field                                                                                                                                                                           \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nQuantity Surveyor to make the final submission of the estimates and oversee the technical inputs                                                                                                                                   \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nArchitect to proceed with illustrative sketches and planning drawings                                                                                                                                            March – April 2011\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nPlanning consultant to prepare, coordinate and submit the planning application                                                                                                                                                     \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nSite engineers to make assessment and preparation of environmental report                                                                                                                                                          \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nSports consultants to prepare necessary applications for licensing                                                                                                                                                                 \n                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \nPreparing and submitting the planning applications by undertaking site investigation and surveys;

      "Loss of Biodiversity and Extinctions Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nExtinction is a term used to refer to the loss of species which are found on the earth’s surface. When extinction occurs it is normally irrevocable and the particular species disappear for ever meaning that some biological aspect of the Earth is lost. The Earth is the only place where living species are found. Extinction can be caused by a number of factors, for instance it can occur due natural calamities which are not predictable such as floods, or drought or it can occur due to man’s activities.\n\nIt can also be caused by increased predation due to competition for food, environmental stress, and disease outbreaks. Of late, the rate of extinction has increased because of human beings who have dominated the earth and are a major cause of environmental stress and degradation; this includes increased rates of population, overexploitation of marine mammals, deforestation, among others.\n\nBiodiversity can be defined as to the numerous number of species found on the planet. These species are found on different ecosystems in which they are adapted to. Scientists have managed to identify a large number of these species but surprisingly enough the number of unknown species is estimated to be higher than the number of known species.\n\nGeologists estimate that there are more than 30 million species living on earth although scientist have been able to identify about 1.4 species. Most of the biological diversity is concentrated near the equator and few are found as one move towards the latitudes. Tropical rain forests are believed to provide a habitat of millions of species. This paper looks at extinction are being the greatest threat to biodiversity, looks at the major causes of extinction and concludes with a controversial issue that have risen concerning the rates of extinction.\n\nLoss of biodiversity and extinction\n\nAccording to Wilson (1992), the worst thing has happened in the 1900s was not depletion of energy sources, nor was it an increase in nuclear war but loss in the biodiversity. The other catastrophes can be repaired within a very short period but loss in biodiversity would take millions of years to correct.\n\nThe biggest threat to biodiversity is extinction; this can either occur due to natural processes or can be influenced by human beings. It is estimated that the number of species that have become extinct is greater than the number of species that are currently found on earth. Over the pat two centuries, the rate of extinction is estimated to be one species in every two per year (Anon. “Biodiversity- Biodiversity and extinctions” 2010).\n\nHowever, in the recent times, this rate has almost doubled and there have been instances of mass extinction. This has been caused by the increase in human actions. From research, it has been known that, most species appear and disappear over a given period of time.\n\nSo it is possible that most of the species and families we find today were not present some 500 hundred years ago. For example many families of invertebrates that flourished during the Cambrian era more than five hundred and seventy million years ago are now extinct. Just like animal species, many divisions of plants have been known to appear and disappear over time, this includes the seed ferns, woody plants, pteridospermales, just to name but a few\n\nCauses of extinction\n\nThe highest rate of extinction is caused by natural forces. Many species that were originally found on earth have become extinct not because of human activities but because of natural forces such as climate change, disease outbreak, unpredictable catastrophes, and increased rates of predation.\n\nGeological records show that for the past many years, there has been a uniform rate of extinction with some mass extinctions characterized by catastrophic episodes. The Permian epoch recorded the highest extinction rate. Another similar extinction occurred towards the end of the Cretaceous period many million years ago.\n\nTo a greater extent, man can be held responsible for the recent mass extinction that is almost surpassing the ones documented in geological records.\n\nThis increased rate of extinction has been as a result of over harvesting, distance of their natural habitat, although some arte just victims of circumstances for instance the Vaquita which are normally trapped in nets used for harvesting fish. The increasing rate of extinction is causing an even greater loss of the Earth’s biodiversity (Anon. “Biodiversity- Biodiversity and extinctions” 2010).\n\nThe earth is known to be a home of millions of species making it a biodiversity place, however, with the extinctions that are currently occurring, it is losing its biodiversity. This loss is to a greater extent being caused by man’s interference with the ecosystems whereby most rainforest are converted into agricultural land through deforestation.\n\nThese lands are not able to maintain a big number of species and most of them become extinct. Tropical ecosystems for instance, the rain forest are habitats for thousands of species and if they are destroyed, the earth losses its biodiversity. Most of these species that become extinct will never occur again meaning that, a part of the earth’s richness is permanently destroyed (Raup, 1991).\n\nSome of the human influences that are believed to cause mass extinctions are over exploitation, introduction of predators, competitors and disease causing organisms, and disturbance of the natural habitat. Most of the species that have been affected by these influences over the past few centuries are the vertebrates.\n\nFor instance, nearly 700 species has gone extinct (over the last 500 years) as a result of human activities. That not outstanding, a bigger number of species is at the blink of extinction because they are endangered; about one thousand bird species are endangered and might become extinct after some time (Quammen, 1997).\n\nHuman influences that cause extinction\n\nIncrease in population\n\nOver the past few centuries, the human population has been growing at a very high rate thereby increasing the rate at which the ecosystems are converted to agricultural land for sustaining this big population. The increase in human population has led to the destruction of almost half of the rain forests found in the world while others have been degraded. This population use most of the fresh water and harvest almost everything that is found in the ocean.\n\nOver harvesting\n\nOne of the major causes of extinction is overharvesting. Hundreds of specious have become extinct through overharvesting while others are endangered especially the whales. Most of these species are harvested for food, or for commercial purposes. Commercial harvesting is the principal threat in this case.\n\nThis includes harvesting fish, rhinos because of their hones, over fishing leads to depletion of resources, reduced biological growth rates and low biomass levels. Sharks are the common type of fish that are over harvested. Over fishing of sharks results in disturbance of the marine ecosystem\n\nDisturbance of the ecosystem\n\nThe ecosystem is interfered with due to various human influences for instance deforestation of the rain forests renders most species homeless because their habitat is found in these forested. As they homes are destroyed, they are exposed to their predators who harvest them for food while others die to the harsh environment they are exposed to.\n\nIncreased human activities in the ocean such pollution and thermal stratification interferes with the ocean’s ability to act as a carbon sink. For a long time, oceans have been known to store a lot of carbon dioxide. They act as a carbon sink and can hold back more than 50 times of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere.\n\nHowever, thermal stratification of the oceans has resulted in a reduction of the ocean’s ability to hold carbon dioxide. Ocean’s can now hold very little levels of carbon dioxide leaving the rest in the atmosphere which consequently results in global warming. On the other hand, the increase in carbon dioxide in the atmosphere causes oceans to acidify leading to the death of the plants found in the ocean with some becoming extinct.\n\nGlobal warming\n\nNatural habitats are also being interfered with by global warming. Global warming is the increase in the temperatures of the earth’s air surface and the subsequent increase in the water levels that is, oceans and sea levels increase. It results from numerous human activities that emit gasses they prevent the radiation of sunlight back to the atmosphere.\n\nGenerally when sunlight reaches the earth’s surface, there is an amount of it that is reflected back to the atmosphere at a higher wave length; when this happens, the earth’s temperatures are regulated. In cases where the air is polluted by green house emissions then these green house gasses break the reflected sunlight radiations from reflecting back to the atmosphere, leaving them just at the earth’s surface.\n\nThing increases the earth’s surface temperature. This is not only harmful to human beings, but to all living organisms including plants and animals. When these harmful rays get to the earth’s surface, they absorb most of the moist that helps in the growth of vegetation.\n\nAs the growth of vegetation for instance, forest is interfered with, the water cycle changes resulting into shorter periods of rainfall. Growth of plants and vegetation declines consequently resulting in lack of food for both animals and human beings. This increases the mortality rate and some plant species may even become extinct.\n\nA controversial issue about the rate of extinction\n\nThere is a controversial issue that has caused scientists to involve themselves in many augments, many scientist disagree with the fact that, the rate of extinction that is recorded in geological books is too high and does not represent a real life situation.\n\nIt is assumed that, in every year, more than seven thousand species become extinct; this is rather too high for many people. On the other hand, other scientist hold that, the rate that is recorded is actually too low keeping in mind the increase in human influences. This increased population has to be fed, sheltered and even clothed. There is no other source of resource to cater for this increased population rather than the ones found on earth.\n\nThe biggest number of species lives in the rainforest and these forests are being cleared at a very high rate (Anon.” Estimates of the extinction rates” 2010). This means that, the rate of extinction might be actually higher than what is recorded. Statistics taken in 2008 showed that, many species are endangered by human influences and might soon become extinct. The following table shows the percentage of endangered species to the number of evaluated species.\n\nScientists who disagree with the alarming figures that have been recorded about species extinction argue that, it is not even possible to stop in every part of the world to carry out a research of the number of species that are becoming extinct. Yet there records that estimate the number of species that go extinct on a daily basis, weekly, monthly or even annually.\n\nIt is surprising to note that, the estimated rate of extinction exceeds the number of species that have actually being declared extinct through research (Raup, 1991). The high rate of extinction seems to be exaggerated given that, the number of species that have been identified is less than the number that still remains unknown.\n\nThe question is how then can it be possible to estimate the number of species that go extinct every day given that most of them are unknown? The majority species are known to have vanished. Where then did the species we find today come from? It is true that, human influences have led to the accelerating rate of extinction of species but at the same time, many urge saving species for their aesthetic value.\n\nMany people have changed their perspective about the environment and have are now using measures of conserving it. Trees are being planted and the government is constantly issuing bans to prevent the exploitation of marine animals. With all these measures being put in place, we expect the rate of extinction to be declining but it seems to be increasing on a daily basis.\n\nHuman beings have become more conscious on the role played by living organisms. For instance forests and vegetations are believed to regulate the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere thereby controlling the rate of global warming. Measures have been put in place to ensure that certain areas are left as reserves and most governments have gone to the extent of planting forests. This has created an increase in the habitat of most species and the rate of extinction is expected to go down.\n\nConclusion\n\nResearch has found that, most of the specious that lived many millions years are now extinct. Others keep on appearing and disappearing over time. According to scientist, the rate of extinction that has been recorded over the past two centuries is higher than that which was recorded about 2000 years ago.\n\nHuman influences are assumed to have caused the accelerating rate of extinction although some scientists hold that, this rate does not reflect the rear number of species that go extinct every year. They argue that, the rate is too high given that many species have not yet being recognized and the government has been putting measures to conserve some of the ecosystems.\n\nReference List\n\nAnon.

      "Emirates Airways Strategic Management Report\n\nStep One – Getting Ready\n\nOrganizational Profile\n\nEmirates Airways is currently the leading airline in the Middle East. This firm was started in 1985 by the Emirati government. There was a rising concern that some of the international planes that were plying the route were avoiding the route and this was causing a lot of inconveniences to the people of this country.\n\nThe government of United Arab Emirates realized that the country needed to develop an airline that would take care of the interests of the country’s nationals. The government had embarked on development of the infrastructure of the country. The roads were well developed and the airports were also properly expanded (Freeman 92). Dubai was rising very fast as a business center.\n\nThe government had heavily invested in building social amenities, besides the infrastructure, and therefore this city was attracting a good number of tourists on a yearly basis. As a result of this, the government wanted an airline that would be reliable to its tourists, and other people that would be travelling to this country. They wanted an airline that could be controlled by the state, and could meet the rising demands locally. This was the genesis of this airline company.\n\nThe Emirates Airline has its headquarters in Dubai in Dubai International Airport. This firm operates in to four largest destinations across the world. The firm operates in more than 100 destinations in 74 countries. The company has managed to overcome the stiff competition that is in the current market. According to Desvaux (70), the airline industry is very competitive. This scholar notes that this competition has been rising in the past decade with the entry of new airlines into the industry.\n\nIt becomes a big challenge for a firm to operate in such a competitive market if it lacks proper competitive strategies. This scholar notes that the aviation industry has been consistently on the rise in the past one decade. The emerging technologies have brought in a lot of changes in this industry, and firms are forced to adjust their operations in order to meet the market demands.\n\nThe emerging trends in the aviation industry cannot be ignored. It would force a firm to embrace these changes in order to realize the benefits that this industry has to offer. This is what the management of Emirate Airline has been keen on. This firm has received enough financial support from the government to enable it manage the emerging trends in the aviation sector.\n\nEffective strategic planning has seen this firm become the largest airline in this region. According to Freeman (26), project management has changed from what it used to be in the past. Project management was considered as part of production about 50 years ago. By then, competition was low, and the main concern was to increase production of the firm. The market was readily available in the global world. However, this has systematically changed over the years.\n\nFirms have come to realize that customers have various options to choose from when they want to make a purchase. Given such independence of the customers, firms have come to realize that they have to come up with strategies that would enable them attract customers. This has resulted in a scenario where every firm is struggling to come up with appealing strategies through which they can capture the attention of the customers.\n\nIssues that the planning process should address\n\nPlanning process should address specific issues within an organization that would result in achieving the goals of a firm. The vision of a firm always stipulate what the firm plans to achieve.\n\nStrategic planning would help achieve this vision within the desired timeline. One of the main issues that planning process should address is the emerging technologies. In the field of aviation, there are various emerging technologies that affect the industry very heavily. The emerging technologies are bringing new trends that have redefined marketing in this industry.\n\nFor instance, most of the bookings in this industry are currently done online. Customers can easily do their bookings from their homes. Emirates Airline must ensure that it adopts this technology if it plans to increase its customer base. Planning should be done with the aim of ensuring that the process of implementing this technology within this firm is successful, and that it reflects the current trends in the market.\n\nAnother issue that requires serious planning within this firm involves customers’ comfort when on board. Many of the major airlines like the British Airways and Virgin Atlantic have come up with strategies to ensure their customers are satisfied. This involves installation of television screens and music system on each seat. A customer can watch television on a seven inch screen fixed on the backseat of the seats.\n\nOther services like snacks and newspapers are also offered to increase customer satisfaction. This firm should develop a clear plan on how it would come up with a strategy that would help the firm come up with such services that would offer its customers superior satisfaction in the market.\n\nInformation that must be collected to help make sound decisions\n\nInformation is very important when making decision. In order to come up with a sound decision on what steps that should be taken to ensure that the strategic plan is successful, it would require the management to ensure that relevant information is gathered from all the relevant stakeholders. The days when decision would be made based on the information the top management had are long gone.\n\nIn the current society, it is important to ensure that all the stakeholders’ opinion, from the customers to employees, the government and the general public, are taken into consideration when making sound decision. From the customers, it is important to have information about their changing tastes and preferences in the market. Collecting this information will help make a sound decision when it comes to developing customer management strategies.\n\nEmployees’ opinions should also be put into consideration when making decision because they are the ones involved in the day-to-day activities of the firm. Management should therefore collect this information when making decision. Information from the government, industry players and the general public is also important to take into consideration when making sound decision within the firm.\n\nStep Two – Articulating Vision & Mission\n\nThe vision, mission and objectives of a firm are the basic elements of strategic management. Sadler (31) says that the main difference between a vision and a mission is that while the vision focuses on what the firm plans to achieve in future, mission statement is concerned with what the firm is doing now in order to achieve its objectives.\n\nThe vision of a firm is always very important in charting the path to be taken by the firm. Emirates’ vision statement clearly demonstrates the far this firm sees in the competitive electronic market. The vision statement of Emirates is based on leadership and ambition.\n\nThe vision is envisaged on coming up with ambitious projects and new ideas that would enable the firm offer its customer’s new products with maximum satisfaction always. As such, he should be above structures and systems, and not subordinate to them (Kline 28). This vision has seen this firm become very competitive. This has been its driving force in innovations and creativity. Based on this, the firm has ensured that it remains relevant in the market by introducing new products with advanced features.\n\nThe mission statement of Emirates Airlines may not pass as a standard mission statement. This is because it is a list of products that this firm produces, its commitment to a green pollution free world, and what it does in ensuring that they remain competitive. However, by the close of this statement, there is another statement that explains its commitment to business travelers, various professionals, and general consumers in providing them with desirable products that are able to meet their desires.\n\nStep Three – Assessing the Situation\n\nIn strategic management project, there are always three important conditions that should be assessed in order to come up with a clear plan. The first is always the past incidents or activities that had an impact on the firm’s current position. The second is the firm’s current position that would define its future.\n\nLastly would be what the firm’s plans for its future based on the past and present situation of the firm. Assessing the situation is always important in determining the strategic position of a firm. The following SWOT analysis is important in helping assess the current situation of the firm.\n\nSWOT analysis is one of the important tools that are very popular in analyzing a company. It helps in analyzing firms based on the existing internal and external factors. SWOT analysis would be very valuable in analyzing Emirates Airline. In order to bring more understanding of the firm in this competitive market, a SWOT analysis would be appropriate. It would also help in understanding the strengths and weaknesses that the firm has.\n\nStrength of this firm that would translate to increased profitability is a positive image in the market due to its environmental friendly projects. The world is increasingly becoming sensitive of the impact of various business units on the environment.\n\nThe concern is emanating from the fact that it has been confirmed beyond any reasonable doubt that various multinational companies are polluting the environment at a very dangerous rate Sadler (65). Various environmental conservation projects are expected to give this company a different image in the market.\n\nThis company will be seen as a firm that is smarter in its environmental strategy. The market will be convinced that this company is not just interested in making profits, but also turning the society into a better place. The firm will easily attract additional customers who are determined to make a positive difference in their society. This is because they will view this firm as one that helps in conserving the environment.\n\nThey will consider the purchase of the firm’s product as part of environmental conservation. As a result of this, the firm will develop a strong base of loyal customers. This firm may also take this advantage to reach out to the international markets. The project would give this company a moral right to claim that it is a champion of a clean environment in the entire world. The firm has a team of dedicated and qualified staff who are able to front all the interest of the firm both in the local and regional markets.\n\nDespite the above strengths, this firm has some weakness. The first weakness that this firm has is the financial challenge. The initiative of managing the environment is very challenging financially.\n\nIt would cost this firm, large sum of money if it would sustain such projects over the years it expects to operate in this market Grundy (92). The members of this firm expect to work in collaboration with other firms in order to clean the environment. The team may not have the capacity to rid the environment of all the electronic wastes, unless it is supported by other agencies within the local society.\n\nThe local government must be convinced to participate in such projects actively. Other environmental agencies would also be invited to take part in the elimination of such wastes as plastic materials. The fact such the projects would involve partnership with other firms; success of the entire process may be jeopardized. Success would be pegged on how determined the other partners are in fulfilling their duties.\n\nThe firm has a number of opportunities in the external environment. In the local market, this firm has managed to build a large base of loyal customers, especially in the cities of Abu Dhabi and Dubai. The Emirati government has strongly appreciated the move of this firm to help improve the environment of this country, a fact that has earned it a large base of customers.\n\nThe Emirati government has maintained a very stable political environment. This means that the business environment is free from any political unrest that may disrupt normal business operations within the market. This has created a business environment that is very peaceful to various firms in the country.\n\nThe firm also enjoys an economic growth in this region that has increased the purchasing power of the consumers. This increased purchasing power has helped the firm to increase its operations to regions beyond its borders. The emerging technologies have also helped Emirates Airline in its operational strategies. The firm has adapted the emerging technologies in its operations, a fact that has helped it increase it efficiency.\n\nThis firm faces a number of threats in its operations. Threats may not be predictable in this industry, though the firm may try to reduce the possibility of occurrence. The first threat that this firm faces is price wars in the market. The strategy of the firm to charge lesser prices for its products, especially to those consumers who have shown resolve to combat environmental degradation may not pass unnoticed by the local firms.\n\nThere is a possibility that the competitors may consider this move as a strategy that this firm uses to charge cheap for their products. The impact of this is that the competitor may respond by equally lowering their prices in the market. Such price wars are always dangerous to the prosperity of a business. The initiative may fail to make any serious sense. However, this threat has been minimized by introducing other responsibilities for the project, and the invitation of the whole society to participate.\n\nEmirates Airline also faces the threat from the emerging technologies. The emerging technologies are beneficial to the firm. However, they can pose serious challenge to the firm if the firm fails to select the appropriate technology to apply. Applying a wrong technology may cause serious negative consequences to the firm. Late application of the emerging technologies may also render such a firm less competitive in the market. This firm has been forced to spend a lot of financial resources to sustain the force of emerging technologies.\n\nStep Four – Developing Strategies, Goals, and Objectives\n\nMiller (56) says that it is important for a firm to develop functional strategies that can help it achieve its vision within a competitive environment. Emirates Airline has adopted diversification and partnership strategies. It is important that a firm develops different lines of products that can cushion it in case one of the lines is experiencing a dry spell.\n\nEmirates Airlines stated out as a passenger carrier firm. However, as time went by, this firm realized the importance of diversification of its products. Taking research and development as one of the important aspects of the firm, Emirates Airlines has managed to develop new products to the market, extending its line of production. The firm currently has a series of products targeting various markets. Some of these products include different classes of the planes, the cargo plane and other currier services.\n\nThis has enabled this firm to operate as a multi-business firm. This way, it is able to reap maximally from one line in case the other experiences a low season. In its early year, it entered into a joint partnership with Qantas to ensure diversification of its products. This resulted in huge profits, though this partnership is yet to get deep rooting. The following are some of the objectives of this firm.\n\n 1. To be the leading airline in the entire region of Middle East and beyond.\n 2. To increase its market share within this market.\n 3. To diversify its products in order to bring in new market segments.\n\nStep Five – Completing the Written Plan\n\nStrategic management of projects will only be considered as complete if there is a clear success after implementation. It is important to have a clearly written plan on how this can be achieved within a stipulated timeline. Having a written plan on how to undertake a given strategy within a firm is important.\n\nThe management of Emirates Airline should have a clearly defined plan written in a way that is unambiguous. This written plan should stipulate all the activities that are to be carried out within the firm. Having a clearly written plan would not only be vital to the top management of the firm, but also lower cadre employees. The entire group of employees would base their actions on this written plan. It is through this that the plan can be executed based on the vision, mission and objectives of the firm.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDesvaux, Martin. “A Synopsis Of Clive Ponting‘s: A Green History Of The World.” Optimum Population Trust Journal.

      "Response paper in USA Essay\n\nGiving birth to a child is the most important event in the life of every woman. That is why it is necessary to pay attention to every detail of this significant process, to take into account all the aspects of the procedure and hope for the better.\n\nHowever, every pregnant woman wants to be sure that her labors will be successful and everything will be all right. It is that point on which American doctors accentuate in their speeches. There are few problems which can experience a pregnant woman when she is preparing for one of the most significant moments in her life.\n\nNevertheless, the real situations and facts support the idea that the health care system of the USA is not perfect, and there are many controversial questions which require their immediate solutions. This opinion can be considered as a decisive one for the analysis of Marsden Wagner’s Born in the USA: How a Broken Maternity System Must Be Fixed to Put Women and Children First in which the author provides the detailed examination of the most typical and influential problems of the maternity and health care system in the USA.\n\nIn his book, Marsden Wagner focuses on such problematic questions as the state of the hospitals in the USA, the aspects of the American maternity care system, difficulties in providing the effective care for mothers and their babies.\n\nThe most controversial question is about the fact that the USA health care system provides the most expensive care services for pregnant women in the world, but the level of the quality of these services does not follow the principles of the highest standards which are stated in the programs about the health care system in the country. Moreover, the author pays attention to the issues of midwifery and the women’s safety in hospitals.\n\nThere can also be different visions of the question of the main goal of the book. Angelo P. Giardino accentuates that the author of the book “specifically states that the purpose of the book is to further an understanding of problems in the system with an eye toward ultimately moving beyond defining the issues and toward suggesting solutions” (Giardino 38).\n\nMoreover, the most interesting detail of the work is the high level of the criticism expressed in the book. Thus, Marsden Wagner is strict about the role of physicians in the life of a pregnant woman. “Physicians, however, will find the book a difficult read because of the level of criticism lobbed at their profession” (Giardino 39).\n\nOne more important detail which also requires the further investigation is the point that Wagner uses the allusion to the physicians as “priests” of a cult of science runs counter to that view” (Giardino 39). Marsden Wagner openly and rather sarcastically discusses the problems of the health care system in the USA.\n\nNevertheless, why can this book be useful for pregnant women who face the problem of following the principles of the modern maturity care system in the USA? “Examining the structure of obstetrical care more thoroughly than most books about childbirth, it helps readers understand why present maternity care services are often unsatisfactory, why choices are limited, and why women’s basic human rights ignored or abused” (Pincus 185).\n\nIn his book, Marsden Wagner also concentrates on those risks which pregnant women can experience during their labors. He is extremely honest in his description of all the possible problems which they can face in the hospitals. The author also pays attention to the necessity of the conveniences for the further mothers and to the ways which women can use for creating the best conditions for the childbirth.\n\nMoreover, Dr. Wagner accentuates the rights which women should know when they choose the best variant for their labors. Thus, “a pregnant woman who finds that her hospital is not willing to comply with her wishes for her labor and birth can also file a complaint with the chief compliance officer of the hospital” (Wagner 179).\n\nHe also focuses on the fact that pregnant women should not blindly follow the doctors’ instructions, and it is necessary for them to know as much information about labors as possible because there are many situations when women are treated wrongly due to the lack of the physicians’ competence.\n\nFor instance, Cytotec can be considered as a rather dangerous medicine with a lot of negative effects for the majority of women. The author focuses on the fact that “we have very little solid information on the use and outcomes of procedures and drugs, such as Cytotec for inducing labor, that have not been adequately tested for safety” (Wagner 184).\n\nThat is why it is useful for pregnant women to collect as much information about the aspects of labors as possible and have the strict opinion according to the medicines and the other ways of treatment which can be used for their case. Nevertheless, in spite of the fact that the level of health care services in hospitals can be considered as unsatisfied, the risks which women experience while giving birth to their children at home is much higher.\n\nThus, the book written by Dr. Wagner is helpful for women who are pregnant because it gives the truthful vision of the aspects which are connected with the health care system in the USA, and it provides definite useful solutions for the most controversial problems.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGiardino, Angelo P. “Born in the USA: How a Broken Maternity System Must Be Fixed to Put Women and Children First”.

      "The Natural Resources of the African Community Expository Essay\n\nThe write up is on the African community. In Africa, most of the natural resources such as water, forests, soils and many more are on the rapid rate of extinction due to man’s exploitative nature without putting up the right conservation measures. Man exploits these resources in order to get their daily needs. The high population rates and the level of poverty contribute a lot to this kind of behavior.\n\nIn this paper, energy, water and forests have been identified as the three main areas that can be improved. There has been a cry in Africa over the shortages on these vital resources whereby the members are forced to acquire them expensively, because of this, measures to ensure their conservation is necessary.\n\nFor each of the above mentioned resource, actions can be taken to cut down on their misuse. For water, it is necessary to have the water act that sets regulations and ensures that they are followed to the letter. In the case of energy, it is necessary to look for alternative renewable source of energy that is least costly and is environmental sensitive. In the issue of forests, laws should be enacted to ensure that those who go against them are answerable and pay heavily for their actions.\n\nAccording to a research done by Mwingi Godfrey on the conservation of water in South Africa, the following is important to ensure a sustainable use; Pressure management, this will control the chances of pipe bursts thus reducing the amount of losses through leakages, and in connection to this is the repairing of the faulty pipes and tapes to reduce the leakages. It is also vital to put up water meters for drafting payment schedules, this reduce the amount of water used for both domestic and commercial purposes.\n\nWater used for washing dishes and in flushing toilets is also a lot; therefore, re-use should be considered as some water can be used twice, this is called grey water. Dual flush system should be adopted because of its minimal water usage. In case of irrigation, conservative measures should be applied such as mulching and watering at the right time to avoid wastage (Water conservation para. 4).\n\nOn energy, it is important to consider all the types of renewable energy sources such as wind, tides and waves, solar and biogas energy. If these entire sources are harnessed then the cost on electricity can be greatly reduced.\n\nSolar and biogas are the most efficient sources of energy that can be embraced to ensure a cost effective use. Practices such as putting off lights and all electrical appliances when not in use should be implemented. Use of energy saving bulbs should not be ignored (Fourteenth session of the United Nations commission on sustainable development para. 5).\n\nIn considering forest resources in Africa, it is important to ensure that growing more trees is encouraged by emphasizing on the plant two as you cut down one should be encouraged, looking for alternative sources of energy and construction materials to reduce on logging done daily. Education campaigns on the importance of forests should be carried out.\n\nConservation of these resources is a long time process which requires a timeframe of not less than five years. For water conservation, all the above mentioned ideas can be implemented in twenty years time, this due to ignorance with the people in Africa and lack of required skills to implement the strategies.\n\nFor energy, a period of more than twenty years can be possible considering the lack in technical knowhow, awareness and lack of money to adopt the renewable sources. This case applies to forests because carrying out awareness and huge amount of money is required to carry out a forestation process.\n\nIn the process of implementing the earlier mentioned ideas in order to conserve the above resources, many challenges are experienced. These include lack of money for proper funding, ignorance by the people on the importance of the resources and how to conserve them, poverty level and high population growth is also a threat as people have no alternative to get their daily needs apart from exploiting them and others.\n\nIn order to counter the challenges mentioned, it is important to seek funds from the developed countries, carry out campaigns to educate the people on the importance of the resources and hoe to use them sustainably and providing an alternative for each of the mentioned resource to ensure its sustainability.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFourteenth session of the United Nations commission on sustainable development, Department of environmental and tourism affairs, SEP 2005.

      "“Why I Went to the Woods” by Henry David Thoreau Essay (Review)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Background\n 2. We Should Live a Simplistic Life\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Work Cited\n\nBackground\n\n“Why I Went to the Woods” was written by Henry David Thoreau as a part of the book “Walden” and was inspired by an ‘experiment’ in which he constructed a small house in the woods near his residence in Massachusetts. He stayed in the little house for two years, two days, and two months, and while living in the woods, he wrote an article about the ordeal.\n\nNearly half of the article is made up of Thoreau’s reflection on human nature and society. He mentions that nobody can be an unbiased commentator on these two things unless he eliminates himself from them and exists in what he calls “voluntary poverty.” Thoreau has much to talk about concerning society. In this paper, the analysis and summary of “Why I went to the Woods” shall be provided.\n\nHe writes that men labor their lives away, toiling and paying their expenses with no knowledge on what it means to be human, he continues to write that “The mass of men live lives of quiet desperation” (Thoreau, pp. 283). In this chapter, Thoreau encourages us to become independent and to have a purposeful life. The second half of the article delves on Thoreau’s day-to-day activities in the house in the woods, his experiences during trips to the town and the people he encounters.\n\nMoreover, the meaning of “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately” is of great significance. Above all, Thoreau tries to explain why he opted to get away from society and move into the woods, just as the article’s title. This is evident in the first paragraph, he writes “I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately, to front only the essential facts of life, and see if I could not learn what it had to teach, and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived” (Thoreau, p. 278).\n\nWe Should Live a Simplistic Life\n\nThe central idea that Thoreau tries to convey in the article is that life should be taken in the simplest of forms, evidenced by opting to live in a cabin in the woods at Walden Pond for more than two years. “What news! How much more important to know what that is, which was never old!” (Thoreau, pp. 280), this is just one of the several lines in which he attempts to convince society to adopt his simplistic lifestyle.\n\nHe writes that we should live a simple life with only the essential needs, he urges his audience “Simplicity, simplicity, simplicity! I say, let your affairs be as two or three, and not a hundred or a thousand; instead of a million count half a dozen, and keep your accounts on your thumbnail” (Thoreau, 278).\n\nTo ensure that his message reaches the intended audience in a deliberate manner, Thoreau incorporates several rhetorical tools. For example, he chooses words that bring out his confidence, in one instance he writes “And we are enabled to apprehend at all what is sublime and noble only by the perpetual instilling and drenching of the reality that surrounds us” (Thoreau, pp. 281) instead of writing “We understand unique stuff by looking at what is real”. He chooses his words carefully.\n\nThoreau also uses imagery and metaphor in Why I Went to the Woods to add meaning and develop his stance. He calls life the “chopping sea of civilized life” (Thoreau 278) to stress on the labors of life. This harsh comparison of civilized life to a chopping sea demonstrates Thoreau’s rejection of a flowery and worthless lifestyle. It also plainly pushes on simplification to avoid the challenges that most people come across if they opt to choose a complicated lifestyle.\n\nAs is clear from “Why I Went to the Woods” analysis, Thoreau makes use of rhetorical questions in the article. He uses several of these questions, the one that struck me most was, “Why should we live with such hurry and waste of life?” (Thoreau, pp. 279). This single line brings out the central theme of the article: that of simplicity.\n\nIt projects humans’ as blatantly stupid enough to waste away their lives. Another important use of rhetoric language is a synecdoche, he writes about an “overgrown establishment, cluttered with furniture” (Thoreau, 279). Here, the clutter of furniture symbolizes all facets of life, forced together into the tiny brain of man. Thoreau makes a convincing point here. Mostly, the mind resembles an attic.\n\nMany people opt to fill up their attics with the old property as they are fed up with it, or purely yearn for more than they have already. However, after some time, the space in the attic is used up, and we become overpowered. Thoreau advises us to throw out the old stuff that is filling up the attic. As the summary of “Why I Went to the Woods” evidences, his escape to the woods was a way of clearing out his “attic.”\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Why I Went to the Woods, Thoreau conveys his views about the simplicity of life. Every word inside the article points to this theme. To begin with, he uses a scholarly tone, and this brings out his message in an intended manner. However, he balances the mood and even gives his personal outlook.\n\nHe also uses rhetorical tools such as imagery, metaphors, and rhetorical questions to stress on the importance of adopting a simple life, and the risks of failing to the same. All of these language tools add up to bringing out the central theme of the article.\n\nWork Cited\n\nThoreau, Henry David. Why I Went to the Woods. In Walden; or, Life in the Woods.

      "Napoleon’s Strategy and Tactics Research Paper\n\nAim and Thesis\n\nThis research paper aims to explore Napoleon’s strategies and tactics, which he employed throughout his military campaigns to defeat his enemies and conquer other empires when he ruled the French empire between 1779 and 1821.\n\nThe thesis of the research paper examines critically the effectiveness of Napoleon’s military strategies and tactics, which he used during his reign as a powerful emperor of France and an army commander.\n\nGeneral Outline\n\nThis paper delves into military experiences of Napoleon and tries to unravel why his strategies are valid in teaching military students of this tremendous technological era. Since many commanders of his time acknowledged and credited him as a military genius, then, how effective were his military strategies.\n\nThe effectiveness of his military and leadership tactics is evident in the way he managed to lead the French empire, mobilized his armies, and conquered many territories. Napoleon employed a strategy of dividing his enemies and forming strategic alliances to conquer his enemies with much ease.\n\nThe uniqueness of Napoleon is that he had already discovered in his time the current application of professional military skills and logistics in his strategies and tactics. Professional skills and logistics are the present pillars of a military that guarantee victory when optimally utilized. To overcome his battles, he interrupted the logistics of his enemies to weaken them.\n\nEven though Napoleon considered himself as a great commander, he never underestimated the danger posed by the enemies, even the weakest of them all. At all times Napoleon took precaution and responded rapidly to any threatening enemy.\n\nWhen combating his enemies on the battlefield, Napoleon employed central position approach and indirect approach. These two approaches enabled him to seize the local superiority to control and manipulate the enemy on the battlefield.\n\nMoreover, Napoleon utilized Battalion square strategy to combat his enemies. This strategy enhanced his ability to mobilize his armies and troops effectively in fighting powerful forces of Russia, which defeated him. He also applied his five military principles that enabled him to use his troops economically as concerted military efforts focused on the enemy were quite effective.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNapoleon was the great Emperor of France with novel military strategies and tactics that enabled him to conquer his enemies and neighboring empires in a bid to expand his territory. His determination to win battles came from his confession that “there is no man more pusillanimous than I when I am planning a campaign.\n\nI purposely exaggerate all the dangers and all the calamities that the circumstances make possible… I am like an unmarried girl laboring with child” (Nafziger 1989, 23). He derived his military strategies and tactics from inherent fears that kept him on toes due to the imminent battles that revolved in the neighboring empires. The fear of losing a battle haunted him constantly, and this prompted him to draw novel strategies and tactics to overcome his enemies.\n\nDuring the great battle of Borodino when he attacked Russia, he demonstrated his military potential and ability to conquer ferocious enemies despite their military prowess. Critical analysis of Napoleon’s strategies and tactics show that his military approach to the decisive Russian battle, invasion of Italy, Egypt, United Kingdom, Portugal, Syria, and series of Coalition wars was quite effective and is still invaluable in the contemporary warfare.\n\nNapoleon’s Legacy\n\nNapoleon left leadership and military legacy due to the strategies and tactics he extensively employed during his reign as the French Emperor. Although Napoleon exercised his military powers during the early 19 th century, his strategy and tactics are still applicable in the 21 st century.\n\nAccording to Nafziger, “…his campaigns formed the basis of military education throughout the western world, and a lot of military thinking is still influenced by the great Frenchman” (1989, 26). Since his military strategies and tactics have stood the test of time, which is about two centuries now and can still prove to be invaluable in this era of high technology, then it shows that his military skills were and still are quite effective.\n\nThe effectiveness of military strategies and tactics depends on the ability of a military commander to mobilize his armies and resources effectively. Napoleon applied time and space as the components of logistics that are necessary to win a decisive battle such as the invasion of Russia, Coalition wars and the Italian Campaign.\n\nThe greatness of Napoleon emerged after he became an emperor in 1779 when he began to exercise his political and military powers with novel strategies and tactics. Tarle and Viktorovich observe that “Napoleon’s greatness as a soldier was evident from the start of his remarkable career; he made victory followed upon victory for over a decade” (Tarle & Viktorovich 1979, 357). His victory in a series of battles did not only demonstrate his strategies but also tactics that gave him an upper hand in major battles that he fought.\n\nMilitary analysts of his time considered him a military genius based on his ability to strategize and mobilize his armies to war. Even if Napoleon lost a battle like the Russian invasion, he still demonstrated the courage and creativity in withdrawing his soldiers from the field. Therefore, the character and military prowess of Napoleon was of high standards, and that is why current military students still read his military strategies and maneuvers.\n\nThe Military Empire\n\nBy 1812, Napoleon had led France to become a mighty empire in Europe, and he boasted of the great achievement that he had made. Given the military status of the French Empire, Napoleon was poised to invade and conquer the neighboring independent states of Europe. To achieve his mission, “he managed to destroy the unity of purpose which had fed the coalitions against France for so long, as Austria, Russia, and Prussia were now ready to fight each other as well as to fight France” (Tarle & Viktorovich 1979, 356).\n\nNapoleon knew that the unity of independent European states threatened and would eventually ruin his powerful empire and there would be no legacy left for him and his successor, so he had to destroy their unity before conquering Russia individually. Therefore, he employed the tactic of dividing and conquering; what colonialists would popularly call divide and rule.\n\nSince Napoleon participated in a series of coalition wars, he had learned the importance of making a coalition against the common enemy. When an enemy seemed to have many coalition partners against him, Napoleon would scheme a way of dividing the coalition and conquering.\n\nThis strategy weakened the ability of the enemy to fight effectively with the immense back up from its allies. To fight and conquer Russia, Napoleon devised a scheme of building alliances with the Middle-East powers of the Ottoman Empire. “In 1803, Napoleon went to considerable lengths to try to convince the Ottoman Empire to fight against Russia in the Balkans and join his anti-Russian coalition” (Olszewski 2005, 34).\n\nAfter three years of negotiations, the Ottoman Empire realized Napoleon’s victory on the battle of Austerlitz and agreed to form a powerful alliance, and they conquered Russia and England in 1806. Napoleon used the strategy of dividing the enemy and formation of powerful strategic partnerships to defeat his enemies, a creative, scheming, and effective strategy.\n\nModern Military Skills\n\nThe unique strategy that Napoleon employed as a military commander is the use of military professionalism. Many of his successors regarded Napoleon as a premier general who conceptualized new strategy and tactics in terms of structure and composition of strong armies; impregnable in the face of threatening enemies. “Napoleon embodied the idea of the professional military leader, not gaining his position through familial or political connection, but earning it by distinguishing himself in combat” (Hoffman 2005, 122).\n\nIn his military professionalism, Napoleon took two years in doing logistical planning to invade Russia, for he realized that decisive battles demanded proper logistics. Due to his logistical approach to battles, many generals have appreciated his approach and have applied his strategies and tactics, which have proved to give consistent successes in various wars. His presence during the war made a significant difference, as he was indispensable in the mobilization of resources and troops.\n\nLogistical interruption of the enemy is a professional application of military strategies and tactics. Napoleon had realized that “every effort must be made to render the enemy helpless through the severance of his lines of supply, communications, and retreat…to envelop one of the enemy’s army’s flanks and threaten its rear and communications” (Nafziger 1989, 21).\n\nThe prime objective of Napoleon as a commander of the army was to identify the location of the enemy and logistical parameters that the enemy relied upon. The battle is not only about fighting the enemy directly, but it also involves indirectly fighting by interrupting logistical support as a means of weakening the enemy.\n\nWhen logistical support in terms of communication, transport or supply of essential weapons decline, then an enemy becomes weak and can only retreat or risk fighting helplessly. Napoleon utilized this strategy extensively when he invaded Russia, Egypt, Italy, and a series of coalition wars all over Europe. To this day, the concept of military professionalism and logistics are central pillars of military strategies.\n\nMilitary Precautions\n\nSince Napoleon harbored many fears concerning his vast empire, which he had managed to hold together through immense challenges, he wanted to guard it jealously without overlooking any possible threats albeit negligible. Napoleon argues that “…when I am planning a campaign, I purposely exaggerate all the danger and all calamities that circumstances make possible” (Olszewski 2005, 32).\n\nThis strategy gave him the advantage in case the potential threat of the enemy was underestimated. During the Russia invasion, Napoleon never at any instance overlooked or underestimated the battle and consequences that arose, for in his logistical skills, he provided for the worst-case scenarios that were bound to occur in decisive battles like the Russia invasion that cost the lives of many soldiers.\n\nGiving a chance and ample time to an enemy to strategize was against Napoleon’s strategy. In his military campaign, Napoleon never wasted his time camping troops in wait of the already known enemy.\n\nRainey (2006) explains that “the strength of an army, like the power in mechanics, is estimated by multiplying the mass by the rapidity, as a rapid march augments the morale of an army, and increases its means of victory. Press on!” (169). Therefore, rapid response to an impending battle was Napoleon’s strategy, which ensured that his enemies did not gain an opportunity to wage war; moreover, the strategy increased the morale of the army to attack vigorously.\n\nIn his principles, Napoleon believed that military strategies should employ tactics to surprise and confuse an enemy on the battlefield because initiating and controlling the pace of the fight is the crucial element in conquering an enemy. Napoleon illustrated these tactics when he successfully won the battle of Ulm-Austerlitz in1805.\n\nBattlefield Strategies and Tactics\n\nThe primary strategy of Napoleon was to identify the enemy. Identifying the location, composition, and structure of the enemy highlighted any possible threats and imminent calamities, which were very critical in determining whether to go ahead with the battle or not. If the battle was inevitable, then effective strategies and tactics were necessary to combat the enemy.\n\nHardeman (1998) notes that “when facing a foe superior in numbers, the strategy of the central position was employed to split the enemy into separate parts, each of which could then be eliminated in turn by adroit maneuvering…” (175).\n\nWith this strategy, though overwhelmed by the Russian armies, Napoleon armies managed to kill more of them as compared to their troops who died in the decisive battle. In this case, the central position strategy proved useful in combating armies who were mightier while incurring minimal losses and injuries.\n\nThe strategy of the indirect approach was very effective when Napoleon had a large number of armies under his command. This strategy enabled Napoleon to seize superiority while on the battlefield and thus wield much power to control the battle.\n\nThis strategy involved displaying mighty armies in front of the enemy to attract attention and subsequently scare away the enemy. According to Hoffman (2005), in this strategy, “one of two army corps would be detached to pin the attention of the enemy to his front. Meanwhile, Napoleon would take the bulk of his army on a swift, wide march around one of the enemy’s strategic flanks (177).\n\nFlanking the enemy weakens the logistical maneuvers that sustain it in the battle preventing further reinforcement from other troops. Eventually, the enemy is isolated and severed from obtaining logistical support of forces, communications, retreating, and supply of more weapons. This strategy demonstrated to be very effective as it led to massive victories of Jena, Ulm and Friedland battles.\n\nNapoleon also utilized the strategy of Battalion Square and the tactic of outflanking his enemies. The Battalion Square consisted of an advance guard, which was to identify the enemy, right and left wings who acted as combating troops that marched within the range where they could offer emergency support to both advancing and reserved forces. At the rear end of the advancing army was a reserved troop, which provided extra support in case the advance troop retreated.\n\nRainey argues that “Napoleon could use a mere part of his force to tie down and occupy the attention of one enemy, then rapidly move his remaining forces to build up a local superiority against his enemies” (2006, 158). When Napoleon had built local superiority, he employed the tactic of flanking to combat the Russian armies who were too strong for him to conquer, but at least he demonstrated artful military combat.\n\nNapoleon had five principles that guided his military strategies and tactics. His principles were quite evident in the number of battles he successfully fought during his reign because many commanders acknowledged that no commander could beat him in terms of the number of battles he fought and severity of battling conditions, which he experienced.\n\nThe five principles entailed the destruction of the enemy on sight, the concentration of the military efforts, scheming operations, interruption of logistics, and real-time surveillance of the armies. Adhering to these principles, Napoleon focused objectively on the enemy. He held that “there are in Europe, many good generals, but they see too many things at once.\n\nI see only one thing, namely the enemy’s main body… I try to crush it, confident that secondary matters will then settle themselves” (Nafziger 1989, 23). In this strategy, Napoleon distinguished himself from other generals who lacked concentration on the enemy and lost the decisive battles they fought. His military principles enabled him to concentrate forces and managed to mobilize them artfully to economize his resources.\n\nConclusion\n\nNapoleon’s military strategies and tactics are crucial in military education as a case study of a genius military commander who fought numerous and diverse battles. Despite the astounding defeat that Napoleon met during his war against Russia, he demonstrated logistical strategies and tactics that many generals consider artful and worth acquiring in the current generation.\n\nNapoleon left a military legacy as his successors credit him a military genius who made a great impact in military reforms and shaped the approaches of decisive battles. His strategies and tactics still echo through the 21 st century since military academies recognize and approve them as effective and worth learning. Although Napoleon armies suffered after invading Russia, this does not mean that their strategies were ineffective; it is only that the Russian troops were many, organized, and smarter.\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\nHardeman, Richard. “General Logistics Paradigm: A study of the Logistics of Alexander, Napoleon, and Sherman .” Air Force Logistics Management Agency 26, no. 13 (1998): 120-125.\n\nCompares and contrasts logistical strategies and tactics, which great men like Napoleon, Alexander and Sherman employed in their military leadership to conquer battles.

      "Critical Research on “The idea on Latin America” by Walter Mignolo Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Critical analysis of “The idea of Latin America”\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nLatin America is a part of America well known for its prevailing Latin languages, specifically the Spanish and Portuguese. It includes all the American regions formerly under the dominion of the Portuguese and Spain. All these regions depict similar socioeconomic backgrounds whose colonialism is either, formal or informal rather than cultural. The Latin America is thought to have emerged as early as 1830s, as posited by French people who claim that it was initially occupied by the Latin immigrants.\n\nThen an idea arose that, based on the time of arrival of the Latin people to this part of America, the region should be favoring the Latin cultural practices more than any other group. It was postulated that that the chances of Latin Europe joining this regions on the expense of Teutonic Europe were high, an issue that was subject to discussion before it happened. This became now, ‘The idea of Latin America’, which is a public declaration, based on the economic geography of the powers of state.\n\nThis idea seeks the notion of Latin America, right from its European origin a few centuries ago, tracing its roots since then up to date. It shows the reason why the issues of the 19 th centuries need to be damped to welcome new inventions.\n\n“The idea of Latin America is a geopolitical manifesto that charts the history of the concept of Latin America, insisting on the need to leave behind an idea which belonged to the nation-building mentality of the 19 th century Europe.” (Mignolo 78). This idea declares the century’s state of mind invalid and paves way to new ideas of the 20 th century and the upcoming others.\n\nThis idea has triggered the minds of many, arousing the need to consider stories, which have been neglected. Mignolo, in his idea portrays the difference between Euro America and Latin America by pointing out the origin, state of economy and the insidiousness of the former. However, Mognolo’s work concerning this idea is subject to criticism, right from the topic. It is provocative and a probable attractor of racial discrimination originating from the Latin American region.\n\nCritical analysis of “The idea of Latin America”\n\nMignolo artistically chooses ‘The idea of Latin America’ as the principal topic of his book . He claims that the book is the basis of the imperial and colonial ‘notion’ of the Latin America. He shows how it will influence politics in relation to previous centuries and how this will give the present world a new shape. Building on this, the topic is quite provocative. It singles out one, on the expense of others, an issue that has served as a fuel to the prevailing conflicts.\n\nPeople, in need of a change, cannot employ a topic that is liable of causing havoc. In addition, it is based on the assumptions that, exploitation is the root cause of the modern world. He uses Latin America as the one responsible of colonizing other countries in order to bring modernity. The results of colonialism are clear from the wars that people involved themselves in, in an effort to eradicate it. Therefore, it stands out that the topic is outdated and irrelevant.\n\nThe author has employed many assumptions in passing his claims. These render his works less accurate. Scientifically, they are, allowed but the few they are the more meaningful the research becomes. He posits that the future cannot be, achieved without capitalism. This is general and not well thought because many have arisen to disagree with this.\n\n“The case for de-colonial global system, the system must be egalitarian and holistic in its approach. We have seen socialism fail and we have seen capitalism succeed in its self afflicted destruction…those who say there is no future without capitalism have been proven wrong…” (Quintero para 1). This response clearly addresses the issue of capitalism and is in contrast with Mignolo’s assumption.\n\nAnother argument arises in Mignolo’s use of the term ‘Colonialism’ without expounding on what it covers. Colonialism by itself is all, encompassing. It includes knowledge as well, a case that is highly controversial because once the knowledge is colonized, it blocks all the avenues of change and this calls for people to adhere with the present rules regardless of the impact it imposes on them. The author ought to have argued out this clearly not to cast doubts on the readers of his works.\n\nThe author goes on to include indigenous intellectual people in his works. He is entirely devoted to support them concerning the issue of Eurocentric and current/majestic intellectuals. These intellectuals have people they ought to represent from where they come.\n\nThe author does not take into account the probability that these people can fail to; appropriately stand in for their communities. He just assumes that this cannot be the case. In his complain about Occidentalism as the main issue behind the Latin Americans subaltern acquaintance, he does not take into account the impact of excluding them in his theory of colonization.\n\nHe wants to convince the reader that this is not of any significance, though in the real sense, it shows how the Latin America can be safe on the expense of the other countries, in case of any drawback from the theory. This then calls for clarification, failure to which an untimely catastrophe can erupt.\n\nOn the subject of knowledge, Mignolo points out the relationship between it and the modernity/ colonialism. He also mentions a change of the terms when developing theory concepts. By this, he wants to convince people that this will improve their efficiency. However, his intentions of locking the other countries that ought to benefit are clear.\n\nThe change in question is aimed at ensuring that the theories work well in some but not everywhere. According to him, they will be in favor of the Latin Americans. In his assumption that capitalism is a booster of modernity, he ought to consider the results. It goes hand in hand with industrialization, which the world is claiming will precede the third world war.\n\nConclusion\n\nMignolo is taking people through the origin of the Latin America showing its connection to the western identity. It is depicted as a planned idea aimed at expanding the global capitalism, which on the other hand will bring a revolutionary shift, a mark of the cure of colonialism. Though driven by change, he fails to clarify its area of coverage as well as its impact to the entire word, and hence welcoming criticisms to his work.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nMignolo, Walter. “The Idea of Latin America.” Oxford: Blackwell, 2005.\n\nQuintero, Ramon. “The Idea of Latin America.” Word press: Blackwell, 2007.\n",
      "Arabian Women in “Zainab” and “Duties of a Working Mother” Essay\n\nWork and empowerment is a growing aspect in the female world of late. Most of the women have ventured into employment. This has widely affected their position in society. Saudi Arabian women have had difficulty in defining their position in the family. Their role in the society includes the normal home chores and nothing more. Islam rules and regulations governed these women. Strictness of the law crushed the hopes and expectations of these women.\n\nFrom the short story Zainab , the author portrays a clear picture of Saudi Arabian women. He says that women should be at home (Ash-Shamalan 40). Their duty is to take care of their spouses and carry out house chores.\n\nThese include washing up utensils, cooking, cleaning the house, doing the laundry etc. In addition, women should be submissive to their husbands. In Duties of a working mother , Munawarr illustrate that taking proper care of the children is an obligation of the women (Munawwar 44). He uses the character of Leila to bring out this scenario.\n\nAlthough she has a job as a teacher, she still has to ensure that the children have eaten and that their homework is submitted in time. When the guest visits her home, she is the one responsible for welcoming and preparing meals for them (Munawwar 45). Traditionally in the Middle East, the unmarried daughters have the least authority, and are to portray an attitude of difference and servitude. The role and status of women inside the household coincide with their role outside the house.\n\nIn Saudi Arabia, the voice of a woman has no weight. They have no authority to make decisions. When they get married, they are automatically bound by a contract that stipulates the extent a woman can go in decision making. This same contract does not limit the husband’s decision making whatsoever.\n\nNevertheless, the women are limited to playing their role of child rearing and housekeeping. These women thus find satisfaction and enhancement of their moral status spiritually. She has no say in deciding what she wants while under the care of her parents. The father decides for her the person to marry her (Al-Ulayyan 132).\n\nSuad encounters this when her father chooses a husband for her. She could not resist this since daughters are not supposed to show resistance. When it comes to matters of decision making at work, the voice of the unmarried women is inconsequential. It is the duty of husbands to make decisions. Culture and custom hinders the participation of women in activities other than household chores.\n\nThese cultures also dictate their limit of employment. According to them, employment of women and deploying labor of females in factories is immoral and dishonorable. Moreover, women attain power to speak to the authority of men as seen with Ahmad’s wife. Men gain control over home finances.\n\nHaving a job does not review the status of women in the family. Men still regard them as their property. The only job they have permission to do is teaching. If the husband feels this profession is hindering her wife to fulfill her household responsibility, he tells her to resign. In Duties of a working mother , Leila has experienced this for quite some time.\n\nThe husband mounts pressure on her to resign so that she can concentrate on the household chores (Munawwar 45). Ahmad’s mother did not appreciate his wife when she decided to venture into teaching. The mother in law insisted that she should stay at home.\n\nA woman’s contribution to the economy of the family does not influence her status in the family. Despite this contribution, she does not govern herself. The husband remains to be the breadwinner of the family. At work, women are at peace. They are happy to be earning and doing what interests them.\n\nIn Duties of a working mother , Leila is happy being a teacher. She does her work with commitment and makes children understand concepts with ease. As a result, she receives an appraisal from the administration of the school for a job well done. Women do not receive equal treatment at work simply because they are “economically dependent” and subservient. Employers regard married women as being dependant on the husbands’ salary and wages.\n\nThere is no restriction of hiring men, yet there is a restriction on women. There is a lot of discrimination in hiring of old and married women. The women work in difficult conditions for extremely little pay. (Cairoli 165) Women are not included in positions of textual authority and higher managerial tasks. The married women should motivate themselves to struggle for employment and recognition for being skillful.\n\nRelationships with the relatives also come with challenges. When a woman gets married, she gets a warm welcome into her new home, and the in-laws seem to be unusually friendly. The pain of leaving family is too much for them to bear. This is evident in the story Zainab . At her in-laws, Zainab is a lonely stranger with no one to socialize and talk to apart from her husband.\n\nWhen she is unable to bear children, her mother in law subjects her to harsh words (Zeinab 41). Zainab’s disappearance became a crisis of the society. The husband reported the matter to her mother so that she can search for her. She is so infuriated that she denounces her and says she has brought shame to the family.\n\nEducation is valuable to the women in Saudi Arabia. Most of them study in order to establish themselves and become independent. All these women take their studies seriously. This is rampant across Asia. Women empowerment is the only solution to eliminating discrimination of Saudi Arabian women.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAsh-Shamlan, Shariff. “Zainab.” Voices of change: short stories by Saudi Arabian women.

      "Relative Advantage of the Firm Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Distinct offerings of the firm\n 2. Pricing\n 3. Works Cited\n\nAccording to the case study, salton inc. enjoys a great advantage in relation to its suppliers placing it at a strategic advantage with its competitors. This strong relationship with suppliers places it at an upper hand in product development, innovation and branding. Further, the case illustrates that the firm has a strategic advantage due to product sourcing from the cheaper Asian markets, which provides it with the advantage of diversification.\n\nAccording to Afuah, a firm gains competitive advantage over its rivals by establishing strong relationship with suppliers and in this case the firm has 50 different suppliers for its products and a long-term relationship with Markpeak ltd (291). Markpeak Ltd, which supplies the firm with 38% of its products, is a reliable and competent supplier.\n\nAccording to Afuah, this advantage places the firm at a strategic market leadership position against its competitors and new entrants. By insisting on short-term supplier contracts, risk aversion is entrenched in sourcing for materials. In addition, the firm stresses on the importance of competitive bidding to gain an upper in sourcing for its products, placing it at an upper hand on margins position by ensuring that merchandize is of high quality.\n\nIn addition, high quality standards remained a priority (Afuah 292). However, competitors had the disadvantage of slow outsourcing, low volume purchases, translating to high costs and reduced profit margins placing it at a competitive advantage against its competitors. A clear marketing strategy and marketing mix is evident from the above case.\n\nCustomers on the other hand enjoyed high quality products, appropriately designed for their needs and wants. Further still, the company specialized in a wide range of quality kitchen, home, personal, and beauty care products.\n\nThus, the company’s brand name became a household name, an important concept in marketing. In addition, to beat her competitors, the company specialized in a wide range of products such as shower radios, and espressio/cappuccino products that placed the company’s brand at strategic places in homes serving as an advertising method.\n\nPotential new entrants could find it difficulty to penetrate the market due to its strategic position in terms of branding, lowered product cost, good quality products, product differentiation, and good marketing power and unique marketing mix. The firm’s concentration in advertising and marketing, tailor-making products for its customers by addressing their needs and wants, and making the brand name common through superior marketing techniques provides it with a clear lead in the market share.\n\nDistinct offerings of the firm\n\nAccording to the case, the firm offers distinct products specializing in product differentiation, tailor made to meet customer needs and wants. This included healthier and more convenient foods coupled with product diversification. With innovative ingenuity, the food products met the market demands as it were, raking the company in huge profits (Afuah 297).\n\nFurther, to boost its sales, the firm produced another brand called juiceman. This brand was similar to the original product but with half the characteristics of the original brand. This made record sales. Product differentiation and flexible pricing mechanisms played an important role in gaining and maintaining a strong lead in the market share.\n\nBrown asserts that firms have to adopt a unique marketing mix, adopt a unique hard selling concepts and competitive pricing to stay ahead in the market (chapter 2). These points to product diversification, product differentiation, and tailor made products to meet customer needs and wants.\n\nPricing\n\nEvident from the case study, marketers did enough research in pricing their products in relation to the value obtained by stressing on the importance of flexible pricing techniques. Pindyck asserts that, “profit-maximizing price-cost margin is inversely related to the firm’s price elasticity of demand” (Pindyck 1). Pindyck further asserts that a firm producing products with interrelated demand must use joint pricing mechanisms for profit maximization by creating a profound effect on sales (Pindyck 9).\n\nAccording to the above case, product diversification is evident, with innovative blending to meet customer needs with different prices and value. Afuah points out that the firm had excellent pricing techniques by creating a pricing strategy and mix, educating consumers, and providing a single price for any of its products through all its retail outlets (Pindyck 294).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAfuah Allan.Business Models: A strategic Management Approach, University of Michigan ® McGraw-Hill Irwin Boston Burr Ridge” ,2003.\n\nBrown Alex.

      "Early Retirement: Pros and Cons Analytical Essay\n\nIn order to exhaustively evaluate the merits and demerits of an early retirement, it is important to consider the longtermview as opposed to a short term view. Reductions in personal expenditures in the short term have to be balanced with increasedpension benefit liability and expenses over thelong term. Nevertheless, budgetary and administrative discipline is necessary in order to get such reductions.\n\nSome issues associated with early retirement should be addressed before deciding whether or not to take an early retirement. It is important to consider the economic, mental and emotional impacts of early retirement. Another important aspect is the decision’s effect on the immediate family. This paper seeks to prepare a decision paper outlining both the advantages and disadvantages of early retirement.\n\nMany people find themselves pursuing money making activities and finding it hard to stop. Either in employment or in business, there is an insatiable urge to attain a social status. Many end up accomplishing the social status and climbing the top of the ladder, but end up having limited time to enjoy their accomplishments.\n\nOn the contrary, some people are forced to retire unwillingly or without their consent. Many companies or employers have a policy for retirement after fifty five years, unless an employee has obtained a “chief” management position in the company. Beside the government policy on retirement, early retirement is a personal decision (Martel, 2011).\n\nThe first advantage of early retirement is that after the end of a career, it is another new beginning. The retiree has a lot of time to spend with the family and friends. The retiree gets a lot of time to manage and participate in family affairs.There is adequate time to eat healthy cooked food and do more exercises and physical activities as opposed to junk food while sitting in an office. Early retiree can have an opportunity and adequate time to do the things that were impossible when working.\n\nSome of these include travelling around the world, spending time with the grand kids and gardening. The fundamental assumption is that early retirement is for those who have already saved. This gives them a chance to do a lot in their young active lives, as opposed to after fifty five years of age(Zelinski, 2009).\n\nAn advantage that accrues to the society at large is the vacant position left by the retiree. A much younger person will be able to occupy the post; this will solve the unemployment problem that is dominant in young generation. In this way, early retirement becomes a program or a mechanism designed to solve unemployment problems in the society.\n\nOn the contrary, it should be mentioned that this is not always preferred by employers. For employers, replacing an old experienced employee is not easy. Some characteristics like conscientiousness and reasonableness cannot be easily replaced (Martel, 2011).\n\nEarly retirement is an attractive prospect for many workers especially if it is packaged with incentives. It is possible to have an early retirement and still enjoyed a stable and a secure financial ability. However, this applies only to those who spent their time to plan ahead of early retirement.\n\nIt is important to accumulate adequate financial and personal resources during employment. The retiree also requires making thorough long time projections. The retiree should hire a qualified accountant or a financial expert to help with the projections. If the income and expenditure projections on long time basis are in a safe position, then it is possible to consider early retirement(Zelinski, 2009).\n\nEarly retirement gives a person an opportunity to learn and practice new skills, and have a built-in interaction with people. The retiree gets an opportunity to concentrate on new skills while meeting new interesting people. Another way of utilizing the time and potential is by working with a humanitarian non-governmental organization. The retiree is able to bring in new skills, share with others, and acquire new skills.\n\nThe retiree can volunteer as a teacher, a move that has been proven to be successful. This enables the retiree to interact with young people who can listen unlike at workplace. It is appealing to work with a young person about job prospects and life issues than talking to an old experienced person(Zelinski, 2003).\n\nEarly retirement incentive programs are very popular strategies applied by companies around the world to reduce the employees. They are also advantage plans for companies in mergers, downsizing or takeovers. Experienced managers have also applied then to reduce layoffs.\n\nTo the employee, it is beneficial and the most humane way of ending a career in a company. Early retirement incentives are practically appealing to an employee who does not have a guarantee of keeping the employment. For those aspiring to retire without any benefits, they are the best ways of going for early retirement. However, the retiree should evaluate critically the benefits offered by the incentives, and those that will be accrued for normal retirement (Martel, 2011).\n\nThere is always a reason for avoiding early retirement. Getting the free time after retirement has some negative consequences. Some people feel redundant, a symptom for impending depression. Economically, inflation should be used as a determinant for early retirement. The pension and savings should be able to support the retiree. Since the retiree will spend a lot of time in retirement, the effects of inflation will be heavily felt.\n\nThe cost of living continues to increase after retirement until the retiree has reached eighty years of old. Statistics shows that those who retire early have an increased percentage of living expenses when they reach eighty (Paul & Townsend, 1992).\n\nA good number of retirees mistakenly assume that their tax responsibilities will reduce after retirement. To some extent, some taxes are avoided after retirement, but on the other hand, they could also go up. Additionally, income tax never goes down than they are before retirement.\n\nRetirees’ lifestyles changes significantly after retirement. Before planning on early retirement, a retiree should be able to curtail their lifestyle. The optimum spending after retirement should be about 75% of what was being spent during the working days. A considerable number of retirees spend more than the optimum amount, a move that complicates and worsen their life after retirement (Paul & Townsend, 1992).\n\nAnother commonly ignored expense is the cost of health insurance. This comes as a disadvantage of early retirement unless the retiree worked for a company that extends health insurance until the stipulated age, probably sixty five. The retiree is forced to pay high health insurance premiums from the accumulated savings until sixty five. Some early retirement incentives endorsed by the employer extends the health insurance until sixty five, after which one is eligible for Medicare(Zelinski, 2009).\n\nA considerable number of early retirees gets fed up with their full time working schedules and decide to retire. After retiring early, they proceed to look for part time job without considering its drawbacks. Most of part time jobs do not have regular, fixed or full time schedules.\n\nThe catch is that most of these jobs are not financially and emotionally rewarding. It becomes hard to supplement the retiree’s income by working on part time basis. The additional income obtained is also channeled to other additional costs like higher income tax. The retiree is affected both mentally and emotionally due to reduced social security offered by part time jobs (Paul & Townsend, 1992).\n\nThe social security benefits will be cut down significantly by retiring early. The early retiree will be forced to start drawing the benefits early. The monthly spending will be lower and the effect of inflation will be hard to deal with.\n\nIf the personal savings of a person is not adequate, the social security benefits will be overused and over-relied upon. The retiree will also be forced to start drawing and spending funds that has been set aside for personal retirement plans to supplement the benefits. This will also reduce the time of contribution to the plans, and hence less benefits.\n\nThe retiree will also incur steep penalties by withdrawing from personal retirement plans before the stipulated age. The early retiree is also penalized by the company in the company pension plans. For this matter, the person is undoubtedly unfit for early retirement (Baker, 2007).\n\nIn conclusion, early retirement is not an overnight or an instant decision. The retiree should compare the psychological and emotional ramifications of continuing to work and for early retirement. Impact on the members of the family should also be put into consideration. The situation should be assessed realistically without a rush decision being made.\n\nIf the future of your job is not guaranteed, the early retirement option will be most desirable. If the company is likely to have future layoffs, it is not good to be left behind the early retirement incentive program that has been offered. As mentioned earlier, the retiree needs to hire a competent financial advisor to project the long term income versus expenses. If the figures fallin your expectation bracket, then you should consider retiring early.\n\nReferences\n\nBaker, S. (2007).

      "The Effects of Tragic Tales on Audience Reflective Essay\n\nTragic tales draw enormous pity and empathy from the audience who get a chance, to either read and/or listen to them. Often, the heroes of tragic tales experience punishments that are beyond the implied committed crimes arising from the lethal mistakes they make.\n\nBy learning from the mistakes made in the due course, the heroes acquire self-knowledge coupled with an abundant wisdom enough to make them go back to their normal life sure of one thing: never to repeat the errors.\n\nConsistent with Aristotle’s suggested reasons as to why people flocked to the Greek theatres, at least to have a firsthand feel of tragic theatre shows, people leave in a world full of imperfections, which challenge them adequately rendering them hopeless: never to think of succeeding in their endeavors of dealing with challenges.\n\nEven today, people prefer tragic shows. By watching the shows, people redeem their hope of coping with challenging situations and perhaps leaving the theatre with a reformed mindset. The success of the protagonist is particularly essential since he/she becomes a role model and a subject of drawing comparisons of the depth of lifelong encountered problems among the audience.\n\nAs a way of example, audience prefers tragic stories as a way of encouragement to adopt steps that would see them succeed in their daily chores, as opposed for instance to some autobiographic tales of successful characters. Perhaps that is why people prefer to learn, not only from their mistakes, but also from those of oters. In the actual form, the entire learning process entails some sort of tragedies.\n\nZimmer in Grade School provides a substantially close packed humiliating story of a boy who struggles to deal with his school ordeals with no one capable of coming for his rescue. Perhaps in the modern world, empathetic readers would pose a challenging concern as to why the church, family and concerned educators hardly come to help the boy. However, this presentation aids the poet to achieve his literally style of fostering catharsis.\n\nTelling this story in form of a poem is advocated for, since the symbols used serve to represent hundreds of words that could be used if the poem was to be put in any other genre. For instance the mask , symbolically explains all the ordeals engulfed within the narrator.\n\nOn the other hand, in Eleven , the situation depicted by Sandra is well suited to the purpose short stories intend to serve, despite the fact that the story opens up by unveiling all the meaning of the being ‘eleven’ and hence taking incredibly almost the entire narration space.\n\nThe red sweater ordeal is perhaps well explained in a story format as opposed to other genres such as poetry. Providing the meaning of being eleven, ten, nine, eight, seven, six, etc, all at the same time would prove problematic in a poem since poems are brief in nature.\n\nConsequently, on my part, I prefer the use of poetry as a vehicle for telling Zimmer in Grade One , just as the way it is. The red sweater ordeal is one situation that draws many imaginational images to the mind of the reader. Eleven would have thus been more effective, if presented in form of a short video or on a stage skit.\n\nThe speaker in the poem The Mask remains unidentified all through the poem. All that is told is that the anonymous speaker struggles to hide the realty of his/her situation from other people always. The mask shrouds the suffering of the speaker.\n\nThe speaker must take caution to make sure that the mask remains intact by being vigilant lest the mask falls off exposing the realty of a tormented personality. According to well-documented historical sources, though not provided in the poem, the author is a black American who lived in the late nineteenth century.\n\nIn addition, the author had suffered from tuberculosis dying at a young age in the same century. By putting into consideration the stigmatization associated with such chronic ailments then, the author through speculation may have been the speaker. However, for critical analysis purpose of the poem, there is no warranty of such a speculation. In the last stanza of The Mask , the author uses ‘we’ to denote all people, the persona inclusive.\n\nThe ‘We’ shows how all people have worn the mask leave alone the persona. This can be interpreted as author’s attempt to draw a general conclusion on the message of the poem. ‘We’ refers thus to all other people who undergo hidden tortures, which they do not want unveiled to others, tantamount to the speaker’s predicament.\n\nNon-provision of information pertaining to who wore the mask is deliberate. By over perusing the information about who wore the mask could obscure the message contained in the poem. Otherwise, Durbar could have provided substantial details if they were necessary for unmasking the intended message in the poem.\n",
      "Hospice and Pain Management Analytical Essay\n\nIn certain stages of life or in the case a person has terminal illness death is inevitable and for that reason, the only thing that helpsis to control the pain in these patients.\n\nAs stated by Saunders (2007) most patients at the dying stage will experience symptoms such as pain, vomiting, nausea, respiratory secretions, fatigue, and dyspepsia. All these symptoms are painful and therefore the main goal of hospice careis to control or reduce the pain experienced by patients.As stated by Connor (1998), “the patient and the family are a critical part of the hospice team.”\n\nPain control in patients is of interest to both the patient, their families and the government has a role to play in ensuring that it issues guidelines that regulate hospice care. The law that regulates hospice care also requires that pain control should be the main goal in hospice care. In hospice care, the use of medication is the main method that controls pain even though there are other known methods of pain control.\n\nThe main work of a hospice nurse is to deal with patients who have severe pain.As stated by Jackson and Abraham (2005),Nurses should give pain control medication in appropriate time and we should not always respond due to distress in patients. The use of medication has become the main method of pain control among patients.\n\nThe use of narcotics has widely been applied in reducing pain among patients. Even though the use of narcotics is an effective method of pain control, respiratory depression is a major side effect resulting from it. Respiratory depression is a condition whereby the breathing of a patient becomes slow and weaker and in severe cases, the breathing may stop. The termination of breathing resulting from the use of narcotics in most cases is temporary but in some cases, it might be permanent resulting in the death of the patient.\n\nThis is just one of the examples of the side effects caused by the use of medication in pain control. Hospice service other medicationsand most of them if not allhave side effects. The question of the type of medication or the dosage for a patient therefore remains a major concern to us when we are providing hospice care services.\n\nIn hospice care the death of the patient although in some cases being inevitable should be prevented and incase it occurs it should not result from a mistake committed by a hospice service provider. Pain management in this stage of life is a right to the patient and a duty to the caregiver. Even though this is the obligation of hospice care, most families have stated that at the end of their lives most of their loved ones suffered from pain due to lack of treatment (Jackson & Abraham, 2005).\n\nIn order to be effective in my duties as a hospice service provider then applying the standard protocols in prescribing medication is essential. These protocols outline the methods for changing, increasing the dosage, or adjusting the medication used in patients.\n\nThe first medications that I will begin pain treatment with are the types referred to as over the counter medicine forexample,Tylenol and Aspirin.When the illness continues to develop the result will be an increase in pain to levels where over the counter medications are not effective. In such cases as a nurse, I will prescribe other medications that are much stronger such as narcotic based medication.\n\nReferences\n\nConnor, S. (1998) Hospice: Practice, pitfalls, and promise .

      "A Modern Cinderella and Other Stories Analytical Essay\n\n“A Modern Cinderella and Other Stories” by Louisa May Alcott includes four short stories, each with different themes, tones, structure and point of view. Yet on a careful reading of these four stories one can discern a common theme that can be loosely applied to all the four stories.\n\nThis common theme of love and compassion is brought out in each of these stories in a very distinctive way, making each one stand out in its own right. This essay will compare and contrast the various literary elements of the four short stories and highlight the common theme of love and compassion running through the entire collection.\n\nThe structure of each of these stories is laid out in a way to have maximum impact on the readers. A Modern Cinderella starts out like Cinderella’s story and shows one sister toiling hard while other rest and ends like Cinderella when John produces the slipper. The beginning and the end justify the title for the rest of the story is nothing like the fairy tale and lays out the daily trials of simple folks.\n\nBut while the Cinderella like start hooks the reader, the happy ending gives reader something to cheer about after the tragedy that had befallen the family in the middle of the story. The structure provides a perfect blend wherein comparison with the fairy tale is juxtaposed with the harsher realities of life.\n\nDebby’s Debut follows a simple structure of a love triangle where the love of the two suitors is alternately discussed to create the suspense as to which of the two Debby will chose. Although the reader is told that Debby loves Evans and there are a number of signs pointing towards Evans as the eventual winner, the depth of Leavenworth’s love is discussed in enough details to create doubt in the reader’s mind, especially in light of the pressure from Aunt Pen. This story follows the classical structure of a love triangle to keep the readers interested.\n\nThe Brothers has an ebb and flow like structure. It starts slowly but the momentum builds up and reaches its high point when Robert’s identity is revealed. The tension continues as Robert proceeds to kill Ned and Faith tries to stop him.\n\nOnce Robert agrees to back off, the narrative once again slows down only to rise again towards the climax. This structure has a very dramatic effect on the story and gets the reader involved in the lives of the lead characters.\n\nEach of the stories introduces the loving and compassionate nature of its lead characters in the opening scene. The first story, A Modern Cinderella, starts on a hot summer day when the main protagonist, Nan, is toiling alone in the kitchen while her younger sisters laze around.\n\nThe arrival of John in this setting and subsequent change in Nan’s demeanor immediately makes the reader aware of the spark between these lead characters. Similarly in the Debby’s Debut, the reference to Aunt Pen’s intention of finding a suitable match for Debby, gives the first hint of an impending romance.\n\nThe themes of The Brothers and Nelly’s Hospital center more around the compassion of its lead characters for other creatures. In The Brothers, nurse Faith Dane finds compassion in her heart for both the rebel soldier as well as the Mulatto, when it is clear that no one else in the hospital want to have anything to do with either of them.\n\nThe main theme of Nelly’s Hospital is her compassion for her living being and once again this theme is introduced early in the story. Thus, each one of the four stories gives very specific and clear hint about their main theme in the early stages.\n\nAnother idea repeated through the stories is that of loving one’s enemy. In The Brothers, Faith immediately agrees to care for the rebel soldier declaring that though she could not quite love her enemies, she was “willing to take care of them” (55). This theme of loving one’s enemies is repeated in Nelly’s Hospital, When Nelly compares the snake with a Rebel soldiers and yet decides to help it.\n\nIn Debby’s Debut, Debby feels compassion for Clara, who would have been considered competition by other girls in her place. Astute enough to realize that Leavenworth was flirting with Clara to get her attention and that Clara might be falling for him, Debby chides Leavenworth for his actions.\n\nIn the Modern Cinderella, although her sisters are not her enemies and are not intentionally cruel to her, at the beginning of the story, they come across as the “wicked stepsisters” and yet Nan jokes about them when John asks where they are. At this stage, the reader is not aware of the true nature of the relationship between the sisters, and Nan’s charitable description of her sisters’ activities hint at her compassionate constitution.\n\nThus the idea of compassion towards enemies is firmly established across the four stories.\n\nThe common theme of love and compassion is supported by author’s tone which is mostly optimistic in each of the stories. Modern Cinderella starts with the various domestic problems facing Nan, but the entry of John quickly turns the tone into optimism.\n\nThe sisters share a loving relationship and even though Di and Laura tend to avoid house work and responsibilities, John’s reproach of their attitude is playful and their reaction suggests at the tight bond shared by the sisters. Despite all the problems faced by lovers, the tone never becomes pessimistic.\n\nEven the death of the sisters’ father does bring down the narrative and when Nan falls ill, it is quickly balanced by Laura’s optimistic thoughts about her sister and her resolve to become more like Nan. In Debby’s Debut, the tone is earnest and joyful as Debby attempts to please her aunt but cannot help herself from enjoying simple pleasures of life.\n\nAs Debby enjoys her life despite Aunt Pen’s strict rules, the readers get pulled into the lively girl’s adventure and enjoy the vacation with her. In keeping with the subject of the story, The Brothers has a rather solemn tone. Although Robert’s experiences as a slave make him bitter, it does not affect the tone of the story which remains optimistic throughout.\n\nFinally, Nelly’s Hospital has an earnest tone as all the major characters chip in to help Nelly in her noble cause. As mentioned, each one of these stories remains optimistic even in the face of adverse circumstances and avoid any kind of negative tone.\n\nThe stories make ample use of foreshadowing to prepare the readers for the budding romance of its lead characters. In Modern Cinderella, Nan is facing a number of problems in the kitchen as she is trying to prepare the dinner all alone. But with the arrival of John “seemed to soothe all unpropitious powers with a sudden spell” (5).\n\nThis is the first hint of about Nan’s feeling for John. Similarly, the mention of John giving “his own gift in his mother’s name” hints at John’s feeling for Nan long before he confesses about it to his mother. In Debby’s Debut, the readers get the first hint Frank Evans and Debby may fall in love which each other by referring to Evans as “her fate” (26).\n\nIn The Brothers, Robert’s trance like conduct when Faith first sees him gives the first hint that something is right. These foreshadowing makes the readers look forward to impending romance in The Modern Cinderella and Debby’s Debut, while incites the curiosity in The Brothers.\n\nThe stories introduce conflict at various stages in the plot. In a Modern Cinderella, the conflict first arises somewhere in the middle of the story when John’s mother advices him to wait a year before proposing to Nan. It is further heightened by the death of the sisters’ father which puts the responsibility of the family on young Nan’s shoulders.\n\nIn Debby’s Debut, conflict is present from the very start since the Aunt Pen obviously wants Debby to marry rich and Evans comes from a working class background. Leavenworth’s growing affection for Debby further complicates the conflict. In The Brothers, the conflict is introduced rather late when Robert discloses his true identity and his intentions of taking revenge.\n\nThe introduction of the conflict at various stages makes the readers react in different ways in each of these stories. In the Modern Cinderella, just as the reader is starting to believe that the main protagonists will soon get together, the introduction of conflict brings back the suspense. The love triangle and Aunt Pen’s clear preference for the rich Leavenworth keeps the suspense alive throughout the story in Debby’s Debut.\n\nIn The Brothers, once the conflict is revealed, readers develop sympathy for Robert and subsequently, when the Rebel recovers, readers get the feeling of injustice towards the former slave. The strategic positioning of the conflict in each of these stories keeps the reader involved and raises varying emotions.\n\nComing to the point of view, Alcott uses various points of view in the four stories to make the desired impact. Both Modern Cinderella and Debby’s Debut are romantic stories and so the omniscient point of view of these stories keeps the readers aware of the feelings of each of the characters and heightens the conflict and suspense in these stories.\n\nThe Brothers uses a First Person narration resulting in a limited point of view which in turn heightens the suspense of the proceedings. The third person narrative of Nelly’s Hospital provides readers with the facts as seen from the perspective of a young girl. This helps the readers appreciate Nelly’s efforts and empathize with her concerns.\n\nThus using the right point of views makes conflict and the suspense of each one these stories stand out and helps the reader to identify with the characters.\n\nWhile each of the stories has their own ironies, The Brothers is perhaps one of the most ironic tales ever told. Robert finds himself caring for and trying to save the man who was responsible for his wife’s death. Even though he hates Ned, for an entire week he works hard to improve his condition so that he can learn what happened to his wife.\n\nWhen Robert tries to kill Ned to take revenge for her wife’s death, Faith ironically evokes the dead woman’s memory to stop him from committing murder. And in the end, even though he had been wronged again and again by his former master, he is unable to get his revenge when not him but another soldier kills Ned while he dies as a result of wounds inflicted upon him by Ned.\n\nRobert feels avenged and says that “it’s better so”, perhaps because the way the things played out ensured that Robert was not guilty of murdering his own brother. Once again the readers witness the irony of the situation since even though he had been wronged by Ned in so many ways Robert continues to think of him as his brother.\n\nWhile The Brothers is full of irony, other stories in the collection also have their ironic moments. In A Modern Cinderella, the biggest irony is perhaps the fact that the girls lose their father on the happiest day of their life. Just a few hours after he accepts Phillips proposal to allow Laura to marry him, he is found dead in his garden.\n\nAlcott further brings out this irony in announcing the death. She refers to fields of grain and ripening fruits, all of which are symbols of prosperity and life and then mentions almost offhandedly that “In the silence of the night a greater Reaper had passed by…leaving only tender memories” (18).\n\nIn Debby’s Debut, we witness the happy irony of Debby falling in love with the poor Mr. Evans despite her aunt’s best efforts to get her married to the rich Leavenworth. Also, while Aunt Pen tries to educate her niece in the sophisticated ways of the rich society, ironically it is Debby’s simple and honest demeanor which attracts Leavenworth to her.\n\nThe stories also make ample use of symbols, metaphors and imagery to get the message across. A Modern Cinderella starts with a description of the sisters’ house and its surrounding and refers to the trees as “patriarchal elms stood sentinel upon the lawn, as they had stood almost a century ago” (3), just as their fathers “paternal love … had been its strength and stay” (20). The problems facing Nan as she braves the house work all is best captured by the words “domestic purgatory…, kitchen” (4). Later, when it is obvious that Nan has fallen in love with John, the grove which she had visited since childhood to enjoy its solitude no longer felt deserted and “all things seemed to wear one shape”(13), an obvious reference to John. Just before announcing the death of their father, Alcott tells the readers the good news of Laura’s impending engagement. A little later, John and Nan walk out into the garden to look for Nan’s father. As they are walking down the garden, Alcott describes the scenery as\n\n“Fields of yellow grain were waving on the hill-side, and sere corn blades rustled in the wind, from the orchard came the scent of ripening fruit, and all the garden-plots lay ready to yield up their humble offerings to their master’s hand” (18).\n\nThese words serve a dual purpose at this point of the story. Besides bringing out the irony of the old man’s death, they also refer to the happiness felt by the young lovers in wake of the recently receive good news. Although the sisters always had a close bond, the death of their father brought them closer and prepared them for the long life that lay in front of them.\n\nAlcott has described this formation of a close bond between the sisters using the metaphor “the soil was made ready, and in the depth of winter the good seed was sown, was watered with many tears, and soon sprang up green with a promise of a harvest for their after years” (20). As the girls grew closer and became more responsible, their actions are described as “herbs of grace” (21). Time heals all wounds and by spring the girls had taken control of their lives and moved on after their father’s death. This aptly symbolized as “spring cleaning”.\n\nIn Debby’ Debut, the contrast between old age and youth is brought out by the fact that while even though they had both had the same exhausting journey, Aunt Pen chose to sleep earl while Debby was forced to be patient even though she wanted to play at the beach. Also, while Debby rose early, Aunt Pen continued to sleep till much later.\n\nThe rising sun is an apt symbol for Debby’s youth and her soon to follow debut. The youngsters at the summer watering hole had completely different dispositions in the privacy of their home but took on more polished roles in the each other company. This change in their personalities is captured by Alcott using the words “actors and actresses” to refer to the young crowd.\n\nIn the Brothers, the various injustices faced by Robert are compared with Michael Angelo’s bronze prisoner. Also, Robert refused to adopt the last name of his masters but later took Faith’s last name as a sign of his respect for the woman who gave him a second life free of vengeful thoughts.\n\nAnother symbol is Alcott’s reference to the fact that “all colored men are called boys”. Robert is described as a twenty five year old strong-limbed and manly person. Yet he is referred to as a “boy” because of his race. As Patterson points out, this confuses his identity, just as his being of mixed race results in him belonging to neither race.\n\nSimilarly, being a contraband “he is neither a slave nor free” (Patterson para 5). By referring to this manly person as “boy”, Alcott symbolizes the confused nature of his identity. Thus Alcott has made ample use of imagery, symbols and metaphors to get across her message in her stories.\n\nAlcott also had a tendency to borrow heavily from her own life and experiences and this lends the realism to her stories. A Modern Cinderella, tells the story of three sisters. As pointed out by Keyser, this sister theme is repeated over and over again Alcott’s writing. A Modern Cinderella like several other of Alcott’s work, including her most famous novel, Little Women, “are based on the experience of Alcott and her sisters” (Keyser 84).\n\nSimilarly, Alcott’s brief work as a nurse during the Civil War is reflected in The Brothers and Nelly’s Hospital. On the other hand, Debby’s Debut reflects her limited knowledge of fashionable society since by the time she wrote the story it was no longer considered necessary for poor girls to “make hay and eat bread and milk out of a bowl” (Harris 117). It is obvious that her stories were much more realistic when they were directly inspired from her personal experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, the four stories in the collection each have a unique take on theme of love and compassion and loving ones enemies. Each one of these stories skillfully uses the various literary elements to create the mood and deliver the punch at the right places. The fourth story, Nelly’s Hospital is simple tale of a little girl who feels compassion for living beings.\n\nAlthough the story is not as dramatic as the other three stories, it portrays the innocence of childhood and brings out the healing power of a kind deed. A Modern Cinderella and Debby’s Debut are classical love stories told in a simple way.\n\nAnd The Brothers highlights the importance of forgiving those who have sinned against us. Each one of these stories provides a new insight into human nature and has a literary structure to keep its readers hooked from the first word to the last.\n\nWork Cited\n\nAlcott, Louis May.

      "Syracuse, N.Y. -- One of Bernie Fine's accusers initially told Syracuse police the former Syracuse University coach molested him in early 2002 while he was attending an away game against the University of Connecticut, Onondaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick said today.\n\nBut Fitzpatrick said that after law enforcement authorities discovered that SU never played UConn during the 2001-02 season, Zach Tomaselli changed his story.\n\nTomaselli then told police that Fine sexually abused him in a Pittsburgh hotel room in January 2002, the night before SU played Pittsburgh, Fitzpatrick said, questioning Tomaselli's credibility.\n\nTomaselli fired back today that Fitzpatrick's account is not true.\n\nHe said that he initially told a police dispatcher that Fine molested him after inviting him to an away rivalry game, possibly against Connecticut. But within 24 hours, a friend, whom Tomaselli would not identify, reminded him that he had gone to Pittsburgh to see SU play, he said.\n\n\n\"I was 13 at the time. I had been in the northeast less than three or four months. That was not something I remembered, the specific city. I did once I thought about it,\" Tomaselli said. \"The minute I actually thought about it I knew it was Pittsburgh. One hundred percent.\"\n\nMinutes later, Tomaselli said, \"I don't think I ever told the police it was in Connecticut. I'm 90 percent sure I did not even tell Connecticut to a police dispatcher. That 10 percent, I might have said it was a rivalry game, possibly Connecticut.\"\n\nTomaselli, 23, is the only known accuser of Fine whose allegations could possibly result in a prosecution because of the statute of limitations, according to prosecutors and legal experts.\n\nTomaselli said he recalled that Fine had invited him to watch an away game in Pittsburgh - not in Connecticut - before police detectives met him and questioned him about the incident. He said he never knew that SU did not play UConn in the 2001-02 season until a Post-Standard reporter questioned him today. No police officials ever confronted him about that fact, Tomaselli said.\n\nFine, 66, who was fired by SU in November after three men publicly accused him of molesting them as children, has not been charged with any crimes. Through his attorneys, Fine has maintained he did nothing wrong.\n\nAssistant U.S. Attorney Steve Clymer, who is overseeing the investigation of Fine, declined to comment today on Fitzpatrick's assertions.\n\nThe spokesman for the Syracuse Police Department, whose detectives interviewed Tomaselli, did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nFitzpatrick's office initially launched an investigation of the sexual abuse allegations against Fine. But Fitzpatrick announced Dec. 7 that he was ending his investigation because no crimes had occurred in Onondaga County within the statute of limitations and the U.S. Attorney's office was taking over the case.\n\nStaff writer Emily Kulkus contributed to this story.

Gaines is the presumptive starter at cornerback alongside rookie Tre'Davious White, so let's get to know him.\n\nHis career thus far\n\nGaines, who was drafted by the Rams in the sixth round of the 2014 draft, managed to win a starting job as a rookie. Starting in 15 games, Gaines was a solid player for his team, allowing just 1 touchdown and 1.03 yards per coverage snap in the 2014 season, per Pro Football Focus.\n\nHis promising rookie season, however, did not last. Entering his second season as the presumptive starter, Gaines missed the entire season after suffering a Lisfranc injury in training camp. In a series of events that might sound familiar to Bills fans, Gaines received his foot injury by getting stepped on in practice. This is almost identical to what happened to Watkins, the player who he was traded for.\n\nGaines came back in 2016, but couldn't recapture his strong rookie form. He was plagued by various lower body injuries in the early part of his campaign and struggled in the games that he did start. Starting in 10 games, he gave up 8 touchdowns and 1.77 yards per coverage snap, both significant regressions from his initial campaign.\n\nHeading into his contract season in 2017, Gaines was expected to battle with Kayvon Webster to be Los Angeles' second cornerback, with Webster having the upper hand. Then, of course, he was traded to Buffalo.",

Listing 13-1 Creating a CGPDFDocument object from a PDF file CGPDFDocumentRef MyGetPDFDocumentRef (const char *filename) { CFStringRef path; CFURLRef url; CGPDFDocumentRef document; size_t count; path = CFStringCreateWithCString (NULL, filename, kCFStringEncodingUTF8); url = CFURLCreateWithFileSystemPath (NULL, path, // 1 kCFURLPOSIXPathStyle, 0); CFRelease (path); document = CGPDFDocumentCreateWithURL (url); // 2 CFRelease(url); count = CGPDFDocumentGetNumberOfPages (document); // 3 if (count == 0) { printf(\"`%s' needs at least one page!\", filename); return NULL; } return document; } Here's what the code does: Calls the Core Foundation function to create a CFURL object from a CFString object that represents the filename of the PDF file to display. Creates a CGPDFDocument object from a CFURL object. Gets the number of pages in the PDF so that the next statement in the code can ensure that the document has at least one page. You can see how to draw a PDF page to a graphics context by looking at the code in Listing 13-2. A detailed explanation for each numbered line of code appears following the listing. Listing 13-2 Drawing a PDF page void MyDisplayPDFPage (CGContextRef myContext, size_t pageNumber, const char *filename) { CGPDFDocumentRef document; CGPDFPageRef page; document = MyGetPDFDocumentRef (filename); // 1 page = CGPDFDocumentGetPage (document, pageNumber); // 2 CGContextDrawPDFPage (myContext, page); // 3 CGPDFDocumentRelease (document); // 4 } Here's what the code does: Calls your function (see Listing 13-1) to create a CGPDFDocument object from a filename you supply. Gets the page for the specified page number from the PDF document. Draws the specified page from the PDF file by calling the function CGContextDrawPDFPage . You need to supply a graphics context and the page to draw. Releases the CGPDFDocument object.\n\nCreating a Transform for a PDF Page Quartz provides a function— CGPDFPageGetDrawingTransform —that creates an affine transform by mapping a box in a PDF page to a rectangle you specify. The prototype for this function is: CGAffineTransform CGPDFPageGetDrawingTransform ( CGPPageRef page, CGPDFBox box, CGRect rect, int rotate, bool preserveAspectRatio ); The function returns an affine transform using that following algorithm: Intersects the rectangle associated with the type of PDF box you specify in the box parameter (media, crop, bleed, trim, or art) and the /MediaBox entry of the specified PDF page. The intersection results in an effective rectangle.\n\nRotates the effective rectangle by the amount specified by the /Rotate entry for the PDF page.\n\nCenters the resulting rectangle on rectangle you supply in the rect parameter.\n\nIf the value",
      "Al Connor First appearance The Camel\" Portrayed by Barry Sigismondi Biological information Gender Male Professional information Occupation(s) Fire Chief of Pawnee, Indiana\n\nChief Al Connor is Pawnee's longest-tenured department head, having taken over the Fire Department at age twenty-nine, after everyone else quit due to lack of hoses. He is known for his easygoing manner and corny jokes, as well as for having that disease where you can't feel pain when exposed to extreme temperatures. So, \"firefighter\" was kind of a no-brainer, career choice-wise.\n\nFor the Pawnee Mural contest, he and his team created a 'camel' of dogs playing poker with an 'everything on fire theme'. It also had some 'other things they liked' on it, including women. Their mural inspired Leslie to use her own team's camel. His mural did not win the contest, nor did any of the others, as an older mural was restored.",

      "As Sen. Dick Durbin's (D-Ill.) Judiciary subcommittee hears testimony on \"stand your ground\" laws Tuesday, charges of racial discrimination will be the central focus. Two black women, one of them Trayvon Martin's mom, are expected to testify about losing their sons to gunshots by white or Hispanic men. It's anticipated that a Harvard law professor will also emphasize race.\n\nThis racial angle is nothing new. President Barack Obama and Attorney General Eric Holder have already weighed in, linking race and these laws.\n\nNevertheless, Trayvon Martin's tragic death, which motivated this debate, had nothing to do with stand your ground laws. These laws allow people who face serious bodily harm or death to defend themselves without first having to retreat as far as possible. George Zimmerman was on his back and had no option to retreat, so the law was completely irrelevant.\n\nWho benefits from the law? Actually, since poor blacks who live in high-crime urban areas are the most likely victims of crime, they are also the ones who benefit the most from stand your ground laws. The laws make it easier for would-be victims to protect themselves when the police can't arrive fast enough. Therefore, rules that make self-defense more difficult disproportionately impact blacks.\n\nBlacks make up 16.6 percent of Florida's population but account for 31 percent of the defendants invoking the stand your ground defense. Black defendants who invoke this statute are actually acquitted 8 percentage points more frequently than whites who use this very same defense.\n\nThose who conclude the law is racially biased point to data compiled by the Tampa Bay Tribune, which collected 112 cases where people charged with murder relied on Florida's stand your ground law, from the first cases in 2006 to July 24 of this year. The Tribune's \"shocking\" claim: 72 percent of those who killed a black person faced no penalty compared to 59 percent of those who killed a white.\n\nBut this doesn't tell the whole story as blacks are overwhelmingly killed by other blacks. Thus, it is also true that blacks claiming self-defense under the stand your ground law are convicted at a lower rate than are whites. About 69 percent of blacks raising the stand your Ground defense were not convicted compared to 62 percent of whites.\n\nIf blacks are supposedly being discriminated against because their killers so often are not facing any penalty, it must also follow that they are being discriminated in favor of when blacks who invoke a stand your ground defense are convicted at a lower rate than are whites. Those who interpret the data as evidence of racism are cherry-picking numbers.\n\nSimple averages also missed important differences in these cases. The Tribune data shows blacks killed in these confrontations were 13 percentage points more likely to be armed than whites. This suggests that those claiming that they were defending themselves often reasonably believed that they had little choice but to kill their attacker.\n\nBy a 43 to 16 percent margin, the blacks killed were also more often in the process of committing a crime.\n\nThe Tampa Bay Tribune collected a lot of other useful information on the cases: whether the victim initiated the confrontation, whether the defendant was on his own property when the shooting occurred, whether a witness was present, whether there was physical evidence, whether the defendant pursued the victim, and the type of case (a drug deal gone bad, home invasion, etc.).\n\nSurprisingly, no one had run regressions with this data to see if these factors might explain the different conviction rates for whites and blacks. Such analysis finds no evidence of discrimination. While the results are not statistically significant, the regressions suggest that any racial bias would go the other way — that killing a black rather than a white increases the defendant's odds of being convicted.\n\nThe estimates also show that white defendants are more likely to be convicted than black defendants. Whether the person killed initiated the confrontation and whether there was an eyewitness were the most important factors in determining whether there was a conviction.\n\nMore than 30 states have adopted laws to remove the requirement to retreat. In the case of Florida in 2005, the law was passed unanimously by the state Senate and by a 94 to 20 vote in the state House. In 2004, then-state Sen. Obama co-sponsored and voted for a bill expanding the protection of Illinois' 1961 stand your ground law.\n\nForgotten are the reasons that stand your ground laws exist. Requiring people to retreat sometimes prevented people from defending themselves. Trying to define an \"appropriate retreat\" also added confusion. Overzealous prosecutors sometimes claimed that people who defended themselves could have retreated even farther.\n\nAre all these Democrats who supported these laws racist? Hardly. Allowing people to protect themselves should be an issue that crosses both racial and political lines.\n\nJohn Lott is the author of the book \"Dumbing Down the Courts: How Politics Keeps the Smartest Judges off the Bench.\" He is president of the Crime Prevention Research Center and will testify Tuesday at the Senate hearing on stand your ground laws.",

      "Polls show the American public strongly against NSA surveillance against them, but actually getting them to stop depends in a large part on Congress, and a battle that is looming between spying advocates and critics.\n\nThe Intelligence Committee chairs in both the House and Senate are eager to back the NSA, and are pushing a resolution, written by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D – CA), that would do materially nothing to stop the programs, and would instead seek to \"tweak\" the amount of transparency the American public gets about it.\n\nOn the other hand, the revelation of \"social mapping\" has added to concerns about the NSA's mass tracking of American citizens, and is spawning a competing resolution from Judiaciary Chairman Sen. Patrick Leahy (D – VT), who wants major changes including the revocation of Section 215 of the Patriot Act.\n\nThe Obama Administration has made clear that it opposes major changes, insisting NSA surveillance of American citizens is a vital part of national security. Yet while they downplay the extent of the program, repeated leaks continue to show worse and worse violations, driving calls for far greater reforms, if not a wholesale tear-down of the existing surveillance state.\n\nLast 5 posts by Jason Ditz",

      "Javed Akhtar, Asaduddin Owaisi and the \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\" debate\n\nPolitics make strange bedfellows. One such pair is Mohan Bhagwat and Javed Akhtar. In fact, Mohan Bhagwat was busy practicing one-liners in the recent past. And the latest one was when he thought the current young generation should be taught to say \"Bharat Mata ki Jai\".\n\nAnd as expected Asaduddin Owaisi, who is working overtime in expanding his constituency in various states responded negatively to Bhagwat's suggestion. \"I don't chant that slogan. What you would do Bhagwat sahib?\" was his retort.\n\nI don't know how Bhagwat would respond, but I know how Atal Behari Vajpayee would have responded. Atal, for sure would have asked Owaisi daily to chant \"I don't say Bharat Mata ki Jai\" one hundred and eight times. Sadly, he is nowhere in the picture and I had to be contended with my imagination.\n\nIndian polity is such a confused lot, not a single leader from any of the so called secular parties have come forward and replied to Owaisi. Whosoever tried to shout down Owaisi don't matter much, except in the pocket of their influence. It was a \"pleasant surprise\" when Javed Akhtar responded to Owaisi. Now, it is common that whenever a famous Muslim takes a stance that was not in line being followed by the predominant leaders, he was accused of playing to the Hindu gallery or he was never a Muslim. Even the former president Abdul Kalam was not spared.\n\nHere is the curious twist in the current tale. Unlike Kalam, who in many ways liked the native culture [yes, that is what it is – the culture popularly called Hindu culture is the native culture of this country, continuously evolved from the contributions of countless people of former generations], Javed Akhtar is an atheist. One columnist writing for Huffing Post wondered how Javed Akhtar expects Owaisi, a practicing Muslim to respect an image of Mother India, as Islam prohibits idol worship. Moreover, Javed Akhtar had said that chanting 'Bharat Mata ki Jai' is not a duty but a right to him, as an Indian. Case is too complex!\n\nreport this ad\n\nThis is not the first time such controversy had emerged. Earlier also there was a refusal from some dogmatic Muslims to say \"Vande Mataram\" claiming that a real Muslim cannot pay obeisance to anyone but Allah. Not even to one's mother!\n\nAt that time I thought it was a ridiculous argument that doesn't deserve a comment. However, when I read when the news broke that one Syrian lad killed his mother for trying to persuade him to leave ISIS, I realized the danger of neglecting mother, at God's cost.\n\nIdol worship in a way is primitive. And like all other primitive things, it is so far the most effective. Those who don't agree that primitive is the most effective needs to pause and reflect about all the feelings, emotions and desires they have. It is the primitive feeling of hunger to sex that drives humans to strive for living. And idol worship was effective and was practiced world over, from Mayans to Egyptians to the Greek, though survived in the main form in India only.\n\nIn fact, all religions practice idolatry to symbols. In Islam nothing represents the God. It was correct, because God, who was omnipresent was a superior being and nothing mortal nor material can ever represent him. Now, whenever Owaisi like people conveniently forget the basic tenet of Islam and cry about the Babri Masjid demolition – as anti-Islamic act, it exposes the hypocrisy and stinks with political opportunism.\n\nMeanwhile, Owaisi, I respect him for his knowledge and skill – had tweeted an old quotation by none other than the Guru Rabindranath Tagore.\n\nMust Read this should be definition of Nationalism pic.twitter.com/vSKz62CHSn — Asaduddin Owaisi (@asadowaisi) March 16, 2016\n\nNow, reading half is the most dangerous thing, but a politician is not a politician if he reads completely. And Owaisi is a good politician. He did not read the last sentence and tried to understand it. Tagore glorifies the 'living words that have issued from the illuminated consciousness of her great sons….'.\n\nI was wondering what Owaisi learnt from the words of the sons of Mother India. Tagore was talking about the native culture that has evolved over millennia because of continuous contribution of many people spanning generations. Owaisi claims he is a nationalist. I wonder what he loves about India, if not the history of India, which was native to it – and not imported it. If he chooses to",

      "Case reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug ( n = 12) or inactive placebo ( n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.\n\nBaggott MJ, Galloway G, Jang M, Didier R, Pournajafi-Nazarloo H, Carter CS, et al.

      "Unless you're reading this from the accounts section of Nintendo, we may never know. But experts in the field can estimate, and they estimate that the 3DS costs Nintendo $101 to manufacture.\n\nIf that's correct - and even if it's not, it's likely to be damn close - there's a big gap between the handheld's $101 parts bill and its $249 retail price in the United States.\n\nWhich is your cue for INDIGNATION and OUTRAGE, yes? Perhaps, but remember, that's just an estimated cost for the \"raw materials\" needed to manufacture a 3DS. It's not including research & development costs, shipping costs, advertising costs, the cuts retailers may take, etc.\n\nNor is it including the fact that Nintendo refuses to sell its hardware at a loss, so there's pure profit to be had in the $148 price gap, too.\n\nHow much pure profit?

      "Why do you play Robin?Well I started with Robin back during the 3DS, I had been excited to play Robin since the reveal trailer because I'm a huge Fire Emblem fan, and a mage-like character was something I always wanted to be included.She felt extremely comfortable, was easy to control, had huge hitboxes, and had tons of power. \"What's the point of movement speed if you have everything else?\" I thought.Why do you play the female version of Robin?Haha, I'm surprised, I think this is the first time this question has come up.I remember watching videos of the Japanese version of the game and fell in love with the Japanese voice of female Robin, so it was sort of natural to play the female version when I got the game in English.Her voice is better than the male's voice in English as well, in my opinion.I used to joke around that I was playing the female version just so I could play her in the Japanese version one day.Where do you think Robin is on the tier list? Which characters do you put above him/her on your tier list?Robin falls somewhere around #15-20 on the tier list.Characters that are for sure better than her are: Cloud, Sheik, Rosalina, Bayonetta, Sonic, Diddy Kong, Mario, Fox, Zero Suit Samus, Ryu, and Pikachu.Characters that are likely better are: Marth, Villager, Meta Knight, Mega Man, and Ness.Characters that are around Robin are: Toon Link, Corrin, Greninja, Pit/Dark Pit, Captain Falcon, Luigi and Peach, but I think she's better than most of those.Which character do you feel deserves to be at the very top of the tier list?That's a really difficult question, I don't think there's anyone who agrees on who's the best of the best. In my opinion, without looking at results, I'd say Bayonetta. If I include results then it's Diddy Kong, with Mario being a very close second.What are Robin's strengths?Strong projectiles, a large disjoint, great auto-cancel frames and ending lag on almost all her aerials that give Robin great spacing tools, combos, and frame traps, a command grab which can be the most rewarding single move in the game, amazing kill power, projectiles that can't be shielded, kill confirm plus tons of damage off grabs.What are Robin's weaknesses?Slow movement speed so it can be difficult to cover tech options or catch opponents, no solid out of shield options, a limited recovery without a hitbox above her, a slow jump, a lot of endlag on missed grabs, and a terrible disadvantage state.What are Robin's advantageous match ups that are relevant to the tournament scene?Advantageous? Haha, maybe Sonic? Ness is a good MU as well, but we're starting to get out of relevant characters with him. Robin goes even or barely loses to most of the top tiers though.What are Robin's disadvantageous match ups?Characters Robin definitely struggles against are: Cloud, Rosalina, Diddy Kong, Zero Suit Samus, Mewtwo, and Toon Link. There are other characters like Ryu, Lucario, Mega Man, Fox, and Villager that can be tough but usually aren't too bad.What is Robin's toughest match up, in your opinion? Why?For sure that's Diddy Kong. Sometimes it feels like the character was specifically designed to keep Robin in check, haha.Banana fizzles every thunder option (except thoron) which means a free punish if Robin shoots anything, he's fast so he can run away from Robin and get banana easily or just reset neutral if needs to.His roll is obnoxious against Robin, his shield is amazing because of his small body which results in items not bouncing off his shield correctly. He can crawl under every thunder variant, has a faster jump squat and much faster disjointed aerial to throw out.Great ways to force Robin into shield (one of her worst states) and a super solid neutral that he can abuse to keep Robin off stage or in disadvantage.Earlier this year during Shine 2016, you went through some very notable Sonic mains. How do you feel about the Robin vs. Sonic match up?Probably slight Robin advantage. Robin has one of the few tools to deal with spin dash invincibility with arcthunder, a large sword to fight Sonic's limbs, and a good way to keep sonic in the air with auto-cancels/frame trap aerials.You also eliminated Larry Lurr's Fox during Shine 2016. How do you feel about the Robin vs. Fox match up?Slight fox advantage, Larry gave me a lot of space during our set and let me breathe way too much. Usually Robin struggles to get hits in because Fox is always on top of her, but that wasn't too much of a problem during our set for some reason.",

      "OTTAWA—The fate of thousands of temporary foreign workers facing deportation beginning April 1 emerged as a high-stakes national issue, with small business urging Ottawa to let them stay and the federal government threatening to track down any who try to go underground. Many low-skilled people who came to Canada under the Temporary Foreign Worker Program are expected to leave the country beginning Wednesday as a result of a clampdown by the Conservative government. Estimates of the exodus run into the tens of thousands but Ottawa won't provide details.\n\nIn a statement Wednesday, Immigration Minister Chris Alexander said those temporary foreign workers who remain in Canada past their deadline will be dealth with \"swiftly and fairly.\" ( Adrian Wyld / THE CANADIAN PRESS file photo )\n\nAs the rule of the four-year ban of re-entry rolled in Wednesday, the federal government warned temporary foreign workers who are due to leave that they will be dealt with swiftly if they try to go underground to avoid leaving Canada. \"Let there be no mistake: We will not tolerate people going 'underground.' Flouting our immigration laws is not an option, and we will deal with offenders swiftly and fairly,\" Immigration Minister Chris Alexander and Employment Minister Pierre Poilievre said in a statement. The low-skilled workers are losing their work permits under a policy introduced on April 1, 2011 that requires any temporary foreign workers who have been here for four years to leave. They are also barred from returning for four years under the \"4-in-4-out\" rule.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nAs many as 70,000 workers now in the country will have to leave, according to the Migrant Workers Alliance for Change, which projected the estimates based on the number of work permits issued four years ago and foreign workers who had already been working in Canada before then. The Alliance points out that some of these workers may be in their first year of employment and have as many as three more years before having to leave. The clampdown has prompted widespread complaints of unfairness and future chaos in business. Thai worker Somsha Chanchai's work permit expired Wednesday and he will be boarding a flight back to Bangkok on Sunday. \"The decision to ban us from working in Canada is unjust and unfair. I have put food on the table of Canadians for so many years. Why would you create laws that penalize us?\" said the 46-year-old father of two boys.\n\nChanchai, who paid $10,000 to a recruitment agency to come to Canada, said he is the sole provider for his family, his parents and other extended family members, and expects he will be unemployed for the next four years.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nSome organizations have called for a temporary moratorium on the intake of foreign workers from abroad and a path to permanent residency for those, including the ones in low-skill and low-wage category, who are already here. \"Given that extensions have been announced for some 1,000 temporary foreign workers (TFW) who had applied for permanent status before July 1, 2014, it is prudent now for the federal government to extend this reprieve to all TFWs facing the four-year rule,\" said Victor Wong of the Chinese Canadian National Council. \"This transition period would allow TFWs to complete their assignments in Canada and return home, and allow those who wish to apply for permanent residency to do so in an orderly fashion.\" Chris Ramsaroop of the Justicia for Migrant Workers said, \"Today's decision to deport tens of thousands of migrant workers represents one of the most inhumane actions undertaken by the Conservative government during its years in power. \"Rather than provide permanent residency and the opportunity to continue to build our communities, the government has chosen to repeat the mistakes of the past by following what previous generations of elected officials have done: demonize, criminalize and dehumanize the same racilized migrant workers who have built our railways and built the wealth of this nation,\" he told the Star. In their statement, Alexander and Poilievre said, \"Employers and foreign workers have known about the four-year time limit since 2011, when this policy was announced. \"Employers have had four years to find alternative employees. Similarly, temporary foreign workers have had four years to pursue pathways to permanent residence.\" The government urged foreign workers to apply for permanent status. However, many immigrant support groups say that low-skilled foreign workers will not qualify to stay under existing programs. \"This is yet another example of a government that lacks compassion and a flexible reasonableness around supporting both Canadian businesses and industries and some very vulnerable people,\" said Liberal Leader Justin Trudeau.

Jim Risch said anyone who supports the nuclear deal \"really joins the ranks of the most naive people on the face of the earth.\"\n\nRisch added that Moniz and Secretary of State John Kerry had been \"bamboozled\" by Iran, but did not clarify whether they had also been run amok, led astray, or hoodwinked.\n\nSometimes congressional hearings can be productive. But almost always they will include a not-insignificant amount of circus time, particularly if it's on a politically loaded issue or if it's getting lots of TV coverage. This hearing is so far no exception.",
      "The true scale of serious crime is revealed in a controversial new method of ranking offences that is changing how police patrol Britain's streets.\n\nUnder the new national 'Crime Harm Index' disclosed by The Mail on Sunday today, robbery is considered worse than child abduction and bike theft more serious than drug possession.\n\nNow, chief constables are using the same approach to focus on offences deemed to cause the public most harm, including putting more effort into deterring dangerous drivers and less into catching shoplifters.\n\nSEEN FOR THE FIRST TIME: NEW LIST OF POLICE PRIORITIES The new Crime Harm Index developed by the Office for National Statistics tries to make police figures more meaningful – by giving more importance to some offences than to others. Rather than treating every crime recorded by police, from murder to shoplifting, on an equal basis, it gives them each their own individual 'weight'. These are derived from the proportion of offenders jailed for each offence and the average number of days criminals spend in jail for them. The harm index is then calculated by multiplying this weight for each offence by the number of offences each year, allowing researchers to see if serious crimes are going up or down. But a number of apparent discrepancies emerge, which could skew police priorities.\n\nThe new analysis by the Office for National Statistics shows that serious crime has been on the rise for the past two years, despite politicians and police insisting the country is becoming safer.\n\nPeter Neyroud, a former chief constable who has pioneered development of a harm index at Cambridge University's Institute of Criminology, said last night: 'A crime harm index will help us – police, politicians and citizens – to understand crime and the harm it causes to victims and communities better.\n\n'It helps police to target serious crimes more effectively, exposing crimes like child sexual exploitation, rape and domestic violence more starkly.\n\n'All crimes are not equal. We all know that a minor theft and a murder cause a different level of harm, yet our traditional crime recording systems count both as one crime.'\n\nBut questions are being raised about the ranking of crimes, which is based on jail sentences handed out by judges but, for example, misses out fraud. There are also fears the new system may again tempt police officers to fiddle the figures.\n\nExperts told the ONS at a recent meeting they were 'sceptical about the value of an index' and concerned about possible 'perverse' incentives for officers to 'downgrade recording of serious offences'.\n\nMarian Fitzgerald, visiting professor of criminology at the University of Kent, warned it could mean that less serious crimes are no longer investigated.\n\nHOW CAN BLACKMAIL BE ON PAR WITH CHILD ABUSE? Aftab Khan was jailed for seven years after running a gang that forced a 14-year-old girl was forced into prostitution The Crime Harm Index ranks blackmail as slightly more serious than 'abuse of children through prostitution and pornography'. It gives blackmail a 'weight' of 566, representing the average number of days offenders serve in jail for the crime, compared with 563 for taking advantage of teenagers for sexual reasons. Many observers would consider the latter to be the more serious crime, particularly in the light of the horrific abuse carried out by grooming gangs around the country that has been exposed in recent years. In one notorious case, a 14-year-old girl was forced into prostitution by a group of men after being picked up in a Rochdale nightclub and plied with alcohol. Police said the vulnerable teenager was 'used as a commodity' by the gang, who forced her to have sex for money before she escaped their clutches. Ringleader Aftab Khan was jailed for seven years.\n\nShe said: 'Large sections of the public will increasingly find that the police may record the crimes they report to them, but will not even go through the motions of following up these reports since they are now officially sanctioned not to take any action.'\n\nMichael Levi, professor of criminology at Cardiff University, said it was 'deeply regrettable' that fraud is being left out of the first index, to be published in the autumn, even though it is now the most common crime reported to police, with some six million cases last year.\n\n'If you've got some categories that are excluded, they are automatically left out of the police's priorities,' he said.\n\nSURREY: 19% RISE IN SERIOUS CRIME\n\nCurrently, the ONS publishes two sets of crime statistics – one based on all offences recorded by police in England and Wales and another based on a survey of victims.\n\nThe latest figures published in July showed 4.5 million offences were recorded by police in the year ending March 2016, an annual rise of eight per cent. Part of the increase is believed to be down to a surge in reported sex offences dating back decades in the wake of the Jimmy Savile scandal, but homicides have also risen to a five-year",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nIn celebration of its upcoming 25th anniversary in April, the Hubble Space Telescope has returned to the site of what may be its most famous image, the wispy columns of the Eagle Nebula, and produced a stunning new picture. \"The Pillars of Creation,\" located 6,500 light-years away in area M16 of the distant nebula, were photographed in visible and near-infrared light with the Hubble's upgraded equipment, and the result is as astonishing now as the original was in 1995. Hubble went online in 1990. The anniversary imagery is being revealed at the American Astronomical Society meeting in Seattle.\n\nNot only does the enhanced detail make for beauty, but astronomers can see how this corner of the nebula has changed over the last two decades. One small jet-like structure, for instance, has been cruising at about 450,000 miles per hour, traveling 60 billion miles — though it's hard to even spot the difference, so vast are these cosmic columns.\n\n\"We have caught these pillars at a very unique and short-lived moment in their evolution,\" explained Arizona State University's Paul Scowen, who also helped capture the 1995 original. \"The ghostly bluish haze around the dense edges of the pillars is material getting heated up and evaporating away into space.\"\n\nDon't worry, though: the nebula will still be around 20 more years from now for another snapshot.\n\nIN-DEPTH\n\nSOCIAL\n\n— Devin Coldewey",
      "WHEN he addresses the UN General Assembly on September 25th, Abdel Fattah al-Sisi will surely have reason to feel pleased. The former field-marshal's first 100 days as president, following a strong electoral win in June, have brought economic and diplomatic advances as well as hope to Egyptians wearied by years of political turmoil. Yet the health of the most populous Arab state remains fragile. Full recovery will take more time and less of a few things, not least reliance on heavy-handed police to silence dissent.\n\nMr Sisi can take credit for some good first steps. Successive Egyptian governments have shied from tackling ruinously large energy subsidies. But in July Mr Sisi's cabinet raised fuel prices, which will both restrain galloping consumption and trim the government's budget deficit, running perilously above 11% of GDP.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nThe launch of a $4 billion project to double the capacity of the Suez Canal, one of Egypt's main earners, has also been a success. Despite scepticism among some experts over government claims that the project will more than double canal revenue, from $5 billion to $12.5 billion, Egyptians snapped up an $8.5 billion bond issue that will underwrite both the digging and a wider development scheme. The sum not only indicates a return of confidence among ordinary citizens, but suggests how Egypt might reduce reliance on foreign donors. Rich Gulf countries have shelled out some $20 billion to prop up Mr Sisi since (as defence minister) he led a coup against the Muslim Brotherhood last year.\n\nMr Sisi has also cashed in on the region's misfortunes. With Egypt's neighbour Libya in turmoil, Gaza in ruins, and Islamic State rampaging in Iraq and Syria, anxious Western countries have turned to Egypt to fulfil its familiar regional role as a moderating force. Visiting Cairo to lobby for support against IS, America's secretary of state, John Kerry, avoided public mention of Egypt's dismal human-rights record. Despite sharp words from the European Union on the subject, France in July sealed a deal to sell warships to Egypt.\n\nMr Sisi's rehabilitation is not yet complete. America, which has lavished $1.3 billion a year of military aid for three decades, is unhappy about overtures to Russia, which on September 17th said it had inked a $3.5 billion arms deal with Cairo. Egyptian diplomats also fear that American supporters of the Muslim Brotherhood, which has suffered the deaths of hundreds of supporters under Mr Sisi, plan demonstrations against his visit in New York.\n\nIn Egypt a snowballing campaign of hunger strikes is focusing public attention on the plight of political prisoners, hundreds of whom have been incarcerated for more than a year without trial. Power cuts and price rises are also causing discontent.\n\nPerhaps to pre-empt embarrassment in New York and encourage a friendlier reception from Mr Obama, Mr Sisi's government has quietly relaxed some strictures in recent weeks. High-profile secular prisoners have been released, as have more than 100 students who had been held for seven months for mounting pro-Brotherhood protests. The government has postponed passage of a law to place NGOs under strict state control, and hints that it will revise a draconian anti-protest law.\n\nSince Mr Sisi's election there have been few counterbalances to the incremental reassertion of state control. The Muslim Brotherhood is crushed and largely discredited, while secular opposition forces are marginalised and in disarray. Parliamentary elections, likely to be held by January, are expected to produce a low turnout and a weak, divided legislature. Mr Sisi's luck, for the time being, looks as if it will hold.",

      "Wednesday, February 15, 2006\n\nThe Bundesverfassungsgericht has declared legislation which would have allowed the German Air Force to shoot down hijacked passenger planes unconstitutional.\n\nThe Luftsicherheitsgesetz (literally: Aviation Safety Act) was passed in January 2005 and mainly dealt with uncontroversial matters concerning the safety at airports. One provision however allowed the minister of defense to order the Air Force to shoot down a hijacked plane as a last resort if it could be presumed that that plane would be used as a weapon to kill people on the ground.\n\nThe court based its decision to strike down that provision on three considerations:\n\n1) It found that the federal government lacks the legislative competence for that part of the act under the Basic Law, the German constitution, which gives the states the main authority to fight disasters and thus, as the court, implied terrorism. Only the federal cabinet acting as a whole could overrule that in certain cases and as the act specifically gives only one minister, the defense minister, that authority it is unconstitutional.\n\n2) The court also found that the act is incompatible with the constitutional right to life and the human dignity. The act would turn passengers and crew of a hijacked plane, victims themselves, into \"objects\"--- not only to the terrorists, but also to the state, which does not have the authority to kill innocents. If their deaths would be used to save others they would be reduced to mere \"things\" at the pleasure of the state. Further, the court believes that the arguments of the federal government, saying that passengers in such a situation would die anyway, are invalid, as human lives deserve protection regardless of the expected duration of their existence and that it is impossible to fully assess the situation leading to an eventual invocation of the act.\n\n3) The third consideration concerned planes manned solely by terrorists. Shooting down those would not violate the right to life and human dignity as in 2), however as described under 1) the federal government lacks competence to pass such legislation.\n\nReactions\n\nGerhart Baum, a former interior minister and one of the plaintiffs, hailed the decision as \"historic\" and said that were it not for that ruling \"we would have martial law while fighting crime\".\n\nDefense minister Franz Josef Jung said \"it is our duty to protect the citizens from terrorism\". He announced that he would consider lobbying to change the Basic Law.\n\nThe ruling is expected to also have bearing on current discussions to extend the mandate of the Bundeswehr (German military forces) to help police large events like the upcoming soccer world championship in Germany, as it implicitely reaffirms the separation of armed forces and the police.\n\nSources",
      "There is no room for Dean Pee's prevent defense in 2017\n\nThe Baltimore Ravens end the 2016 NFL season like they wanted. In a battle for the AFC North on Christmas Day, a Kyle Juszczyk touchdown put the Ravens up with just over a minute left to play. It seemed liked they were in the drivers seat. A win would put them in great position to win the division and make the playoffs.\n\nWhat happened next was a heart breaker. Ben Roethlisberger and the Steelers offense drove down the field and an outstretched arm by Antonio Brown ended the Ravens season. The good news is that the season is over and the slate is clean, but one thing that cannot be continued this season is Dean Pees prevent defense.\n\nDean Pees has been under a lot of scrutiny from fans since he became defensive coordinator in 2012. His defense helped lead the way to a Super Bowl victory his first season, but there has seemed to be more negatives than positives. Many fans were frustrated this offseason when Harbaugh chose to keep Peas for the upcoming season. A big reason is because of Pee's prevent defense that he has used at the end of games. After suffering through the pain of it last season, I cannot blame them.\n\nThe prevent defense is painful to watch. It's not the kind prevent defense you use at the end of the half to stop the Hail Mary pass. The Dean Pees prevent defense gives the only rushes three or four guys and gives the receivers a ton of room to run. I get you do not want to be overaggressive, but this is different. The defense looked like they didn't even want to get to the quarterback. It's like watching the game while someone is slowly stabbing you with a knife. There is nothing you can do about it and you know there's a really good chance the offense is going to score.\n\nTwo games stick out to me when talking about the prevent defense: the Oakland and Pittsburgh games. With all the complaints about the offense last season, they put the team in positions to win. But after going up, the defense let the opposing offense drive down the field. Derrick Carr and Ben Roethlisberger are good quarterbacks, but the Ravens defense were good enough to stop them.\n\nNo excuse this year\n\nThere might have been some excuses in the past, but there is no reason for the prevent defense this year. The Ravens have spent the offseason and draft improving the defense. They did not even take a single offensive skill player in the draft.\n\nThe secondary has gone from Shareece Wright, Jerraud Powers and Kyle Arrington to Tony Jefferson, Brandon Carr and Marlon Humphrey. It has gone from being the weak link on the defense to arguably the strongest part. The Ravens struggled to get to the quarterback, but they also improved this in the draft. Adding Tyus Bowser, Chris Wormley and Tim Williams adds significant help to the pass rush situation.\n\nThe Ravens have a more manageable schedule this year, but they still come up against some very good quarterbacks. They will come up against the likes of Aaron Rodgers, Andrew Luck and Matthew Stafford. Saving the prevent defense for a Rodgers Hail-Mary is going to be more effective than trying to stop him from driving down the field. If the Ravens want to close out games and be contenders, we cannot see the prevent defense next year.",

      "If the earthquake in April was not enough, Nepalis are now suffering the catastrophe of the blockade imposed by India and enforced by agitating Madhesi parties in the central and eastern Tarai.Retired Assistant Secretary General at the UN and one of the most senior Nepalis in the international civil service, Kul Chandra Gautam , takes a retrospective look at events in Nepal's recent history leading up to this crisis in his book Lost in Transition: Rebuilding Nepal from the Maoist mayhem and mega earthquake. In a brilliant counter-narrative, Gautam destroys the dominant discourse that eulogises the Maoist war as a natural and inevitable uprising of the oppressed, arguing instead that the conflict cut short Nepal's march towards democracy and development.He argues that the Maoist movement used grievances of the oppressed and the marginalised to launch a power grab, and in doing so derailed democratic consolidation and state-building at a crucial point in our history -- pushing the country into a needless and ruinous war and disempowering the state. Gautam challenges the root causes theory for the Maoist war and argues that it was more an instrument for state capture than a genuine desire to liberate the oppressed who in reality have been the biggest victims of the violence More significantly, he argues that the Maoist war established political violence as a legitimate instrument to gain power and institutionalised the culture of impunity with repercussions far into the future. Indeed, in many ways, our current problems are tied to our uncritical acceptance of the use of violence by the Maoists and our inability to challenge them on their decision to bypass legal, constitutional and democratic means to achieve political goals and setting a dangerous precedent for other political groups. The Maoists chose to wage guerilla warfare against a young democracy that was only beginning to free itself from the shackles of an autocratic monarchy.At a time when the state should be building institutions, ours was embroiled in fighting an insurgency. In essence, that has been the story of the Nepali state post democracy: a continued fight for survival with domestic and external forces while never having the opportunity to consolidate and strengthen itself. This continued erosion of state capacity, abetted by glorification of destabilising forces, militant rhetoric and political adventurism is what is at the source of our problems. Moving forward from this mayhem, Gautam argues will require discarding all outdated, parochial and extremist ideologies, embracing democratic values and prioritising economic development , inclusion and good governance.This book is also notable for its strong and detailed criticism of the international community's role in Nepal's peace process, in particular its willingness to compromise on accepted principles of human rights, rule of law and democracy in Nepal to appease radical factions. Gautam fiercely criticises the internationals for coddling the Maoists and ethnic extremists, and for falling to their doublespeak.He describes how UNMIN misreported events in Nepal with its visible bias for the Maoists despite frequent breaches of the CPA, how UNMIN treated Maoists at par with the state while displaying a complete distrust of democratic parties. Gautam notes how Ian Martin and Karin Landgrin's disdain for NC and UML as 'thoroughly corrupt, Bahun-led, status-quoists parties' while considering Maoists to be the exception to the rule, reminded him of King Gyanendra and his father Mahendra's dislike for democratic parties, both of whom ended up suspending democracy and ruling as absolute monarchs.This book is a refreshing change from the established discourse on Nepal shaped by a narrow group of elite, English-speaking writers who fail to look beyond empty sloganeering and rhetoric. Their division of Nepalis into monolithic categories of us vs them, 'progressive' vs 'regressive', 'Pahades' vs 'Madhesis' and 'Hill Bahun Chettri' vs the 'rest' ignores the complex and contradictory realities of Nepali society. For international experts that parachute into Nepal, this is a convenient framework to work with, one that fits nicely with their worldviews, but does little to explain our issues, let alone find solutions. Gautam's book is a must-read for an understanding of contemporary Nepal without the dogma of radical posturing.Lost in Transition attempts to dig deeper and presents a more nuanced and sensible understanding of our problems with clear and detailed way-forwards. Despite the heaviness of the subject matter, it is a tremendously hopeful book, laying in concrete terms a roadmap with which Nepal can prosper and achieve stability. The epilogue discusses the Indian blockade and what Nepal can do to initiate negotiations and secure its interests against larger and hostile neighbours.What carries the book beyond its rigour is its sincerity and impassionate defense of democratic values and principles. With an earnestness that comes from his humble beginnings in Gulmi, Gautam speaks of an identity that binds all Nepalis, a pursuit of shared prosperity for themselves and their children. And it is this desire to leave a better Nepal behind for future generations",
      "The fight for the future – and the past – is heating up! Prepare to boldly go when no-one has gone before!\n\nFederation agents from the 31st century are conducting covert operations to find new recruits. They've gone back to the 23rd century, in the early days of Starfleet, to find likely candidates.\n\nFor a limited time, these captains can become special temporal agents, recruited to track down and disable probes seeded throughout the timeline by the Na'kuhl and their allies. 23rd Century Captains created since the launch of Agents of Yesterday on February 14 are already Temporal Agents in this new reward system. All objectives listed below have been kept track of on currently created characters. All 23rd Century captains created before April 4, 2017 will also be able to take part in this system.\n\nTemporal Agents will play through all of the usual story missions, but in many of them they'll uncover probes left by the Na'kuhl to gather intel or drop off equipment for enemy operatives. By completing puzzles, Temporal Agent captains can unlock those probes and disable them – and get great rewards in the process. In some cases, the interference of the Na'kuhl may result in new enemies or revelation of new secrets in these missions!\n\nIn addition to hunting down temporal probes, Temporal Agents will be able to use their special Temporal Transponder item to claim rewards for completing other tasks, such as finishing story arcs, gaining Reputations, completing Duty Officer commendations, finishing Admiralty campaigns, and learning Specialization skills. Unlocking these rewards will also earn rewards for other characters on your account, in addition to providing your Temporal Agent with new traits, gear, and bonus marks.\n\nTemporal Agent Rewards\n\nThe rewards for playing a new temporal recruit are many – and the tasks are those that many captains will complete as they play through the story arcs. Long-term dedication is also rewarded with new bonuses.\n\nFind Temporal Probes: Finding and disabling Na'kuhl temporal probes in various missions will award your Temporal Agent with a small box of Marks of your choice. Finding half of the temporal probes will additionally award you with the new Trait: Rapid Support, which reduces the cooldown time of your Engineering, Science, and Tactical Fleet Captain ability. Finding all of the probes will unlock an Improved version of the Rapid Support Trait.\n\nReach Rank of Admiral: At each new rank you'll gain a package of gear to enhance your space weapons, space equipment, space consoles, or ground equipment – your choice.\n\nSpecializations: Earn Specialization Points and spend them on skills in Specialization Trees – complete full trees to earn more credit. You'll earn experience boosts and special Temporal Agent Tech Upgrades, and upon completion of three full Specialization trees, you'll earn additional Tech Upgrades and all of your Improved Specialization Traits will be increased to Superior versions – giving you better abilities from Command Frequency (Command spec), Predictive Algorithms (Intel spec), Pedal to the Metal (Pilot spec), and Linear Progression (Temporal Operative spec) for all captains on your account!\n\nResearch & Development: Reaching level 1 in any R&D school grants you five R&D Duty Officers as well as a Rare Aegis Duty Officer. Reaching level 5 in any R&D school grants you a one-time boost of any school to level 10.\n\nPlay through Story Arcs: You'll gain packages of Fleet Marks, Dilithium, and Energy Credits for playing through each Story Arc, including everything through the Breen arc, as well as the Delta Quadrant arc, the Future Proof arc, and the new Yesterday's War arc. Finishing half of the Story Arcs unlocks the new Trait: Critical Systems, which grants a bonus to critical hit and critical severity for a short time after using any Emergency Power ability. Completing all of the Story Arcs grants an Improved version of this Trait for all characters on your account!\n\nAdmiralty: As you complete tiers of various Admiralty campaigns you'll gain bonus one-time ship cards and pass tokens. Reaching level 3 in three Admiralty campaigns will give you a bonus that permanently gives you extra experience earned from completion of Admiralty assignments for all captains on your account!\n\nReputations: Persevere in gaining Reputations and you'll gain bonus Energy Credits, Dilithium vouchers for use in Reputation Stores, and bonus Marks so that you can purchase the special gear offered by Reputations. When you reach rank 5 in all nine current reputations – Task Force Omega, Temporal Defense Initiative, Nukara Strikeforce, New Romulus, Dyson Joint Command, 8472 Counter-Command, Delta Alliance, Iconian Resistance, and Terran Task Force – your Reputation projects will be updated so that any project that awards special gear will now replace Mk XII very rare gear with Mk XIII ultra-rare",

      "Many Americans who do not use illegal \"drugs\" assume exemption from drug war policies. But regardless of how much marijuana you do or don't smoke, the U.S. war on drugs affects nearly everyone. While some prohibition tactics are more obvious than others, the drug war has slyly pushed its way into many corners of American life. Be it at the post office, in the workspace, or behind the counter at Walgreens, the war on drugs has established a nagging presence in the everyday lives of Americans, even those who do not get high illegally. We can no longer come down with a cold, for example, without the medication we take to treat it being tracked and monitored by the government. A national database collects information on every person who buys cold medication containing pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.\n\nWhether or not you are aware that the drug war is behind these creeping invasions, our drug policy has unequivocally curtailed basic civil rights and eviscerated the Fourth Amendment. And not coincidentally, many of the civil liberties erosions from the war on terror have their origin in the war on drugs. Here are six insidious and not so insidious ways the drug war invades and violates your right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\n\n1) The drug-testing dragnet ensnares millions of unsuspecting Americans each year.\n\nHave you ever been drug-tested to get a job? Chances are, you have. Now, over 80 percent of employers drug-test their workers and workers to be. And, if illicit drugs show up in the urine, they don't get the job. Or maybe the potential employee takes the opportunity to explain to his prospective employer why he's prescribed legal opiates like oxycodone and methadone or legal amphetamines like Adderall or medical marijuana. Now, the pre-employment pee test gives management unchecked power to discriminate against millions of workers based on their private health decisions. So long as employees are doing their jobs without issue, it's none of an employer's business which medications they're taking and why.\n\nMarijuana users are among the most vulnerable to failing drug tests because THC can be detected in the urine for up to a month. Alcohol and tobacco—two far more dangerous drugs than marijuana—are not subject to screening. And random, suspicionless drug testing is allowed in many workplaces. If you come up positive, it can be automatic grounds for discipline or termination, thanks to the Drug Free Workplace Act.\n\nPlus, peeing in a cup is degrading. Some employees are forced to strip naked and are monitored while they urinate to ensure that they can't switch and use another person's \"clean\" urine. To add insult to injury, drug test results aren't reliable, and commonly used test kits have false positives that range from 10 to 30 percent. In the meantime, you're out of a job.\n\nDrug testing has also invaded high schools. The Supreme Court upheld the right of public high schools to randomly drug-test students. Those who test positive for drugs are not allowed to participate in extracurricular activities and are kicked off their sports teams.\n\nThe unemployed have become new targets for drug testing. Laws in about 20 states already deny the unemployed benefits if they were fired for using drugs. As if that weren't discriminatory enough, there is a movement among conservatives to pass legislation to drug-test people claiming unemployment benefits. A \"chemical McCarthyism\" has been unleashed on those receiving welfare, job training assistance, food stamps and public housing.\n\n2) Carded at Walgreens.\n\nPharmacies used to sell cold and allergy medicines that contained pseudoephedrine over the counter. You could just grab that Sudafed or Theraflu and go. But that changed as a result of the passage of the Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, which was incorporated into the Patriot Act. The Drug Enforcement Administration whipped up a panic around the use of methamphetamines. Since then, any preparation that contains pseudoephedrine, the main chemical used to make meth, is kept behind the counter. It's sold in limited quantities and in order to purchase it the buyer must be 18 years old and show a photo ID.\n\nThe pharmacist enters the person's name, address, product name, quantity sold and the date and time of the sale into the computer. The name and initials of the pharmacist are also recorded. All this metadata is sent to and stored by the DEA for at least two years. Federal, state, local and municipal law enforcement personnel have access to the information, too. Yes, not only is Big Brother monitoring your phone calls and emails, he's tracking the medications you buy.\n\n3) The DEA registration number.\n\nAll physicians, nurse practioners, dentists and veterinarians have one. It costs $731. The number allows the DEA to track prescriptions that are written for controlled substances, mostly narcotics. Every",
      "The typically sedate college town of Charlottesville, Virginia, erupted in chaos on Saturday, as white supremacists clashed with counter-protesters in scenes often resembling all-out street brawls.\n\nFar-right extremists, some outfitted with Nazi SS-style helmets and armed with medieval shields and sticks, openly battled demonstrators, including members of anti-fascist, or Antifa, groups. In a horrific climax, a white supremacist allegedly plowed his vehicle into a group of peaceful demonstrators, killing one and injuring at least 19.\n\nThe attack capped a tumultuous day in which law enforcement allowed the violence to unfold largely unchecked, according to reporters and attendees from both factions. Although officials said they followed their plan to dispatch additional officers and first responders to Charlottesville, law enforcement experts not involved in the melee said police failed to conform to widely accepted best practices for dealing with tense protest environments.\n\nThis tactical breakdown began early on Saturday, as participants of the planned \"Unite the Right\" rally ― including members of neo-Nazi and KKK groups ― filed through the streets of downtown Charlottesville on their way to Emancipation Park, in the heart of the city. The park, a one-block town square formerly known as Lee Park, has become a rallying place for white supremacists protesting the planned removal of a statue memorializing Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee.\n\nMany police officers had already gathered in the square that morning, forming a barricade to break up the groups. That's a standard technique, said Darrel Stephens, executive director of the Major Cities Chiefs Police Association.\n\n\"In most protest [or] counter-protest situations, the police separate the groups with barriers and by enough distance so they can see and hear each other but not engage in violence,\" Stephens told HuffPost in an email.\n\nWhile many officers focused their efforts inside the park, others ― some fully outfitted in riot gear ― stood guard in full view of the violence mounting in the crowd outside. They stood idle, in apparent earshot of requests for them to \"do something,\" as white nationalists fought their way through throngs of counter-protesters toward the park.\n\n\"There was no police presence on the streets themselves,\" said Brittany Caine-Conley, chief organizer of Congregate Charlottesville, a clergy group dedicated to social justice. \"As the alt-right, Nazi groups began to march toward the park, they were often creating pockets of violence.\"\n\nCops need to step in. This is getting out of control. #Charlottesville pic.twitter.com/RpI8Y17eLZ — Christopher Mathias (@letsgomathias) August 12, 2017\n\nOfficers made little effort to break up the fights, instead remaining in phalanx formation around the barrier, said Caine-Conley.\n\n\"I even saw some of the police smiling while they were watching the brawls take place,\" she added.\n\nBefore noon, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe (D) declared a state of emergency, mobilizing additional state troopers and Virginia National Guard troops. Police announced the rally had been deemed an unlawful assembly, and threatened to arrest anyone who did not disperse. Protesters and counter-protesters fanned back out into the streets.\n\nNow, there was nothing to prevent open confrontations between the factions. White nationalists and counter-demonstrators tore through Charlottesville's historic downtown mall, many still carrying makeshift weapons, including large flagpoles and wooden signposts, which Stephens said are typically prohibited at protests.\n\nMayhem took over an otherwise pleasant sunny afternoon in the popular pedestrian thoroughfare.\n\n\"There were people just out enjoying a regular Saturday,\" said Kevin Cope, a research assistant professor at the University of Virginia School of Law, who was protesting the white nationalist rally. \"All of this just came together with the different groups going off in random directions, and at that point, it's hard to imagine how police could have been everywhere.\"\n\nThe inability of law enforcement to contain the situation wasn't due to a lack of manpower, said Cope.\n\n\"There was clearly a coordinated effort to get as many police officers out there as possible,\" he said. \"They had armored vehicles driving down the mall. They had probably hundreds of officers, some of whom were in riot gear, some of whom weren't, but they clearly had some sort of coordinated strategy.\"\n\nWhatever the strategy was, it didn't appear to work. During a volatile protest, it's critical that police work to keep factions separated, especially when violence is \"foreseeable,\" said former Charlottesville police Chief Tim Longo.\n\n\"Not only is it a generally accepted policing practice, it's a well-known policing practice ... when you know that you're going to have groups that are divergent or groups that have very opposite views, and there's the potential for violence,\" Longo told CNN on Monday.\n\nFormer Charlottesville police chief Tim Longo: Violence at rally was",
      "Abstract\n\nIn this article, we address the cosmic frequency of technological species. Recent advances in exoplanet studies provide strong constraints on all astrophysical terms in the Drake equation. Using these and modifying the form and intent of the Drake equation, we set a firm lower bound on the probability that one or more technological species have evolved anywhere and at any time in the history of the observable Universe. We find that as long as the probability that a habitable zone planet develops a technological species is larger than ∼10−24, humanity is not the only time technological intelligence has evolved.

      "President Trump's supporters in the media came out in full force this weekend, supporting the President after he called for the firing of NFL players who have chosen to raise awareness of racial injustice by kneeling during the national anthem.\n\n\"Don't give me this crap that you want to support reform and stand up against social injustice,\" snarled Judge Jeanine Pirro on her Fox News show Saturday evening. \"Shame on you. Shame on all of you. And shame on you too, Roger Goodell, for not showing you love this country as much as the president does.\"\n\nThat sentiment was shared widely in the pro-Trump media universe, where Trump was portrayed as a patriot taking the battle to wealthy athletes who were characterized as behaving in an un-American manner by refusing to stand for the \"Star Spangled Banner.\"\n\n\"What is it about the modern day @TheDemocrats party where they kneel during anthem, torch US flags and cheer cop killers?\" asked Jim Hoft, the publisher of the far-right Gateway Pundit, a blog trafficked by millions of people each month.\n\nWhat is it about the modern day @TheDemocrats party where they kneel during anthem, torch US flags and cheer cop killers? — Jim Hoft (@gatewaypundit) September 24, 2017\n\nPro-Trump media personalities also sought to suggest the decreased ratings for NFL games were tied to protests on the field. Ratings for NFL games are down, but not to the extent suggested by Trump and his allies.\n\nSean Hannity, perhaps Trump's most loyal supporter on cable news, did not call for a boycott, but tweeted on Saturday that NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell appeared to be lecturing Trump and his fans, warning, \"If @NFL and players choose to continue to make political statements (their right) I predict fans who disagree will flee (their right also).\"\n\nLooks like the @nflcommish wants to lecture @POTUS and fans who prefer football over political statements. How many people fought, bled..... — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) September 23, 2017\n\nIf @NFL and players choose to continue to make political statements (their right) I predict fans who disagree will flee (their right also) https://t.co/JzOoce0SUU — Sean Hannity (@seanhannity) September 23, 2017\n\nA column by Daniel Flynn published on the far-right website Breitbart echoed that point.\n\n\"If you want to see 'divisive' and a 'lack of respect,' turn on an NFL game and watch men making millions refuse to stand up for two minutes during the 'Star Spangled Banner.' Or, maybe, you opt not to do this,\" the Breitbart column said. \"Increasingly, that ranks as the popular choice.\"\n\nIn other corners of the web, Trump's supporters seemed to contend it was hypocritical for the NFL to allow players to express themselves on the field for one cause, but not another.\n\nOn \"The Donald\" subreddit, a forum where die-hard Trump supporters gather and from which narratives in the pro-Trump media universe are often birthed, a top post noted that the NFL did not permit the Dallas Cowboys to wear decals on their helmets supporting the Dallas police. The decals had aimed to pay tribute to the officers who lost their lives after a 2016 downtown shooting.\n\nTrump's supporters in media also got creative when trying to discredit the President's critics. In a bizarre \"Fox & Friends Weekend\" segment, host Pete Hegseth read the statement from the Golden State Warriors announcing the team would not be accepting the customary invite to the White House for winning the NBA championship and said, \"I mean, equality, diversity, and inclusion. It reads like a left-wing rap sheet.\"\n\nNewt Gingrich, who was being interviewed for the Fox News segment, added, \"First of all, didn't they just win a championship? What is equal about winning a championship?\"\n\nHegseth then asked, \"Are there women in the NBA? What about the WNBA? That's not equal.\"\n\nTrump and his allies are perhaps willing to engage in the debate over NFL protests because the position they have taken is popular with the base. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted in 2016 found that White Americans, who make up a large part of Trump's base, largely disapprove of national anthem protests.\n\nOn Sunday, in response to the President's inflammatory remarks, the protests on the field amplified. Many players took a knee ahead of the game between the Baltimore Ravens and Jacksonville Jaguars. The Pittsburgh Steelers were also remained in their locker room during the national anthem.",
      "AHMEDABAD: The BJP-ruled Palitana municipality in Bhavnagar has decided to follow the footsteps of Haridwar.The municipality authorities have decided to ban the sale of eggs and non-vegetarian food in the pilgrim town.During a meeting on Friday, the municipality passed a notification banning sale of non-veg food and eggs within the limits of the town.The ban was imposed following protests by Jain saints who threatened to self-immolate if the municipality did not adopt the resolution on the lines of Haridwar.Pravinbhai Gadhvi, president of nagar palika said that the ban was already there but this was only in the peripheries of the road leading to the Jain temples.It was in March that some Jain saints led by Maharaj Saheb Maitriprabhsagar had sat on a fast and later threatened to self-immolate themselves if the nagar palika did not ban the sale of non-veg food and eggs within the jurisdiction of the nagar palika.\"When we met the Jain saints they requested us to enforce the ban in the area which is in the jurisdiction of the nagar palika. The same was then cleared in the meeting on Friday.\"He said since the opposition Congress was against the decision, the nagar palika will have to gather public opinion.\"Palitana is an important pilgrim place for the Jain community. Jain monks were of the opinion that if Haridwar can have a law preventing sale of non-veg food and eggs, this pilgrim town can also follow suit. When saints threatened of self-immolation, the district administration and nagar palika assured to pass such a resolution.\"J L Dave, chief officer of the nagar palika, said, \"Since this was a policy decision, we will have to take objections of the public at large into consideration. Once that is done, the implementation will be done and the same will be sent to the government for final approval.

      "Monday, May 9th, I saw an article on the Montana Cowgirl Blog about Gianforte trying to sue our Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks , \" to get rid of a fishing access point that residents of Bozeman had used for almost 40 years to go fishing on the East Gallatin River.\" You know me, I am all about the Public Trust, so I started researching. After a little online research that night, I quickly found a Bozeman Chronicle news article from June 5, 2009, about the lawsuit, about 2 weeks after it was filed by Wittich Law Firm, P. C. (Art Wittich), but not yet served to FWP. In fact, according to internal FWP emails from that time, they didnt know anything about the filing until reporters began calling them asking questions. Makes you wonder what alerted the reporters? \"There are several other points to access the river in that area, said Art Wittich, the Bozeman attorney representing East Gallatin. So the easement is not necessary for public recreation needs, and, he said, his client's property is being harmed by public wear and tear. 'There's been damage to the property, and what they want to do is avoid that,' Wittich said. FWP has refused to terminate the easement and will fight the suit, said an attorney representing the agency, Becky Jakes Dockter. Because much of the East Gallatin River is flanked by steep banks, the Manley Road access plays a significant role in ensuring public access, she said. It's important to the department, and it's important to the public,' she said.\" Thank you FWP for standing up for the Public Trust! But, I was curious about the Complaint, so Tuesday, May 10th I went to the Clerk and Recorders office and bought a copy of the Complaint filed by the Gianfortes (linked below). Something caught my eye, Line 6. of the Complaint states, \"In 2008, one of the members of the LLC was informed that FWP claims an easement across the NW corner of the Parcel that allows for public access across the Parcel for recreational purposes.\" Understand, that the Gianfortes have owned this land for about 3 years, with the public accessing their easement all during that time, where there is a fence and this is the first time they found out about the easement? It was on the Certificate of Survey No. 1988, which was part of their land purchase documents and referred to each time they transferred the land to themselves, under various names over the years. In a recent article by Lee Enterprise Newspapers, Gianforte is quoted as saying, \"his family first learned of the state easement when they received a FWP letter in 2008 and subsequently discovered that the title company had missed it when preparing the deed for his family's purchase of the property.\" How can that be when the Certificate of Survey No. 1988 clearly shows the FWP Recreation Site Easement? 3 years after purchasing it and transferring it to themselves 2 more times? I contacted Security Title Company to see how they could have missed the easement when I got it less than 5 minutes after walking into the Gallatin County Courthouse. I have been playing phone tag with them today. So I went to the Courthouse Wednesday, May 11th, suspicious that the East Gallatin LLC was created after they had already owned the land and transferred it to themselves in 2008, which was the case. The article quoted Gianfortes as stating, \" the original easement boundaries remain and much of the misunderstanding had arisen from the agency thinking it extended farther south than a survey showed it actually did.\" Please note below, the 1993 FWP Easement stated, \"The dimensions & description are based on record information and they do not represent an actual field survey.\" An actual field survey was conducted 4 years later in 1997, 8 years before the Gianfortes bought the property. The documents and maps are all provided below so that you can see for yourselves the Gianforte efforts against our Public Lands/Water and Access in this matter. A legal easement that existed before the Gianfortes bought their land.",

      "Asian men are angry. They're angry that American society doesn't view them as powerful and attractive and all those signifiers we associate with masculinity. So they'll say or do anything to prove that they can objectify, demean, or rape a woman just as well as any other man can.\n\nI know this thanks to David Choe. I listened to the entire two hours of that torturous podcast where he admits to raping his masseuse, and realized that Choe is not quite your garden-variety \"edgy\" sexist. Instead, he's an Asian man who's so sensitive to emasculation that he overcompensates with misogyny. And he's not the only one.\n\nYou may ask what the stereotype of the emasculated Asian man is. It's that he is sexless, nerdy, timid, cursed with a small penis, and basically the embodiment of what we don't want in a man that we actually want to fuck. To give you some examples, I'm invoking the words of one Eddie Huang. Huang is the owner of Baohaus, a good East Village Taiwanese restaurant, and author of Fresh Off the Boat, a very good memoir that's becoming an ABC pilot. It's the first book I've read that's incisive about how shitty it can be to grow up Chinese amid white suburban sprawl, and to feature frank discussions about conformity, pressure, abuse and other heavy topics in Chinese culture.\n\nYet Fresh Off the Boat has a crucial blind spot, as this passage shows:\n\nOnce we had a debate about emasculated Asian men in Hollywood. Dr. Henton busted out a book called Screening the Asian Male and it made total sense, but the idea of the emasculated Asian wasn't new to me. My cousin Allen was the first to point it out to me one day when we were still kids:\n\n\"Yo, you notice Asian people never get any pussy in movies? Jet Li rescued Aliyah, no pussy! Chow Yun-Fat saves Mira Sorvino, no pussy. Chris Tucker gets mu-shu, but Jackie Chan? No pussy!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBy putting it this bluntly, Huang and his cousin nail how this trope harms Asian men. Yet with their wording, they reduce women and their pussies to trophies that they want a piece of too. I'm all for Asian men being seen as sexually desirable in action movies and other films, but with this quote, Huang is carving out space for emasculated Asian men to casually demean women. It's hard to see where the positive change lies in that.\n\nLater in the memoir, Huang describes his standup career, where his specialty seems to be making self-deprecating jokes about his race, including, apparently, about Asian women's asses: \"I talked about how Asian women had flat asses 'cause they were all drinkin' soy milk. 'How the fuck you gonna grow a bubble without whole milk, boo?' \" This type of humor has extended to the name of Huang's past menu items, which include names like \"Taiwanese Flat Booty Cake\" and \"Poke-Her Face Prawns.\"\n\nAs to his assessment of how Asian women actually felt about this joke: \"I hated seeing those crunchy-ass Asian women turn sour every time I told the soy milk joke.\" It doesn't occur to him that maybe it's not his right to get to decide what Asian women find funny, especially when it comes to jokes about their body parts. It also doesn't occur to him to try and forge a new path when it comes to Asian masculinity: subverting the stereotype while still respecting women. He's so desperate to be the provocateur that society has said that he can't be that he makes a hypocrite of himself, using women as props to achieve this end. It's therefore ironic that Huang later name drops Audre Lorde as influencing his outlook, when she was the one who pointed out that the master's tools won't dismantle the master's house.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThen there's JT Tran, or the Asian playboy, who wants to \"alter the perceptions of Asian men\" by teaching \"social change through pickup.\" The guiding principle, as taught in each class:\n\nBefore each student crosses the floor of that bare white cubicle in midtown, Tran asks him a question. \"What is good in life?\" Tran shouts. The student then replies, in the loudest, most emphatic voice he can muster: \"To crush my enemies, see them driven before me, and to hear the lamentation of their women—in my bed!\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis alpha male motto includes invasive pickup techniques like placing one's hands on a woman's shoulders and pivoting her around to face you (as more recently chronicled at The Awl), and \"attracting those women whose hair is the color of the midday sun and eyes are",
      "How do sign language interpreters show our values in our RID vote? Adam Bartley comments on the question of creating an Interpreter with Deaf Parents Member-at-Large position on the RID board, and the implications of a disengaged membership in determining the course of our profession.\n\nPart of my motivation in writing this article now is that I so poorly dropped the ball when the time came to vote on establishing a position on the RID Board of Directors that dedicated a seat to an Interpreter with Deaf Parents (IDP), the IDP MAL (Member-at-Large) position. I could cite my business at work, or the back pain and subsequent surgery as excuses, but the truth is I could have made time somewhere in there to attend to my business and vote! I failed to exercise my democratic power when the time came, and I failed in what I consider to be one of my personal and professional duties. I believed in the need for an 'IDP seat' already, having thought about the issues and arguments carefully, but by the time I got to putting my coins on the table, the hand was already dealt and done with.\n\nI know there will be another opportunity for our community to debate and vote again on this issue, so I am ante'ing up now for the next hand and putting my arguments here in the public sphere to contribute to our next shot at getting this right.\n\nThe Who\n\nBefore going further, I want to state that I address this letter from the perspective of a Hearing interpreter (I.e. not a Child of Deaf Adults, CODA), to all of my fellow Hearing interpreters. I welcome all members of our community, Deaf, CODA, and Hearing interpreters, Deaf and CODA consumers of sign language interpreting services, and anyone else to read and respond to this writing. However, I feel it important to state that I am directing this to my fellow Hearing interpreters.\n\nAny Position Will Do\n\nIn the interest of keeping my long-windedness at bay, let me begin by starting off with the seemingly strong and seemingly logical argument against having a dedicated IDP-MAL position on the RID Board of Directors. A CODA can always run for a position on the Board anyway! When I first saw this statement in discussions, it made sense and I had to 'chew the cud' as we say in the South, to figure out what bothered me about it. So chew I did and here is what I came up with. It is an absolutely true statement, but it is not an argument at all. It argues neither for a position nor against it.\n\nSo I chewed a little more, and I presumed that what was intended to be argued is that a need for the seat has not been shown. Having wrapped my slow but hopefully able wits around this nugget, I started to construct what arguments I could bring to bear to clearly establish that need and why it is important to the future of our field.\n\nRunning for Office\n\nThe first step in establishing a need for the position requires that we look at the assumptions underlying the \"IDP's can already run for office\" argument. The fact that a thing can happen, does not mean a thing will happen. Sheer numbers can greatly reduce the likelihood that a given thing will happen in fact. The United States of America could have a dozen Hmong Representatives in Congress, but the probability of that given the current populations and geographic positioning of Hmong people in the United States, is extremely low. Given the changing demographics of our field, IDP's are a shrinking minority within our ranks. The proliferation of Interpreter Training Programs and ASL as foreign language offerings in High Schools and Colleges has brought an influx of Hearing interpreters in greater numbers than ever before. Alex Jackson Nelson's article, Sign Language Interpreters: Recognizing & Analyzing Our Power & Privilege, offers some great insight on the need for practitioners to be aware of their privilege. In my mind, one demonstration that the need exists is because the math is against the continuous occupation of non-dedicated seats on the Board by Interpreters with Deaf Parents.\n\nAffinity is Not Membership\n\nAs Hearing interpreters, we will never be members of the Deaf Community in the same way as a Deaf person is, or in the still different way that a CODA is. I say this without prejudice, or any sense of rejection by the community. We exist within the scope of the larger Deaf Community and are accepted into the fold to varying degrees throughout our lives, but we do not share the same experiences. It is vital that we address and accept that as the simple truth that it is. Laurie Nash offers excellent perspective on the value IDP's bring to the profession in her interview with Brandon Arthur about the retraction of the referendum that would have established a designated position on the RID Board",

      "At CES today, Google announced Google Cast for audio, which lets you play back sound from apps directly to speakers, sound bars, and A/V receivers. Sony, LG, and HEOS by Denon will be the first to offer \"Google Cast Ready\" products this spring, Google says.\n\nThe feature will work just like Google's Chromecast streaming stick: Tap the \"cast\" button in an app on Android, iOS, or the web, and select a Google Cast-supported device. The speakers pull content directly from the cloud, not your device, \"so you'll get the best audio quality and can freely multi-task on your phone, tablet, or laptop, all without straining the battery,\" Tomer Shekel, Product Manager of Google Cast for audio, said in a statement.\n\nApps like Deezer, Google Play Music, iHeartRadio, NPR One, Pandora, Rdio, and TuneIn have already signed on, and the company is expecting \"many more\" to follow. Given that there are still a good few months before the spring, we expect there will be quite the list of supported apps at launch.\n\nGoogle Cast for audio uses the same technology that powers the Chromecast. By offering it directly in products made by audio manufacturers, however, the company makes sure it isn't the only one developing compatible hardware.\n\nGoogle is naturally promising additional Google Cast Ready products, saying that \"more brands\" will offer them \"later in 2015.\" The company has partnered with chip makers Broadcom and MediaTek, as well as system integrator Libre Wireless to pull off this latest entertainment push.\n\nThis is but a small piece of the overall ecosystem puzzle the company is trying to put together. With Chromecast becoming popular very quickly, Google is now looking to bring Cast into even more devices around the home, \"including televisions, game consoles, and set-top boxes with Android TV,\" Shekel promised.\n\nIt's naturally too early to say whether Google Cast for audio will take off, but at first glance it seems the company has taken the right first software and hardware steps to give it a strong start. The first Cast-supported products will likely launch during the first quarter of 2015.",

      "\"Mid June.\" That's the current target for the DROID Turbo to receive its Lollipop update, at least according to a Verizon device test engineer. The Big Red employee opened up on Google+ yesterday with an image of his own Turbo running Android 5.1, which is the version of Android expected to make its way to the current Verizon DROID flagship. He didn't just stop there, though. In fact, Jose Arturo, the Verizon engineer, talked about the reasons for the slowness, bugs they are currently working on, and where Motorola ranks when compared to Samsung and Apple in device verifications. He also tossed in news about potential features in upcoming Motorola phones that should excite many of you.\n\nArturo, in response to a number of people commenting about his Turbo update news, mentioned that the delays we are seeing in the latest smartphones are largely due to Verizon's nationwide HD Voice, VoLTE, and their use of band 4 LTE. Because Verizon wants to make sure that their HD Voice service is \"acceptable and does not impact voice quality,\" things seem to be taking longer than usual. They are continually dealing with the tricky transition between their 3G and LTE networks, adding patches from Qualcomm to help improve this, and also make sure phones are working properly on XLTE, which is band 4 LTE.\n\nThe slow rollout of the update also may be due to the fact that Motorola is \"small potatoes on budget\" when compared to competitors, like Samsung or Apple. According to Arturo, delays in software updates are often times the result of \"(lack of) funding for test verifications.\" If that's really the case, the ever-shrinking staff of Motorola and their transition to being a Lenovo company might indeed be the reason Motorola seems to be slower than ever with updates after a couple of years of being the fastest.\n\nOn a related note, in a post from Arturo from April, we may now know a couple of new features that Motorola is working on for its next Moto X. Randomly, this Verizon device test engineer mentioned in an Android community that Motorola is \"bring front facing flash for selfies\" and also plans to start including microSD slots again. I can't say that I ever asked for a company to include a front flash for selfie-hour, but we are always going to be fans of microSD slots, especially now that Samsung is moving away from them.\n\nArturo said to expect these features to arrive this summer.\n\nWell, then.\n\nUpdate: All of the posts we referenced have now been removed.",
      "In France, Marine Le Pen of the National Front says Russia is doing a better job in Syria than Europe. In Britain, UK Independence Party leader Nigel Farage appears on Russia's state-funded RT television channel, blaming the EU for the crisis in Ukraine. And members of Italy's Five Star Movement share blog articles about small-business owners suffering because of Russian sanctions.\n\nThe upstart political parties' messaging fits neatly into a pro-Russian narrative that, in recent months, has led experts and politicians to see a \"Trojan horse\" link between Europe's rising anti-establishment movements and Moscow's disinformation campaign. It's one they say is aimed at undermining trust in democratic institutions, weakening NATO, and shifting debates in Europe to benefit Russia.\n\nA recent study of 45 insurgent parties by the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR) found a majority sympathized with the Russian government's positions.\n\n\"What we are seeing now is a lot of backsliding on democratic values, democratic institutions, and media freedoms across the post-socialist space,\" Alina Polyakova, co-author of a new Atlantic Council report on the Kremlin's propaganda efforts in Western Europe, told Foreign Policy. \"A lot of those negative changes are being brought about by populist politicians who are often aligned with Russia.\"\n\nLong an issue in Eastern and Central Europe, Western European countries are just waking up to the scope of Russian propaganda and influence as election season in Germany and France looms. It has prompted new investigations into the mechanics of Kremlin strategy and stepped-up efforts to counter fake news and promote EU democratic principles.\n\nOn Wednesday, the European Parliament passed a strongly worded resolution responding both to Russian disinformation and Islamic State propaganda. The report outlined how Russia has intensified its propaganda efforts since annexing Crimea from Ukraine and called for more funding to support media freedom and education. It was approved amid loud dissenting voices from populist members of the parliament who warned that lumping Russia into a report that also deals with Islamist terrorists is \"hypocritical\" and may goad Moscow into renewed Cold War tensions.\n\nA headline from Tass, Russia's state-owned news agency, said the report showed \"liberal Europe's weakness.\" Russian President Vladimir Putin also weighed in, calling the resolution an example of \"political degradation\" of democracy in the West, according to RT. From Moscow's perspective, the West is engaged in its own version of information operations. Putin has often argued that Washington has sought to undermine governments in Ukraine and Georgia under the guise of democracy promotion programs.\n\n\"This report is insane. It fosters hysteria against Russia and neo-McCarthyism in Europe. It's a caricature of Russia,\" said parliamentarian Javier Couso Permuy of Spain's far-left Izquierda Unida coalition. He called for lifting sanctions and relaxing tensions with Russia.\n\nDespite a year where Russian hacking and troll factory-generated news served as a backdrop to the U.S. election, the links between authentic political conviction of Europe's populist parties and Moscow's influence are far from straightforward.\n\nExperts are quick to say it's mostly impossible to track the extent to which pro-Russian positions in Europe are directly shaped by the Kremlin. It is extremely difficult to trace foreign investments that sometimes go through obscure channels and offshore accounts. Additionally, many European policy stances that could benefit Moscow genuinely stem from historical geopolitical concerns and skepticism of U.S. intervention. They're also the result of legitimate criticisms of European dysfunction and the EU project.\n\n\"Russia has made the most out of it; benefited from it, [and] to a certain extent, is using it,\" said Fredrik Wesslau, the director of ECFR's Europe program. \"But it is not the cause of European populism.\"\n\nYet plenty of suspicious signals point to a symbiotic relationship. They include the discovery of an $11 million loan to France's National Front that was routed through the Moscow-based First Czech-Russian Bank in 2014 and trips to the Russian capital by high-ranking deputies from anti-establishment parties like Italy's Northern League and Five Star Movement.\n\nMany experts and European officials believe Russia is mainly exploiting the same democratic conventions that protect free speech to help amplify its view. Arguments first spotted on Sputnik, notorious for trafficking in distorted information and even outright lies, increasingly end up on political blogs and filter into mainstream arguments.\n\n\"You can say there's a certain zeitgeist right now,\" Mitchell Orenstein, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said at an Atlantic Council event this month. \"There are many people in Europe, as well as in the United States, who are certainly not being paid by the Kremlin and yet are taking pro-Russian stances on foreign policy.\"\n\n\"The danger is not only that there are agents of influence,\" Orenstein said. \"The danger is winning the hearts and minds of quite a lot of people in Europe.\"\n\nMoscow's narrative, analysts say, isn",
      "KFC's ongoing campaign featuring celebrity Colonel Sanders took a hilarious twist last night during the first integration on The Chris Gethard Show.\n\nDuring truTV's live, interactive talk show, Gethard noted that show correspondent and comedian Connor Ratliff had previously auditioned for Sanders last year, but did not win the part. So Ratliff donned a Colonel costume and reauditioned for the role, live. It doesn't go very well, even after Gethard advises him to \"chill out.\" Eventually, after his Colonel becomes amorous, Gethard cuts him off: \"Everyone's just real weirded out, man. No one's okay with that.\"\n\nRatliff recalled that while he was still in the room during last year's audition, \"I heard them say, 'this guy's pretty good, but I bet we can get someone famous.'\"\n\nHe made another on-air plea for the role with this sign, which was featured the bumper heading to a commercial break.\n\ntruTV\n\nFor its first integration on The Chris Gethard Show, truTV worked to develop a partnership that would be authentic to the show's voice, and incorporate the KFC brand message.\n\n\"We love doing bits that come from a real place. So we were very excited to get this one in the show,\" said showrunner and executive producer J.D. Amato. \"It was a treat for such a large national brand to give us the thumbs up to play with their world on our show, and my secret hope is that this leads to Connor Ratliff getting hired for an actual KFC commercial.\"\n\nDuring last night's show, Ratliff said he hasn't given up hope yet: \"If are there any KFC executives watching, I am available. … Please contact my representation.\" In fact, a few KFC execs were in the audience to oversee the integration.\n\n\"If are there any KFC executives watching, please contact my representation.\" - @ConnoRratliff #ChrisGethardShow pic.twitter.com/FJZjsnK9rb — Chris Gethard Show (@GethardShow) October 27, 2017\n\nSince Wieden + Kennedy won KFC back in 2015, the brand has moved through a rotating cast of actors playing the iconic role of Colonel Sanders, including Darrell Hammond, Norm McDonald, George Hamilton and Rob Lowe.

      "If you haven't noticed, belts have been disappearing from suits shown on runways and in your better class of fashion photo. And some tailoring traditionalists welcome their decline. \"A belt is for a pair of trousers that don't fit properly,\" said Alex Wilcox, owner of New York menswear shop Lord Willy's. \"It really symbolizes that the waist is too big.\" That's especially true, he added, when it comes to classic English tailoring, where custom-made trousers sit exactly where they're supposed to, rendering belts superfluous.\n\nNeed more convincing? Look no further than Cary Grant, that paragon of timeless men's style. He only ever wore a belt with blue jeans and believed that men should dispense with any accessory that doesn't perform a function. Ralph Auriemma, creative director of Paul Stuart, holds up Grant as a role model for the cinch-resistant, pointing to the actor's suit in \"North by Northwest,\" which, without a belt, looks perfectly modern today.\n\nThose who buck the buckle argue that beltless suits look cleaner and dressier. \"There's no cutoff at the waist,\" said Mr. Auriemma, \"which elongates the silhouette.\" That's why all of Paul Stuart's tailored clothing actively discourages belting. Rather than belt loops, trousers are equipped with D-ring-buckled side straps to allow for some adjusting. Even a gentleman's weight can yo-yo slightly.\n\nThe same is true of tailored suits from Lord Willy's, said Mr. Wilcox, where 90% of the customers prefer no belt. For the few who can't fathom forgoing one, loops can be added, unless the suit is three-piece. \"A belt looks terrible in that context; it breaks the flow of the fabric,\" he said. And for tuxedos? \"That's a no-no. I don't think a belt should be anywhere near a tuxedo.\"\n\nYes\n\n\"If I'm wearing brown suede shoes, I want a complementary, non-matching belt,\" said Jim Ockert, owner of California menswear shop Khaki's of Carmel. \"A belt tells a little more of a story.\" Though he does concede that current suit trends steer away from belts, he still sees a place for them. A belt, he argues, lets a man add more flavor to his look, especially given the scarcity of accessory options for menswear. And the iffiness of lapel carnations.\n\nNot to mention that belts can be very interesting when you open your mind to those beyond basic brown or black. There are all sorts of subtle color and leather variations—suede, alligator, ostrich and pebble grain to name a few. The key, said Mr. Ockert, is to avoid matching materials: \"If you're wearing brown suede shoes, don't wear a brown suede belt.\" Something in the same ballpark but not slavishly in sync looks more style-aware.\n\nBelts speak to a more Continental aesthetic, where accessorizing plays a bigger role. Jauntily folded pocket squares and more emphatic colors, not to mention the soft-shouldered silhouette of Italian tailoring, all tend to be simpatico with a belt. Unsurprisingly, belted suits stood tall during the 1980s, when the unstructured look of Giorgio Armani was at its zenith.\n\nAnd then, of course, there is the belt's functionality. Side tabs or back tabs on a tailored pair of trousers offer some scope for cinching but could never accommodate, say, the newly trim waistline of a man who finally achieved his New Year's resolution (hey, there's always a first). \"Side tabs are a great look, but it's a look,\" said Mr. Ockert. \"A belt is maximum versatility.\"",

Fancier menu items, like Alaska sockeye salmon and lobster tacos (as well as an updated cocktail list), are helping to draw the 18 to 24 set, who made the chain number one, according the survey.\n\n\nThe company's CEO is as baffled by the rise of the chain as we are: Kim Lodrup told Business Insider: \"It's particularly interesting, because we have not been explicitly targeting millennials. We've just been focusing on making improvements overall.\"",
      "On January 23, the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence joined a newly-birthed anti-suppressor campaign by arguing that quiet guns are deadlier than loud ones.\n\nThey made this argument on the same day that political science professor Robert Spitzer used a Washington Post op-ed to suggest suppressors could hinder \"potential victims\" from escaping a mass shooter and could prevent a hiker from \"being alerted to the presence of a hunter in the woods.\"\n\nThe Brady Campaign tweeted: \"[The] movement 2 make gun silencers easier 2 obtain ignores that gun shots are warnings to bystanders of potential danger.\"\n\nMovement 2 make gun silencers easier 2 obtain ignores that gun shots are warnings to bystanders of potential danger- https://t.co/mEe3BbnJ2L — Brady Campaign (@Bradybuzz) January 23, 2017\n\nThe tweet suggests suppressors makes the sound of gunfire disappear. But in reality, suppressors simply make the sound of gunfire manageable. You can still hear it, but the decibel level is lowered to a point that it does not hurt the ears, and this explains why the title of the suppressor deregulation legislation is the \"Hearing Protection Act.\"\n\nNevertheless, the Brady Campaign is in lockstep with other gun controllers who do not want to see government restrictions rescinded or reduced in favor of the Second Amendment. In fact, they want more and more gun control. For this reason, they rebuffed President Trump's offer of prayers for victims' families following the January 6 Ft. Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport attack by tweeting that they did not need prayers. Rather, they needed gun control.\n\nThe Brady Campaign tweeted:\n\nAWR Hawkins is the Second Amendment columnist for Breitbart News and host of \"Bullets with AWR Hawkins,\" a Breitbart News podcast.

      "Man, that's going to be so awkward when Titus Young shows up at Rams Park for training camp this summer.\n\nWait, you say, the Rams cut him. Indeed they did, but that news came relatively late to Young.

Everything he has in his luggage is a set of keys, a lone receiver's glove and a Calvin Johnson trading card marked up with red ink.\n\nIt's a pretty awful story really. I have no idea if a concussion made an obvious mental health issue worse. It probably didn't help, but Young had personality problems earlier in his career. The NFL does offer mental health services to its players (but not much in the way of long-term care for neurological disease).

      "Last week saw the premiere of, a quite icky horror film by Jeremy Gillespie and Steven Kostanski. In it, a small group of people are stuck in an empty hospital, in the middle of a forest. Hooded strangers kill anyone who tries to leave, while inside the building... \"things\" come alive. Michelle \"Izzy\" Galgana gave the film a positive review , and mentioned that the film was (directly and indirectly) inspired by the writings of H. P. Lovecraft. She is not the only one who noticed this: reviews may vary, but across the board almost everyone mentions Lovecraft, and in the comments sections, this is mostly seen as a good thing.But what does 'Lovecraftian' mean? People will lob the term at you whenever tentacles, elder gods and space monsters make an appearance, but the man sometimes wrote a mean ghost story as well. Often accused of racism and misogyny even beyond what was considered normal in the time he lived in, H. P. Lovecraft was a noted xenophobe, considered to have been literally afraid of everything which seemed 'different' to him. His talent was that he was able to translate this constant dread into words, and managed to convey these feelings through his stories.According to Lovecraft's fiction, we're all just blundering in the darkness, like blind mice in a lion's cage. The only reason we still exist is that we haven't accidentally bumped into something hungry, something that's a million times larger than us and hasn't noticed us yet. And scientists? They constantly try to turn on the light...So, with that in mind, what's the best 'Lovecraftian' film out there? It doesn't necessarily need to be an adapted story by him (or even horror for that matter...), but which titles get the atmosphere right?Chime in, in the comments below, and HAVE YOUR SAY!",
      "Former Vice President Joseph Biden is coming to Proctors on November 20 as part of a national tour in support of his forthcoming memoir \"Promise Me, Dad: A Year of Hope, Hardship, and Purpose.\"\n\n\"I have always been fortunate to have an incredible support system around me, and I understand how many people in this country go through far worse than I have, with far less support,\" Biden said in a press release for the tour. \"I hope my own story will strike a chord with other Americans who have walked the same path I have. I'm looking forward to talking with people all over the country on this book tour, not only about my experiences, but about how much we have in common, and what we can do together to continue to build on the great promise of America.\"\n\nThe tour is billed as a series of conversations that \"will will go beyond the 24-hour news cycle and 140-character arguments to connect friends and neighbors around the topics that matter most.\"\n\nBiden has made frequent visits to New York State as of late. He enjoys a close personal and professional relationship with Governor Andrew Cuomo, attending fundraisers for the governor's 2018 reelection campaign and backing the New York political leader on several proposals such as the Fight for $15 minimum wage hike, the family leave plan–which would give New Yorkers 12 weeks of paid leave to care for newborns or the sick and dying–and a $4 million infrastructure revitalization project at LaGuardia Airport.\n\nCuomo moved to act on the renovations after the vice president likened the airport to one travelers might pass through \"in a third world country.\"\n\nEarlier this year, he was honored by Cuomo for his work for the national non-profit HELP USA in support of military veterans and their families as well as his legislative record in the fight against domestic abuse. Biden's landmark Violence Against Women Act of 1994 garnered attention for bringing forth the first ever White House Advisor role to support and aid abuse victims.\n\nBiden has recently fueled speculation from his supporters concerning a 2020 presidential campaign, as has Cuomo. Both politicians have shot down such rumors. Biden has already run for president twice in his career, once in 1988 and again in 2008. While considering a run in the 2016 race, he soon bowed out following the devastating loss of his son Beau to brain cancer.\n\nBiden has spent nearly half of a century in political service to the United States. After an upset victory in 1972, he was elected the fifth-youngest senator in U.S. history at the age of 29–turning the Constitutionally-legal 30 during his campaign–and spent 36 years serving Delaware's Senate before Barack Obama chose him as his running mate during the 2008 presidential campaign. He is known for his role as a the loyal right-hand-man to the Democratic president as well as his ability to communicate efficiently across party and national lines.\n\nDuring his time in the White House, Biden was the resident go-to on foreign and economic policies. He advised on the conflicts in Ukraine, Iraq and Afghanistan and managed the administration's $787 billion stimulus package. Additionally, he was given 100% approval rating from the American Public Health Association (2007) for his stance on expanding public health policies and was key in the push for marriage equality and bipartisan outreach with the Republican party.\n\nIn January 2017, he was awarded the prestigious Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Obama for his service during their two terms. The former president called Biden \"the best vice president America's ever had,\" later adding, \"To know Joe Biden is to know love without pretense, service without self-regard, and to live life fully.\"\n\nTickets for the event will be available at www.proctors.org, by calling 346-6204 or at the Proctors box office, 432 State St., Schenectady. Prices range from $75 to $150. There is also a $300 meet-and-greet package.",
      "Exploring the beauties of Arctic Svalbard without tour\n\nFrom the moment I first heard about Svalbard I got captivated by the idea of travelling to the northernmost settlement in the world 1000km North from Norway and deep in the Arctic.\n\nAnd when I found out that the flights up there are dirt cheap, I booked my flight from Oslo beginning of September and made my adventure happen.\n\nThe only thing I knew about this place is that because of its remoteness it is far more expensive than Norway itself, and Norway is already one of the most expensive countries I've travelled. And it is said that there are more polar bears living in Svalbard than people. So because of that you are not allowed to leave the city without a rifle – or one of the way too expensive guided tours they offer.\n\nSo how did I manage to stay two weeks in Svalbard having a blast and hardly spending any money?\n\nThey have a camping site which closes the first week in September. But the good thing is that from then on you can camp there for free. Of course you also have to take care of yourself then on your own. So I said if I don't find a place to stay, I will pitch my tent at the camp site next to the airport and camp there for two weeks together with the polar bears.\n\nAnyway, I found a great host on CouchSurfing. Alex, a crazy Russian guy who said: \"Two weeks? No problem! You can stay with me.\"\n\nAnd then when I arrived at the airport I met another group of Russian tourists and we decided to walk to town together. I think it is the first time I walked all the way from an airport to town, all the 4km. 🙂\n\nAnd when in town I joined them to their hostel and had a little chat with Lena, the girl at the reception. She was a friendly girl from the Ukraine and she was easy to talk to. And when I found out she needed help with fixing her computer I offered her my help. It was some small issues which were fixed soon and when I was finished she came with two bags full of food and said: \"Here, that should be enough for two weeks in Svalbard.\"\n\nOne of the most amazing things if you go to Svalbard in Autumn is are the sunrises and the sunsets. In Svalbard I've seen the longest and some of the most beautiful sunsets ever! One evening I looked out of the windows and saw an amazing sunset painting the sky with beautiful colours. When I went out to watch it around 9pm it was already going on for an hour. And when I went to bed at 1am the sky was still reddish.\n\nThe next morning I got up at 4:40am to watch the sunrise and it was a blast! The sun was putting the whole bay in a pink tint.\n\nAnother day I embarked with one of the tour boats to Pyramiden, an abandoned Russian coal mining city. They offer day trips that go there and back, but I managed to get a really cheap one-way ticket since I was planning to stay there over night. Pyramiden was featured as one of the top ten most amazing ghost towns. Now it has five people living there and running a hotel for the tourists plus Sasha, the Russian tour guide.\n\nSince I heard about some cabins not far from town my plan was to spent two nights around Pyramiden and stay in the cabins. A friend gave me her signal pistol just in case I encounter some polar bears. I had to walk about an hour each day to the cabins and back again in the morning without a rifle. And although I thought the polar bears aren't as bad as everyone says and they just have a bad reputation, I wasn't feeling very safe. But I told myself I'm sure you can talk with them. 🙂\n\nSo I left from the hotel towards one of the cabins having my signal pistol holstered. I was quite nervous and I went like 'Oh, is this a polar bear!?', loaded the signal pistol, made a picture with my camera, zoomed in completely and 'Oh, it's just a rock!'.

      "From GoonsWithSpoons\n\n\nOriginally Posted by: Garaphin\n\nWelcome to my first food post on SA. I've been wanting to do this for quite some time now and today was the day... Allez Cuisine!!\n\nThis is actually a pretty simple recipe, although it does take a little bit of time. Believe me though it is worth it as nothing in the world satisfies hunger like a fresh, fried delicacy.\n\nIngredients\n\nFirst step is assemble the ingredients. You will need:\n\n- 2-3 carrots - Handfull of bean sprouts - Green onions (4-5 actual onions from the bunch) - 4-5 white mushrooms - 1/2 small can of bamboo shoots - 3 Cloves of garlic - 1/2 block of tofu (extra firm) - kosher salt - soy sauce - sake or rice wine - oil for stir frying - oil for deep frying - egg roll wrappers (available in the fresh section of most decent grocery stores)\n\n...and here they are!\n\nMethod\n\nFirst, matchstick the carrots. I use a mandolin slicer because it's fast and easy. I did nick my finger once on the damn thing though so be careful! (Screamed like a baby too!)\n\nNext, chop the mushrooms. Since they lose so much moisture cooking don't worry about chopping these too fine. (By the way, I hate mushrooms but like them in this dish. Go figure.)\n\nNow slice the green onions into pretty, little threads. This is by far the most tedious part of the process, but they add nice color and flavor so shut up and keep slicing.\n\nAt some point mince up that garlic. Basically we're just using this as an aromatic and to help flavor the oil for stir frying. Who doesn't love garlic? (You in the back. Put your hand down!)\n\nCut up the bamboo shoots into small slices as well. Basically the same size as the carrots. Since the kind I buy already come close to the right size this is pretty easy.\n\nFinally, crumble up half of the tofu block into something that resembles cottage cheese. If you don't think you need tofu, go ahead and skip this step... although I think it adds some nice body to the dish. Could substitute chicken, shrimp or pork I suppose...\n\nNow we're ready for some cooking! Get that wok hot , add the oil and fry that garlic for a couple of seconds.\n\nThen add all those meticulously chopped veggies all at once and stir fry for a couple of minutes.\n\nAdd about 2 tablespoons of soy sauce and a dash of sake to the delicious smelling mixture. Avoid the temptation to start eating this mix right now.\n\nAdd a good dash of salt to the mix.\n\nWhen it's all done cooking (don't over do it, just long enough to soften everything up and blend the flavors) empty the contents of your wok into a bowl and allow to cool on your countertop for a few minutes.\n\nBecause we're dealing with fresh vegetables here there might be some extra liquid at the bottom after all the stir frying. Feel free to drain off as you won't need it, or want it later on.\n\nNow onto the actual rolling of the rolls! Nimble fingers, thanks to years of playing Nintendo, are helpful here.\n\nFirst, the egg roll wrappers come in roughly 6 in x 6 in. sheets. Slice them in half on the diagonal.\n\nNext, using your fingers, grab a pinch of the vegetable mixture and place it in the middle of the wrapper like so:\n\nFold the bottom edge up and over the filling...\n\nBring in the sides....\n\nRoll up one more time and seal off the top edge with a little water on your finger. (Helps greatly if you use a half water / half cornstarch mixture for the sealant).\n\nNow place the finished, wrapped roll seam side down on a tray. You can also lightly flour it at this point to help keep it from sticking when frying.\n\nMeanwhile, have your deep frying apparatus handy. You can use either a actual gadget built for deep-frying or the same wok you used before (cleaned out obviously... oh, and make sure that it's stable and level. We are dealing with hot oil after all.) I've used both and got the same results. Can't tell you a temp on the oil... just nice and hot. Probably up around 300 degrees.\n\nNote my fiancee's excellent Cream Cheese wontons already ready to go in the fryer. Perhaps another thread?\n\nOk, so get to frying!\n\nCook until they're crispy and brown on the outside. Usually about 1 minute, 30 seconds or so... Remove from oil and drain on some paper towels.\n\nTa-da!!! Serve with some soy sauce for dipping or your Asian condiment of",
      "The UESPWiki – Your source for The Elder Scrolls since 1995\n\nMorihaus-Breath-of-Kyne Race Demigod Gender Male Resided in Cyrodiil\n\nMorihaus, also known as Morihaus-Breath-of-Kyne[1][2] or the \"First Breath of Man\", was a demigod[3] and early cultural hero of the Cyro-Nordics. Legend portrays him as the taker of the \"Citadel\" (the White-Gold Tower), an act of mythic times that established human control over the Nibenay Valley. He is often associated with the thu'um, and therefore with Kyne (or Kynareth to Imperial scholars).[4] He was the consort of Saint Alessia,[5] and wore the Lord's Mail, which is also known as the Armor of Morihaus.[6] He is accredited with fathering the first minotaur, Emperor Belharza.[7]\n\nMorihaus was, apparently, a winged man-bull. Several tales speak of the hoop ring he wore in his nose.[1][5] That the \"man-bull\" Morihaus was the son of Kyne is called a \"solid truth\", though when Alessia sought guidance from the \"Handmaiden\" (believed to be Mara), the Slave-Queen intoned, \"Morihaus, your son, mighty and snorting, gore-horned, winged, when next he flies down, let him bring us anger\". Legend also holds that Alessia flew atop him. He is said to have greeted the arrival of Pelinal Whitestrake with excited stomping and bellowing. When Morihaus was injured by a \"volley of bird beaks\", Pelinal carried \"the bull\" to a Nedic healer.[1]\n\nPelinal loved Morihaus greatly and treated him like family, calling him \"nephew\". While he was a great leader and fighter like Pelinal, Morihaus never fell to the madness which afflicted the elder warrior. In a rare piece of advice, Pelinal counseled Morihaus against pursuing his love for Alessia, saying, \"We are ada, Mor, and change things through love. We must take care lest we beget more monsters on this earth. If you do not desist, she will take to you, and you will transform all Cyrod if you do this.\" Morihaus rejected the advice as \"impossible\" to follow. After Pelinal was killed in his battle with Umaril the Unfeathered, Morihaus found his dismembered head, still able to talk, and the two had a conversation largely lost to history.[1]\n\nThe Adabal-a, one of the oldest written accounts from the First Era, is traditionally believed to be the memoirs of Morihaus. It includes all or part of Pelinal's final conversation with the \"winged-bull\". Morihaus chided his \"uncle\" for going beyond Alessia's counsel and getting himself killed, but predicted the \"blood-made-glorious\" warrior would come again. Pelinal warned Morihaus that Umaril still lived and would return. Morihaus out-lived his love Paravania, as he called Alessia,[5] who died in 1E 266.[8] When (or if) the demigod died is unknown.\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\nCherim's Heart of Anequina mentions that the famous artist Cherim created a tapestry depicting Morihaus and his army battling the Ayleids at the White-Gold Tower.\n\nmentions that the famous artist Cherim created a tapestry depicting Morihaus and his army battling the Ayleids at the White-Gold Tower.

      "NEW DELHI: The government could consider an anti-profiteering clause to ensure the benefits of the goods and services tax (GST) are passed on to consumers and prices don't spike once the levy is rolled out, Finance Minister Arun Jaitley said. The matter will have to be discussed in the GST Council if it comes up as a subject for debate, he said.\"We are still far from that kind of thinking,\" Jaitley told reporters on Thursday, a day after the Rajya Sabha approved the constitutional amendment that will pave the way for GST.\"If that thinking comes within the council, then we will have to consider it.\" The council will comprise representatives of the Centre and states and will decide on all critical aspects of GST, including the rate structure and relevant legislation. Malaysia , which adopted GST in 2015, introduced an anti-profiteering law besides intensifying enforcement through its National Pricing Council to protect consumers and ensure businesses didn't take undue advantage of the levy to charge more and make excessive profits.With some countries having seen a rise in inflation after switching over to GST, Malaysia has been treading with caution. Following the RS vote, the discussion has shifted to what the rate should be and whether it will be easy on the pocket.\"Some provision like the law brought in by Malaysia to ensure that profiteering does not take away the advantage of GST from consumers is needed,\" said SD Mazumder, former chairman of the Central Board of Excise and Customs ( CBEC ). \"Also, stringent monitoring would be required to ensure that the benefit of lower taxation is reaching the common man.\"Some don't think it's a good idea. \"This will entail detailed audit of financial data of companies and would lead to avoidable disputes,\" said Pratik Jain , partner and leader, indirect tax , PwC India. \"Instead, the government should focus on engaging with industry so that they understand the benefits of input credits and pass on the benefit to consumers.\"The government is hoping for an April 1 rollout, but much remains to be done before the levy can be implemented. GST will help end the cascading of taxes and possibly result in lower levies besides simplifying processes.Companies should be able to save on logistics, protect themselves better from imports and optimise operations, all of which should lead to reduced prices. In the long run, the tax rate will come down and with that, the price of many goods, Jaitley said.\"Currently, what the taxpayers are paying is phenomenally much higher,\" he said. \"For almost 60-70% of the commodities on a weighted average, you are paying 27% plus a large number of other small taxes. In some instances, states say it's even higher at 30-32% or more.\"The guiding principle laid out by the empowered committee of state finance ministers is that this rate has to come down, he said. \"It will gradually slide down, but even in the first instance it will come down. That's the clear intention that they have expressed.\" This will have to be married with the second intent — that states get enough money for their development.\"Developmental activities of states are also in larger public interest,\" he said. \"Curtailing them will certainly not help the common man. So a balance between the two will always have to be maintained by the GST Council,\" he said, arguing for a middle ground against the Congress view on keeping GST as low as possible to protect consumers. \"I think what you need is an optimum rate,\" Jaitley said.Asked about a possible rise in the levy on services when GST is in place, he said it would depend on two factors — the standard rate and what the GST Council will decide on service tax . There has been some discussion about having some key services at the threshold or lower rate and others at the standard rate.GST will have a three-slab structure with most goods and services at the standard rate in the middle. A lower rate will be imposed on essential items to protect the poor and a higher rate on luxury items.That's why successive governments have been gradually raising service tax. \"Because, one of the intentions was, besides revenueraising, that it should start converging towards the GST rate,\" he said. The minister pointed out that the previous government had raised it to 12% from 10%, then it had gone up to 14%, and with cesses added, it has become about 15%.\"So it has moved up…The difference between the rate and the possible rate which will eventually be fixed has relatively narrowed down,\" he said.",
      "Email Share +1 2K Shares\n\nSen. Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.) has joined other LGBT advocates in calling for administration action to ensure spousal veterans benefits flow to same-sex military couples across the country.\n\nOn Monday, the senior senator from New Hampshire made public a letter to Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald saying he should issue a moratorium allowing spousal benefits to flow to married same-sex couples in states that don't recognize their unions.\n\n\"Veterans with identical service records, disability ratings, and family size living in states that do not recognize same-sex marriage are receiving less than they are entitled,\" Shaheen writes. \"This clear inequity not only violates the spirit of the Court's decision in Windsor, it also offends the basic notions of equal protection.\"\n\nAfter the U.S. Supreme Court ruled against the Defense of Marriage Act in 2013, the Obama administration publicly aimed to extend federal spousal benefits to the greatest extent possible to same-sex couples regardless of their state of residence.\n\nHowever, the administration determined it couldn't afford certain spousal veterans benefits — as well as certain Social Security benefits — to same-sex couples if they live in non-marriage equality states, although the benefits are flowing to LGBT families in states where same-sex marriage is legal.\n\nTitle 38, the section of U.S. code that governs veterans benefits, looks to the state of residence, not the state of celebration, to determine whether a couple is married.\n\nAlthough the administration has developed a workaround for some benefits, it still won't afford others like ChampVA (health care for spouses of disabled veterans), higher disability compensation for disabled veterans with dependents, full access to VA home loans and many survivor benefits for widows.\n\nShaheen issues her call for a moratorium months before the Supreme Court is expected to make a decision on whether same-sex couples have a right to marry across the nation. A ruling in favor of gay nuptials nationwide would eliminate the problem by making the distinction of state of residence and state of celebration meaningless with respect to same-sex marriage.\n\nIn her letter, Shaheen draws on the story of Melissa Perkins-Fercha, a female service-disabled veteran who after serving five years in Iraq was forced to repay the VA for spousal benefits she received. Perkins-Fercha applied for them in her state of residence in Texas, which bans same-sex marriage.\n\n\"No one who has served our country in uniform should be denied the benefits they've earned because of whom they love or where they live,\" Shaheen said in a statement. \"The VA should immediately halt enforcing this discriminatory policy until the Supreme Court or Congress acts to end it.\"\n\nShaheen joins other LGBT advocates, including the Human Rights Campaign, who've said continuing to withhold veterans benefits to same-sex couples in non-marriage equality violates the spirit of the Supreme Court ruling against DOMA.\n\nIn October, Sen Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) wrote a letter to President Obama urging him to take administrative action ensure spousal Social Security and veterans benefits flow to married same-sex couples regardless of their state of residence.\n\nThe LGBT group Lambda Legal filed a lawsuit in August seeking spousal veterans benefits for married same-sex couples in states without marriage equality on behalf of the American Military Partner Association. The case is pending before the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.\n\nShaheen has introduced a bill known as the Charlie Morgan Act to legislatively fix the problem by changing the requirements for marriage recognition under Title 38.\n\nGenevieve Billia, a VA spokesperson, said the Shaheen letter is under review.\n\n\"The Department of Veterans Affairs is in receipt of the letter from Sen. Shaheen,\" Billia said. \"We will respond directly to the senator's office.\"",

For the rest of this development cycle we currently intend to only cherry-pick further fixes, which is the model that will be taken for updating the beta branch from here out.\n\nWe have no changelog for this update, but the final stable release will include a complete changelog for the 1.0 cycle.\n\nI expect that these incremental updates to betas will not be highly-publicized in the future as they will be regular occurrences and not worth creating release notes for individually, but as the process gets started and people are migrating to beta it seems prudent to attempt keep people informed for now.

      "Turkey recognizes it is no longer \"realistic\" to reach a solution to the conflict in Syria without President Bashar al-Assad (photo), a top Turkish official said on Friday.\n\n\"We have to be pragmatic, realistic. The facts on the ground have changed dramatically,\" Turkish Deputy Prime Minister Mehmet Simsek said at a panel on Syria and Iraq at the World Economic Forum (WEF) in Davos, Switzerland. \"Turkey can no longer insist on a settlement without Assad. It is not realistic.\"\n\nAs one of the main rebel backers, Turkey has long insisted al-Assad step down as part of any political solution to the nearly six-year civil war. But Ankara has refined its stance towards Syria in recent months, standing by as Aleppo fell to the regime and reconciling with the Syrian president's main backer Russia.\n\nTurkish military deaths\n\nAlso on Friday, the Turkish military said a bomb attack by the so-called \"Islamic State\" (IS) group killed five soldiers and wounded another nine. The deaths brought the total number of Turkish soldiers killed in Syria since August to 54.\n\nThe Turkish military intervened in northern Syria in August with the tacit approval of Russia in a bid to clear IS from its border and block the Kurdish YPG militia from connecting two of its enclaves. After making initial progress against IS, the Turkish military and the rebels it backs have been bogged down for about two months trying to dislodge IS from the strategic town of al-Bab.\n\nTurkish tank at the Syrian border last August\n\nAnkara and Moscow\n\nThe rapprochement between Ankara and Moscow paved the way for the two countries to broker a ceasefire ahead of talks on January 23 in the Kazakh capital Astana between opposition representatives and the regime.\n\nLast week, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman Ibrahim Kalin said a united and peaceful Syria was impossible with al-Assad remaining in power. \"But we will see how the Astana talks go, we want to go step by step at this point,\" he said.\n\nPrevious US and Russian backed Syria talks failed to advance over what, if any, role the Syrian president could play in a transition.\n\nTurkey's move towards Russia and shift in its position towards the president has come as it focuses on countering IS and the US-backed Kurdish YPG militia in northern Syria.\n\n\nPigeon Bazaar in Turkey Pigeon auction in the Turkish city of Sanliurfa A stream of men carrying cardboard boxes filled with pigeons heads to three tea-houses.

      "The total number of fatalities from auto accidents in California has fallen by 22 percent since the 2008 law banning hand-held cellphone use behind the wheel. This statistic comes courtesy of a study conducted by the Safe Transportation Research and Education Center (SafeTREC) at Berkeley, University of California, which has looked at records from two years before and two years after the law was passed. While the 22 percent drop is fairly conclusive, another statistic is even more convincing: the number of drivers killed on the road due to cellphone use has fallen by 47 percent. Fatal accidents while using a hands-free phone use saw a similar decrease.\n\nWhile the 47 percent drop is impressive, we're sure lawmakers will be looking to the remaining 53 percent, with the hefty $169 fine for first offenders obviously not presenting a big enough deterrent. Christopher J. Murphy, director for the California Office of Traffic Safety said that, while his office is thrilled that the ban has reduced distracted driving crashes, \"there are still far too many drivers talking and texting while driving.\" The stats will also be encouraging for Chapel Hill, NC, which plans to ban almost all cellphone use while driving on June 1st.",

      "Nearly one-quarter of all federal inmates are illegal immigrants and virtually all are in deportation proceedings or already face removal orders, according to a new Homeland Security report.\n\nThe Justice Department's Bureau of Prisons, fulfilling a presidential executive order requiring transparency on prisoner immigration status, said that it houses 187,855 inmates of which 42,034 are foreign born.\n\nThe DHS report said that only seven of those 42,034 have been granted deportation \"relief.\" According to DHS:\n\n19,749 (46.9 percent) are aliens who have received final orders of removal.\n\n21,121 (50.2 percent) are aliens who are under ICE investigation for possible removal.\n\n1,157 (2.8 percent) are aliens whose cases are pending adjudication before an Immigration Judge in the Executive Office of Immigration Review (EOIR).\n\n7 (.0002 percent) are aliens who have been granted relief.\n\nHomeland also said that the U.S. Marshal Service has a similar breakdown in its cells. Of 50,135 they've detained, 12,005 \"self-report\" as illegals. They are all in some type of deportation proceeding:\n\n\n9,857 (82.1 percent) are aliens who have received final orders of removal.\n\n2,047 (17.1 percent) are aliens whose cases are still pending adjudication before an immigration judge in the EOIR.\n\n101 (.8 percent) are aliens still pending adjudication (U.S. Immigrations and Customs Enforcement has charged these aliens as removal cases, but a final disposition has not yet been reached.)\n\nAccording to experts the percentage of prisoners who are illegal immigrants is down slightly, but still remain a significant population.\n\nJessica M. Vaughan, director of policy studies for the Center for Immigration Studies, said \"For a long time the number of non-citizens serving time in federal prison has been disproportionate to their share of the population. This is because a disproportionate number are border-related crimes, such as human smuggling and drug trafficking, and some are immigration offenders. These crimes are most often committed by citizens of other countries, and these numbers show why we need to control our borders.\"\n\nUnder Trump, she added, the percentage is likely to go higher.\n\nShe also said that the numbers show that illegal immigrants with criminal records need to go. Vaughan told Secrets:\n\n\"This does not mean that non-citizens are more criminal than Americans, but it does mean that they clearly are not less criminal, and that there are certain crimes that are more closely associated with non-citizens, and certain crimes that are taking place because we do not have a secure border. When we do, and when all criminal aliens are deported instead of released, then the proportion of non-citizens in federal prison will go down.\"\n\nPaul Bedard, the Washington Examiner's \"Washington Secrets\" columnist, can be contacted at pbedard@washingtonexaminer.com",
      "As the world said goodbye to Deacon Jones last week, Len Rohde recalled the time he said hello.\n\nThe longtime offensive 49ers lineman set the team record for most consecutive games played — a streak that began a week after he impressed coaches by holding his own in emergency duty against the Los Angeles Rams defensive terror.\n\nWhen right tackle Bob St. Clair suffered a season-ending Achilles tendon injury in the first half on Nov. 18, 1962, offensive line coach Bill Johnson looked down the sideline, reluctantly pondered his options and said: \"Rohde, get in there!\"\n\nThat's how Rohde came face to face with Jones, the man whose New York Times obituary described him as \"the pass-rushing defensive end who became a master of the sack and one of the NFL's greatest defensive players.\"\n\nJones was in just his second season in '62. But to Rohde, his talent was as obvious as a smack in the face.\n\n\"Deacon had this big head slap,\" Rohde, now 75, recalled in a phone interview. \"He had a really long reach, and he'd give you a hit on the helmet and knock you off balance. And once he had you off balance, he would try to get around you.\"\n\nJones died Monday in Anaheim Hills at age 74. During his 14 NFL seasons, the 6-foot-5, 270-pounder tormented opposing quarterbacks by racking up what everyone now calls \"sacks.\"\n\nRohde, whose 15-year career with the 49ers (1960-74) almost mirrored Jones' time in the NFL (1961-74) remembers him well. In fact, some memories still echo in his ears.\n\n\"Deacon had some gamesmanship about him. He was always talking,\" Rohde said. \"And if he got blocked, he'd automatically think it must be because you were holding, so he'd start screaming at the officials.\n\n\"You'd be thinking, 'Yeah, right.'\"\n\nRohde and Jones didn't match up often — they spent most of their careers on opposite sides — but that game in 1962 might have saved Rohde's career.\n\nHe'd been drafted as a two-way player from Utah State in the fifth round of the 1960 draft but had a hard time finding his niche in San Francisco. Rohde played some backup tackle here and there but felt more comfortable whenever he lined up as the right defensive end.\n\nAfter Rohde had a strong '62 preseason on defense, the 49ers started him on defense in the season opener. He promptly spent the day missing tackles and blowing assignments in a 30-14 loss to the Chicago Bears. By the time Rohde showed up for practice Monday, coach Red Hickey told him he was going back to offense.\n\n\"I figured it was all over, my career was over,\" Rohde said in the 2007 book \"The Game of My Life: San Francisco 49ers\" by former San Jose Mercury News sports writer Dennis Georgatos. \"I mean, how many opportunities to you get? I knew I had been struggling on offense, so I didn't think I had a chance. I was about as low as you could go …\n\n\"At that point, I figured I'd wait out the season and if the 49ers didn't want me, (I'd go) play defense for somebody somewhere. I knew I could rush the passer.\"\n\nInstead, his career changed because of how he played against Deacon Jones. After St. Clair went down with his injury, Rohde jumped in for the second half with the goal of just getting through the game without getting completely run over. He \"played respectably\" (his words) and helped the 49ers hold on for a 24-17 win.\n\nLooking back, Rohde noted that Jones, too, was just a young player trying to establish himself. Jones was a 14th-round draft pick in his second year and still two seasons away from his first Pro Bowl selection.\n\nRohde, though, got a sense of what was to come.\n\n\"Deacon was quick. He was real quick and you had to be ready to react to what he was doing because he had a great outside move,\" Rohde said.\n\nImpressed, the 49ers coaches used Rohde as the starting right tackle the following week against St. Louis. Rhode would remain entrenched in the lineup for the next 13 years, mostly at left tackle, playing a 49ers record 208 consecutive games.\n\nThe mark has stood since Rhode's retirement after the 1974 season. (Long snapper Brian Jennings is also at 208 in a row entering the 2013 season.)\n\nAfter retirement, Rohde entered the restaurant business. At one point, he owned nine Burger Kings and six Applebees. These days, the Illinois native has returned to his farming roots to create Templeton Olive Oil from his ranch near",

      "Tomorrow, the United Kingdom will vote on whether to leave the European Union or to remain a member. This historic ballot could fundamentally shape Britain's future — and that of Europe as a whole. Two unholy alliances have driven mainstream debate on the referendum. The Remain forces are dominated by the Britain Stronger in Europe coalition, which comprises a substantial chunk of the Conservative Party cohering around David Cameron and George Osborne, together with much of the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats, and the Greens. Leading sections of British capital also back Remain. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has come out clearly for Remain. But he has wisely kept his distance from the Tory-dominated coalition — his support is widely seen to be lukewarm, at best. Figures from Labour's center and right have been most actively involved — and have looked the most comfortable — in the \"Stronger In\" campaign. The Vote Leave campaign, led by figures from the Eurosceptic hard right of the Tories such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, dominates the other side. Nearly half of Tory members of parliament (MPs) and probably the large majority of its activist and membership base also support Brexit. They are working with a smattering of Labour politicians and big business backers to promote the Leave vote. The right-wing UK Independence Party (UKIP) is also involved in Vote Leave. But its leader, Nigel Farage — jockeying for position on the British right with his Tory rivals — is more closely associated with the competing Leave.EU campaign. (There does seem to have been some rapprochement between the two campaigns — and between Farage and Johnson in particular — recently.) Right-wing forces are leading both sides of the Brexit debate, and thus the debate's terms pivot on a largely neoliberal terrain: economic issues, like trade and investment, situated almost entirely in terms of what's best for big capital. Leave's exaggerated claims about EU laws superseding \"our own\" often raises the issue of British \"sovereignty.\" They have pitched this issue in terms of border control — and indeed, immigration more and more dominates the referendum debate. Although Leave made immigration the centerpiece of its campaign, the Remain camp has certainly helped. The mainstream Remain boosters are desperate to avoid appearing too soft on migration. But Leave's focus on immigration has been relentless, plumbing new depths last Thursday with the release of a UKIP campaign poster that many compared to Nazi propaganda. In a terrible coincidence, the launch of this poster — clearly designed to whip up xenophobic hatred — came only a few hours before the brutal killing of Labour MP and Remain supporter Jo Cox. Many commentators have connected the murder to the divisive, anti-immigrant, and nationalist tenor of recent British political discourse. The suspect has links with the far right, and gave his name in court as \"death to traitors, freedom for Britain.\" These are dark times in British politics. But even though neoliberals and the Right control the mainstream debate, left-wing Remain and Leave campaigns are also being fought — though sadly both are marginal. The Left Exit (Lexit) campaign — an alliance between the Socialist Workers Party and other small revolutionary groups — argues that withdrawal from the pro-austerity, anti-democratic \"bosses' club\" of the European Union would represent a serious blow to the interests of dominant sections of the British capital, and to European elites as well. It would also weaken David Cameron's government, opening up opportunities for workers' struggle in the United Kingdom. Lexit's radical counterpart is the Another Europe is Possible (AEiP) campaign. The collection of left forces — which include Momentum, the activist organization of mostly young Labour Party members set up to support Corbyn — promote a radical, internationalist vision of a Europe-wide left movement that could democratize and transform EU structures from within.\n\nAnother Europe? Though I'm sympathetic to AEiP, I'm not particularly convinced that it could accomplish what it promises. For one thing, the coalition tends to downplay the EU's close ties to national and trans-national capitalist accumulation imperatives. Among other things, the EU is where these imperatives are transformed into coherent strategies to organize and embed the hegemony of dominant sections of European capital. This is why it has become one of the main vectors for the imposition of neoliberal and austerity measures across the continent. The AEiP approach tends to miss, too, how the European Union manifests and expresses the unequal power dynamics between member states. In addition, they overlook how EU institutions are relatively insulated from popular pressures in a way that national states cannot be if they are to maintain their legitimacy. The unelected European Commission wields huge power, and the virtually ornamental European Parliament — and indeed the absence of a European demos to speak of — cannot balance it. Also, the European Union might function, partially, to bolster national state legitimacy: the union takes responsibility for neoliberal reforms \"imposed from without\" that state elites — who helped draw up the measures in the first place — can then disavow. Finally, the pro-Rem",

      "Financial institutions have shown a keen interest in the concept of distributed ledger technology, and some countries have even taken the plunge of creating their own national digital currencies. While digitizing fiat currency may seem clear as day to same, it could pose a major threat to the business model of commercial banks. Bank of England is rethinking their plans with blockchain technology for the time being, as all of the risks need to be weighed carefully, especially where the central bank role is concerned\n\nAlso read: Japan Set To Reconsider Stance on Taxing Bitcoin\n\nBank of England Does Not Get Overexcited Yet\n\nAt a time during which financial innovation will mean the demise or survival of many banks in the coming years, rushed decisions are the last thing anyone needs. Blockchain technology, which presents distributed ledgers t decentralize a lot of aspects associated with finance, is a powerful tool that can be wielded by anyone in the world. But without proper understanding of what this technology can do, there are a lot of potential doom scenarios to keep in mind.\n\nThe Bank of England is one of those financial players keeping close tabs on the progress being made regarding distributed ledger technology. But at the same time, they keep their feet planted firmly on the ground, rather than getting carried away by the concept of creating national digital currencies.\n\nPrivate blockchains, which is how banks would wield distributed blockchain technology, could very well lead to competitive threats from commercial and challenger banks. After all, the funding of other banks and the supply of credit lines is handled by the central bank as well. At this time, it remains unclear what role distributed ledger technology would play in that regard, yet it could put banking competitors out of business completely.\n\nThere are tough times for central bankers, as they are trying to figure out how to keep up with the evolution of finance. Bitcoin, FinTech, mobile, and peer-to-peer solutions are all bringing direct competition to the business model of central banks around the world. A private blockchain would give central banks even more power than ever before, as they will decide who gets access to their balance sheet and who doesn't.\n\nBitcoin, the most popular modern digital currency is existence today, has shown how distributed ledger technology can create a financial ecosystem accessible to all. Additionally, everyone can see the total supply of bitcoins – which has a limited supply cap, whereas fiat currency is subject to inflation – and transactions are publicly broadcasted in real-time. Central banks will never adopt this same business model, as they don't want other banks to figure out where the money is coming from and flowing to.\n\nCentral Bank Digital Currencies Are Dangerous\n\nIt is impossible to predict the global effect of central bank digital currencies right now, yet the concept can create very dangerous precedents. A lot will depend on how these central bank digital currencies are designed, and how accessible they will be to consumers and other banks. Will they replace the current units of account, will they run in parallel, or is there another strategy at play?\n\nAssuming these creations would ever see the light of day, it will be entirely controlled by the central banks. They can opt to make bank lending more expensive or scarcer, and there is nothing anyone can do about it. This would, in turn, have a big effect on the global economy, which remains on very wobbly legs since the recent financial crisis. However, there is also a chance the central bank will use digital currency in a \"positive\" manner, and reduce the demand for physical cash altogether.\n\nSource: Daily News",
      "click to enlarge PROVIDED IMAGE\n\nA local partnership proposes a minimum 14-story glass-and-steel structure for Midtown, with condos, restaurant, performing arts center, hotel, and other amenities.\n\nUnderwhelmed by the available options and, he says, determined to give Rochester a real choice, Fraser Smillie sat down at his computer to brainstorm a new concept for Parcel 5 at Midtown in downtown Rochester (see proposal below).What he and Bud DeWolff, owner of DeWolff Partnership Architects, came up with is a statement building: a minimum 14-story glass-and-steel structure with a hotel, offices, restaurant, 3,000-seat performing arts center, housing, and other amenities.An optics museum to showcase Rochester's rich imaging history as well as its future in photonics is another possibility, says Smillie, who's retired from Xerox, where he did marketing.\"Is it a final plan? No,\" he says. \"It's just a plan to say that there are other options available. I think what we have done is sort of stir the pot a little bit by saying, 'Here's another chance to do something right.'\"Smillie puts the price tag at about $150 million and says that he potentially has a group of interested investors. But investors are reluctant to commit unless the City of Rochester shows it is taking the proposal seriously, he says.That may be a sticking point; the deadline to submit proposals is long past. But in an unusual but not unprecedented move, City Council members say that they will interview the developers behind each Parcel 5 proposal. Council member Carolee Conklin said in today's Democrat and Chronicle that she's willing to include the Smillie-DeWolff proposal in that process.The traditional route is for the mayor to choose a proposal and then send the recommendation to City Council for approval.The other proposals are: a 14-story mixed-use tower; performing arts center; and green space for concerts and other public uses.Smillie says those proposals are really not \"choices.\" The city will undoubtedly choose the mixed-use proposal, put forth by Gallina Development, he says. Now the city will have a real choice, he says.\"Here we have an opportunity do something really neat, and Bud came up with a great-looking building,\" Smillie says.\n\n2016 10-24 City Centre Complex by Scott Fien on Scribd",
      "Donald Trump and his father, Fred, in 1973 at Trump Village, Fred's last project, in Queens. Donald was an apprentice to his father at the time. (Barton Silverman/The New York Times/Redux)\n\nNEW YORK — When a black woman asked to rent an apartment in a Brooklyn complex managed by Donald Trump's real estate company, she said she was told that nothing was available. A short time later, a white woman who made the same request was invited to choose between two available apartments.\n\nThe two would-be renters on that July 1972 day were actually undercover \"testers\" for a ­government-sanctioned investigation to determine whether Trump Management Inc. discriminated against minorities seeking housing at properties across Brooklyn and Queens.\n\nFederal investigators also gathered evidence. Trump employees had secretly marked the applications of minorities with codes, such as \"No. 9\" and \"C\" for \"colored,\" according to government interview accounts filed in federal court. The employees allegedly directed blacks and Puerto Ricans away from buildings with mostly white tenants, and steered them toward properties that had many minorities, the government filings alleged.\n\nIn October 1973, the Justice Department filed a civil rights case that accused the Trump firm, whose complexes contained 14,000 apartments, of violating the Fair Housing Act of 1968.\n\nThe case, one of the biggest federal housing discrimination suits to be brought during that time, put a spotlight on the family empire led by its 27-year-old president, Donald Trump, and his father, Fred Trump, the chairman, who had begun building houses and apartments in the 1930s. The younger Trump demonstrated the brash, combative style that would make him famous, holding forth at a news conference in a Manhattan hotel to decry the government's arguments as \"such outrageous lies.\" He would also say that the company wanted to avoid renting apartments to welfare recipients of any color but never discriminated based on race.\n\nThe Trumps retained Roy Cohn, a defense attorney who two decades earlier had been a top aide to Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) during his infamous effort to root out communists in government. Cohn portrayed the Trumps as the victims and counter-sued the government, demanding it pay them $100 million for falsely accusing them of discrimination.\n\n\n(Tear sheet from U.S. v Fred Trump complaint from October 1973. )\n\nFor Trump, whose statements as a presidential candidate about Mexican immigrants, women and Muslims have drawn charges of racism and sexism, his role as a defendant in a discrimination case put him near the center of a civil rights-era struggle over society's changing views about race and culture. The 20-month legal battle marked the first time Trump became a regular presence on newspaper front pages. It served as an early look at the hardball tactics he has employed in business and, more recently, in politics. And its resolution showed how Trump, even in the heat of battle, is often willing to strike a deal.\n\nThis account is based on a review of more than 1,000 pages of court records, including hearing transcripts and affidavits that have received little attention in the decades since the case, as well as interviews with people involved in the case.\n\nAspects of the case were reported at the time, and other details, such as the racial coding allegations, gained notice in a Aspects of the case were reported at the time, and other details, such as the racial coding allegations, gained notice in a 1979 Village Voice investigation and more recently in a Daily Beast story\n\nTrump declined to be interviewed. His attorney, Alan Garten, said via email that there was \"absolutely no merit to the allegations.\"\n\n\"This suit was brought as part of a nationwide inquiry against a number of companies, and the matter was ultimately settled without any finding of liability and without any admission of wrongdoing whatsoever,\" Garten said.\n\nTargeting the Trumps\n\nDonald Trump's ascent in his family's business, after his 1968 graduation from business school, came as allegations of race discrimination were mounting against landlords across New York City. Housing bias had become a major policy issue in Congress.\n\nMany whites were relocating to the suburbs, and minorities often moved in to rent or buy properties. Concern about the issue peaked following race riots that broke out across the country after the assassination of the Rev.

      "What's the hardest language in the world?\nOf the six thousand languages of the world, which is the most difficult for an English-speaker to learn? It's a question I've long asked myself. Part of the reason I'm so fascinated by the question is that other linguists and enthusiasts do such a poor job of answering the question. Some hide behind question-retorts like, \"Well, what do you mean by hardest?\" or \"What's the criteria for hardest?\" While those questions are important, they also kill the fun by ending the conversation in a long-winded explanation that all languages are equal in content delivery. Yes, I think to myself, but that doesn't mean that the underlying structures of delivery are equally apprehensible by an English speaker. So for this blog post and perhaps other posts to come, I will explore what I believe are the hardest languages to learn for a native English speaker. Previous attempts tend to focus on politically important languages: Japanese, Polish, Mandarin, Hungarian. Languages that are widely spoken and are globally important. Sure, Mandarin has a nightmarish writing system and Japanese has a painful content delivery system, but what about Northeast Caucasian languages that have an enormous inventory of phonemes and a fearsome system of vowel harmonies. Japanese and Mandarin are discussed because people bother to learn them. I intend to consider all languages. This, of course, unfortunately means that many hundreds of qualified candidates will be overlooked because there is simply too little information or (more likely) I haven't read more than a sentence or so about them. My apologies in advance. If you know a good language to consider, please let me know in the comments. A handful of other very considerably difficult tongues must be skipped because our knowledge of the language is incomplete. From what we know of Hurrian and Sumerian, they are frustrating ancient languages, worthy of any list like mine. But our knowledge of the languages is grossly incomplete and therefore I condemn the tongues to the soil. Sorry, guys! Today's candidate for most difficult language is an old favorite: Basque Basque is a language isolate spoken by ~300,000 people in northern Spain and the far western reaches of France. It is part of a category of Paleo-European languages that are unrelated. Paleo-European languages are languages that were spoken before the invasion of Indo-European and Uralic tongues. The Germanic languages like English and German; the Italic languages like Spanish and French; the Uralic languages like Finnish and Hungarian; Balto-Slavic languages like Russian, have all done a very good job at eliminating all the old tribal languages that were once spoken thousands of years ago. Among all of the ancients, only Basque survives. It is unrelated to any other language on earth, though we know a related dialect of Basque called Aquitaine existed during the time of Julius Caesar. So why is it so difficult? 1. Ergativity Basque a completely ergative language, in fact it is the only totally ergative language in the world. All other ergative languages are actually \"split-ergative,\" able to state things in either ergative or nominative cases, dependent on tense, structure, or class. What's an ergative sentence? It's where a subject \"behaves\" like an object. Wikipedia has a good example . While in English we can say \"I moved her\" or \"she moved,\" ergative speakers would have to say the equivalent to \"I moved her\" or \"her moved.\" But a better example might come from a short list of ergative verbs that exist in English. The verb to break is an ergative verb in English. \"The window breaks.\"   \"The window breaks me.\"  Note that the verb breaks  is not behaving the same in both examples. In the first, the window receives the action because the verb is behaving ergatively. Compare the same structure but with a non-ergative verb. \"She loves.\" \"She loves me.\" In this example, the woman is doing the 'loving' in both sentences. Unlike the window that breaks, the woman directs her love to an object, regardless of whether the object is named or not. By placing 'me' at the end of a verb, we can quickly hear that the verb is ergative. \"The window breaks me\" sounds very funny and it should be \"I break the window\" (but not \"I break\"). Most verbs in English are not ergative. 2. Those damn cases Cases are markings at the beginnings, middles, or ends of nouns that signify meaning. English has a few cases, most notably the genitive case, indicated by - s. In English, all cases can be replaced with a preposition or a postposition. \"Flannery's house,\" a sentence with the genitive -s , can just as easily be read \"The house of Flannery\" where the of  contains the meaning of the case marker - s .",
      "Is this what the loss of net neutrality will bring? A reader on Silicon Valley Watcher left this tip:\n\nI use Cox cable internet, Cox's media empire printed classifieds is one of their big revenue drivers. Guess what? If you try to access Craigslist over Cox Cable internet... its nearly impossible! It appears that they throttle access to craigslist - as a matter of fact there have been a zillion complaints but hey, who can blame Cox? They're trying to stop the opening cap in their money dam! Maybe you should investigate this tip further. Cheers\n\nI did investigate further, I walked out of my apartment and across Alamo Square and popped in on Jim Buckmaster, the CEO of Craigslist. Jim was just getting back from work and I spoke with Susan Best, publicist for Craigslist. Susan said they have known about the problem with Cox.\n\nJim soon arrived and said the problem of access had been going on since late February. It had something to do with the security software that Cox isusing from a company called Authentium. Cox has been collaborating with Authentium since April 2005 to develop the security software suite.\n\nBack on February 23rd Authentium acknowledged that their software is blocking Craigslist but it still hasn't fixed the problem, more than three months later. That's a heck of long time to delete some text from their blacklist. (UPDATE: I assumed there was a blacklist-I have no idea how Craigslist is being blocked but Authentium admits its software has blocked Craigslist.) And this company also supplies security software to other large ISPs.\n\nCraigslist has approached Authentium several times to get it to stop blocking access by Cox internet users but it has been unresponsive.\n\nJim wasn't aware that Cox had its own classified ads service. \"That changes things, \" he said.\n\nThis situation does not look good in the context of the net neutrality debate. This is exactly the kind of scenario that many people are concerned about, that the cable companies and the telcos will make it difficult for their internet users to access competing services.\n\nHere are Craigslists' system reports: If you scroll down you can see the Cox problem, and there are quite a few problems with others too: email with SBC, and also with Yahoo and BT Internet. Are those problems also related to the telcos using software that discriminates against Craigslist?\n\nSome more related links:\n\nFrom Newspapers and Technology: Cox papers adding interactive features to classifieds Sept 2005\n\nAlso, take a look at this story about Cox refusing to run AP video. Is it fighting for open standards or is it fighting off a competitor with a poor revenue split? From Mark Glaser's MediaShift: Cox Newspapers Says No to AP Video\n\nAre the telcos funding an online campaign against net neutrality? Take a look at this recent post from Mark Glaser's MediaShift: Bloggers Must Be Vigilant Against Astroturf Comments\n\nHere is the Cox Communications site, it's called Safe is Beautiful(!)\n\nHere is a video sent to me by Stefano Boscutti: SAVE THE INTERNET\n\nIs it too late?",
      "Lyons is currently in the middle of writing a book titled Disrupted: My Misadventure in the Startup Bubble, which sounds like the next natural leap from working on TV. I spoke with Lyons this week ahead of Sunday's finale to ask how he wound up at HBO, his new book, and what it's like being the real Fake Steve Jobs.\n\nHow did you end up in the job?\n\n\"I get this call from my agent, saying, 'HBO just called.'\"\n\nIn 2010, I had a novel about my Fake Steve blog, and the novel was called Options, and I sold the rights to the book to a company called Media Rights Capital in LA. They teamed me up with a guy named Larry Charles who had worked on Curb Your Enthusiasm and Seinfeld, and we created a show called Icon, which we shopped around and sold to the Epix cable network. Then we spent the next 18 months writing scripts, but then in the end Epix decided not to make any shows.\n\nThen, when Silicon Valley was picked up by HBO, the original showrunners left the show right after the pilot was made. HBO brought in this other guy named Alec Berg. Alec had worked on Curb and on Seinfeld, so he went way back with Larry Charles, and Larry said to him, \"Oh, you should talk to Dan.\" He showed Alec some of my old scripts and said, \"This guy really knows Silicon Valley really well.\" [So] I get this call from my agent, saying, \"Completely weird thing, but HBO just called and asked if you would come work on a show for the summer?\"\n\nThe thing that's always struck me about it was that I was really heartbroken in 2010 when the Icon show got dropped. I just was kind of crushed, but then weirdly enough something good came out of it. It was one of those stories when people say you never know where things are taking you.\n\nSpeaking of you knowing a lot about how Silicon Valley works, how did you wind up becoming Fake Steve Jobs?\n\nWell, here's the thing. I wouldn't say that I know a lot about Silicon Valley. I live in Boston, for one thing. And I don't live and breathe this stuff the way most of the guys out there do. I was working at Forbes, and I covered big enterprise companies — IBM, Sun, and EMC — and it was kind of boring. Forbes only came out every other week, so it was not the most fast-paced job in the world. It was very nice, comfortable.\n\nI wanted to learn how to blog, so I was playing around with Wordpress and Typepad and Blogger, starting all these different blogs just to learn how these things work. I had a fake Sergey Brin blog, an anonymous, fake Ph.D kind of blog. I did it for like, I don't know, six weeks, and the Steve Jobs one just caught on. I don't know why. I think someone saw it, and passed it on to someone else, and someone else saw it. It was like a practical joke that got out of control. In fact, originally I was working on a novel in my spare time, and I kept thinking, \"I'd better drop this stupid blog and get back to my novel.\" And then I realized it was probably more interesting than the novel. Then the blog became a novel, then it became a TV show, and that TV show led to Silicon Valley. It was just that one random decision to do that one stupid blog [that] led to all these other things.\n\nSo could you walk me through a day of you being a staff writer at Silicon Valley?\n\nI learned a lot, but basically... there are 10 writers on the show, but that includes Alec Berg and Mike Judge. So Alec and Mike and then eight writers and a couple of assistants. So you go in every day at like 11, and from 11 to like 6 or 7 we just sat around a big conference table. And we shot the shit all day, and we had whiteboards all over the wall. So usually Alec or Mike, would be up at the whiteboard, break out beats, and be like, \"Okay, let's have a storyline\" and often you'd spend a whole day and fill up a whiteboard and be like, \"Fuck. No,\" and just erase the whole thing. It was kind of a grueling process. Basically, you just sit there and talk, and Alec might call on you and be like, \"Hey, what do you think would happen now?\" But more often than not it's just a conversation and you kind of have to jump in. I was the lowest-ranking person. The absolute lowest ranking of the 10 people in the room. You just have to try to get a word in edgewise.\n\n\"It was kind of a grueling process.\"\n\nAle",
      "Kelly Digges has had many roles at Wizards over the years, including creative text writer, R&D editor, website copyeditor, lead website editor, Serious Fun column author, and design/development team member on multiple sets.\n\nPrevious story: The Archmage of Goldnight\n\nSix thousand years before the events of the Eldritch Moon story, three Planeswalkers collaborated to trap the monstrous Eldrazi on the world of Zendikar. Nahiri, a kor of Zendikar, stood vigil over the prisoners. Ugin, called the Spirit Dragon, and the vampire Sorin Markov agreed to return if their aid was needed. But the Eldrazi nearly escaped over a thousand years ago, and neither Sorin nor Ugin came. Sorin was Nahiri's friend, and his absence worried and puzzled her. After quelling the Eldrazi's escape attempts, Nahiri set out to find her friend. We know from Sorin's recollections that their meeting did not go well. But there are two sides to every story...\n\nReunion\n\nOne thousand years ago\n\nNahiri cast herself through the chaos of the Blind Eternities, the space between worlds. She'd slept for too long, in a cocoon of stone. Allowed certain things to drift beyond her awareness. She'd already corrected the most egregious case of neglect, reinforcing the wards that kept her prisoners secure and consigning their servants to oblivion. Her own world was safe, at least for the moment.\n\nNow it was time to call on an old friend, and restore something less tangible.\n\nIt did not take long before Nahiri sensed his presence and aimed for it, warping the world around her until she could stand beside him. Their friendship was ancient now, a faded relic, but Sorin Markov had been her first ally, and Nahiri would know him anywhere.\n\nShe stood, then, on a high bluff overlooking a dark and choppy sea. She had never been here, but nothing about it surprised her. Innistrad and Sorin had shaped each other, and the world seemed to suit him—brooding and dangerous, almost purposefully unwelcome. And the moon—there was something odd about the moon that rose above the water, something that tugged at her senses.\n\nSorin had never brought her here, but he had spoken of it in wistful tones. Had hoped, she knew, to call upon her to defend it—as she had hoped to call upon him to defend Zendikar. Neither had gotten what they wanted, in the end.\n\nSorin was not here.\n\nOn the highest part of the bluff, where she had sensed his presence, stood instead a massive, rough-hewn chunk of silver, forty feet tall at least. It had faces, but they were irregular and uneven, as though an amateur lithomancer had pulled it out of the ground and not yet bothered to smooth it out to a finish.\n\nHelvault | Art by Jaime Jones\n\nBut it was finished—unquestionably, to her senses, obviously the end result of tremendous effort rather than a work in progress. It was not polished because the polish did not matter to whatever it was this thing was supposed to be. Or do.\n\nAnd this—this thing—was what she had sensed. Not Sorin. The Thing had spoken to her, through the tenuous medium of the Blind Eternities, of him.\n\nThere was nothing on the bluff but the wind and the silver monolith, save a stunted tree with red leaves. She left the tree to its business and circled the tremendous chunk of silver.\n\nSides. It had eight of them, or perhaps seven, depending on how generous one felt as to the nature of an edge. But faces they were, deliberately shaped, almost like...But there were no hedrons on Innistrad, and Sorin had neither means nor cause to make them.\n\nAnd like a hedron, the Thing was more than its physical substance. She tested it with her lithomancy, taking a sounding of the pure metal and trying to get a sense of its inner structure.\n\nNothing. Nothing at all. She could sense the grain of the bedrock half a mile below her feet, feel the slow and steady heartbeat of continental plates dancing their slow, inexorable waltz. But she couldn't see into this sliver of silver. Couldn't so much as scratch it. Her power vanished into it, like an infinite well. Almost like...but no. No again. It was not a hedron. Not here.\n\nShe bent and peered beneath the Thing, half expecting to see that it was floating above the ground. But it was rooted at the bottom, by a comparatively thin stem of silver not much wider than Nahiri herself.\n\nShe stood and continued her slow circle of",
      "Melons/Watermelon\n\nPlanting:\n\nFor best results start seed indoors, 4 weeks prior to the last frost. Sow 2-3 seeds 1⁄2 inches deep in 21⁄4 inches Jiffy strips. Provide a warm soil temperature (24-27 degrees C) and even moisture. Leave the 2 best seedlings in each pot. Transplant outdoors after all risk of frost in rows 4-6 feet apart with 36 inches(melons) - 48 inches(watermelon) between jiffy pots. For direct seeding, wait until all risk of frost has passed and soil has warmed. Sow seed in rows and space properly or sow into mounded 1 foot x 2 foot hills, leaving 2 plants per hill, with hills spaced at 4-6 feet. Melons require a bright, warm growing season of about 3 months duration. Row covers or black mulch are highly recommended for extending growing season, to ensure maturity and to increase yield. Seedless varieties must be grown with a seeded variety for pollination to occur.\n\nGrowing:\n\nFull sun and sheltered location with soil pH of 6.0-7.0. Melons are moderate feeders which require plenty of compost added to the soil. Regular feedings during the season with a well balanced fertilizer or compost tea are highly beneficial.\n\nHarvest:\n\nMuskmelons-when the melon easily slips off the stem. Watermelon-when the curly tendril that intersects the main stem with the stem on the fruit has completely dried and turned brown and the underside of the melon, where it sits on the ground, is yellow.\n\nPests:\n\nMonitor for Cucumber beetles; use Rotenone to control beetles. Leaf spots and mildew can be controlled using a sulfur or copper fungicide.\n\nCompanions:\n\nCorn.",
      "Tonight: Franz Ferdinand singer Alex Kapranos orders the mussels while drummer Paul Thomson opts for the steak tartare at a pre-gig dinner in a Toronto bistro-- a suitably elegant and intimate environment in which to discuss the Glaswegian indie-pop pin-ups' nocturnally themed third album, Tonight.\n\nThe new album arrives nearly three and a half years after its predecessor, You Could Have It So Much Better-- not exactly a Guns N' Roses-scale hiatus, though in the mad-fer-it world of British pop, that's a potentially career-crippling length of time to spend off the cover of NME. But if Tonight's more exploratory nature reveals the benefits of a more relaxed recording schedule-- marked by flirtations with experimental electronica, acoustic folk and even metal-- the band's original mandate still stands: to bring intelligent, glamorous pop music to the masses, an ethos that makes their more brow-raising maneuvers-- like debuting songs in video games, or collaborating with rap superstars-- seem perfectly logical.\n\nPitchfork: So this meal makes for a nice change from the usual backstage deli tray…\n\nAlex Kapranos: When we first started touring for Franz Ferdinand, we were touring around Britain in a van, and like most bands, we were skint and we didn't eat particularly well: It was sandwiches from service stations and all that-- really gross. And then we come to this venue and the guy says, \"Are you guys hungry? We own the curry house next door, so help yourselves to the food there.\" So we all went in and completely stuffed ourselves and we had to go onstage a half hour later. I just remember walking up to the microphone with all this curry swirling around in my stomach, and belching curry fumes over the microphone, and every time I moved, just feeling it-- horrible. One of the worst gigs ever.\n\nPitchfork: Franz Ferdinand have always fancied themselves a pop band trying to bring arty/subversive ideas to the mainstream. So how did you feel being onstage at the Grammys in 2005, performing a live mash-up alongside the Black Eyed Peas and Maroon 5: Was it a case of \"mission accomplished\" or \"what the fuck are we doing here?\"\n\nPaul Thomson: It was like being in a House of Wax on very bad drugs.\n\nAK: Yeah: \"What the fuck is going on here? Is that Gwen Stefani? In a pirate ship? What the fuck is that!?!\" The weirdest thing wasn't what was going on onstage, but who was in the audience: \"Oh, there's the guy from Led Zeppelin…there's Kris Kristofferson…\"\n\nPT: And then we start playing and I'm like, \"Is that Jerry Lee Lewis?\" I'd never seen him in the flesh before.\n\nAK: Walking up the red carpet behind James Brown and in front of Hulk Hogan-- that has to be one of the most surreal moments of my life. Things like that, you've got to see it as a laugh-- just enjoy it. That's not my life, that's not who I am. I'm not going to be a prick about it-- it's a pretty amazing thing to get to see.\n\nPT: You can't ever let that become your life. You appreciate it on a level of \"this is preposterous.\" It's such a spectacle-- and then you can go home and tell people, \"I stood on a red carpet between James Brown and Hulk Hogan, what have you done?\"\n\nPitchfork: Some of the first news we received about your new record was about the song \"Lucid Dreams\" being used in the Madden 09 video game. Now, when I think of potential soundtracks for American football games, Franz Ferdinand aren't the first band that come to mind…\n\nAK: [laughs] But you get the most bizarre bands used in sports! Gary Glitter is still really popular in the States-- they don't know the whole history. You guys are singing along to a pedophile!\n\nPT: It's like, don't you know how those royalties are being spent?\n\nPitchfork: Does putting your song in a football video game motivated by the same absurdity as, say, playing the Grammys?\n\nAK: I find American football quite ridiculous generally. I don't understand it. It looks like a lot of guys dressed up as spacemen shouting at each other. I love the idea of people playing that game getting off on the tune-- yeah, fine. That's the great thing: Music should be universal. My life perspective, my lifestyle-- I'm not going to impose that on the people that listen to our music. That's kind of a perverse form of snobbery I like to reject.\n\nPitchfork: So you're not going to pull a Kurt Cob",

      "In 1848 a match was played like no other before or after. Saluting the men who played in a world that is unknowable now\n\nThere are several candidates for the match of the year 2011 – mad collapses, last-ball draws, you know, the usual – but there can be only one winner of the award for the year of 1848, when, at the Priory Ground in Lewisham, a team of men with one leg played a team of men with one arm.\n\nIt is a long reach back in time: 1848 was the summer that Grace was born. Brahms was 15. Tolstoy was 20. Dickens had just written A Christmas Carol. The Crimean war was five years away. America had 30 states. A man called Innocenzo Manzetti had hit on the idea for something that, three decades later, would become the telephone: 1848 is a distant place.\n\nCricket, though, was in rude health in its first great age, a sport of the people and a gambler's paradise. Two thousand four hundred people went to the Priory Ground to watch Eleven One Armed Men v Eleven With One Leg. The game lives on through a glorious match report in an Australian paper published six months later. \"Novelty was the ruling passion,\" it runs, \"nine tenths went merely for the say of the thing\".\n\nThe principal of the fixture was well-established; a similar game had been played for a thousand guineas in 1796, and this was a rematch of sorts of a fixture played in 1841, although, \"during this long recess, the great leveller had bowled a large proportion of those who figured on that occasion out.\" The betting, \"what little there was,\" went in favour of the men with \"two living legs\".\n\nThe players from both teams were Greenwich Pensioners, navy men who had been injured in service and now lived at the Royal Hospital. What a sight it was: \"The singularity of the Greenwich dress combined with the ludicrous positions of the fielders, their antique physiognomies and the general clumsiness of both parties at the game produced a match that was grotesque in the extreme\".\n\nLest anyone think political correctness was being invented at the boundary edge that day, a riotous time was had by all. A clue as to why the players were keen enough came from the description of their \"substantial luncheon before each day's play\" and \"for their dinner there was a profusion of roast and boiled beef, and lamb, accompanied by plenty of heavy\".\n\nThus, in their veteran's uniforms, full of grub and with a night's-worth of ale in them, did the One Arm XI make 50 in their first innings, which featured a top score of eight not out. The One Legged XI replied with 32, The One Arm XI extended their lead with 41, leaving the One Legged XI 60 to win. They were dismissed for 44, a gallant effort that included the highest score of the match, 15, from their number five, Sears. The greatest contributor to both totals was extras. The One Legged XI conceded 30, the One Arm XI 43, all of which were wides. Across the match, 21 players were dismissed without scoring in one innings or the other, and the One Legged XI featured five batsmen who made pairs, including the unfortunate number 11 Baldrick, who was run out twice.\n\n\"The bowling on both sides was generally very wide,\" wrote our man [Mitch wasn't playing was he … ?] \"and the One Legs, in endeavouring to take advantage of it but in the majority of cases missing the object, span round like the final revolutions of an expiring teetotum, and frequently got out\".\n\nThen, in strange triumph, both teams \"marched to the Bull Inn, headed by an excellent band who had been engaged throughout the match. Each man had free passage to and from the Royal Hospital, a glass of grog to drink to Her Majesty's health and ten shillings for his two days' exertions\".\n\nIt was a distant match from a distant time, played in a world that is unknowable now. The lives of the players had not been easy, and yet their oddly uplifting spirit endures and flourishes. Any cricketer can relate to how they felt – especially that Baldrick. Here are the names of the men that played. Gentlemen, we salute you:\n\nOne Arm XI: Guay, Wiley, Morley, Johnson, Burns, Sissoms, Broom, Newsom, Seale, Jeffreys, Sowden.\n\nOne Legged XI: Wetherhead, Ryan, Scot, Brown, Sears, Albar, Polston, West, Drew, Browne, Baldrick.\n\nNB: Thanks to the great Jonathon Green for passing along the report.\n\n• This",
      "Following the awesome new trailer and record breaking ticket sales, it looks like Star Wars: The Force Awakens is set for a rather large opening weekend.\n\nExperts are saying that the movie could have the biggest domestic opening of all-time with around $300 million (beating Jurassic World's $208 million), which added to a worldwide taking of $300 million could lead to Star Wars: The Force Awakens bringing Disney a whopping $600 million on its opening weekend alone.\n\nNow, if we use Jurassic World as the rule of thumb, that movie made a total of $651 million domestically overall. If Star Wars: The Force Awakens can match its trajectory following its weekend opening of $300 million, then it could push past the $1 billion mark in the US alone.

      "Use of the machine in this case illustrates the ingenuity that often drives medical progress. It also points up the risks that must be weighed before using new techniques. Michelle's family and doctors agonized over the possibility that if they succeeded in reviving her, her brain might have been severely damaged.\n\nPerhaps the greatest fascination for experts, as Dr. James P. Orlowski of the Cleveland Clinic said in the editorial in the journal, is that the survival of victims of ice water submersion ''defy our accepted limits for recovery from'' lack of oxygen. But no one knows for how long a human can be hypothermic and, after rewarming, survive with a normal brain.\n\nMichelle fell into a creek swollen by runoff from the winter snowpack near her home in Salt Lake City on June 10, 1986. Her brother saw the accident and called their mother, who searched for Michelle for from 4 to 10 minutes before calling the emergency phone number, 911.\n\nWithin eight minutes, rescue workers began a search. When they found no trace of the girl, they reduced the outflow from a reservoir that feeds the creek. As the water level dropped, rescuers saw the child's arm sticking out of the water. She was wedged against a rock, and there was no evidence of an air pocket.\n\nWhen rescuers finally pulled her from the water, 62 minutes after her mother's call, she was very cold and blue. She had no pulse and was not breathing. Her pupils were fixed and widely dilated, as they would be with severe brain damage or death. A monitor detected no heartbeat.\n\nNevertheless, rescue workers began cardiopulmonary resuscitation, forcing air into her lungs and blood throughout her body. They continued it in a helicopter ambulance that flew her to the hospital.\n\nIn the emergency room, Dr. Bolte and technicians set up the bypass machine. When the child arrived, Dr. Bolte led a team in injecting warmed fluids into Michelle's veins and stomach. They squeezed warmed air through a tube into her lungs.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAbout three hours after the child had fallen into the creek, she still appeared lifeless.\n\n''Many would have declared her dead at that point,'' said Dr. Howard W. Corneli, another pediatrician on the team. ''Other staff members thought Dr. Bolte was crazy.''\n\nDr. Bolte recalled in an interview: ''We had to decide how hard to push to save her life. You do not want to be in the position where you are creating a child that is going to end up in a vegetative state.''\n\nOne crucial factor was her temperature, measured in the hospital as low as 66 degrees Fahrenheit.\n\n''Most important, the child was so profoundly cold,'' Dr. Bolte said. ''Also, we had a rough idea she had been under for about 45 minutes,'' the longest period from which anyone had ever recovered with their brain intact. If it had been much longer, he said he would have stopped.\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box. Invalid email address.

One was a finding that the amounts of oxygen and other gases in Michelle's blood, although abnormal, were ''incredibly good under the circumstances.''\n\nThe other was the absence of any apparent head injuries or broken bones. Injections of heparin, an anticoagulant, would be needed to prevent clots as Michelle's blood flowed through the heart-lung machine. If she had been injured, bleeding would have been an intolerable risk.\n\nWhen Michelle's parents arrived, Dr. Bolte said, ''we told them the possible scenarios and that if we rewarmed the child there was a strong likelihood that she would have significant brain damage.'' Everyone decided ''to go for it because rewarming was her only chance,'' Dr. Bolte said.\n\nIn the operating room, the doctors delicately inserted tubes into the narrow blood vessels of the child's groin and connected the tubes to the machine. It began pumping, and slowly her temperature began to rise.\n\nWhen it reached 77 degrees Fahrenheit, she gasped. Moments later she opened her eyes. A few minutes later her pupils, responding to the bright lights in the operating room, narrowed, a sign of returning brain function. Then the doctors detected a faint heart beat.\n\n''We realized she had a shot,'' Dr. Bolte said. ''We were excited",
      "In case there was any question, the National Rifle Association has revealed once and for all that they are an ill-fitting collection of \"gun-clingers\" and fearmongers when they voted to bring Ted Nugent on once again as a 3-year board member.\n\nNugent has been in the news consistently the past couple of years for anti-Semitic remarks, calling for the hanging of the president and first lady, as well as several other batsh*t remarks and declarations.\n\nNugent is clearly an unstable individual, but he is allowed to not only own guns, but is recognized as a distinguised member of the gun-owner club. Endorsing Trump may have been a stupid thing for the NRA to do, but putting Nugent back on the board was possibly even more idiotic.\n\nWatch.",
      "It seems that the concept of tokenization is taking the world by storm. Decentralized networks allow people to invest through the pooling of funds in assets that are tangible, and that would otherwise be far out of their price point.\n\nMaecenas is a platform that allows users to invest in works of art through tokenization. The artwork is kept in the custody of art vaults like freeports - ultra luxurious art viewing spaces in tax free zones near major airports. The currency used within the ecosystem for purchases and leases is the ART, the ERC20 token issued by Maecenas. The tokens can also be traded on exchanges for fiat currency.\n\nThe tokenized artwork is then offered to the community who is able to invest in the art via the same token - the ART token. Investors then hold a portion interest in the artwork, which appreciates with time.\n\nThe principle of tokenization is the same as in the stock market. Individual investors are able to own shares in huge corporations like Google, Apple, or GE. However, until Maecenas, the art world was limited to a few art patrons who were willing to spend millions on individual pieces. Through tokenization, this will radically change.\n\nA massive opportunity\n\nThe art world is growing rapidly. With nearly $65 bln per year in art being transferred, the opportunity for a company like Maecenas is huge. By tokenizing these assets, the company is able to offer them to a wider market, thus increasing the buying power for the market.\n\nFurther, investors seeking more safe-haven asset purchases are able to diversify their portfolios with assets which have, until now, been reserved for the largest-scale investors in the world. Through tokenization, these large-scale purchases are moved into the mainstream, in general class investors can participate.\n\nThis coupling of price increase, wider participation, and opening of new investor fronts will drive the art market forward, and Maecenas is there to make the tokenization leap smooth.\n\nFurther, the decentralized platform allows investors to coordinate with one another across a peer-to-peer network, effectively removing the exorbitant fees charged by art auction houses. This also drives prices upward as handling costs are greatly reduced.\n\nART tokens offered\n\nFor investors who want to join in on the ground floor of what will ultimately become a global tokenized market, the company is offering its ART tokens via a crowd sale ICO. Tokens are sold at a rate of 480 ART for 1 ETH.\n\nThe company is committed to capping the number of tokens, and only allowing the funds to be used within the platform. Pantera Capital has already invested part of its $100 mln crypto hedge fund into ART tokens. Savvy investors will want to get in on the ground floor with Pantera.",
      "Meghan Trainor just nabbed the Grammy award for Best New Artist, the only category in which she was nominated this year—and it was perhaps the least-surprising major category win at tonight's ceremony.\n\nIn the days leading up to music's biggest night, Trainor was the favorite for all the online betting sites monitored by OddsTracker. A $1 bet on a Trainor victory today would have yielded only $2.20, putting her solidly ahead of James Bay ($3.50), Sam Hunt ($5), Courtney Barnett ($6) and Tori Kelly ($11).\n\nTrainor still seemed a bit surprised to take home the golden gramophone, weeping through her acceptance speech.\n\n\"I have to thank L.A. Reid for looking at me as an artist instead of just a songwriter,\" she said while accepting the award from presenter Sam Smith, who won the award last year. \"And my mom and dad.\"\n\nThis isn't Trainor's first rodeo. Last year she was nominated for Record of the Year and Song of the Year (both for \"All About That Bass\"), but lost out on both. Of course, last year's nominations underscore how strange it is that she was up for Best New Artist this year.\n\nDespite being only 22 years old, Trainor is something of an established star at this point. In addition to her 2015 Grammy nominations, she has a No. 1 album under her belt along with four multiplatinum singles, including \"All About That Bass,\" which was released in June 2014.\n\nPerhaps Trainor's victory will cause the Grammy establishment to reconsider what constitutes a new artist, leaving the door open for even newer acts to have their shot at Grammy glory in the coming years.\n\nFor more on the business of music, check out my books (Empire State of Mind and Michael Jackson, Inc.) and sign up for my email updates.

      "This Guide will tell you all you need to know about the InGame Currencies in Gwent with a specific focus on Kegs. At the time of writing this, it's been a few months since the Closed Beta started and we are approaching Open Beta now. The pricing models and (many) other things may change. When/If that happens, I'll do my best to update all the information with its new values.\n\nNew to Gwent? Learn more about the game and follow all the news updates.\n\n\nGwent's InGame Currencies\n\nI've explained those in my GWENT The Witcher Card Game Beginners Guide, but let's mention them here just briefly once again.\n\nOre\n\nInGame currency used to purchase Kegs. Earned as a random reward (5 Ore or 5 Scraps) after each game if your opponent gives you a \"Good Game\" (GG) or from completing dailies, ranked play and leveling up.\n\nScraps\n\nInGame currency used to craft new cards. Earned as a random reward (5 Ore or 5 Scraps) after each game if your opponent gives you a \"Good Game\" (GG) or from completing dailies, ranked play and leveling up.\n\nMeteorite Powder\n\nThis is the InGame currency used to convert normal cards into Premiums. Each and every card in the game has a premium version. Premium cards act exactly as the normal ones, but their design is animated and voiced over with the appropriate sound for the creature or effect they represent when previewing them.\n\nCard Kegs\n\nThe main source for new cards. You can earn new cards as a level-up reward, but those are few, far apart and in most cases nothing really of a great value to help turn the tides in your games. Kegs contain 5 cards in total. One of them is always a Rare, Epic or Legandary. First you have 4 cards that are randomly pulled out of all cards available. Then you have to pick your 5th card out of 3 other cards that appear on the screen. Premium cards (animated) are also available. CD Projekt Red's has released Premium versions of all cards for the release of Open Beta.\n\nGwent Kegs Pricing Model\n\nPurchasing Kegs can be done in 2 ways: With Ore (see description of Ore) or with Real Money. Here is a list of current pricing for all packs of Gwent Kegs in USD (you may see prices in different currency). It's possible that depending on local currency pricing may differ slightly.\n\nGwent Kegs Price list is below:\n\n1x Card Keg = 100 Ore\n\n2x Card Kegs = $3.19\n\n7x Card Kegs = $10.64\n\n15x Card Kegs = $21.27\n\n40x Card Kegs = $53.20\n\n60x Card Kegs = $74.49\n\nIs it worth buying Gwent Kegs\n\nThe game is still in early development and in the future tons of new cards will be introduced. With that said, let's take a look at what it is like to be a F2P vs buying kegs at the moment.\n\nIs F2P in Gwent bad\n\nThat, of course is more of a personal question. My advice is to buy if and what you can afford. CD Projekt Red are, as usual, very generous and in my opinion the company deserves the support. If you feel fine with being stuck for quite some time to only one faction and a very limited deck, F2P is perfect for you. Progress and earning cards as F2P is quite slow, especially when you gain a few levels and start to get matched against \"richer\" opponents. But, as I said, if you stick to one faction and expand one type of a deck, you will be perfectly fine with the F2P model.\n\nIn fact, the new rewards CDPR introduced in GWENT Open Beta help minimize the struggle from early levels to the moment when you will have a well designed and working high tier deck. Griding through your dailies and participating in Ranked play, reward you with great resources and it wont be too long before you will be able to afford to expand you collection. All depends on how much you play and if you work on the daily rewards each day or once a week. :)\n\nDon't get me wrong. I myself was playing without paying money for over 3 months in the Closed Beta until I decided to purchase the $70 pack. In this time I managed to build several decent decks with 3 different factions.\n\nOne final thought on the \"is F2P bad in Gwent\": NO! CD Projekt Red, as I've said many",
      "The $500 billion farm bill agreed upon by House and Senate negotiators this week holds good tidings for organic farmers, an increasingly prominent constituency long neglected by the federal government.\n\nThe draft bill contains several measures likely to benefit organic farms, including funding for research in organic agriculture and a federal program to market organic foods. (Keep your eyes peeled for \"Got Organic?\" billboards to pop up soon on a highway near you.)\n\nThe most significant change may be a provision that makes federal crop insurance more available (and generous) to organic farmers. Sen. Jeff Merkley (D.-Ore.) added the crop insurance measure to the farm bill in an amendment in June 2012.\n\nUntil 2001, organic farmers weren't even eligible for federal crop insurance, which reimburses farmers for crop losses due to natural causes. And they've faced further obstacles since being allowed to purchase insurance. Until recently, the U.S. Department of Agriculture charged organic farmers crop insurance premiums 5 percent higher than those for conventional farmers. The crop insurance program also calculated payouts to organic farmers for losses using the price of conventional crops -- even though organic crops are almost always worth two to three times more, according to USDA data.\n\nMerkley's amendment changes all this, eliminating the 5 percent penalty for organic farm crop insurance premiums and mandating that proper prices be used for indemnity rates. Though USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack vowed last spring to get rid of the fee, Merkley's amendment commits the USDA to the change regardless of its leadership.\n\nThe amendment also provides the USDA with funding to establish appropriate price levels for insurance rates for organic farmers, and requires the department to use those prices when determining payouts. It even calls on the USDA to insure farmers who sell their produce locally (at farmers markets, for example) at the higher prices they can get at these venues.\n\nThe changes may spur organic agriculture to quicker growth. Though the industry has become increasingly prosperous over the last decade, with sales hitting $32 billion in 2013, organics remain a small part of the American agricultural industry.\n\nOrganic farmers have cited their disadvantages in the crop insurance market as a serious barrier to growth. Indeed, there's evidence that many organic farmers have responded to their disadvantages by refusing to insure their crops.\n\nData from the Union of Concerned Scientists and USDA show that in 2010, just 13 percent of all organic farmland was covered by federal crop insurance policies, compared with about 24 percent of conventional farmland.\n\nWithout insurance, organic farmers are exposed to sudden changes in weather and pests, driving up prices and decreasing yields.\n\nOn the other hand, the farm bill benefits conventional farmers far more than organic farmers.\n\n\"The support for organic farming in the farm bill is not commensurate with the economic importance of organic farming in this country,\" said Kari Hamerschlag, a food policy analyst at the Environmental Working Group. \"For a $32 billion to get not much more than $150 million ... it's just way out of alignment. The industry still has a ways to go in terms of getting Congress to recognize how important the sector is for job development.\"\n\nThe bill still must be approved by the full House and Senate.",
      "Dental caries remains the most prevalent and costly oral infectious disease worldwide. Several methods have been employed to prevent this biofilm-dependent disease, including the use of essential oils (EOs). In this systematic review, we discuss the antibacterial activity of EOs and their isolated constituents in view of a potential applicability in novel dental formulations. Seven databases were systematically searched for clinical trials, in situ, in vivo and in vitro studies addressing the topic published up to date. Most of the knowledge in the literature is based on in vitro studies assessing the effects of EOs on caries-related streptococci (mainly Streptococcus mutans) and lactobacilli, and on a limited number of clinical trials. The most promising species with antibacterial potential against cariogenic bacteria are: Achillea ligustica, Baccharis dracunculifolia, Croton cajucara, Cryptomeria japonica, Coriandrum sativum, Eugenia caryophyllata, Lippia sidoides, Ocimum americanum, and Rosmarinus officinalis. In some cases, the major phytochemical compounds determine the biological properties of EOs. Menthol and eugenol were considered outstanding compounds demonstrating an antibacterial potential. Only L. sidoides mouthwash (1%) has shown clinical antimicrobial effects against oral pathogens thus far. This review suggests avenues for further non-clinical and clinical studies with the most promising EOs and their isolated constituents bioprospected worldwide.",

      "A n Oakland woman is suing UC Berkeley and 15 other parties, claiming they did nothing to protect her when she was attacked by protesters with pepper spray while attending a planned speaking event for conservative provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos on campus in February.\n\nIn a federal lawsuit filed Monday, Kiara Robles said she is seeking $23 million in damages for the attack — some of which was videotaped.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, Robles visited the UC Berkeley campus on Feb. 1 because she wanted to see Yiannopoulos speak. Fifteen minutes after she arrived, violence erupted on campus. Yiannopoulos' event was immediately canceled amid chaotic protests.\n\nAs she was being interviewed by a KGO-TV news station reporter, Robles said, she was attacked by both masked and unmasked assailants with painful pepper spray and bear spray — all because \"she chose to exercise her right to freedom of speech and show support for the planned speaker, Milo Yiannopoulos.\"\n\nKiara Robles is attacked with pepper spray during a news interview. (Kiara Robles / U.S. District Court )\n\nShe said no campus police were present as she was being attacked.\n\n\"Instead, nearly 100 campus police and SWAT members waited in the Student Union building, within eyesight of the violence happening outside, watching the protesters become more belligerent and dangerous,\" Robles said.\n\nShe claims the university chose to withhold police protection because she, Yiannopoulos and a large number of his supporters are gay and politically conservative.\n\nThe university, she said, \"has acted to unconstitutionally curtail the 1st Amendment rights of its students and invitees.\"\n\nShe said UC Berkeley students and guests who did \"not subscribe to the radical, left-wing philosophies\" were subjected \"to severe violence and bodily harm for merely expressing a differing viewpoint, in clear contravention of their rights under the 1st Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.\"\n\nThe lawsuit's defendants include: UC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), activist billionaire George Soros, UC President Janet Napolitano, UC Board of Regents Chairwoman Monica Lozano, Berkeley Mayor Jesse Arreguin, and the University of California and Berkeley police departments.\n\nMilo Yiannopoulos speaks at the University of Colorado in Boulder in January. (Jeremy Papasso / Associated Press)\n\nIn a statement issued Wednesday, UC Berkeley said it \"intends to mount a vigorous and successful defense of its actions, and looks forward to contesting this collection of false claims.\"\n\nThe university said campus police and administrators are committed to supporting free speech and providing safety.\n\nPrior to the Yiannopoulos event, \"administrators and UCPD spent countless hours and substantial University resources planning security measures to enable the event to occur,\" the university said. \"Faced with an unprecedented level of organized violence, UCPD responded in a manner designed to minimize injuries to innocent members of the surrounding crowd, defend the building from incursion by massed attackers, and protect and safely remove the speaker.\"\n\nIn the days after the violent protests, UC Berkeley officials said moving officers into the melee would have created a lethal situation.\n\nAuthorities blamed a group of violent protesters, whom they described as a paramilitary force, for the disturbance. Armed with bats, steel rods, fireworks and Molotov cocktails, the agitators set a fire on campus and prevented Yiannopoulos from speaking.\n\nGiven the current political climate, Robles contends that university officials should have foreseen the violence. She said their actions were \"a callous and blatant disregard for safety\" for Yiannopoulos' fans.\n\n\"Based on the recent frequency of violence associated with political protest in the United States,\" Robles said, \"defendants were, at a minimum, grossly negligent — if not intentionally negligent — by hiding behind glass windows in order to further the protestors' politically motivated agenda — in failing to provide effective police protection for the crowds present at one of their own events.\"",
      "In all branches of the military, physical fitness is an important requirement. Marines take a physical fitness test every six months, to evaluate their conditioning and strength. This test includes a timed three-mile run, pull-ups, a flexed-arm hang and abdominal crunches, and is as rigorous as it sounds.\n\nBut there are good reasons for having such stringent requirements for Marine recruits. Marine Corps basic training is well-known as being among the most difficult and challenging of all branches of the service. At 12 1/2 weeks, it is the longest, so stamina and physical fitness are necessary.\n\nHeight, Weight and Body Fat Requirements\n\nBut before newly-enlisted Marines ship out to basic training, they must meet strict weight requirements, referred to as the retention weight standards, based on their height. The other factor is body fat, and there are limits on body fat percentage based on a Marine's age. For male Marines age 17 to 26, the body fat limit is 18 percent. Between age 27 and 39, the limit is 19 percent body fat, and for Marines age 40-45, the body fat limit is 20 percent. For male Marines age 46 and up, the body fat limit is 21 percent.\n\nFor female Marines, the body fat percentage limits are slightly higher. Female Marines age 17-26 have a body fat percentage limit of 26 percent. For female Marines age 27 to 39 the limit is 27 percent, and for those age 40 to 45 it's 28 percent. And for female Marines age 46 and over, the body fat percentage limit is 29 percent.\n\nIt's important to note that the weight and body fat standards of the Marine Corps are not based on appearance, but are health and performance-based. Marines face numerous tests of endurance and stamina, especially in combat, so being in top physical shape is crucial.\n\nConditions for Exceeding the Weight Requirements\n\nApplicants to the Marines who are over the weight limits need a waiver from approved by the Marine Corps Recruiting Region Commanding General, in order to enlist in the delayed entry program (DEP). Such waivers are only approved when the recruit meets the requirements of the initial strength test (IST), and doesn't exceed the body fat requirements.\n\nMale recruits who are over the retention weight standards may be able to attend basic training under a few specific conditions. If a male recruit is within five percent of the retention weight standard for their height and pass the IST, he doesn't need a waiver.\n\nBut if a male recruit is more than five percent over the retention weight, he has to pass the IST and get a waiver. If a male recruit is more than 10 percent above the retention weight, he has to pass the IST, have body fat no greater than 18 percent and get a waiver.",
      "Zuccarello's speech returned with the help of a speech therapist. He was diagnosed with a brain contusion. He didn't return to the Rangers lineup until the start of this season.\n\nThere's the slight slur in his speech, which he didn't have for four days after he was struck in the left side of the head by defenseman Ryan McDonagh's slap shot in Game 5 of the Eastern Conference First Round series against the Pittsburgh Penguins on April 24, 2015.\n\nGREENBURGH, N.Y. -- Eleven months after the puck hit him in the head and knocked the words out of his mouth, New York Rangers forward Mats Zuccarello is leading the Rangers in scoring while still dealing with minor effects of a brain injury that could have jeopardized his career and maybe even his life.\n\n\"I still miss a bunch of words sometimes,\" Zuccarello said. \"I'm better in Norwegian, but English, if it goes too fast I mix up words. When I take my time and think about what I'm going to say it's all good. But when I kind of get wound up or excited you can hear it. That's a small bump.\"\n\nVideo: FLA@NYR: Zuccarello beats Montoya top-shelf\n\nIt seemed bigger to Zuccarello in the winter, when he realized his slurring got worse as the weather got colder. He also toe picks more often now than before. It happens regardless of if he's skating or walking. And then there is the occasional numbness in his right leg.\n\n\"They said this is as good as it's going to get maybe, at least for now,\" Zuccarello said. \"You can't think about it.\"\n\nHe has been told the effects of the head injury shouldn't affect his long-term health, so Zuccarello said he feels comfortable going on as normal, living his regular life. He's getting by just fine, to the point where he leads the Rangers with 54 points and is second with 23 goals heading into the game against the Boston Bruins at Madison Square Garden on Wednesday (8 p.m. ET; NBCSN, SN1).\n\nZuccarello has played all 73 games this season. He also has shown no hesitation in going to the front of the net, a risk that might not seem to be worth the reward when you go through what he went through.\n\n\"You always tell yourself, 'No, I'm going to be the same, I'm going to be the same.' But you never know until you're in that situation,\" Zuccarello said. \"I don't feel like I've changed a lot, so that's good.\"\n\nIt's great for the Rangers, because in many ways Zuccarello is their beating heart because of how he plays and what he's overcome. In many ways he's an inspiration to his teammates on a daily basis.\n\n\"You see him that first night and he's all wired up in the hospital, it's a scary scene and you don't know what's going to happen, the outcome, how he's going to progress,\" said McDonagh, who admitted to battling against his guilt because the puck that hit Zuccarello came off of his stick. \"You just want him to be like himself; be the fun, energetic guy I've always known and we love here in New York. Certainly we didn't know if he was ever going to play again. But thankfully he was able to recover and progress.\"\n\nAnd now?\n\n\"He's loving the fact that he's back here playing,\" McDonagh said. \"Not just because of what he went through but because he loves playing hockey, being in the locker room atmosphere, being around the guys. It's been everything and more to see him come back and play the way he has been, carrying our team up front, being that offensive spark and energetic player for us.\"\n\nVideo: NYR@PHI: Zuccarello dekes Mason, buries shootout goal\n\nHis path back easily could be taken for granted now because time has passed and his injury, fortunately, has healed enough to allow him to lead a normal life and be the player the Rangers need him to be.\n\nZuccarello, though, isn't foolish enough to take anything he has for granted. He might never again. Playing hockey for him has become more of a blessing than a career.\n\n\"You appreciate things more when you go through an injury like that,\" he said. \"At the end it wasn't that serious, but it wasn't far away from being more serious than it was. I was lucky.\"\n\nFor a while he wondered if he wasn't. He vividly remembers how in the days after sustaining the injury he tried and yearned to say something, anything, only to find he couldn't.\n\n\"It was frustrating",
      "From MTG Wiki\n\nMagic Duels symbol for Legendary. Thesymbol for Legendary.\n\nLegendary is a supertype of a card. Any permanent (artifact, creature, enchantment, planeswalker, and land) with the legendary supertype is bound by the \"legend rule,\" which prevents multiple copies of the card from existing on the battlefield under the same player's control. Legendary may also appear as a supertype with non-permanents (sorceries and instants). The rules for these are different: you can't cast a legendary non-permanent spell unless you control a legendary creature or a legendary planeswalker. Legendary cards are historic.\n\nFrom the glossary of the Comprehensive Rules (Commander 2018 (August 10, 2018)) Legendary A supertype that's normally relevant on permanents. See rule 205.4, \"Supertypes.\" See also Legend Rule.\n\nFlavorfully, legendary cards represent the key people, places, and objects of a set's story. Typical expansion sets contain no more than 10 to 15 legendary cards, with the exceptions of Dominaria, Kamigawa block, and the early expansion Legends, each of which had a Legendary theme and contained significantly more. Except for cards found in those sets, or in compilation sets, all legendary cards carry a rarity of rare or mythic rare.[1][2]\n\nLegendary was first featured on the lands in the set Legends. Starting with Champions of Kamigawa it also replaced the creature type Legend.[3]\n\nThe Commander format requires that a legendary creature be selected as one's deck commander. This excludes legendary planeswalkers (which are not creatures), except for the five appearing in Commander 2014, the Battlebond planeswalker duo \"Will Kenrith\" and \"Rowan Kenrith,\" and the four appearing in Commander 2018.\n\nCard frame [ edit | edit source ]\n\nStarting with Duel Decks: Elves vs. Inventors and Dominaria, all legendary cards, except planeswalkers, have crown-like flourishes on the title bar of the card frame.[4]\n\nLegend rule [ edit | edit source ]\n\nIf a player controls two or more legendary permanents of the same name when state-based effects are checked, that player chooses one of those permanents and immediately put the others into their owners' graveyards, without any player having an opportunity to respond. This does not destroy the other permanents, does not cause them to be sacrificed, and cannot be prevented by indestructibility or regeneration.\n\nThis version of the rule has been in effect since the release of Magic 2014.[5][6]\n\nCurrently, only two cards circumvent the \"legend rule.\" Brothers Yamazaki ignores the rule for itself as long as a player controls exactly two of the card, and Mirror Gallery cancels the rule entirely.\n\nFrom the glossary of the Comprehensive Rules (Commander 2018 (August 10, 2018)) Legend Rule A state-based action that causes a player who controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name to put all but one into their owners' graveyards. See rule 704.5j.\n\nFrom the Comprehensive Rules (Commander 2018 (August 10, 2018)) 205.4d Any permanent with the supertype \"legendary\" is subject to the state-based action for legendary permanents, also called the \"legend rule\" (see rule 704.5j).\n\nFrom the Comprehensive Rules (Commander 2018 (August 10, 2018)) 704.5j If a player controls two or more legendary permanents with the same name, that player chooses one of them, and the rest are put into their owners' graveyards. This is called the \"legend rule.\"\n\nOther versions of the Legend rule [ edit | edit source ]\n\nFrom Legends to Champions of Kamigawa [ edit | edit source ]\n\nOriginally, only one creature of the same name, with the creature type Legend, could be in play at the same time. For a while, they were even on the restricted list, meaning there could be only one creature of the same name in each deck. This was changed around the time of Ice Age.[7][8][9]\n\nAny person could play a Legend provided that that Legend wasn't already on the battlefield. If it was, that card was stuck in its owner's hand. They could cast it if they wanted to, but the newest one would immediately be put into the graveyard, so there was no incentive to do so.\n\nThis issue came to great prominence during the Masques block because Rebel decks centered around Lin Sivvi, Defiant Hero were dominant at the time. The card was so key to the deck that when two Rebel decks played one another, the first person to get Lin Sivvi out had an unfair advantage.[10] However, developer Tom LaPille still preferred this version of the",
      "In her new book, Fields of Blood, Karen Armstrong argues against the idea that faith causes wars. By Emma Green\n\n\"Piles of heads, hands, and feet were to be seen. It was necessary to pick one's way over the bodies of men and horses.\" This was how the historian Raymond of Aguilers described Jerusalem in 1099, as he watched Christian crusaders conquer the city. \"Men rode in blood up to their knees and bridle reins,\" he observed. \"Indeed, it was a just and splendid judgment of God that this place should be filled with the blood of unbelievers, since it had so long suffered from their blasphemies.\"\n\nWhen people make generalized arguments about the inherent violence of religion, this is the kind of thing they're probably thinking of: the unapologetic, triumphalist bloodletting of the Crusades; the decades-long slaughter of the Thirty Years' War; and the dehumanizing murder sprees of contemporary jihad. And it is this kind of argument that motivated Karen Armstrong to write her newest book, aptly titled Fields of Blood: Religion and the History of Violence, which was published last week in the United States.\n\nThe book tackles a simple question: Has religion been the cause of all the major wars in history? If you want to save yourself several hundred thousand words, the short answer is: no. Any student of history could point out that conflicts from the campaigns of Genghis Khan to World War I had non-religious motivations. During the talks she has already given about the book, Armstrong told me in an interview, the first person to ask her a question always says something along these lines: No one actually believes that religion is the cause of all major wars in history.\n\nBut then for the rest of the talk, Armstrong said, audience members \"are insisting that [religion] is the chief cause that is to blame,\" Armstrong said. In her book, she writes that she has \"heard this sentence recited like a mantra by American commentators and psychiatrists, London taxi drivers and Oxford academics.\" Religion may not have caused all the wars in history, these people say, but it is inherently violent in a way that has undeniably shaped world history for the worse. It's this ambient suspicion that Armstrong seems to be arguing against, rallying textual evidence from thousands of years before Christ through modernity.\n\nAlthough the book is framed as a polemic response to what is essentially a straw-man question, Armstrong has isolated an interesting quality of contemporary discourse about religion: It's really, really vague. Contemplating whether violence is inherent in religion might seem like a pastime limited to college debating societies or educated retirees who have a lot of time for book talks (or dilettante journalists, for that matter), but this idea has an intangible and problematic power in Western culture—the focus of Armstrong's study. Even posing the question at the center of Armstrong's book assumes that there's a unified thing called \"religion\" that has stayed constant over thousands of years of human life.\n\nBut, as Armstrong points out in the book, \"there is no universal way to define 'religion,'\" particularly when it comes to comparing mono- and polytheistic faiths. \"In the West we see 'religion' as a coherent system of obligatory beliefs, institutions, and rituals … whose practice is essentially private and hermetically sealed off from all 'secular' activities,\" she writes. \"But words in other languages that we translate as 'religion' almost invariably refer to something larger, vaguer, and more encompassing.\" This is an important premise of one of Armstrong's main arguments: It's impossible make a coherent case about the role of religion in warfare and violence throughout history and across the world, simply because religion plays very different roles in different cultures.\n\nFor example, religious belief and practice in, say, ancient Mesopotamia were very different than what they have become in modernity—a period that Armstrong and many academics say began in the West in 1648, when peace treaties ending several major wars in Europe were signed in Westphalia, a region in present-day Germany. She describes the spread of more secular governments in the West and the decline of religion as a primary organizing force in many people's lives during this period. Although \"religious\" violence has always had a political element, she argues, the political nature of warfare—even in wars with putatively religious justifications—has become even more pronounced in contemporary history.\n\nThe notion that \"religion\" is not a single belief, practice, or idea seems fairly obvious. But this claim is no less important for being self-evident. In the United States, debates about topics like birth control, abortion, and school prayer are often presented in the framework of a monolithic, uniform, publicly expressed \"religion\" in tension with a monolithic, uniform \"secular culture,\" one that mostly considers faith to be private and personal. As Armstrong argues, throughout the contemporary Western",
      "Abstract In this article, we present and review the evidence for two major biopsychosocial theories of the onset and course of bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs) that integrate behavioral, environmental, and neurobiological mechanisms: the reward hypersensitivity and the social and circadian rhythm disruption models. We describe the clinical features, spectrum, age of onset, and course of BSDs. We then discuss research designs relevant to demonstrating whether a hypothesized mechanism represents a correlate, vulnerability, or predictor of the course of BSDs, as well as important methodological issues. We next present the reward hypersensitivity model of BSD, followed by the social/circadian rhythm disruption model of BSD. For each model, we review evidence regarding whether the proposed underlying mechanism is associated with BSDs, provides vulnerability to the onset of BSDs, and predicts the course of BSDs. We then present a new integrated reward/circadian rhythm (RCR) dysregulation model of BSD and discuss how the RCR model explains the symptoms, onset, and course of BSDs. We end with recommendations for future research directions. Keywords: bipolar spectrum disorder, reward sensitivity, social rhythms, circadian rhythms\n\nIntroduction Emotions vary along a continuum of severity and affective lability is common. However, individuals who experience extreme mood lability may qualify for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder is characterized by extreme swings of mood (euphoria or irritability versus sadness), behavior (excessive goal striving, supercharged energy, and increased talkativeness versus anhedonia, fatigue, and lethargy), and cognition (grandiosity and racing thoughts versus worthlessness) occurring within the same individual. As discussed below, bipolar disorder occurs on a continuum of severity, and bipolar spectrum disorders (BSDs) are relatively common, occurring in 4.4% of the US population (Merikangas et al., 2007). BSDs are among the leading causes of functional disability worldwide for physical and psychological disorders (e.g., Miklowitz & Johnson, 2006) and are linked to high rates of interpersonal dysfunction and divorce, erratic work history, substance abuse, and suicide (for a review, see Miklowitz & Johnson, 2006). However, BSDs also are associated with high creativity and achievement (Miklowitz & Johnson, 2006). In this article, we describe two of the major biopsychosocial theories of BSD - the behavioral approach system (BAS) or reward hypersensitivity model and the social/circadian rhythm disruption model – and review the evidence for these theories. These models are relatively unique among theories of BSD in that each integrates neurobiological, behavioral, and environmental factors in explaining the onset and course of BSDs and proposes a single underlying mechanism that accounts for both poles of these disorders. In the sections that follow, we first describe the clinical features, spectrum, age of onset, and course of BSDs. We then discuss research designs that are relevant to demonstrating whether a hypothesized mechanism represents a vulnerability to BSD or a course predictor, rather than simply a correlate of BSD, as well as methodological difficulties in investigating mechanisms involved in the onset and course of BSD. We next present the reward hypersensitivity model, followed by the social/circadian rhythm disruption model of BSD. For each model, we review evidence regarding whether the proposed underlying mechanism is associated with BSDs, provides vulnerability to the onset of BSDs, and predicts the course of BSDs. We then present a new integrated reward/circadian rhythm (RCR) dysregulation model of BSD and discuss how the integrated model explains the features, onset, and course of BSDs. We end with recommendations for future research directions.\n\nResearch Design and Methodological Issues The two major theoretical models of BSD reviewed below – the reward hypersensitivity and social/circadian rhythm disruption models – hypothesize particular mechanisms as providing vulnerability to the onset and contributing to variations in the course of BSD. In this article, we use the term \"vulnerability\" to refer to factors that may contribute to the initial onset of BSD and thus may be a causal mechanism, whereas we use the term \"predictor of course\" to refer to risk factors that predict subsequent symptoms or functional status, relapse and recurrence of mood episodes, or progression to more severe bipolar disorders along the spectrum. Such course predictors may serve as mechanisms that maintain or worsen bipolar symptoms. Given these distinctions, different research study designs are relevant to establishing that a particular factor is a vulnerability versus a course predictor versus a correlate of BSD. Cross-sectional or retrospective studies that compare individuals with BSD to healthy controls or individuals with another disorder (e.g., unipolar depression) can establish factors that are correlates of BSD, but they are inadequate to demonstrate that these factors serve as vulnerabilities or maintenance factors because they cannot establish temporal precedence for the factor relative to symptom onset or exacerbation/recurrence. Even though cross-sectional or retrospective studies",

      "U.S. Loans Indirectly Financed Iraq Military : Foreign aid: Baker pushed through agriculture credits that helped Hussein free up money for arms.\n\nBush And Aid To Iraq. Last Of Three Parts\n\n\"I think we're seeing it the same way you guys are,\" Yeutter responded, according to a handwritten note by Baker on a memo about the Oct. 31, 1989, conversation. \"I'll get into it.\"\n\nBaker's task was to bring the Agriculture Department into line. Sketching out the problem, he asked Yeutter to reverse his department's position and approve the loans, according to classified documents obtained by The Times. The agriculture secretary, today the President's senior domestic policy adviser, apparently saw the light.\n\nEarlier in the month, President Bush had signed a secret national security directive ordering closer ties with Iraq and the Administration wanted to give Hussein's regime $1 billion in new financial aid, using an Agriculture Department loan-guarantee program to do it. But program officials were balking--saying that Iraq would never repay the money. And a potential scandal was brewing over irregularities in past loans to Baghdad.\n\nWASHINGTON — On the last day of October, 1989, nine months before Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait, Secretary of State James A. Baker III placed a telephone call to Agriculture Secretary Clayton K. Yeutter.\n\nThe new loans, pushed through at a time when U.S. intelligence reports indicated Hussein was spending heavily on developing nuclear weapons, were used by a credit-starved Iraq to feed its people, freeing up its cash reserves to finance the massive arms buildup that ended in war with the United States. The Bush Administration, apparently failing to understand the Iraqi dictator's intentions, indirectly helped pay for weapons that were ultimately used against American and allied troops.\n\nAnd the Agriculture Department loans, which ultimately went bad just as officials of the department and others had warned, were no aberration.\n\nClassified documents show that Bush, first as vice president and then as President, intervened repeatedly over a period of almost a decade to obtain special assistance for Saddam Hussein--financial aid as well as access to high-tech equipment that was critical to Iraq's quest for nuclear and chemical arms.\n\nThe policy of helping Hussein was conceived in the Ronald Reagan Administration to prop up Hussein in his long war with Iran and thus slow the spread of radical Islamic fundamentalism in the Middle East.\n\nBut the policy--and Bush's repeated personal involvement--continued well beyond the end of the Iran-Iraq war, which was concluded in the summer of 1988. And it did more than enable Hussein to survive: It helped him assemble the war machine that soon became a threat to his neighbors and to vital U.S. interests in the oil-rich Persian Gulf.\n\nIt was apparently a case of a policy pursued with head-down determination long after its original purpose had become obsolete by a President and senior officials who overestimated their own ability to influence a foreign leader. Until the eve of the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, senior Administration officials seemed convinced that, with continued U.S. aid, they could cajole Hussein into mending his ways.\n\nIn early October of 1989, the policy had gotten a major new push when Bush signed the top-secret National Security Decision Directive 26 ordering government agencies to expand political and economic ties with Iraq. In the weeks and months that followed, Iraq became the beneficiary of added financial aid as well as fresh access to so-called \"dual use\" technology--sophisticated equipment with both military and civilian applications.\n\nIn responding to the disclosures by The Times about Bush's role in providing assistance to Iraq, a White House spokesman said that, under both the Reagan and Bush administrations, \"U.S. policy toward Iraq was based on our national interest.\n\n\"Any actions undertaken by the then-vice president were in support of Administration policy,\" Deputy Press Secretary Roman Popadiuk said. He also stressed that the U.S. stance twoard Iraq \"shifted dramatically\" after its invasion of Kuwait. \"We were in the forefront of stemming that agression and of restoring freedom to Kuwait,\" he said.",

      "By day I'm a Kindergarten teacher. I hang out with 3 and 4-year olds and sometimes learn a little bit along the way. Sometimes they learn a little bit, too. Recently, a group of my youngest students asked where babies come from. I expertly dodged the question and, like a good educator, turned it back upon the asker,\"Where were you born?\" I asked a couple of them. I was surprised by their incredulous looks, like I'd ask them to explain Pythagoras's theorem.\n\n\"I don't know,\" each one, in turn, replied. It was a question, I could tell by their faces, that they didn't even know how to begin to process, nevermind answer.\n\nI was surprised.\n\nOf course, I probably shouldn't have been. To a 3 or 4-year old the question of where they were born must seem pretty irrelevant. They were born, they exist, they're playing cops and robbers with their friends. That's enough.\n\nLikewise, that was enough for me, as a Protestant, for 15 years. Since I came to Christ as a high school student up until I started exploring the roots of the Christian Church it was enough to know I was born, I existed, I was a Christian.\n\nOnce I began digging deeper into those roots, to learn about where Christianity—my faith—was born I realized, like my tiny Kindergartners, how little I knew.\n\nI was surprised to realize that my Kindergarten students didn't know where they were born. But, as I thought about it, I was in the exact same position in my faith life. I didn't know where I came from—where my faith, a central part of my life and identity, had its origins.\n\nSure, I knew about the Reformation. I knew about the church in the New Testament. I knew, roughly, the outline of history. But I didn't know the details, and the details are important. I never took the time, or spent the energy, to learn about where (and how) my faith was born.\n\nBlessed John Henry Cardinal Newman, a famous Anglican convert to Catholicism in the 19th century, made a pretty audacious claim about Protestants who read into the history of the Christian Church. He said,\n\nTo be deep in history is to cease to be Protestant.\n\nNewman was arguing that those who looked deeply into Church history, the development of the Canon of Scriptures, the development of doctrine, the Fathers of the Church, and the catalysts of the Reformation would cease to be Protestant. The alternative, in his mind, was to become a Catholic.\n\nAs I journeyed on this road towards Rome I thought it would be prudent to read some historical texts about the Reformation. After scouring the Internet for suggestions I landed on The Reformation by Diarmaid MacCulloch, a secular Scottish historian of some renown. My goal was to find as unbiased a source as possible covering the Reformation and the Catholic Counter-Reformation from a decent perspective. While MacCulloch's own social ethics lens certainly coloured some of his commentary, The Reformation was incredibly thorough—and incredibly eye-opening.\n\nI've told my Protestant friends this: If I wasn't already on this journey towards becoming Catholic, after reading MacCulloch's massive 864-page tome, I would find it very difficult to remain Protestant.\n\nThat's the truth.\n\nBecause the truth is, in my reading, the Protestant movement began as a protest. A protest against corruption in the Church and its teachings but also as a product of its time.\n\nThe Church was corrupt.\n\nWhat I failed to grasp as a Protestant was that the Church is the first to admit that.\n\nThe Church was doing some pretty ridiculous and those things needed to be reformed. But what started as a reform movement from within the Church quickly got out of hand.\n\nInteresting, MacCulloch argues that if there's any one explanation for the Reformation (and the lack of a Reformation in the Eastern Orthodox churches) was because, suddenly, Europeans could read the Bible in a new language: Greek.\n\nIn fact it was a Church emerging out of the Dark Ages and discovering biblical literature, theology, and, indeed, ancient Greek manuscripts that prompted the Reformation as much as the corruption of the Church. It was a product of the times.\n\nSuddenly, rich theological works that had been lost were being re-read and re-discovered. Suddenly, the Bible was being made available to the average layperson thanks, first of all, to the Catholic Church. But these Bibles, and their theology, needed an interpreter and this is where the Reformation quickly got out of hand.\n\nIn fact Martin Luther himself, the father of the Reformation and the Lutheran Church, tried desperately to get the",

      "ENLARGE Police investigate the scene where Nykea Aldridge was shot dead in Chicago, Aug. 26. Photo: Zuma Press .\n\nBy Holman W. Jenkins, Jr. Sept. 23, 2016 6:10 p.m. ET 778 COMMENTS\n\nOne of the brothers charged in the August shooting death of mother-of-four Nykea Aldridge in Chicago, which prompted a controversial tweet from Donald Trump appealing for black support (\"VOTE TRUMP!\"), was released only two weeks earlier on a firearms violation.\n\nDitto the murderer of 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, whose 2013 killing was adopted as a symbol by the Obama administration. Her killer had also recently been released on a weapons charge.\n\nChicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson last month explained reality to the Chicago Tribune TRNC -0.58 % : Of the 1,400 people on the city's \"Strategic Subject List\" of those believed responsible for its gun violence, most have been arrested and released multiple times on gun charges. By one count (that of the Chicago Sun-Times) 75% of those booked on gun violations in the first three months of 2016 were back on the streets by June.\n\nOpinion Journal Video Your browser does not support HTML5 video. 0:00 / 0:00 Skip >> Business World Columnist Holman Jenkins Jr. on the indictment of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's aides. Photo credit: Associated Press. .\n\n\"Clearly, [gun felons] don't think there's a consequence to their actions,\" Supt. Johnson said in a public news conference. \"And to be quite honest, we're showing them that there's not. If we're not going to keep you in jail because you choose to use a gun, then what are we doing?\"\n\nIn New York in the heyday of stop-and-frisk, these killers would not have been released—something noticeable even to a real-estate developer not otherwise known for the depth of his public-policy acumen.\n\nThose convicted on firearms violations were hit with serious jail time. Even when aggressive stop-and-frisk didn't result in a conviction, an illegal gun was confiscated, and word went out that packing an unlicensed weapon was likely to be unavailing given the city's unrelenting focus on gun violators.\n\nAll this was part of a deliberate strategy in the 1990s to reduce New York's then-towering murder rate. Chicago's murder rate today is a bit of an anomaly in an America where crime has been dropping until recently, but it's not a product of the city not knowing what to do.\n\nTo many liberal and African-American activists not living under immediate threat of gun violence, however, stop-and-frisk has become unacceptable. They reject the tactic because police, some of whom are white, would inevitably be stopping mostly black and Hispanic citizens on the street in search of illegal weapons.\n\nThus Mayor Rahm Emanuel, who sees his political career going down the drain due to the killings, has every reason to believe his career would only go down the drain faster if he took steps that he knows would save Chicagoans' lives. If he has any doubt, he need only look at the New York Times NYT 0.16 % 's home page on Friday. Its headline on Mr. Trump's endorsement of stop-and-frisk judged the most urgent lesson for the public to be: \"Trump Crime Plan Seen as Hitting Minorities Harder.\"\n\nAt bottom, it's this rottenness of American political culture that allows Mr. Trump, for all his flaws as a candidate and human being, to find traction with so many voters. Not because he's a uniquely attractive individual, but because he's uniquely willing to violate the political taboos and challenge the status quo. Indeed, his most insidious offense may be his suggestion that some problems aren't intractable.\n\nTake another example of rottenness. On Thursday, U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara indicted nine associates of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo for bribes in connection with development grants for upstate. The region's economic problems for the past half century are not due to a lack of government-backed capitalism, such as Gov. Cuomo's adopted fetish for nanotechnology. Upstate's problems stem from tax, regulatory and land-use policies designed to flatter the priorities and prejudices of wealthy New York City liberals.\n\nThe immediately relevant example is Gov. Cuomo's ban on fracking, undoubtedly undertaken with an eye on burnishing his presidential bona fides with his party's liberal greens. His subsequent blather about nanotechnology, his unlimbering of state development funds, were never seriously meant to compensate residents on the jobs and wealth they'd be forgoing. These gestures (with taxpayer money) merely give the governor something to say when the subject comes up. Everyone's entitled to the presumption of innocence, and much of",

      "When compared with our closest relatives, such as chimpanzees and gorillas, the human mating strategy is a bit of an oddity. In fact, within the entire animal kingdom, creatures that practice monogamy are exceedingly rare, which raises the question of why humans have made it the social norm. A new study, published this week in Nature Communications, reports that it might not have so much to do with love and loyalty, but with syphilis and chlamydia instead.\n\nWhen anthropologists and biologists pick apart our own species, Homo sapiens, many have come to conclude that all the evidence – from males being on average larger than females to girls reaching sexual maturity earlier than boys – seems to point to the fact that our natural mating system should be polygyny, in which one male mates with many females. So why, then, do we see monogamy being socially imposed across a multitude of different cultures?\n\nThe researchers of the new study suggest it could all come down to the impact of sexually transmitted infections, coupled with peer pressure, as larger communities of people settled in one place during the advent of agriculture. Using computer models, the researchers ran simulations of different mating behaviors, and then assessed how well they did when bacterial sexual infections, such as chlamydia, syphilis, and gonorrhoea, were introduced. In addition to that, they then added another dimension of societal pressure.\n\n\"This research shows how events in natural systems, such as the spread of contagious diseases, can strongly influence the development of social norms and in particular our group-oriented judgments,\" explains Chris Bauch of the University of Waterloo, Canada, who co-authored the study, in a statement. \"Our research illustrates how mathematical models are not only used to predict the future, but also to understand the past.\"\n\nThey found that in smaller polygynous communities, which is what many think early hunter-gatherers formed, outbreaks of STIs were quickly resolved. This meant that they produced more offspring than those who formed monogamous relationships. But the researchers then found that there was a shift when communities grew in size. Here they found that STIs became endemic if the society was largely polygamous, reducing the male's fertility, and therefore meaning that those who stayed monogamous became more successful. When this was paired with the monogamous couples punishing the polygamous ones, sticking with just one partner was the best strategy.\n\nDespite this, there are still those who don't buy into the idea that we as a species are naturally polygynous. By looking at the few surviving hunter-gatherer societies left, which are frequently used by anthropologists as a window into our past, monogamy is actually more common than you might expect. And the fact that in a species in which the sex ratio is roughly 50/50, like our own, polygyny creates a whole bunch of non-reproducing males who could become socially disruptive. Polygyny is also disadvantageous to females in such societies, who not only tend to have fewer offspring as they compete with other females, but also face an increased threat of infanticide from outside males.\n\nMain image: Vince Smith/Flickr CC BY 2.0",

      "About Atom Tables\n\n6 minutes to read\n\nIn this article\n\nAn atom table is a system-defined table that stores strings and corresponding identifiers. An application places a string in an atom table and receives a 16-bit integer, called an atom, that can be used to access the string. A string that has been placed in an atom table is called an atom name.\n\nThe system provides a number of atom tables. Each atom table serves a different purpose. For example, Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE) applications use the global atom table to share item-name and topic-name strings with other applications. Rather than passing actual strings, a DDE application passes global atoms to its partner application. The partner uses the atoms to obtain the strings from the atom table.\n\nApplications can use local atom tables to store their own item-name associations.\n\nThe system uses atom tables that are not directly accessible to applications. However, the application uses these atoms when calling a variety of functions. For example, registered clipboard formats are stored in an internal atom table used by the system. An application adds atoms to this atom table using the RegisterClipboardFormat function. Also, registered classes are stored in an internal atom table used by the system. An application adds atoms to this atom table using the RegisterClass or RegisterClassEx function.\n\nThe following topics are discussed in this section.\n\nGlobal Atom Table\n\nThe global atom table is available to all applications. When an application places a string in the global atom table, the system generates an atom that is unique throughout the system. Any application that has the atom can obtain the string it identifies by querying the global atom table.\n\nAn application that defines a private DDE-data format for sharing data with other applications should place the format name in the global atom table. This technique prevents conflicts with the names of formats defined by the system or by other applications, and makes the identifiers (atoms) for the messages or formats available to the other applications.\n\nLocal Atom Tables\n\nAn application can use a local atom table to efficiently manage a large number of strings used only within the application. These strings, and the associated atoms, are available only to the application that created the table.\n\nAn application requiring the same string in a number of structures can reduce memory usage by using a local atom table. Rather than copying the string into each structure, the application can place the string in the atom table and include the resulting atom in the structures. In this way, a string appears only once in memory but can be used many times in the application.\n\nApplications can also use local atom tables to save time when searching for a particular string. To perform a search, an application need only place the search string in the atom table and compare the resulting atom with the atoms in the relevant structures. Comparing atoms is typically faster than comparing strings.\n\nAtom tables are implemented as hash tables. By default, a local atom table uses 37 buckets for its hash table. However, you can change the number of buckets used by calling the InitAtomTable function. If the application calls InitAtomTable, however, it must do so before calling any other atom-management functions.\n\nAtom Types\n\nApplications can create two types of atoms: string atoms and integer atoms. The values of integer atoms and string atoms do not overlap, so both types of atoms can be used in the same block of code.\n\nSeveral functions accept either strings or atoms as parameters. When passing an atom to these functions, an application can use the MAKEINTATOM macro to convert the atom into a form that can be used by the function.\n\nThe following sections describe atom types.\n\nString Atoms\n\nWhen applications pass null-terminated strings to the GlobalAddAtom, AddAtom, GlobalFindAtom, and FindAtom functions, they receive string atoms (16-bit integers) in return. String atoms have the following properties:\n\nThe values of string atoms are in the range 0xC000 (MAXINTATOM) through 0xFFFF.\n\nCase is not significant in searches for an atom name in an atom table. Also, the entire string must match in a search operation; no substring matching is performed.\n\nThe string associated with a string atom can be no more than 255 bytes in size. This limitation applies to all atom functions.\n\nA reference count is associated with each atom name. The count is incremented each time the atom name is added to the table and decremented each time the atom name is deleted from it. This prevents different users of the same string atom from destroying each other's atom names. When the reference count for an atom name equals zero, the system removes the atom and the atom name from the table.\n\nInteger Atoms\n\nInteger atoms differ from string atoms in the following ways:\n\nThe values of integer atoms are in the range 0x0001 through",

      "When the Democratic presidential candidates debate here Sunday, their immediate goal will be to shore up their support in Iowa and New Hampshire, where Democrats vote early next month in close races.\n\nBut the Charleston backdrop also is significant.\n\nThe debate stage will be down the street from \"Mother Emanuel,\" the AME church where nine African-Americans were slain in June during a Bible study, thrusting South Carolina into the national spotlight and the gun control debate.\n\nThe S.C. setting also is a reminder of the commanding lead Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton has in the Palmetto State, a lead that could propel her to her party's nomination.\n\nSIGN UP\n\nA decisive win in South Carolina's Feb. 27 Democratic presidential primary would serve as Clinton's \"firewall\" – protecting her against the impact of potential losses in earlier-voting Iowa and New Hampshire.\n\nU.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' rise in polls in those states is raising questions about the supposed inevitability of the former secretary of state's nomination.\n\nHowever, the S.C. contest will be different, in large part because it will be the first test of the Democratic candidates' support among African-American voters.\n\nBlack voters, one of the Democratic Party's most loyal voting blocs, make up only a tiny portion of the voters in Iowa and New Hampshire. But they make up more than half of South Carolina's Democratic voters.\n\nAfter South Carolina, the Democratic contest will move across the South, with large numbers of African-American voters, into more than two dozen states in March.\n\nWinning South Carolina would set up Clinton to win the Democratic nomination, said College of Charleston political scientist Gibbs Knotts, adding a Clinton victory also is the most likely outcome in South Carolina, where some Democrats tend to be more conservative.\n\n\"Clinton is the ultimate moderate Democrat,\" he said. \"She gets pushed by (U.S. Sen.) Elizabeth Warren (a Massachusetts Democrat) and Bernie Sanders because she's more willing to cross the aisle and stake out hawkish positions on defense.\"\n\nClinton's firewall\n\nFormer Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley also will participate in Sunday's debate on NBC. But, so far, the Democratic race has been between Clinton, a former secretary of state and first lady propelled by a family legacy, and Sanders, a Vermont independent and self-described democratic socialist with populist appeal.\n\nIn South Carolina, Clinton leads by 40 percentage points, according to an average of polls.\n\nTo gain that advantage, Clinton has waged an aggressive statewide grassroots campaign. She has built coalitions focused heavily on African-Americans, including mayors and state legislators. She also has secured endorsements from two former S.C. governors and other Democratic leaders. High-profile surrogates – from U.S. Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey to TV personality Star Jones – also have campaigned for her.\n\nIn an attempt to cut into Clinton's lead with S.C. black voters, Sanders has touted its alliances with Black Lives Matter activists and student leaders at historically black colleges and universities.\n\nThe Sanders campaign – with more than 50 paid S.C. staffers and offices across the state – says its volunteers have knocked on more than 165,000 doors statewide and attempted to reach 500,000 voters, roughly the number of ballots cast in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary.\n\nThe Clinton camp says it hit that mark in November.\n\nNot like Obama\n\nWins by Sanders in Iowa and New Hampshire could be game changers, proving – as President Barack Obama did by winning Iowa in 2008 against Clinton – that Sanders is electable and shift the tides in South Carolina in his favor, Sanders' S.C. director Chris Covert says.\n\nBut Sanders' S.C. poll numbers only have inched up thus far.\n\nPolls put Sanders' support among black S.C. Democratic voters at 8 percent in November and 19 percent in December. By comparison, Clinton had 80 percent support from S.C. African-Americans in both polls.\n\nSanders also has more ground to make up against Clinton than Obama did in 2008.\n\nIn 2008, Obama was less of an underdog to Clinton in South Carolina than Sanders is this year.\n\nIn that race, Obama tied Clinton in South Carolina in mid-December. This primary season, Sanders trailed Clinton by 36 percentage points in mid-December.\n\nTaking nothing for granted\n\nStill, the possibility of Sanders gaining traction in the Palmetto State if he wins Iowa is not lost of S.C. Democrats.\n\n\"It's just like the weak spot for Barack Obama was his skin color, but he got cured of that in Iowa,\" U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-Columbia, told The Washington Post.\n\n\"If (Sanders) comes out of Iowa and New Hampshire with big victories ... hey, man, it could very well",

Some groups gather wild food that's growing in a public space, such as a traffic median; others glean surplus fruit from around the neighborhood.\n\nUrban fruit-harvesting engages a community, makes community members aware of their own local (and often organic) food resources, provides an opportunity for neighbors to meet over the boughs of fruit trees, and brings up important questions about public space. And in this economy the price is right.\n\nSome groups harvest some fruit for themselves, some for fruit-tree owners, and some for local hunger organizations. Often groups provide fruit maps to local neighborhoods so harvesters know where to find the good stuff. Groups also might orchestrate jam-making nights, organize twilight fruit tours for first-time pickers, or provide an easy way to register your own trees if you've got a surplus.\n\nThe difference between now and ancient times is that your neighbors probably aren't farmers and probably didn't purposefully leave that food thinking it would be gleaned. But, they might be drowning in fruit from their one pear tree, or they don't know what to do with their loquats.\n\nSince you won't be able to fall back on biblical law when your neighbors ask what you're doing among their bushes and branches, it's best to read up on how groups harvest properly and what they recommend.\n\nGathering, Gleaning, and Harvesting Fruit Around the World\n\nBerkeley and Santa Clara, California: Village Harvest organizes backyard fruit harvesting, provides education on fruit tree care, and information on food preservation.\n\nBoston: Boston Area Gleaners works with farmers and Earthworks works to provide urban residents with free fruit and essential nutrition by planting, maintaining, and harvesting fruit from community trees.\n\nSome Tips on Gleaning According to a report done on KCRW's Good Food, picking fruit that spills over onto public space, (even if the tree is planted on private property) is not illegal. But if you go out in hopes of scoring something sweet, follow some hints from Fallen Fruit: Ask first or leave a note on a door with your contact information\n\nTake only what you need\n\nSay \"hi\" to strangers\n\nShare your food\n\nTake a friend\n\nGo by foot\n\nCalifornia, Idaho, and Washington: The six chapters of Backyard Harvest collect food from private property and commercial farms.\n\nLos Angeles: Fallen Fruit started as an activist art project. They have many maps of LA neighborhoods with publicly accessible fruit trees and they encourage you to submit your own Public Fruit Map.\n\nNew York City: There aren't as many opportunities to harvest fruit but there are people who enthusiastically harvest fruit from mulberry trees when the season rolls around in late June. If you look closely you might be able to find cherries, figs, and apricots too.\n\nOakland, California: Asiya Wadud works at the bar at Chez Pannise by day and encourages people to see their surrounding neighborhoods as a \"veritable edible map\" with her group Forage Oakland by night. The group also runs fruit exchanges.\n\nPhiladelphia: The Philadelphia Orchard Project plants their own trees in vacant lots, community gardens, and schoolyards for all to share.\n\nPortland, Oregon: The Portland Fruit Tree Project and Urban Edibles can show you how to find cherries, walnut trees, grapes, and more.\n\nRiverside, California: Where the city slogan is \"City Of Trees\" Urban Fruit Harvesting uses Twitter, Facebook, and MySpace to get the word out and find new trees.\n\nSeattle: Community Harvest of Southwest Seattle picks and donates neighborhood fruit to local food banks with help from volunteers.\n\nAll over the U.S.: The Society of St. Andrew, a religious group, gleans food from all over the country, especially in the South.\n\nCanada: Groups are widespread. The following all work toward similar goals.\n\nEngland: Abundance Manchester picks fruit from gardens and public trees and Grow Sheffield runs the Abundance Fruit Harvest and publishes a handbook as a guide to community urban harvesting.\n\nIf your city isn't listed, try neighborhoodfruit.com for a listing of 5,000 public fruit trees and an online system for swapping fruit.\n\nThis post may contain links to Amazon or other partners;",

San Francisco (being the city of extremes) will have a tour of a BDSM porn production studio for us to visit. Kink.com (NSFW) offers a tour of their production studio located at the Armory Studios (SFW) – formerly known as the San Francisco National Guard Armory and Arsenal located at the corner of 14th and Mission Street.\n\nSome history for you history buffs: The building is a 200,000 square foot reproduction Moorish Castle. It was completed in 1914 and was used as a National Guard facility until 1976. It retains original period details including wainscoting, stone staircases, sweeping corridors, cavernous access to Mission Creek,and a gigantic drill court spanning almost an acre. The building served as both a barricade and safety point for officers during rioting in San Francisco in 1934.\n\nArmory Studios, LLC bought the space in 2007 and here it is, now a Kink BDSM porn studio production tour! They offer group tours almost every day and you can get tickets here.\n\nThe beginning of the Kink BDSM porn studio tour starts with a little introduction from our tour guide.\n\nThe usual: do not touch anything unless the tour guide explicitly says you can (and why would you?!) and do not wander off alone or get lost.\n\nFor you vanilla folks (or any chick who hasn't read the craptastic 50 shades of grey or isn't into it), the term BDSM formed by joining the term B&D (bondage and discipline) with S&M(sadomasochism, or sadism and masochism).\n\nIt's a catch-all phrase for anybody that wants to involve themselves with bondage, dominance, submissive, role-playing, and other various non-normative activities like cross-dressing, latex & rubber play, etc. If you're interested in this type of thing – be sure to practice SAFE and INFORMATIVE (consensual) sex!\n\nOtherwise….feel free to get your FREAK ON.\n\nThe different sets\n\nThe first room – I was able to sit in a large…bird cage and got locked up with some of the people in our group! Jeremy was actually able to fit in this cage too – all 6'3 of him but it was a much tighter squeeze and not at all comfortable. This was a nice little segue into the sets. The rooms (sets) are much bigger than anticipated with lots of open and empty space – we figured this is for all the equipment needed during filming and the rest of the crew to sit and stand.\n\nAnother set reminded me of the Saw movie with how…creepy and \"dirty\" it was to get your freak on. We also toured a regular looking \"apartment\" as well as an interrogation room with a one-way mirror and a padded room for the psycho in you!\n\nThere was the typical classroom with desks and chairs for people trying to seduce their teachers or pupils. Along the hallways, there were HUGE tubs of lube….the kind you could find on Amazon during their prime day sale. haha.\n\nUltimate Surrender\n\nAnother room we were able to explore was the wrestling room. Also known as Ultimate Surrender (NSFW). Two people of the same sex wrestle each other (same height, weight, etc.) and you earn points by being the more dominant (dom) person while the other person is considered the sub (submissive).\n\nThe director is the referee and you get points by grabbing their ass, grabbing a boob, sitting on their face, \"accidentally\" slipping in two fingers, making them orgasm, and what not. They used to allow real guests/visitors sit on the sidelines and cheer but I think it got a little too rowdy so they've put a hold on visitors for now.\n\nThe Artwork\n\nOne of the coolest things that stood out on the tour was the works of art all neatly lined up on the walls. Not something most people would have in the hallway of their home but maybe in your own sexual playroom or dungeon. This isn't for the faint of heart or sexually conservative but the paintings are really awesome in that sublime way.\n\nAnybody who participates in Kink.com is considered a model and everything is consensual. They are a condom-optional studio and models get tested every two weeks for any STDs.\n\nRates for female models range from $500-1300 per shoot. Men",

      "With shackles around her feet, Dasyl Jeanette Rios, who had just been declared mentally incompetent, screamed as a sheriff's officer dragged her by her feet down the hallway of a Florida courthouse on Monday morning.\n\nThe incident was caught on video and sparked an investigation into the actions of Sheriff Deputy Christopher Johnson, the Sun Sentinel reported. \"I am concerned by the way the deputy handled this situation, because there were other courses of action he could have taken,\" Sheriff Scott Israel said in a statement. \"Internal Affairs has initiated a complete and comprehensive investigation, and the deputy has been placed on restricted duty pending the outcome.\"\n\n\"Stop! You're hurting me! You're f—— hurting me!\" Rios screams in the opening of the video. \"I hate my life! I wish they would kill me already! Why do I have to be alive?\"\n\nJohnson replies, saying that he gave her a chance. Rios: \"You didn't give nobody a chance. All I wanted to do was sob for a few minutes. Cry. I wanted to cry for a few minutes because my life is in your hands.\"\n\nThe video was shot by attorney Bill Gelin, who happened to be in the hallway as the events unfolded. \"This is really barbaric, and I'm just extremely disappointed,\" he told WSVN. \"We all work together in the court system, particularly in the criminal justice system, and this just gives everybody a black eye.\"\n\nBut the video doesn't show why Johnson felt compelled to restrain Rios in the first place.\n\nThe Sun Sentinel reported that Rios had just left court for a misdemeanor case and is also held without bond for violating probation and drug possession. According to one report, Assistant Public Defender Rhonda Boettcher said Rios was heard arguing with a female deputy in the courtroom after the hearing before Johnson intervened and escorted her to the hallway. \"Once there,\" Boettcher said \"Rios sat on a bench and started to cry.\"\n\nRios's mother told WSVN that while she was in the hallway she told Johnson: \"Please give me a minute. I just want to cry,'\"\n\nJohnson felt that Rios was \"disturbing the public,\" according to the Daily Beast. \"Fearing she would cause a commotion in the public area, I then physically grabbed inmate Rios by her leg restraints and pulled her back to the D10-door,\" Johnson stated in his report. In a supplemental report Deputy Anthony Pulitano added Johnson asked Rios two times if she would walk on her own.\n\n\"He basically picked up this girl, yanked her off the bench, and started dragging her through the hallway,\"Assistant Public Defender Lynn DeSanti told the Sun Sentinel. \"I said, 'Stop it! What are you doing to her?' But he just told her, 'You don't want to walk? I'm going to drag you.' \"\n\nGelin told the Sun Sentinel: \"The truly disgusting part is, during that entire breakdown, you can hear her telling them she's mentally ill. There's no excuse.\"\n\nRios remains in jail without bond.",
      "Smart guns are supposed to be safer than traditional weapons. They're designed to only fire when paired with a second piece of technology that identifies the shooter, like an electronic chip or a fingerprint.\n\nSupporters say they could stop accidental shootings or misfires. And they've been lauded by law enforcement to prevent criminals from using stolen or misplaced guns.\n\nHowever, like any technology, they're not unhackable.\n\nA hacker known by the pseudonym Plore doesn't want to put a stop to smart guns, but he wants the firearm industry that's increasingly manufacturing these devices to know that they can be hacked.\n\nThe model Plore hacked is called the Armatix IPI. It pairs electronically with a smart watch so that only the person wearing the watch can fire it. The devices authenticate users via radio signals, electronically talking to each other within a small range.\n\nPlore broke the security features in three different ways, including jamming radio signals in the weapon and watch so the gun couldn't be fired, and shooting the gun with no watch nearby by placing strong magnets next to the weapon.\n\n\"Future smart guns might use different authorization mechanisms,\" Plore said. \"But you'd want to make future smart guns robust against interference, intentional or unintentional, even if it doesn't use radio signals.\"\n\nOne hack involved breaking the gun's range restrictions. The gun is only supposed to work if it's within a foot of the watch. But Plore extended the range by using radio devices to trick the gun into thinking the watch was closer than it was.\n\nAnother hack involved stopping the gun from firing. Plore created a device that emits the same 900 megahertz frequency of the gun and watch -- devices like baby monitors or cordless phones use this frequency, too. His device simulated interference, effectively confusing the gun and watch and rendering them useless.\n\nRelated: Mac malware caught silently spying on computer users\n\nThe main reason people are interested in smart guns is to ensure only the owners can control them. But it's possible to fire the weapon without the watch around, Plore found.\n\nThe hacker placed strong magnets next to the body of the gun. That simple solution allowed the gun to be fired.\n\nArmatix does not dispute Plore's findings, but says the hack was beyond the scope of the gun's design. \"[The iP1] had been focused on suppressing the ability to shoot, when a third person (e.g. a child or a normal user) accesses the weapon in the heat of the moment and tries to use it,\" wrote Helmut Brandtner, Amratix's managing director, in an email to CNN Tech. \"There was never the demand to avoid the usage by a well prepared attacker or a skilled hacker.\"\n\nComparing the iP1 to any secure system, Brandtner added, \"If you have access to a safety device for a sufficient time, you are able to modify it and probably can misuse it.\"\n\nPlore is presenting his findings at the Defcon security conference this week. He says that while the instruments he used to study the problem cost thousands, the tools he created to execute the three attacks cost less than $50.\n\nIt's not the first time magnets have been used to hack smart devices. A similar tactic was used to hack into a safe.\n\n\"You see the same mistakes repeated,\" he said. \"Safes and guns aren't the same devices, but conceptually it was the same attack.\"\n\nThere are many smart-gun skeptics. Two Arizona lawmakers recently said the technology is still too new and could be dangerous. The NRA has said that while it's not against smart guns, it does not support legislative restrictions on acquiring non-smart guns.\n\nSmart guns are not yet widespread, and the Armatix IPI was the only weapon of its type easily accessible to Plore, he said. So while it's cheap to execute these hacks, a real-world scenario is relatively unlikely.\n\nPlore wants to make sure manufacturers are aware of these flaws in order to make future smart guns safer.\n\n\"If you're going to buy one, you should get what's on the label,\" he said. \"You should be able to really get something that provides meaningful security.\"",

      "Kazakhstan's government sanctioned a foundation called WikiBilim last year, which creates material for a Kazakh Wikipedia. The organisation, which has 25 staff, is backed by Kazakhstan's sovereign oil wealth fund and run by Rauan Kenzhekhanuly, an ex-government official.\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation, the non-profit organisation that runs Wikipedia, provided a $16,600 grant from visitor donations and Mr Wales named Mr Kenzhekhanuly the first ever \"Wikipedian of the Year\" in 2011 .\n\nWikipedia contributors in the West have questioned whether the Wikimedia Foundation and Mr Wales should be supporting a project backed by a government that Human Rights Watch said earlier this month was mounting a \"growing crackdown on free speech\" . Independent media outlets have been hauled before courts and shut down.\n\nLast week, Mr Wales denied his or the Wikimedia Foundation's work in Kazakhstan supported the regime.\n\nOn his Talk page on Wikipedia , he argued he takes a \"thoughtful and nuanced\" position on \"working with companies and organization in difficult jurisdictions\".\n\n\"In Kazakhstan, there is a great group of volunteer editors - just like you - who are working in a non-political way with their own government to transition an older encyclopedia into Wikipedia, as well as to recruit quality volunteers,\" he said.\n\n\"Like many people, I have concerns about potential problems, but so far I have been pleased with what I have seen.\"\n\nIn a separate discussion on Quora, he added that \"no one has produced any evidence of any kind of manipulation of Kazakh Wikipedia\".\n\nMr Wales shut down the discussion on his Talk page, saying it had become \"absurd\", when critics raised his friendship with Tony Blair, who is advising the Kazakh dictator Nursultan Nazarbayev, reportedly for $13 million. Mr Blair was a guest at Mr Wales' wedding to his former diary secretary Kate Garvey in October, and the men have visited Richard Branson's private island in the Caribbean.\n\n\"That's just totally weird and irrelevant,\" said Mr Wales as he shut down the discussion.\n\n\"I have nothing to do with his consulting in Kazakhstan, and I have many political (and religious) disagreements with him, which I'm quite open about.\n\n\"I have lots of friends, many from difficult countries, many who are politicians, and I don't necessarily agree with everything they say (nor do they agree with me). But frankly, my personal life has absolutely nothing to do with Kazakhstan!\"\n\nThe discussion was later reopened. He told The Telegraph attempts to link Mr Blair's work with Wikipedia in kazakhstan were the work of \"some deranged conspiracy theorists\".\n\nThe friendship was raised by Andreas Kolbe, a prolific UK-based Wikipedia contributor and frequent critic of the way the Wikimedia Foundation operates. Mr Wales told him to \"please stay off my Talk page\".\n\n\"I've had enough of you. I'll delete anything you post there, and if you persist, I'll ask others to help delete anything you post there,\" he said.\n\nMr Wales, who said he was strongly committed to free speech, is due to visit Kazakhstan in 2013 according to Rauan Kenzhekhanuly.",
      "Senate Democrats have a new strategy for easing Bernie Sanders out of the presidential campaign: Flatter him and give him some space.\n\nWith Sanders on his way to Washington on Thursday, his colleagues in the Senate are softening their once-sharp rhetoric toward the independent senator who ran an insurgent campaign against Hillary Clinton. Though Sanders declined to concede after Clinton clinched the Democratic nomination this week, Senate Democrats are optimistic Sanders won't continue his fight to the party's convention in Philadelphia.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nBut they want to give him room to coalesce his movement behind Clinton — on his own terms.\n\nSen. Bill Nelson of Florida, who called on Sanders to \"stand down now\" as voters were heading to the polls during Tuesday's primaries, said Wednesday that he was confident the Vermont senator was, indeed, standing down.\n\nSen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico had warned earlier that Sanders risked diminishing his political capital to help craft the party's convention platform if he refused to admit defeat to Clinton. But he was sounding a much more optimistic tone on Wednesday — even though Sanders still hadn't conceded.\n\n\"I don't think I'm in the business of offering Sen. Sanders advice,\" Heinrich said. \"I think Bernie's going to do the right thing, and I think we're at a point now where it's time to think about how we make sure Donald Trump doesn't make it into the White House. But … he certainly earned the right to do that on his time frame.\"\n\nSanders will host a rally for supporters at RFK Stadium in Washington, but the real focus Thursday will be on his separate meetings with President Barack Obama and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.).\n\nDemocrats expect Sanders' visit to be placid and constructive — not divisive. While Democrats are aware Sanders could reject Obama and Reid's unity pleas, aides said it was more likely the beginning of the party's internal healing process.\n\nAt times, Reid has attacked Sanders for running a quixotic campaign that wore on despite insurmountable odds. But the top Senate Democrat has backed off the pressure somewhat since he suggested Sanders would \"lose\" and should \"give up.\"\n\nHe's also kept lines of communication open with both Sanders and his wife, Jane — and arranged Thursday's meeting through back-channel talks with Jane Sanders, sources said. Reid and the candidate's wife met in person two weeks ago, when she was in Washington to attend an annual luncheon for Senate spouses.\n\nFor his part, Reid declined to elaborate on what he plans to tell Sanders.\n\n\"I'll talk to Bernie tomorrow, and I'll talk to you guys after I do that,\" Reid told reporters Wednesday. \"Until then, I think I'm better off just keeping quiet about it.\"\n\nNew York Sen. Chuck Schumer, the presumed successor to Reid next year, added that Sanders has been a \"very constructive influence\" on Democrats during the Vermont senator's presidential campaign.\n\nAt times, however, Sanders' impact hasn't been as well-received.\n\nSenate Democrats and Sanders have been locked in a delicate dance for months, with a vast majority of the caucus aligned behind Clinton yet unwilling to alienate a longtime colleague who has invigorated the progressive movement. But as Clinton marched closer to the nomination, relations between Democratic senators and Sanders grew increasingly testy, particularly after a raucous convention in Reid's home state of Nevada, where Sen. Barbara Boxer (D-Calif.) was shouted down by Sanders backers.\n\nIn his primary night speech in Santa Monica, California, Sanders pledged to continue his presidential ambitions to the July party convention, declaring to his supporters that \"the struggle continues.\" Clinton has secured the majority of pledged delegates, with just one contest left in the primary season: Washington, D.C., on June 14.\n\nBut with the math in place for Clinton and the former secretary of state declaring victory, even Sanders' endorsers are focusing on rallying the Democratic Party behind her. In an interview, Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley — the sole Senate Democrat to endorse Sanders during the race — said: \"I do believe that we now have our nominee. Our nominee is Secretary Clinton.\"\n\nMerkley said it is up to three key groups — the Democratic National Committee, Clinton's campaign and Sanders' campaign — to take the lead in charting the path to party unity.\n\n\"Much is at stake. There is a lot that needs to be done to repair the path to make sure everyone has felt that they had been heard [and] their views had been respected,\" said Merkley, who also pressured the party to consider key Sanders priorities such as reducing fossil fuel reliance, reforming campaign finance laws and raising the minimum wage.\n\nWhether he fights it out to the convention or not, Sanders will carry with him more influence than ever before in his long career in politics, armed with the support of millions of grass-roots backers and a megaph",
      "Around 77 per cent of British jihadists have links to so-called \"non-violent\" Islamists and extremists, an analysis of 113 terrorists by the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change (TBIGC) has found.\n\nThe study's authors looked at the jihadists' operations between the 1980s up until the present day in Syria and Iraq, and concluded by advocating a crackdown on the extremists' free speech.\n\nFormer Labour Prime Minister Mr. Blair introduced the Racial and Religious Hatred Act of 2006, outlawing \"religious hatred\", and is a proponent of restricting free speech to tackle terror as well as perceived bigotry.\n\n6 individuals have shaped the British jihadi movement, with 67% of #UKjihadis tied to them. Read our new report: https://t.co/JdMTkDh6Dy pic.twitter.com/GQCPyktNdk — Tony Blair Institute (@InstituteGC) September 29, 2017\n\nThe study found that just six prolific extremists appear to have shaped the British jihadist movement, with 67 per cent of British jihadists tied either directly or indirectly to them.\n\nConvicted Islamic State recruiter Anjem Choudary (pictured, right) is one of them, as is his teacher, Omar Bakri Mohammed (pictured, left); Abu Hamza (pictured, centre), who preached at the Finsbury Park Mosque; Abdullah el-Faisal, who was deported to Jamaica in 2007; Abu Qatada, a radical cleric deported to Jordan; and Hani al-Sibai, a preacher who still lives in London.\n\nThe study made a raft of other interesting findings, including that jihadism appears to have a strong family component, with 61 per cent of the of women sampled having relatives involved in jihadi activity and 30 per cent of the men.\n\nLondon dominates the UK's jihadist scene, with 49 per cent of those in the study based in the capital.\n\nA further 58 per cent of the men studied had spent time in prison and all but 13 per cent of them had been incarcerated for crimes related to jihadism. However, many are well educated.\n\nThe report said: \"Seven individuals served time in young offender institutions, and at least four were believed to be radicalised in prison.\n\n\"Many are well-educated. Thirty-one per cent started a degree, and over half of these studied Stemm [Science, Technology, Engineering, Maths and Medicine] subjects.\"\n\nNearly a third of those with degrees studied humanities or social sciences and four read Islamic studies. Five dropped out of their course before graduating.\n\nThe report urges university Islamic societies to be more vigilant and \"vet, train, and guide student officers\". Prisoners, too, should be deterred from extremism when locked up, they say.\n\nRadical mosques and charities should also be clamped down on. \"Investigate mosques and religious study centres where links are found to multiple jihadis, examining whether radicalisation is taking place under its auspices,\" the authors insist.",
      "Boris Boillon, a former adviser to Nicolas Sarkozy, faces tax fraud and forgery charges after being stopped with a bag stuffed with cash\n\nA French diplomat and close adviser to the former president Nicolas Sarkozy has gone on trial after he was stopped trying to leave the country with a bag stuffed with banknotes.\n\nBoris Boillon, who was known as \"Sarko Boy\", appeared in a Paris court on Monday on charges of tax fraud and forgery following the discovery.\n\nBoillon, who once appeared on the cover of a celebrity magazine with the headline \"The James Bond of the diplomatic world\", was pulled over by customs officers at Gare du Nord in Paris in July 2013 before he boarded a train to Belgium, where he lives with his family near Brussels.\n\nWhen Boillon opened the sports bag that he was carrying, police found €350,000 (£302,000) and $40,000 (£31,000) in cash wrapped in plastic bags and a plastic box. Boillon claimed he had been paid the money for consultancy work on a stadium construction in Iraq. As well as the fraud charges, he is accused of breaking strict limits on the transfer of cash within the European Union. The forgery charge relates to documents he allegedly presented justifying the cash.\n\nInvestigators say they have been unable to trace the source of the money. Boillon, who is facing four charges, could be fined up to €855,000 if found guilty of each and be ordered to serve up to five years in prison.\n\nOnce a rising star in France's diplomatic service, Boillon, 46, a graduate of the elite Sciences Po university and the National Institute of Oriental Languages and Civilisations, began his diplomatic career in Algeria in 2000. After Sarkozy was elected president in 2007, Boillon joined him at the Élysée as a special presidential adviser on north Africa and the Middle East.\n\nHe was appointed ambassador to Iraq in 2009 and two years later he moved to Tunis, where he provoked demonstrations after swearing at a Tunisian journalist and raised eyebrows at the Quai d'Orsay, the French foreign affairs ministry, after posting a photo posing in swimming trunks on his Facebook page.\n\nWith Sarkozy's blessing, he was allowed to remain in his job until the Socialist president François Hollande was elected in 2012. He then set up his own consultancy, Spartago, working mainly for Iraqi companies. He returned to the French foreign affairs ministry in 2016 and was sent to the United Nations in New York. He has since been suspended pending the outcome of the trial.\n\nIn 2010, Boillon went on Canal+ to defend Muammar Gaddafi, saying: \"He was a terrorist, he is no longer. We mustn't fall into cliches. We've all made mistakes in life and we've all the right to be forgiven.\"\n\nDuring a preliminary court appearance in March, Boillon indicated he would not be exercising his right to remain silent and wished to explain where the money had come from and where it was going.\n\nOn Monday, Boillon, an Arabic speaker, told the court he was a \"big sports lover\". Asked why he had left the foreign ministry in 2012, he answered: \"I like leaving my comfort zone. I wanted to be in the action. One has to think like a man of action.\"\n\nAsked why he chose Iraq, he said: \"My big difference is that I go into difficult, dangerous places … worth the danger money.\"\n\n\nLast November, Sarkozy was hit by fresh allegations that he received €50m from Gaddafi to fund his successful 2007 presidential campaign. He has repeatedly denied taking money from the Libyan dictator.",
      "Earlier this week, we shared a hint about applying Finder labels from the keyboard. But that hint, which focused on adding labels to the Finder's toolbar, suffered from a few annoying limitations. One Macworld reader, who asked to remain anonymous, contacted us with a much better solution to the same problem.\n\nThis reader's solution uses Automator. Launch Automator, and create a new Service.\n\nLook for the \"Services receive selected…\" dropdown menu at the upper right, and choose \"files or folders.\"\n\nIn the search box at the upper left, type in Label ; you'll see Label Finder Items appear in the list. Drag that entry to the right side of the Automator window. From that section, choose which color label you'd like to create a service for. (You'll create multiple services if you want to create keyboard shortcuts for multiple colors.)\n\nSave your service with a descriptive name (e.g, Label in Red ). Now, launch the Keyboard preference pane; you can get there by launching System Preferences directly, or you can go to the Automator menu, and then choose Services Preferences from the Services submenu. Either way, make sure that Services is selected on the left pane, and then find your new service in the right pane—it'll be in the Files and Folders section. Hit Return to select the new service's otherwise-invisible keyboard shortcut box, and then type the shortcut you'd like to use (say, Command-Shift-Control-1). While you're there, make sure that your new service's checkbox is checked. Quit System Preferences (and Automator, if you haven't yet), and select anything in the Finder and try your new key command. You may need to select the service once from the contextual menu by Control-clicking (right-clicking) on the file to label, just to make sure that your Mac becomes aware of the newly-created service and its keyboard shortcut.\n\nNow, though, you'll be able to label files and folders without the limitations of our earlier approach—including those that sit on your desktop.",
      "Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini - Full name Sayyid Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini (Farsi: روح الله موسوی خمینی) was the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran and its ruler from 1979 to 1989, as well as a Shia Islamic religious leader and scholar and philosopher and theologist of the Shi'a version of radical Islamism. The Ayatollah Khomeini was born on May 17, 1900 ref (or September 24, 1902) ref in the Iranian town of Khomein, to Mustafa Musawi and Hajiyah Aga Khanum. His father was murdered by bandits when he was 5 months old, his mother died in 1918. Khomeini began his religious and philosophical studies after World War I in Arak and later in the religious center of Qom, inspired by Mirza Ali Akbar Yazdi and a variety of Sufi mystics. Ruhollah Khomeini was a lecturer in political philosophy, Islamic history and ethics at the Qom seminary and in Najaf for many years and was recognized as a leading scholar of Shia Islam. In 1929 he married Khadijeh Saqafi Khomeini, who was 12 or 13 years old at the time. She bore him seven children, of whom 5 survived to adulthood. Their eldest son, Mustafa, may have been murdered on orders of the Shah while the family was exiled in Najaf, Iraq. Khomeini was elevated to the status of Ayatollah in the 1950s. In the 1960s, he became politically active in opposition to the government of the Shah. In 1962, he led opposition to a bill that would have reformed elections to allow non-Muslims to run for office. ref Because of his increasingly strident opposition to the Iranian government, he was arrested in the spring of 1963 and exiled in 1964. He stayed in Turkey for a year and then moved to Najaf, Iraq. Until he was forced to leave in 1978, Khomeini was successful in imposing himself as a political presence in Iran through political initiatives and materials that were smuggled into the country. During this period, he also established himself as an Islamic authority in Najaf, and he developed his theory of Islamic governance, exposed in a series of lectures given in Najaf from January 21 to February 8, 1970. These were compiled into a book: Hukumat e Islami: Velayat i Faqih (or Wilayat al Faqih), or in English: Islamic government: the custodianship of the Jurists. The book delineates Khomeini's political principles that justify an Islamist religious dictatorship and is discussed in more detail below. When he was exiled from Iraq, Khomeini went to France which gave him asylum, perhaps in order to frustrate U.S. Middle East policy, until February 1, 1979, after the Shah had departed Iran because of illness and political unrest. Khomeini returned home at the invitation of Iran's anti-Shah revolutionaries. Soon after his return, Khomeini ousted the interim Prime Minister Shahpour Bakhtiar and installed Mehdie Bazargan, his own candidate. The Iranian military, loyal to the Shah, did not interfere in any stage of the revolution, probably because the United States government warned them against human rights violations. The nature of Khomeini's creed and his plans were quite clear to many observers outside Iran. He had also explicitly stated his anti-democratic idea of Islamic rule in Hukumat e Islami: Velayat i Faqih, published in 1970 and widely circulated in Iran. Nonetheless, the United States refused to interfere to restore order or help its allies and supporters in Iran, and Iranian revolutionaries convinced themselves that Khomeini would bring about a democratic regime. Khomeini had promised to adhere to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and to make Iran into a representative democracy. After he seized power however, he formed an Islamic Republic making himself Head of State for life. He rewrote the draft constitution to include the principles of Velayat-i-faqih. He was styled marj al faqih - the source of emulation, and implemented the undemocratic concept of Velayat-i-faqih, Guardianship of the Islamic Jurists. Early in his rule, Khomeini was popularly known as \"Leader of the Revolution.\" Later he held the title of \"Supreme Spiritual Leader.\" In power, Khomeini undertook to implement his version of Shia Sharia Islamic Law. Women were forced to wear the Chador and both women and men were compelled to dress according to restrictive codes. Tens of thousands of opponents, real or imagined, were murdered. The Bahai religious minority were deprived of their rights including the right to practice their faith. Numerous Bahai were executed, including ten young Bahai female schoolteachers, hanged in 1983. Homosexuals were persecuted and hanged. Elections would be held, but they",

It is no coincidence this article appears in Japan's mainstream press given the abrupt termination of Japan's NICT MagSim immediately after the infamous magnetosphere reversal.\n\nAs recorded in the magnetosphere deformations blog, Earth's magnetosphere has been undergoing severe compressions with increasing frequency since 2010 and during a period of unusual dormancy in the Sun's 11-year magnetic activity cycle.\n\nThe Zetas have long predicted the Establishment would blame the Sun for the many abnormalities visited upon the Earth by the unstoppable approach of Planet X.

      "Inside & Outside of Turns 4 January 2017 (Happy New Year!)\n\nOne thing dancers often struggle with is getting around each other in Standard. In the beginning, it is difficult to get around your partner in the Natural and Reverse Turns in Viennese Waltz and Heel Turns, then as you progress you encounter more difficult figures, like the Double Reverse Spin, the Fallaway Reverse Slip Pivot, and Fleckerls, and finally at the Open level you encounter extremely rotary figures, such as Standing Spins, and Overturned Double Revers Spins. If any of these figures have given you grief, it is probably because you didn't have a proper understanding of the inside and outside of the turn. By the end of this article, you will have a thorough understanding of this mechanic, and if you practice it you will find it helps you in places you didn't even know you needed help.\n\nCircles\n\nWe can think of any rotary figure as a circle, and when two dancers form a partnership, each of them follows a separate, yet parallel circle. Let's take steps 1-3 of the Natural Turn in Waltz. In this case, we would only use 1/8 of the circle, as shown in the diagram below. The Man commences facing DW, the Lady backing DW, and the Man ends backing LOD, the Lady facing LOD. Also, the Lady remains offset toward the Man's right throughout.\n\nNotice that the distance the Lady travels is shorter than the distance the Man travels. This is known as being on the inside of the turn, for if their full circles were represented instead of just the eighth of a circle shown above, then the Lady's circle would fit inside the Man's. It isn't always true that the Lady is on the inside of the turn, in fact, during steps 4-6 of the Natural Turn, it will be the Man who is on the inside. Because we dance facing each other in Ballroom, the person going forward will always be on the outside of the circle, whereas the person going back will always be on the inside. If we were to dance back to back, the opposite would be true.\n\nThe idea of the circle is just a prop for learning. In actuality, the Man and Lady both travel in straight lines, as shown below. Nevertheless, the person on the inside has a shorter distance to travel.\n\nBecause the person on the inside of the turn has less distance to travel, that person must take smaller steps overall, otherwise that person will easily outrun the other, and the person on the outside of the circle will not be able to get around. Likewise, the person on the outside of the turn must travel as strongly as possible to get through. Typically, dancers can fudge this, but by turning the opposite direction on the next step they can undo all their problems. The real problem comes when they have to repeatedly dance turns in one direction, such as in Viennese Waltz. If you ever find that your Viennese Waltz starts out great, but then falls apart, the problem may be that the person on the outside of the turn isn't travelling strongly enough, or the person on the inside of the turn isn't allowing the person on the outside to pass.\n\nThe Centre of the Circle\n\nAbove we discussed the instance where both the Man and the Lady are travelling along the circumferences of their circles, but sometimes one dancer becomes the centre of the circle, and the other orbits around. Such is the case with Heel Turns and Toe Spins. In the case of a Heel Turn, one partner (typically the Lady) closes her feet and turns on a single point, while her partner dances around her, just as if he were the outside of the circle, as discussed above, but this time a smaller circle. The Toe Spin (found in the Man's second step of the Double Reverse Spin, and also the Standing Spin), is the same principle, but where the turn is made on the Ball of the foot instead of the Heel.\n\nIn both of these instances, the problem typically arises when the dancer on the outside of the turn treats the figure as if it were a regular turning figure and not a smaller circle, and ends up stepping so as to end too far away from his partner. This causes his partner to step forward, rather than turning on the spot, or for the partnership to separate.\n\nChanging Centres\n\nSometimes one partner is the centre of the turn during the beginning of the figure, but another partner becomes the centre of the turn at the end. Such is the case with the Double Reverse Spin. The first step is taken straight, but on the second step, the Lady closes her feet and becomes the centre of the turn, while the Man must step around her, paying special attention to remain in contact with her without disturbing her balance. On the Lady's steps 3 and 4, the Man dances his Toe",
      "Tons of openings, surprising shutdowns, a staff shortage — no wonder local chefs are uneasy. What's going on?\n\nHAVE YOU BEEN to Opus Co., the new Phinney Ridge restaurant from two chefs who've worked with the great Rachel Yang? Eaten Mutsuko Soma's already-renowned handmade soba at her brand-new Kamonegi in Fremont, where Art of the Table used to be? Been to the new location of beloved Art of the Table, a block away? Tried the imported-from-Hong-Kong, reportedly incredible Betsutenjin Ramen on Capitol Hill? The other three, soon to be four, new ramen places within half a mile of Betsutenjin? The half-dozen new pizzerias nearby? Any of the 35-plus new places specializing in poke in and around Seattle?\n\nIf you can't keep up, it's not your imagination — restaurants are opening at an unprecedented rate. Over a month and a half this summer, at least 40 debuted hereabout.\n\nIf that seems overwhelming, consider this: Seattle had 2,696 restaurants as of the first quarter of 2017, according to Department of Revenue data — up 25 percent from a decade ago. (These DOR figures represent all food service businesses, including full- and quick-service places, trucks and carts, and caterers.) Contrary to the oft-quoted \"fact\" that half of all restaurants fail in the first year, the Seattle survival rate for restaurants has been hovering around 87 percent a year out (up from 83 percent in 2007). And the numbers for Seattle restaurants' gross annual sales are startling: up 45 percent over the past decade, to a 2016 total of $2.9 billion. Yes, billion.\n\nIt's very big business, getting bigger all the time. Last year, for the first time, spending on eating out outstripped spending at grocery stores nationwide, according to U.S. Census data. And Seattle's economy is, as you might have heard, booming. We've got more cranes than any other U.S. city, and more new people, too — more than 90,000 newcomers since the start of the decade. And they've got to eat, right?\n\nWhy, then, does Seattle's restaurant scene feel so unstable? Why do chefs speak — quietly or a lot less so — of high anxiety?\n\nSEATTLE RESTAURANT CASUALTIES\n\n\"Pivot\" has become an industry verb in Seattle, a euphemism for changing a floundering restaurant to something with more prospects for profit instead of shutting it down. And closures, while relatively few and far between, sometimes feel full of portent. A pivot/closure case in point: James Beard Award-winning chef Maria Hines' Ballard restaurant, Golden Beetle. It served all-organic, adventurous takes on Mediterranean food, but the neighborhood balked at paying more for a gyro. \"My heart aches,\" she said upon changing the place to a family-friendly, conceptually easy-to-swallow gastropub earlier this year. But she still couldn't get out from under the debt. Hines closed Golden Beetle this spring to concentrate on her other two restaurants, Tilth and Agrodolce.\n\nSeattle's finer-dining audience is \"spread thinner and thinner,\" Hines observes. A top chef's imprimatur doesn't have the draw that it used to — too many new places to try, and too much traffic to fight for crosstown \"foodie\" repeat visits. And to Hines, the rejection of Golden Beetle felt like a rebuke to culinary creativity. She was left with a philosophical question about the city: \"As it grows exponentially fast, how do I grow exponentially fast, and hold on to my craft for dear life?\"\n\nSouth Lake Union, the land of Amazon, has been uncharted restaurant territory since the company took hold. Serial failures there have defied all conventional wisdom. Shanik — opened in 2012 by Meeru Dhalwala, half of the team that made Vij's in Vancouver, B.C., a lines-down-the-block hit — lasted three years. In 2015, chef Travis Kukull's much-lauded \"weird food\" lasted seven and a half months at Mollusk, now the very unweird Dexter Brewhouse. Restaurateur Josh Henderson opened five restaurants in S.L.U. last year, then took the radical step of closing three of them. He echoed others on \"the pressures of Amazon\": a dearth of dinner business, a desire for quick-serve, a neighborhood still under construction, diners unwilling to travel from elsewhere. \"[You] look in the mirror and say, 'Is this [expletive] working?' \" Henderson says. \"Bank accounts don't lie; butts in seats don't lie.\"\n\nElsewhere,",

      "The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a bill to radically restructure the American health care system within a few hours of this writing. At the moment, no one knows what that legislation actually looks like. The bill in question, the American Health Care Act, has struggled to gain sufficient support to clear a party-line vote in the Republican-controlled House. So Speaker Paul Ryan and the rest of the leadership are reported to be making major rewrites on the fly in order to appease hard-line conservatives. This is all being done behind closed doors as the leadership remains committed to voting on this as-yet-unfinalized legislation on Thursday evening.\n\nWhy does the vote have to happen today? You might think there was a good reason given all the drama and urgency, but there really isn't. The vote was scheduled for symbolic reasons. Today is the seventh anniversary of the signing of the Affordable Care Act, and Ryan wants to pass his unfinished and wildly unpopular bill so he can have a tidy little close-the-circle talking point to wrap up several years of \"repeal and replace Obamacare\" messaging.\n\nIt's hard to overstate how wildly reckless this all is. President Donald Trump and the House Republican leadership are trying to ram through massive changes to the health care system without having given serious consideration to what their legislation will actually do. It's quite literally a matter of life and death, and the overriding concern among Republican lawmakers is just to get something passed quickly.\n\nRepublicans like to cite the unintended consequences of the Affordable Care Act as one of their chief arguments for repealing the legislation. But by scheduling the American Health Care Act vote on Thursday, the GOP is underscoring how hypocritical and dangerous this whole process is. It's the seventh anniversary of the ACA's signing, which, if you can't do the math at home, means that the bill had been signed into law more than a full year into Barack Obama's presidency.\n\nIt took that long for Obama and the Democratic Congress to pass the ACA because they spent a lot of time writing the legislation, holding hearings, talking to experts and negotiating details — all the procedures typically associated with big-ticket legislative items.\n\nPresident Trump and Ryan are trying to replicate that feat in the second month of this new administration. They've condensed the entire process into a matter of weeks as the speaker has jammed the AHCA through a handful of cursory hearings. When the Congressional Budget Office finally got a chance to analyze the proposed bill (after it had already gone through two committee votes), the budget office found that the AHCA would result in 24 million fewer people with health coverage, massive premium increases for elderly individuals and huge funding cuts for Medicaid.\n\nThe response from Ryan and Trump was to plow ahead, making major alterations to the bill on the fly while adhering to the same abbreviated timeline. To try to appease hand-wringing \"moderates,\" the House leadership included language in the bill instructing the Senate to figure out how to give older people more generous subsidies to purchase insurance. To make recalcitrant House conservatives happy, the White House agreed to let states add work requirements for Medicaid and shift the program's funding to block grants.\n\nNeither of those concessions seemed to do much to drum up the needed level of support, so further alterations are reportedly on the table. These include the elimination of the Affordable Care Act's essential health benefits — the mandate requiring health plans to cover things like maternity care, mental health benefits and so on. Putting those on the block would free up insurers to offer plans that cost next to nothing — because they cover almost nothing. As The New York Times noted, pursuing this sort of policy could result in people burning up insurance tax credits on policies that cover aromatherapy and nothing else.\n\nIf the American Health Care Act comes to the House floor on Thursday evening with some or all of these changes, this would mean legislators will vote on a bill that looks substantially different from the one Ryan unveiled just a few short weeks ago. Nobody has any real understanding about how those changes would affect coverage, the insurance markets, Medicaid or the federal budget, because the Congressional Budget Office has not had an opportunity to review any of these desperate last-minute revisions.\n\nPeople's lives and financial well-being hang in the balance, but right now the most important consideration for Republicans is fulfilling a longstanding campaign promise — that, and cutting taxes for the rich. The health of the GOP's political agenda is of greater concern to Donald Trump and Paul Ryan than the health of actual people. Hopefully no deal will be struck and this cynical and thoroughly irresponsible legislative gambit will meet with the failure it so richly deserves.",
      "MUMBAI: Private sector bankers say that if NDTV's loan settlement with ICICI Bank is termed criminal, it could hit resolution of bad debts. The concerns follow the Central Bureau of Investigation ( CBI ) alleging that ICICI Bank officials may have caused wrongful gains to NDTV promoters by agreeing to cut the interest rate to settle the loan.\"Settlement of any stressed loan involves some sacrifice by the banker. Often this is done to protect the loan amount since stand-off might result in loss of the principal well,\" said a banker who didn't want to be identified. If this sacrifice were to be construed as wrongful loss to the bank and a gain to the borrower, loan resolutions would not be possible, he added.Multinational banks in India have been able to clean up their balance sheet the fastest as they have taken large haircuts in loans that were in default. The government is pushing for settlement of close to Rs 4 lakh crore of bad debt owed by top 50 borrowers which account for over 40% of the banking sector's bad loans Banks are likely to make a representation to the government and the RBI through the Indian Banks Association on commercial decisions being questioned. This is the second instance of CBI action against a commercial decision, the first being the arrest of senior officials of IDBI Bank on charges of improper loan sanctioning to Kingfisher Airlines.The CBI, in a statement on Tuesday, said that the investigation did not pertain to loan default but to the interest relief. \"ICICI Bank took the entire shareholding of the promoters in NDTV (nearly 61%) as collateral and then accepted prepayment of the loan by reducing the interest rate from 19% p.a. to nearly 9.5 % p.a. and as a consequence thereof, causing a wrongful loss of Rs 48 crore to ICICI Bank and a corresponding wrongful gain to the promoters of NDTV,\" the agency said.Last month, the government passed an ordinance authorising the RBI to issue directions to banks to initiate insolvency resolution process under the provisions of Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code (IBC), 2016. This new legislation was aimed at breaking the logjam in the banking industry over banks' inability to resolve over Rs 7 lakh crore of bad loans.A key feature of this legislation was creation of oversight committees to ratify decision taken by bankers. Having a panel in place is expected to shield bankers from action by investigating agencies who may later look into loan recasts. However, the government has said that there will not be any blanket protection for bankers. Also proposals have to be referred to the oversight panels by banks.",

      "The life-size \"creature\", which weighs less than six grams and flaps just like a real bat, can be fitted with tiny cameras and other equipment to spy on enemy bases or sniff out biological weapons.\n\nIt was designed to overcome problems faced by existing \"micro aerial vehicles\" (MAVs) - scaled-down helicopters and planes which are inefficient and difficult to move around.\n\nScientists at North Carolina State University turned to nature for inspiration, and created a bat-style skeleton and muscle system from ultra-modern 'smart' materials.\n\nDr Stefan Seelecke, one of the researchers behind the $10million project, said: \"We have used a shape-memory metal alloy that is super-elastic for the joints. The material provides a full range of motion, but will always return to its original position - a function performed by many tiny bones, cartilage and tendons in real bats.\n\n\"The research team is also using smart materials for the muscular system. We're using an alloy that responds to the heat from an electric current. That heat activates wires the size of a human hair, making them contract like metal muscles.\n\n\"During the contraction, the muscle wires also change their electric resistance, which can be measured to provide sensory input. This dual functionality helps cut down on the robo-bat's weight and allows it to respond quickly to changing conditions such as a gust of wind.\"\n\nThe bat is powered by a solar-powered battery and comes complete with a miniature radar, a self-guidance system and radio to send data back to troops in combat zones.\n\nIt is currently in the prototype stage and has yet to be rolled out for use on the front line.",
      "Kudankulam project +\n\nCHENNAI: With synchronization of the second unit of the Kudankulam power plant, India's civil nuclear programme has reached a couple of landmarks: theturned a page on protests and a legal challenge over its safety parameters in the Supreme Court, and India crossed the 6,000MW mark in nuclear power.Once the output of Unit II is scaled up to a full 1,000MW in two months, India's 22 nuclear power reactors will be able to generate 6,780MW of power and the Nuclear Power Corporation of India Limited (NPCIL) expects four more reactors to be commissioned in a year. Unit II is functioning smoothly as scientists seem to have incorporated the right lessons from hitches that marred Unit I's functioning after attaining criticality in 2013.The two 1,000MW nuclear units built with Russian assistance have made Tamil Nadu the highest consumer of nuclear power on a daily basis. Kudankulam I and II are also the last nuclear units in India built with foreign collaboration that will not attract the liability clause legislated after the India-US nuclear deal.NPCIL engineers learnt bitter lessons while commissioning Unit I. The reactor has been in continuous operation only since February 2016. Protests in 2011-12 by anti-nuclear activists delayed the project by months when it was over 90% ready, but not much is known of the problems it faced later. The Unit I has been operating continuously for 189 days since February 22 and has generated 11,269 million units of electricity since October 2013.But NPCIL did its homework and made changes to Unit II. \"We carried out all changes effected to Unit I on Unit II. This made the commissioning of the second unit easier,\" Kudankulam project site director R S Sundar told TOI.In the near future — around six months to a year — two indigenous reactors each in Rajasthan and Kakrapar in Gujarat should be ready. \"Beyond Kudankulam, Nuclear Power Corporation is hopeful of commissioning the four reactors in a year. These reactors are built by NPCIL engineers and each has a capacity of 700MW,\" Sundar said.Not all of India's 22 nuclear reactors are functioning to full capacity. \"A total of 14 reactors are under International Atomic Energy Agency safeguards. Only these reactors are eligible to use imported nuclear fuel and are currently operational. The plant load factor (PLF) of these reactors is around 90%,\" a former Atomic Energy Commission chief said.The PLF of reactors using indigenous fuel is less. For example, the PLF of two units of 220MW capacity in Kalpakkam is around 65-70% as there is a shortage of nuclear fuel in the country. \"As we synchronized Unit-2 with the grid on August 29, the total nuclear power generation in the country on that day was 5100MW. This is a new high for nuclear power generation. As on date, Unit-2 is generating 270MW and we will be scaling up the generation in the coming days,\" said Sundar.",

      "Elected Greens are being systematically monitored by the Metropolitan police because we do not buy into the ideas that uphold the establishment status quo. We ask difficult questions, we often support people who are causing waves, and we promote policies that mainstream politicians feel threatened by.\n\nWe are part of a wider movement for change and we do our bit to defend people whose right to protest is under threat. For example, I have been a big defender of the monthly Critical Mass bike ride in London, the peaceful protesters at G8 and the student demonstrations. However it's worth noting that I've also sat down with senior police officers to discuss issues such as how they deal with people trafficking, FGM, wildlife crime and hit-and-run drivers, and how they catch all sorts of other criminals. I've helped steer policing policy and earned respect from the senior ranks. Unlike most people on their domestic extremism database, I am known to them personally. We sit down for coffee, and we generally get on well.\n\nOfficer claims Met police improperly destroyed files on Green party peer Read more\n\nI hope that the police see us as reasonable people, but I also hope that Greens at City Hall will continue to have a proud record of asking difficult questions about the anti-terrorism strategy Prevent, deaths in custody, stop and search and all the other civil liberties issues that other parties sometimes get cold feet over championing.\n\nAbove all, elected Greens have become effective at what we do. In the London Assembly, we have continued to ask difficult questions on numerous topics, including the excessive use of stop and search or the weak push for solar power in London, that have gradually become the basis for a cross-party consensus on what is going wrong. People I have met and championed in the early days of their campaigns, such as the women betrayed by undercover officers, have become well known as their stories get more coverage and traction. Policies that were seen as fringe, like cycling in London, or air pollution, have become part of the mainstream political agenda.\n\nUnlike many of the fringe groups and parties to the left of Labour, we can no longer be dismissed as merely a party of permanent protest. Anyone who looks at the series of pragmatic initiatives put forward by the Greens in the London assembly and our long list of achievements, big and small, has to accept that we have got things done. That doesn't mean that we have gone soft on wanting fundamental change. These achievements and the way that we have shifted City Hall's priorities are part of a larger vision of a different kind of society and a very different kind of economy.\n\nThe police monitor us because we oppose the vested interests which exert undue influence over the running of our country\n\nPerhaps the biggest reason why the police monitor the Greens is because we oppose many of the vested interests that exert undue influence over the running of our country. Nationally, Greens oppose nuclear power as an expensive, dinosaur technology. We have supported communities using nonviolent direct action to stop fracking, or big new roads being built. We support people making a clear moral case for animal welfare, or against arms fairs and nuclear weapons, such as Trident. All of this makes us a threat to the state, and to the less caring businesses linked to the government. In London we propose breaking the monopoly of big developers being given control over public land. They have failed to solve the housing crisis under the patronage of either Boris Johnson or Ken Livingstone.\n\nGreens are anti-establishment because we just don't think the establishment does a very good job of running things. Elected Greens will act in the interests of the common good, not just the richest 1%, and that is why the Met police can't take their eyes off us.",
      "Art has undeniably affixed itself to our lives, entering into every part and it extends outside the walls of a gallery or museum. The 20th century was a time during which colossal shifts have taken place in so many different areas, from technology to literature and medicine to Arts in general. The arts of this century were characterized by socio-political reality and technological advancement from the late 19th century. It touched the traditional works of art and challenged the essence of postmodernism itself.\n\nThe 20th century recorded vibrant explorations of Expressionism, Cubism, Constructivism, Social Realism and other notable art movements. Every movement had its famous painters, ones that remain unbeatable as the ultimate creators of new ideas. Here is a list of top five most influential artists of the twentieth century whose work has deeply influenced the way we perceive art today.\n\nCLAUDE MONET: Claude Monet impact was felt in the first quarter of the 20th century. He was born in the 19th century and died in 1926. Monet was one of the leading figures of the impressionist movement and his work was highly influential. Monet not only had an impact on other artists during the same period but he continues to influence students of art and artists to this very day. The \"Impression, Sunrise\" is one of his most celebrated artworks.\n\nDAVID HOCKNEY: David Hockney impacted the world of Art during the second half of the 20th century and was an enormously significant figure of the 1960s pop-art movement. Hockney not only created paintings that are recognized as masterpieces internationally, but he also earned the respect of the Art world through his other artistic work like photography and set design.\n\nJACKSON POLLOCK: Jackson Pollock was an American painter whose influence was felt in the first half of the 20th century. He used a never before seen technique of dripping paints across big canvases and this put him quickly on the map of the abstract world. Jackson Pollock remains one of the most important names of the abstract art genre. Although Jackson Pollock's legacy holds to this day and is rock solid, his struggle with alcoholism was the cause of his untimely death. In 1944, the world was deprived of his genius.\n\nROY LICHTENSTEIN: Roy Lichtenstein's artworks have become symbolic all through the 1960s pop-art movement. He is best known to have produced paintings that were hugely influenced by the world of comics. This is why Lichtenstein's work has remained so popular and relevant until today. Lichtenstein's paintings are rarely sold but when they do become available in the market they cost millions of dollars.\n\nSALVADOR DALI: Salvador Dali is generally considered to be one of the leading figures of Surrealism. From the inception of his artistic voyage in mid 20th century in Spain, his talent was unquestionable and his skills in painting are still beyond the need for proof. Dali's artworks were always quite appalling, one way or another, regarding their subject matter and they are full of symbolisms depicting them as something far beyond than the simple illustration of an odd scene.",
      "CM Punk Talks Wrestling Being 'Overscripted To Death', Who The Safest Wrestler Was.\n\nAs we noted prior, CM Punk will be making his long awaited octagon debut at UFC 203 in September. Punk made the transition from the WWE to the UFC a couple years ago now. When he left he was one of the most popular stars in the company. He recently did UFC Unfiltered with Jim Norton and Matt Serra where he talked about his upcoming UFC debut and also his WWE past. Here were some of the highlights:\n\nPunk says that Bret Hart was a very safe worker. He did a great job of making it look like he was hurting someone but keeping them safe at the same time:\n\n\"In wrestling, you're trying to make it look like you're smashing a guy without actually touching him at all. And somebody who was super, super good at that was Bret Hart. He always made it look like he was killing a motherf***** and he never was\" (Source; UFC Unfiltered, H/T WrestlingInc).\n\nWidget not in any sidebars\n\nPunk also comments on the WWE being too scripted and some guys like him would much prefer some creative freedom instead of random writers doing everything for them:\n\n\"I think the good ones, the interviews and the promos people remember, those are improv. Now, wrestling's just overscripted to death. It's almost like they have a chokehold on it. Some guys need to operate that way and I feel like some people need to let loose and be themselves. You've got a whole room of guys writing for you. They don't know you. They don't know where you're coming from. They don't know your perspective or your character and stuff like that. And if you're out there being disingenuous and saying words that three other people wrote, I always felt that the crowd could tell and then they're going to pay attention to their phones or s*** on whatever segment you're in. So yeah, I was always a fan of just kind of doing my own thing\" (Source; UFC Unfiltered, H/T WrestlingInc).\n\nYou can check out the full interview here.\n\nI think he makes some good points about promos. Some guys work way better doing their own thing. Look at guys like the Rock. Imagine trying to script his words and charisma? You can't. Just let them be themselves and trust your performers.\n\nLet us know what you think in the comment section below! Also please subscribe below to us if you can!",

      "The Surreal Reasons Girls Are Disappearing In El Salvador: #15Girls\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Encarni Pindado for NPR Encarni Pindado for NPR\n\nIn many countries, the decisions teens make at 15 can determine the rest of their lives. But, often, girls don't have much say — parents, culture and tradition decide for them. In a new series, #15Girls, NPR explores the lives of 15-year-old girls who are seeking to take control and change their fate. Warning: Some of the depictions and images in this story are graphic.\n\nIt's our first morning in El Salvador's capital. We're eating breakfast and we get a call from a local reporter we know.\n\nThere's a crime scene, he says. A girl. You should come. We take a taxi to what looks like a major intersection in San Salvador. When we get there, we look around. And then we see her, slumped on a street corner.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Encarni Pindado for NPR Encarni Pindado for NPR\n\nThe girl is dead. She's 15 years old and her name is Marcela. Witnesses tell us she was executed by a gang member.\n\nWe can't see her face. All we can see is her plaid pants and gray T-shirt. Her family is across the street in a pickup truck. We can't tell you their names because it would put them in danger.\n\nMarcela's mother is too upset to talk. So, we talk to her grandmother. She says Marcela left the house that morning with her sister. The two worked in downtown San Salvador, the capitol of El Salvador, making tortillas.\n\nThe grandmother tells us that Marcela's boyfriend was a bus driver in a gang-controlled neighborhood. First, he got threats. \"Help the gang or we'll kill you.\" Then he disappeared.\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption Encarni Pindado for NPR Encarni Pindado for NPR\n\nThen Marcela started getting threats. And now this: Marcela's body, lying on the ground, while people drive to work.\n\nIf you were standing at the U.S.-Mexico border two summers ago during the so-called \"surge\" of unaccompanied minors trying to come to the U.S., you would have seen thousands of young girls from El Salvador.\n\nIf you had asked them why they came, they would have told you the answer is simple: gangs. Back in the 1980s, during El Salvador's civil war, many people migrated from El Salvador to the U.S. On the streets of cities like Los Angeles, they formed gangs.\n\nThen, many of them were deported back to El Salvador. And they brought the gangs with them. Now, El Salvador's two main gangs — Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and Barrio 18 — control much of the country. There is so much violence in El Salvador that someone dies there, on average, every hour.\n\nMuch of the killing is over turf or revenge. And sometimes people are just caught in the middle. Many times, those caught in the middle are girls.\n\nWe went to El Salvador to talk to these girls, to understand why they would want to make the perilous journey to the U.S., why they would ever want to leave home.\n\nThis is the story of four of those girls. In most cases, we're not using last names; to bring any attention to them would make them a target of the gangs.\n\nMarcela\n\nWe find the police investigator on the case. He says Marcela was attacked from behind and shot twice in the head. He says Marcela's sister witnessed the killing. She's now in police protection.\n\nWe ask him why a gang member would kill a 15-year-old girl. He speculates that it's because she didn't want to be someone's girlfriend or didn't want to do something for that gang.\n\nIs this normal, we ask? Does it happen to young women a lot?\n\nIt happens every day, he says.\n\nThe police later release Marcela's sister from their protection, even though local reporters tell us the gangs will probably go after her now.\n\nThe family tells us their only option is to leave the country, ideally for the U.S. But they've got about $200 to their name. It's not nearly enough to pay a smuggler.\n\nAll this happened on our first full day in El Salvador. If this is how bad it is, how do girls live?\n\n\nTo answer that question, we go to a school and start interviewing 15-year-old-girls.\n\nAby\n\nOne girl stands out. Her name is Aby Salas and she wants to study",
      "Looking at this year's edition of the Los Angeles Lakers, you could have made an argument--easily, some would say--that the '13-14 team is packed with just as much, or more talent than last season's. Let's take a look:\n\nKobe Bryant, Jeremy Lin, Jordan Clarkson and Ronnie Price might very well be an upgrade over last year's core of Jordan Farmar, Jodie Meeks, Kent Bazemore, Kendall Marshall and just over a dozen games from Steve Nash, simply on the merit of Bean making his return.\n\nWhile Pau Gasol is certainly missed, the defensive potential of Jordan Hill, Ed Davis and Robert Sacre could definitely equate in talent and overall value to Hill, Sacre, the Spaniard and Chris Kaman. An unfortunately timed injury to Julius Randle could have definitively swayed the balance towards the '14-15 Lakers' frontcourt. Please note that I did not mention Carlos Boozer. At all.\n\nLooking at the swingmen, Nick Young, Wesley Johnson and Xavier Henry all remain, leaving them at an even wash from last year. However, some would say Young is a better player, as is hopefully Johnson with a summer full of off-season workouts with Kobe.\n\nWhen I wrote this year's Lakers aren't only worse than last year's, but were the worst of all-time, I got a tremendous amount of push back. Almost unanimously. How could a team with Kobe Bryant be worse than a team without Kobe Bryant? That just didn't make sense. Moreover, even beyond just addressing the intangibles the Black Mamba brings to the table, comparing both teams side by side could arguably give the edge to the very Lake Show we see before us.\n\nIt isn't about the amount of talent, it's how that talent fits.\n\nBut my credo when it comes to the NBA is that professional basketball isn't playing checkers -- it's playing three dimensional chess. Against a robot. That Bruce Wayne designed. It's never an apples to apples comparison when evaluating two players. One can't simply say that Jerry West was a better player than Hakeem Olajuwan. There are too many variables to consider -- positional differentiation, offensive statistics, defensive metrics, teammates, minutes played, offense and defensive systems played in, usage rate .... I could go on. But the point is, taking a player, or a group of players, and assigning overall value to them without looking at varying factors doesn't a fair contrast make. That's like saying a meal in Mexico is better than a meal in Seattle because you shelled out more coins for it. You've got to have context.\n\nIn comparing last year's team to this one, it isn't about the amount of talent, it's how that talent fits. Last year's team, as flawed as they were, played to an amazing ceiling, especially considering how prominent roles were for guys like Marshall, Johnson and Meeks. That's because the team was much better suited to play Mike D'Antoni's style -- plenty of three-point shooters, athletes that could get up and down the floor and point guards who could execute top of the key pick-and-roll plays. Sure, the team was atrocious defensively, but they weren't the most atrocious .... just the 28th most. Out of 30. As limited as the team was in skillset, those limited skillsets at least complemented one another.\n\nThe evidence? Pau Gasol is a very good passing big man out of the post. It certainly couldn't have hurt a team that finished seventh in three-point percentage for the year and it's probably not a coincidence that the top five three-point shooters on the team finished at the top or near the top of their respective career lines in three-pointers made. Overall, those Lakers were horrid mid-range shooters .... so the team just didn't shoot mid-range jumpers. Guys like Wesley Johnson weren't ready or equipped to make decisions with the ball, thus guys like Wesley Johnson were given roles as spot-up shooters and finishers on the run. Meanwhile, multi-dimensional point guards like Farmar and Steve Blake were given the responsibilities to make decisions with the ball, including starting on-court offensive actions, as well as taking shots from deep themselves.\n\nPhoto Credit: Jayne Kamin-Oncea, USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe MDA Lakers weren't good by any stretch of the imagination, but there's little doubt to me that they were all put in situations where they could best succeed, as the system best accentuated their strengths. That is the biggest problem with Byron Scott's Lakers, though on paper the talent may be superior to last year. The pieces just don't fit. And it's leaving me with so many questions ....\n\nWhy is Jeremy Lin, whose best skill is unquestionably driving to the basket, taking it to the rack the same amount of times per game as She",
      "WASHINGTON — Sebastian Gorka, the British-born deputy assistant to President Trump whose unsmiling, dark-bearded visage and plummy English accent made frequent appearances on political talk shows, left his post late Friday. The conservative web site The Federalist reported on Friday that Gorka resigned with a scathing letter accusing \"forces\" in the White House of working against Trump's agenda. However, a White House official told Yahoo News that Gorka did not leave of his own accord.\n\n\"Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House,\" the official said.\n\nAccording to the Washington Examiner's Sarah Westwood, Gorka said it was \"disappointing\" that the White House said he was fired, because \"I resigned.\"\n\nA source with knowledge of the situation said Gorka did indeed resign—but only after being informed on Friday by White House Chief of Staff John Kelly that his security clearance had been revoked, which would have made it impossible for him to continue in his White House job. Gorka was on vacation at the time and due to return on Monday. Instead, after hearing from Kelly, he submitted his resignation.\n\nGorka, who did not respond to multiple requests for comment from Yahoo News, was a controversial and curious figure in the White House. He styled himself as \"Dr.\" Sebastian Gorka (he had a doctorate in political science from a Hungarian university) and described himself as a national security expert and intelligence analyst. However, experts in the field questioned his credentials. Gorka frequently appeared on television to defend the Trump administration, but his actual responsibilities within the West Wing were unclear. He also had ties to anti-Semitic groups in Hungary, from which his parents had fled after the failed 1956 uprising against the Soviet-backed regime.\n\nGorka's departure comes during a turbulent period for the White House that has seen several top staffers leave including former chief strategist Steve Bannon. The changes have come after John Kelly, a former Marine General, was installed as White House chief of staff last month. Kelly, who was previously Trump's secretary of Homeland Security, has been tasked with instilling order in the administration. The ex-general reportedly immediately focused on Bannon as a source of internal disputes and leaks.\n\nBannon was widely seen as Gorka's patron. Prior to joining the White House, Gorka worked as an editor at Bannon's Breitbart News. Gorka's affiliation with the site and his inflammatory commentaries about Muslims earned him a reputation as an alt-right voice in Trump's White House. In the wake of his departure, Bannon returned to Breitbart where he hopes to take on the administration's enemies and guide Trump's agenda from the outside. Gorka's alleged resignation letter published by The Federalist expressed a similar desire.\n\n\"It is clear to me that forces that do not support the MAGA promise are – for now – ascendant within the White House,\" Gorka wrote. \"As a result, the best and most effective way I can support you, Mr. President, is from outside the People's House.\"\n\nAs news of his departure broke, Gorka edited the biography on his Twitter page to remove his White House affiliation. He also changed his picture on the site from one that showed him with Trump's son, Eric, to a shot of him standing alone with a taut grin.\n\n\"#NewProfilePic,\" Gorka wrote.\n\nRead more from Yahoo News:",

      "What Net Neutrality and Title II Is\n\nFirst of all, it's very important to note that the current Net Neutrality debate (Title II and the FCC) only affects the United States of America. While it could have an effect on American Tor nodes, the Tor network as a whole would be more-or-less just the same.\n\nNet Neutrality means that all Internet traffic should be treated the same. Title II allows the American FCC to enforce these rules on American ISPs. Without Title II, Net Neutrality would still be enforced by the American FTC or Congress. However, these protections will be weaker and slower to action.\n\nHow This Affects Tor users and Onion services\n\nWithout Title II enforcement of Net Neutrality, American ISPs will be able to legally throttle or block access to any content they wish. There are 3 main ways this could effect Tor users in America:\n\nISPs do nothing, Tor works as usual. ISPs throttle Tor, making it slower than it already is. ISPs completely block Tor. You could still use bridges to connect.\n\nWorst-Case Scenario\n\nThe worst-case scenario is that ISPs block everything except the websites and services on their whitelist. In this case, blocking all Tor bridges would be possible.\n\nWithout Net Neutrality, it's up to your ISP to decide to allow or block Tor.",

We explore a number of reasons for the declines in geographic and labor market transitions, and find the strongest support for explanations related to a decrease in the net benefit to changing employers.

      "Now that he's persona non grata at the White House, Steve Bannon's moved back into the whiter house, i.e., Breitbart, which eagerly welcomed back its \"populist hero.\" In fact, the editors at the far-right publication were so excited to have Bannon back, they dove right into an email chain to make disparaging remarks about members of the Trump family. That turned out to be a prank, but you can't blame Breitbart; the perpetrator cleverly disguised himself as Bannon by threatening \"Javanka\" (Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump) and describing his morning uttanasana routine.\n\nJokes and threats aside, Breitbart's really rolled out the red carpet for Bannon's homecoming, dedicating posts to its fearless leader, and even hawking fidget spinners with his oozing face emblazoned on them. This newest addition to the publication's online store is \"proudly made in the USA,\" like all the cheap whiskey Bannon regularly swigs. The molded plastic is the same shade of orange as the Breitbart logo, but not, as Pantone tells us, the current color of the president's spray tan. The accompanying copy is fairly uninspiring, though it does manage to make a tired \"snowflake\" joke while also touching on current events, so maybe it's the most spot-on thing ever published on the site: \"Leftists need comfort at times like these. Gift them this pacifying item that will give them something to do in between pulling down monuments.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat makes it a Bannon fidget spinner—aside from the fact that it's full of holes—is the photo of his ravaged countenance slapped onto each one, along with the hashtag \"War.\" (Nothing disconcerting about that; at least, not until they add \"race\" to it.) The item is special delivery, meaning it will take up to 10 days for you to get Steve Bannon in your hands, which is actually plenty of time to change your mind.",

      "In a new interview, actor Morgan Freeman shared his unique perspective on President Donald Trump. During the 2016 campaign, Freeman was an outspoken Hillary Clinton supporter. But his views on the new president might come as a surprise to many.\n\nThe interview with AARP Magazine covered a variety of topics ranging from Freeman's time in the United States Air Force to his views on the late Nelson Mandela. Perhaps the most interesting topic, though, was a brief discussion of the current state of American politics. When asked about his views, Freeman said:\n\n\"As for politics today, I supported Hillary in the election, and now it feels like we are jumping off a cliff. We just have to find out how we land. I'm not scared, though. I'm holding out hope that Donald Trump has to be a good president. He can't not be. What I see is a guy who will not lose.\"\n\nDuring the presidential campaign, Freeman threw the full force of his fame behind Clinton. He narrated campaign ads and a biographical video that played before Clinton's acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. Freeman even went so far as to defend Clinton's trustworthiness during an interview on CNN, saying:\n\n\"She's just going on with that legacy that she's inherited during the amount of time she's been in politics, which is a long time. I think this is just made up stuff, you know. It's political hogwash.\"\n\nRead more\n\nRELATED: President Trump Will Not Betray You",

The incident is said to have happened on Tuesday.\n\n\"It was the first day of the madrassa after our holidays. Our teacher got angry when she heard that we were not offering regular prayers during our vacation,\" said Ferdousi Akther, aged eight.\n\n\"Then she asked her servant to heat up the rod and then she pressed it on our legs. The pain was unbearable.\"\n\nPupils say that the teacher asked the students whether they knew the severity of the fire in hell.\n\nThey were allegedly told that if they did not offer prayers regularly, they would experience a similar punishment.\n\nHiding\n\nThe neighbourhood of small businessmen, day labourers and garment factory workers is shocked over the incident.\n\nImage caption The madrassa has been temporarily closed in the aftermath of the burnings\n\n\"This is... human rights violence on children.

But the implementation is weak,\" Rasheda K Chowdhury of the Campaign for Popular Education said.\n\nPolice are investigating the incident following complaints by parents.\n\n\"We have registered a case against the madrassa teacher following a complaint by the father of a girl. The teacher and her husband have gone into hiding. We are still searching for them,\" Shafiqul Islam, a police officer in charge of the Kadamtoli area of Dhaka told the BBC.\n\nParents, meanwhile, say that they are reluctant to carry on sending their children to the madrassa.\n\n\"If we had a government school in the vicinity then we would send them there.

      "\"I do, however, share your concern that we cannot rely solely on the market incentives of ISPs to fully address the risk of malevolent cyber activities. As private actors, ISPs operate in economic environments that pressure them to not take those steps, or to take them minimally. Given the interconnected nature of broadband networks, protective actions taken by one ISP against cyberthreats can be undermined by the failure of other ISPs to take similar actions. This weakens the incentive of all ISPs to take such protections. Cyber-accountability therefore requires a combination of market-based incentives and appropriate regulatory oversight where the market does not, or cannot, do the job effectively.\"\n\n\"In 2014, I initiated a new paradigm for how the FCC would address cybersecurity for our nation's communications networks and services. I stated that it begins with private sector leadership that recognizes how easily cyber threats cross corporate and national boundaries and that, because of this, the communications sector must step up its responsibility and accountability for cyber risk management.\"\n\nSo we've noted how the surge in the internet-of-poorly-secured things has put us all at risk by introducing thousands of new attack vectors in homes and businesses around the world. We've also noted that the rise of these not-so-smart cameras, toys and hackable tea kettles has resulted in a spike in larger DDoS attacks than we've ever seen before, as these devices are compromised and used maliciously within minutes of being connected to the internet. Many security experts have started to warn us that it's only a matter of time before the check comes due, potentially involving infrastructure failure and mass fatalities.Rather unsurprisingly, this has lead to a renewed call for some kind of regulation to hold gear-makers accountable for shipping poorly-secured product. So far, however, the most we're seeing on the policy solution front are relatively shallow missives pushed by folks like the Department of Homeland Security . The DHS's \"non-binding strategic principles\" recently included such recommendations along the lines of \"hey, guys, maybe some of you should actually probe your product for vulnerabilities before shipping it to consumers?\" and \"uh, perhaps companies should think about security a little bit during the product design phase?\"FCC boss Tom Wheeler also appears to be vaguely exploring the idea of regulating the internet of things space with an eye on avoiding an IOT-induced cyber-apocalypse. In a letter by Wheeler to Senator Mark Warner (pdf), Wheeler advocates an FCC-mandated cybersecurity certification process for IOT devices, as well as a system to apply \"consumer cybersecurity labels\" for IoT devices and associated services. In the letter, Wheeler argues that this is one scenario in which industry self regulation hasn't worked, and may not work down the road:Wheeler's responding to an October letter from Warner regarding the Dyn DDoS attack , which was fueled by IOT devices. But like the DHS's recommendations few companies will actually follow, Wheeler's letter similarly leans heavily on ambiguities and lip service, while realizing the FCC's precarious current position. Buried under some oblique references to the FCC's Open Internet Order (Wheeler really only says that ISPs can manage these threats without running afoul of net neutrality), the baseline message is that industry needs to step up and fix its own problem:While stories like this one over at Morning Consult engage in a lot of hand wringing about the FCC engaging in regulatory over-reach, there's little to no actual chance of Wheeler's ideas actually being implemented. Wheeler is set to step down as chairman on January 20, and Trump's incoming telecom advisors have made it abundantly clear their top priority will be not only eliminating the FCC's net neutrality rules, but working to defang and defund the agency. The GOP is also cooking up a Communications Act rewrite now that it has Congressional and White House control that will similarly aim to hamstring the regulator.A defunded and weakened FCC will likely be in no position to dramatically expand its authority into regulation of internet of things devices. In fact, it will likely mean the erosion of many FCC rules that already exist now. In other words, when it comes to IOT security we're going to be exactly where we started: waiting for gear makers to step up and take some responsibility for the fact they're laziness has left us all immeasurably less secure, while bickering over whether regulatory over-reach on security could hinder the innovation in the IOT market.Meanwhile, it's going to take a dramatic IOT-fueled incident of dysfunction and disaster before we stop doing the bare minimum, and begin taking the entire problem more seriously.",
      "It all goes back to each country's distinct cultural heritage. For one, the British have always been in touch with their pagan folklore, says Maria Tatar, a Harvard professor of children's literature and folklore. After all, the country's very origin story is about a young king tutored by a wizard. Legends have always been embraced as history, from Merlin to Macbeth. \"Even as Brits were digging into these enchanted worlds, Americans, much more pragmatic, always viewed their soil as something to exploit,\" says Tatar. Americans are defined by a Protestant work ethic that can still be heard in stories like Pollyanna or The Little Engine That Could.\n\nAmericans write fantasies too, but nothing like the British, says Jerry Griswold, a San Diego State University emeritus professor of children's literature. \"American stories are rooted in realism; even our fantasies are rooted in realism,\" he said, pointing to Dorothy who unmasks the great and powerful Wizard of Oz as a charlatan.\n\nAmerican fantasies differ in another way: They usually end with a moral lesson learned—such as, surprisingly, in the zany works by Dr. Seuss who has Horton the elephant intoning: \"A person's a person no matter how small,\" and, \"I meant what I said, and I said what I meant. An elephant's faithful one hundred percent.\" Even The Cat in the Hat restores order from chaos just before mother gets home. In Oz, Dorothy's Technicolor quest ends with the realization: \"There's no place like home.\" And Max in Where the Wild Things Are atones for the \"wild rumpus\" of his temper tantrum by calming down and sailing home.\n\nLandscape matters: Britain's antique countryside, strewn with moldering castles and cozy farms, lends itself to fairy-tale invention. As Tatar puts it, the British are tuned in to the charm of their pastoral fields: \"Think about Beatrix Potter talking to bunnies in the hedgerows, or A.A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh wandering the Hundred Acre Wood.\" Not for nothing, J.K. Rowling set Harry Potter's Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry in the spooky wilds of the Scottish Highlands. Lewis Carroll drew on the ancient stonewalled gardens, sleepy rivers, and hidden hallways of Oxford University to breathe life into the whimsical prose of Alice in Wonderland.\n\nAmerica's mighty vistas, by contrast, are less cozy, less human-scaled, and less haunted. The characters that populate its purple mountain majesties and fruited plains are decidedly real: There's the burro Brighty of the Grand Canyon, the Boston cop who stops traffic in Make Way for Ducklings, and the mail-order bride in Sarah, Plain and Tall who brings love to lonely children on a Midwestern farm. No dragons, wands, or Mary Poppins umbrellas here.\n\nBritain's pagan religions and the stories that form their liturgy never really disappeared, the literature professor Meg Bateman told me in an interview on the Isle of Skye in the Scottish Highlands. Pagan Britain, Scotland in particular, survived the march of Christianity far longer than the rest of Europe. Monotheism had a harder time making inroads into Great Britain despite how quickly it swept away the continent's nature religions, says Bateman, whose entire curriculum is taught in Gaelic. Isolated behind Hadrian's Wall—built by the Romans to stem raids by the Northern barbarian hordes—Scotland endured as a place where pagan beliefs persisted; beliefs brewed from the religious cauldron of folklore donated by successive invasions of Picts, Celts, Romans, Anglo-Saxons, and Vikings.",
      "The Dwight Howard era ended with far more of a whimper than a bang. His three seasons in Houston produced just one trip past the first round of the playoffs and eventually a 41-41 meltdown that made them the NBA's most disappointing team last season. Now the Rockets hit the reset button with a new coach and new faces lining up behind James Harden.\n\nICYMI\n\nJust as happened in Orlando and L.A., Dwight Howard slinked out of Houston taking no responsibility for what went wrong ... Mike D'Antoni gets the coaching reins with a mandate to juice up the offense and at least make the Rockets fun to watch ... It goes back to being the James Harden show with the ball in his hands and everybody else playing off him ... Ex-New Orleans Pelicans Ryan Anderson and Eric Gordon signed as free agents to bury those open shots off the space that Harden creates ... Young center Clint Capela is the man in the middle, but will be backed up by veteran Nene ... Defensive guru Jeff Bzdelik arrives from Memphis and has been tasked with teaching what is supposed to go on at the other end of the floor.\n\nTHREE POINTS\n\nThe first task is to get everybody back on the same page after a lost season of dysfunction and disappointment that resulted from a slow-growing rift between Howard and Harden. This is now strictly Harden's team once again and the spirit in training camp was back.\n\nEverybody knows that Harden is an unstoppable offensive force and that the opportunities D'Antoni will create for him could make his numbers skyrocket. But the Rockets have to give at least cursory attention to defense and try to stop the other guys at least occasionally.\n\nIt goes without saying that you've got to keep key players healthy and in the lineup. But Gordon hasn't played more than 62 games since his rookie year and Anderson has missed no fewer than 16 games in all but one of his eight NBA seasons.\n\nMAN ON THE SPOT\n\nAfter three seasons of chafing under the uncomfortable partnership with Howard, Harden signed a contract extension and says he's ready, willing and able to re-take ownership in locker room and on the court and lift the Rockets back to the level of Western Conference contenders. It's all on him.\n\nSTARTING FIVE\n\nPatrick Beverley | 9.9 ppg, 3.5 rpg, 3.4 apg\n\nThe feisty pit bull loves to sink his teeth on defense for a team that needs it.\n\nJames Harden | 29ppg, 6.1 rpg, 7.5 apg\n\nSays he's NBA's best player and there are nights when it's hard to argue.\n\nClint Capela | 7.0 ppg, 6.4 rpg, 0.6 apg\n\nYoung, aggressive, still raw defender will get minutes and chance to prove himself.\n\nTrevor Ariza| 12.7 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 2.3 apg\n\nVeteran wingman not quite stopper of old and shooting fell off badly last season.\n\nRyan Anderson | 17 ppg, 6.0 rpg, 1.1 apg\n\nPerfect fit can bury the 3-pointer, but couldn't guard a locked door.\n\nKEY RESERVES\n\nEric Gordon | 15.2 ppg, 2.2 rpg, 2.7 apg\n\nSweet shooter can fill it up if healthy. But that's always been a big if.\n\nCorey Brewer | 7.2 ppg, 2.4 rpg, 1.3 apg\n\nLong, lean wing man can do little bit of everything and good locker room presence.\n\nNene | 9.2 ppg, 4.5 rpg, 1.7 apg\n\n34-year-old big man still has spark and nose for the ball.\n\nTHE BOTTOM LINE\n\nA year after the Rockets claimed they were championship contenders and flopped badly, now they're hoping to contend for home court in the first round of the playoffs. More realistic goal is just making playoffs and that will take uncharacteristic defense from a Mike D'Antoni team.\n\nFran Blinebury has covered the NBA since 1977.

      "A lot of people read my recent post of how I made 1K USD selling iMessage sticker packs. I enjoyed answering questions on Reddit and had fun interacting through direct messages. One recurring topic that I have been asked to share more of is my process in creating these sticker packs. That is what I will be sharing in this article.\n\nNote that the process might vary slightly per sticker pack but the general framework is the same.\n\nGenerating Ideas\n\nSince I started, I developed a habit of writing down all my ideas regardless of the size or effort I think it would take to create it. I now have a bank of ideas and it would take quite a while for me to consume all of it.\n\nOne way I generate ideas is by \"generalizing or specializing\". I'm not sure exactly what I should call the technique but basically it is just about expounding on or narrowing down a subject. For example, I thought of creating a food sticker pack. I'd imagine it would have all kinds of food – fruits, vegetables, fast foods, etc. I'd narrow it down to fruits which can already be a sticker pack. If I narrowed it down even further, I would end up with specific fruits, like avocado, which can also become another sticker pack. So from this thought process, I would have come up with at least three ideas – food, fruits, and avocado.\n\nIf you can't come up with an idea, create something that you would use personally. Create something that relates to your hobby, passion, the shows you've watched, or anything you wished existed as a sticker pack.\n\nDesigning the Sticker Pack\n\nOnce I have the idea locked down, I start by sketching. It doesn't have to look good. It just gives me a feel of what I want as an output.\n\nAs I have noted in my previous post, I try to reuse as much as possible and I keep that in mind while sketching or conceptualizing.\n\nI take a picture of my sketch using my phone and trace them manually through Illustrator. Once digitized, I can color, resize, reuse, and combine them to my liking – no limits aside from time.\n\nBy the way, If you'd like to use Illustrator but don't know where to start, Adobe has an introductory tutorial available for free. There are other good alternatives such as Sketch, Inkscape (free), Gimp, and Affinity. I've heard that other people outsource the graphic design which I believe is a good idea. I would probably do it too if I had insufficient time and extra financial resources.\n\nGoing back to designing, I suggest you focus on text-heavy stickers if you are not a designer or you are a beginner. This will force you to focus on the content rather than the graphics. You will be able to get away with not having a fancy sticker pack. Remember, you can release different stickers with the same text content but having different designs. Create \"Hello!\" in five styles and put each in their own sticker pack – no problem!\n\nMost of my better selling stickers were text-based and were easy to create.\n\nThere are also animated sticker packs which I have not tried producing yet. When I make one in the future, I will update this post. In the meantime, I figured it would take a considerable time to create and so, decided to focus on quantity instead.\n\nIn summary, the \"sticker types\" (my personal categories) you can create are:\n\nStatic Emojis – Allows rapid creation because of its reusability\n\nText-based – Only requires minimal design skills and can also be reused\n\nAnimated Stickers – More possibilities of expression but takes significant time to create\n\nDesigning Promos\n\nApple requires each sticker pack to have promotional app preview and screenshots. A lot of iMessage Sticker pack designers basically ignore this and upload a generic screenshot of their stickers. This is a mistake. Promotional app previews are what the users see when they search for a sticker pack. If the presentation is attractive, it is more likely, but not guaranteed, that users will purchase that particular sticker pack.\n\nI design the app preview by highlighting the best stickers in the pack. I mix and lay them out in such a way that it shows that they are part of a single set and that they look good together. Sometimes, I even design them like they are physical stickers laid on top of one another.\n\nYou don't need to put all your stickers in the app preview. You also don't need to include all your stickers in the screenshot. If the users see that you only have 8 stickers in the pack, they might think that it's too little for their dollar. You can be creative in presenting the 8 stickers in such a way that it doesn't look like there's only 8.\n\nPutting \"more stickers will be added\" and similar statements can also have a positive",
      "The Rays appear close to signing free agent first baseman James Loney, according to Tim Brown of Yahoo Sports (via Twitter). It would be a one-year deal for Loney, according to Jim Bowden of ESPN.com (via Twitter).\n\nLoney, a client of CAA Sports, came to the Red Sox as a part of August's blockbuster trade with the Dodgers. On the year, 28-year-old hit .249/.293/.336 with six homers in 465 plate appearances for the two clubs. Boston was said to be considering a return for Loney, but the odds were pegged at 50-50 in late October.\n\nThe left-handed hitter would presumably come to Tampa Bay as a replacement for Carlos Pena at first base. Pena struggled last season, hitting .197/.330/.354 with 19 homers in 600 plate appearances.",

      "It was he who convinced her to re-embrace One Nation and now, as one of One Nations' four senators, he is poised to play a pivotal role in Australian politics over the next six years. He said the new One Nation team was a world away from the rabble who won 11 seats in Queensland in 1998, imploded and took Hanson down with them. \"They ran dopes, unemployed, inexperienced, not all that intellectual ... we're more cohesive than the previous bunch,\" Burston said. \"We're a more intelligent bunch for a start. \"We're not going to be a group that is going to block or run interference. We'll judge everything on its merits.\" The polls had barely been declared this week before One Nation was water-boarded after Hanson's Queensland colleague, Malcolm Roberts, a climate change sceptic, was forced to deny membership of a North American anti-government movement.\n\nMeanwhile, her West Australian senator Rod Culleton​, a dispossessed farmer, is to go on trial in Perth later this month over allegations he stole a $27,000 hire car last year. Amid such high-profile colleagues, Burston, 68, remains relatively little known. Cessnock born and educated, he was raised a Methodist and at 15 started a boilermaker's apprenticeship with \"The BHP\" (as the Hunter calls the former Big Australian). He married at 22, had three children, taught at TAFE, trained TAFE teachers at Newcastle University, went into his business as a draftsman – \"Some of my best clients are Muslim\" – served on Cessnock Council and later divorced his first wife. \"They ran dopes, unemployed, inexperienced, not all that intellectual.... we're more cohesive than the previous bunch. We're a more intelligent bunch for a start.\" Senator Burston In 1998, Burston met One Nation co-founder David Ettridge​ at Maitland. He ended up standing for the Senate with the other co-founder David Oldfield.\n\nBoth contested the 1999 NSW, the notorious table cloth ballot paper. Oldfield was elected with 9 per cent of the vote, but Glenn \"preference whisperer\" Druery's​ deal-making kept Burston off the Upper House red leather. He worked as Oldfield's parliamentary staffer and, amid the Brown's cow madness of the Queensland One Nation MPs and Tony Abbott's sustained attack on the party, Hanson sacked him, collateral damage in the power struggle between herself and Oldfield. Three years later, he was pre-selected but feuded with Oldfield who wanted his wife Lisa as the Upper House candidate. As writs flew, Bev Wallis, Hanson's close friend, a Sylvania Waters resident, rang Burston's mother seeking a rapprochement. Said Burston: \"We kissed and made up. She said she always liked me, and I've always liked Pauline. I've got a lot of time for her.\" Hanson had also started a relationship with Nelson Bay real estate agent Tony Nyquist and was spending time in the Newcastle area. \"We're very close friends now, she stays here often,\" Burston said.\n\nHe remarried in 2008 and he and his wife Rosie, a teacher, live in a house overlooking Lake Macquarie. \"Pauline was sitting in our lounge room in the summer of 2013 and I said 'Pauline if you ever want to get elected again, you have to get back with One Nation and you must change the name back to Pauline Hanson's One Nation',\" Burston said. \"She was reluctant at first and wondered who was running things in Queensland, so I rang Ian Nelson [One Nation Queensland state director] and said: 'How'd you like to have Pauline back? Two conditions: I'm her campaign manager and her preference negotiator.' He was very excited.\" Burston said One Nation would support the Turnbull government on the trade union and registered organisations bills but not on changes to superannuation, unless retrospectivity was removed. As a son of Cessnock, Burston wants to stop the Wine Equalisation Tax (he's designed and project managed a number of Polkolbin wineries) and seeks $55 million to clean up the RAAF foam spill at Salt Ash north of Newcastle.",

Wade Dies at 69\n\n(SFGN) Her name was Norma McCorvey, but in court documents she was identified as Jane Roe. The plaintiff in the landmark 1973 case Roe V. Wade which legalized abortion nationwide, died Saturday in Texas, the Washington Post reports. McCorvey, 69 died of a heart condition while in an assisted living facility.\n\nMcCorvey's story gained national attention when at the age of 22, she became pregnant while living in Dallas Texas, a state where abortion was illegal. McCorvey could not afford to travel to a state where abortion was legal. Attorneys Linda Coffee and Sarah Weddington heard McCorvey's story, taking the case to the Supreme Court. The class-action suit resulted in a 7-2 ruling to legalize the right to abortion nationwide. By then, McCorvey had given birth, giving the child over to adoption.\n\nAfter her role in the controversial case, McCorvey came out in the '80s as having had a 35-year relationship with a woman named Connie Gonzalez. In the '90s she began to speak out against the lawyers who had taken her case. McCorvey became a born again Christian, and later a Catholic, eventually joining anti-abortion protestors. But ultimately, McCorvey's homosexuality could not be reconciled among her newfound religious, anti-abortion community.\n\n\"Neither side was ever willing to accept her for who she was,\" Roe V. Wade expert David J. Garrow told the Post.\n\nVogue Paris says it's a 'Post Gender' World\n\n(SFGN) The French edition of Vogue will become the country's first magazine to feature a transgender model on its cover. Brazilian model Valentina Sampaio, described by the magazine as a \"femme fatale who was born a boy,\" appears on the cover of the March issue of Vogue Paris.\n\n\"This month we are proud to celebrate transgender beauty and how models like Valentina Sampaio, who is posing for her first ever Vogue cover, are changing the face of fashion and deconstructing prejudice,\" Vogue Paris posted on Instagram. Sampaio is pictured in a gold gown with a plunging neckline beneath a headline that reads, \"Transgender beauty: How they are shaking up the world.\"\n\nEditor-in-Chief Emmanuelle Alt wrote on the Vogue Paris website that she featured the 22-year-old Sampaio on the cover because she is \"the absolute equal of Gisele, Daria, Edie or Anna.\"\n\n\"In a post-gendered world which more and more designers are highlighting on their runways, Trans people, the ultimate symbols of a rejection of conformity, are icons that Vogue supports and chooses to celebrate,\" Alt said.\n\nWhile trans models and activist have appeared on the covers of U.S. magazines, including Caitlyn Jenner's Vanity Fair cover in 2015 and Laverne Cox's Time magazine cover in 2014, this is a first for France.

      "Thumbnail image via Flickr User TpolyG\n\nIn April 2013, a group of men carried out an attack on a San Jose Pacific Gas and Electric transmission substation, attempting to cut local power. Former CIA director Jim Woolsey, who has been warning of the potential to disrupt the electric grid via EMP, spoke at San Francisco's Commonwealth Club and described video of the attack. It showed three or four men lowering themselves underground to cut fiber-optics cables (protected only by a heavy manhole) and firing at least 100 rounds from a high-powered rifle at equipment, destroying 17 of 20 transformers and causing $16 million in damages. The former official described it as \"a systematic attempt to take down the electric grid\" and characterized the men's behavior was \"disciplined\" and \"military.\"\n\n\"We do not believe it is related to domestic or international terrorists,\" said Peter Lee of the FBI, despite nearly every single aspect of the operation being in line with the most basic definition of \"domestic terrorism.\" When America's top security agency is unwilling to admit that our power grid is susceptible to terrorist attacks, that probably says that they have absolutely no idea how to pretend to prevent them, not unlike the foibles of the TSA or the 50s' wisdom of \"duck and cover.\"\n\nThe former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, Jon Wellinghoff, also disagreed with the FBI, telling the Associated Press, \"I don't know what the definition of terrorism is other than when an extremely well-trained group attacks a major piece of infrastructure in an expertly planned attack.\" He went on to say that \"This is the most sophisticated and extensive attack that's ever occurred on the grid, to my knowledge.\"\n\nA handbook distributed to the US Army highlights in great detail the insurmountable challenges of protecting our infrastructure, from food and water to cybersecurity to our nation's potentially catastrophic and surprisingly unprotected power grid. In 1996, a tree in Oregon brushed up against a high-voltage transmission line, knocking out all major transmission lines between California and Oregon and keeping power from 5.6 million people in ten states for more than 16 hours.\n\nSeven years later, the Northeast blackout of 2003—caused by a software bug in Ohio—blacked out several large regions of the United States and Canada, affecting 55 million people for up to two days. Backup generators failed, water pressure in several cities was lost, and major water networks were contaminated, prompting officials to put out a boil-water order. Phone systems became nonoperational, partially from the outage, partially from being overloaded with panicked calls. Some TV and radio continued to operate with generators, though many were off the air for most of the blackout. Even Amtrak's electric trains stopped running.\n\nA film produced by National Geographic, titled American Blackout, depicts life following a cyber-attack that blows out the entire nation's power. Over ten days, the documentary-style production outlines the increasingly chaotic results of living without electricity. At first, electronic communication would falter and phone batteries would die, with no way of being recharged. ATMs, public transportation, and much of the internet would be inaccessible. Your car would still work, but none of the traffic signals would, leading to massive gridlock, especially after cars begin to run out of gas. People living above the sixth floor would find their water no longer running. Hospitals would be understaffed and overburdened due to unclean drinking water and any number of medical disasters caused by a lack of electricity. Crime rates would rise and police would be incapacitated without the ability to communicate with each other. The film predicts that the thin veneer of civilization would evaporate within two weeks, costing nearly $2 trillion and half a million lives.\n\nLast November, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NAERC) orchestrated a two-day training exercise called GridEx II, involving more than 2,000 participants from utility companies, the Departments of Defense and Homeland Security, schools, businesses, and a number of other industries. The massive drill went \"very well,\" according to Gerry W. Cauley, CEO of NAERC. \"A bit scary, but really well.\" This included 150 \"casualties\" as well as \"active shooters,\" preventing the ability to restore power.\n\nThe drill was held in areas of increased significance, due to their potential weakness as well as their ability to seriously disrupt the power grid. Their locations were not announced ahead of time. All in the all, while the training exercise went better than the first, smaller-scale GridEx, the general results suggested that as a country we are still not ready to deal with a terrorist attack on our electrical infrastructure. Of course, even if we were, we've still got water to contaminate, bridges to blow up, and crops to infect.\n\n@jules_su",

      "Green Man Brewery's Wayfarer IPA and Sunseeker Pils Are Now Available Year-Round\n\nAugust 3, 2016-Asheville, NC- Due to popular demand, Green Man Brewery is increasing production of their first-ever canned offerings, Wayfarer IPA and Sunseeker Pils. The Asheville, NC brewery released it's first can, Wayfarer IPA, in March of 2016 and it's second can, Sunseeker Pils this June.\n\nInitially branded as rotating offerings, the brewery has made the decision to continue production of these beers year-round, based on the acclaim that they have received. Both were also originally bottled, but as Green Man has introduced a can program, the style and drinkability of these beers makes them perfect candidates for the first canned options.\n\nWayfarer IPA, is an American IPA that is heavily dry-hopped with Citra. The pale malt bill allows for a crisp canvas for the juicy hops to shine. This is the third year that Green Man has released Wayfarer.\n\nSunseeker Pils is Green Man's newest packaged offering. An authentic German Pils brewed with pilsner malt and Vanguard and Magnum hops, Sunseeker offers a refreshing and clean palate while staying true to the signature full-flavor that Green Man prides itself on.\n\nBoth Wayfarer IPA and Sunseeker Pils will be found throughout Green Man's distribution footprint which includes North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and Florida. Look out for additional canned rotating offerings in the coming months, but Wayfarer and Sunseeker are here to stay.\n\nAbout Green Man Brewery: The legendary Green Man has existed for centuries but it's no myth that he's been brewing great beer in Asheville since 1997. Green Man is approaching it's 20th anniversary of producing some of the beer scene's most iconic ales. The flagships are consistently recognized for quality, and the specialty and barrel-aged offerings are highly sought after.

And I wrote this post while watching the show, so we'll have to come back to it in more detail when we've chewed over the videos and commentary, to give it a more balanced appraisal. So the second debate came to pass. And I wrote this post while watching the show, so we'll have to come back to it in more detail when we've chewed over the videos and commentary, to give it a more balanced appraisal.\n\nOverall, I thought it a poor debate. But my immediate response is to home in on Nick Clegg answering a question about the power of the UK outside the EU. There, he was quick to invoke the \"fax democracy\" meme. For a fleeting moment, I was really pleased. Clegg had created the perfect opportunity for a well-crafted comeback - a killer put-down - making it potentially the pivotal point in the debate.\n\n\nMy abiding memory was that David Dimbleby was scrupulously fair in giving Farage every opportunity to deal with the issue. In fact, he handed him the opportunity on a plate. And, however well Farage might have handled the rest of the debate, this he completely fluffed.\n\n\nProbably, unless you are a nerd, you would not have noticed it. But Clegg, in a generally poor performance - where he missed a number of open goals - had made a major tactical error, opening up a point on which he could have been slaughtered. He really did give Farage a gift, but he was also raising an issue on which we really need to score.\n\nOpen Europe yesterday. All Farage had to do was explain that Norway and Iceland had consultative arrangements in place and that they had vetoes. He could also have said, with globalisation, an increasing number of laws were made on the global stage, where the EFTA countries were fully represented, while the UK was excluded.\n\n\nFarage could have then said that in areas where they had major economic interests, Norway and Iceland had more influence than the UK – which had only eight percent of the vote in the Council of Ministers. And, out of the EU, we too could increase our power at the \"top tables\" of the global trading bodies where it really matters.\n\n\nFarage could and should have anticipated the question. There was a very good chance that it might come up. He and his team should have worked out a response, and rehearsed it. Here is one I've just knocked up, in a matter of minutes, the sort of thing I could do in my sleep, without rehearsal: Norway and Iceland have consultative arrangements and vetoes. That is more than our measly eight percent of the vote in the Council of Ministers. And with globalisation, most trading laws affecting the EU are made globally. At that level, the UK is excluded while Norway and Iceland are fully represented - they have more influence than the UK. Out of the EU, we would return to the global \"top tables\". We would then have more power not less. Timing that, it comes out at 30 seconds, allowing for emphasis. That is well within the allowance, and easily deliverable. But Farage showed no familiarity with the\n\n\nAs I said earlier, therefore, even when you give these people stuff gratis, they don't use it. Whatever the ill-informed rumours might be, that's why I fell out with Farage in the first place. He prefers to wing it, instead of doing the work. He might get away with it most times, and he obviously did in this debate overall. But there are times when being on top of your brief really matters. This was one of them.\n\n\nThat now brings us to Clegg's \"seven percent lie\". That came up several times in the debate, opening up another potential \"killer point\". Farage is, of course, compromised by his 75 percent claim, but I gave him We can argue about percentages all day, but the facts are – and you do like facts, Mr Clegg – that on the UK government database there are registered roughly 3,969 General Acts and 71,851 UK Statutory Instruments. That makes 75,820 in all. On the EU database, there are 20,868 EU acts - directives, regulations and decisions - currently in force. Whichever way you look at it, that is a lot of law we have to obey. The only mitigating fact is that, however bad Farage was on some issues, he handled others competently. And he did score some good hits: his Iceland and Switzerland argument was messy but almost up to par. Clegg, on the other hand, was much worse and consistently so. I think he misjudged his entire approach. He never really laid a glove on Farage and ending up being patronising and unconvincing, with a distinctly unimaginative closing speech. And",
      "Figure of 252,000 is a blow to Theresa May, who hopes to reduce number to 100,000 by next election\n\nAnnual net migration to Britain remains at a record high of more than 250,000 a year despite the declared ambition of the home secretary, Theresa May, to reduce it below 100,000 by the time of the next election, according to figures published on Thursday.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics (ONS) said the politically sensitive figure for net migration – the number of people coming to stay in the UK for longer than 12 months minus the number going to live abroad for more than 12 months – in the year to September 2011 was 252,000.\n\nThis is only 3,000 below the 255,000 recorded in the previous year to September 2010 and is a rise of 2,000 from the previous quarter's figure of 250,000 in the year to June 2011.\n\nThe latest figures are a blow to Home Office ministers, who have put in place new curbs on non-European workers, including an annual cap on skilled migrants and a clampdown on overseas students but have yet to see the net migration figures moving in the direction of their target.\n\nDowning Street said the government remained committed to getting net migration down to \"tens of thousands\".\n\n\"There is evidence that the changes we are making to the rules are starting to have an impact. It is still our intention to bring the levels of net migration back down to the tens of thousands. Clearly it is going to take some time,\" said the prime minister's official spokesman.\n\nNew moves to curb the numbers coming to join close family members and spouses by as much as two-thirds are also expected to be detailed shortly.\n\nThe ONS said that long-term immigration to the UK remained steady at 589,000 – a level it has remained at since 2004. An estimated 252,000 people left Britain to the join the 5 million British citizens already living abroad. About 190,000 people left the UK to work abroad.\n\nStudying remains the most common reason for coming to live in Britain with 250,000 overseas students arriving in the year to September 2011 – a similar level to the previous year.\n\nThe Home Office, however, pointed to the \"leading indicator\" of more recent data on the number of student visas issued rather than the ONS estimates of student migration which show a 21% fall in overseas students coming to Britain in the year to March 2012. Ministers claim that an apparent 62% fall in the number of student visas between January and March this year shows that a recent drive to curb their numbers is working.\n\nThe figures also show that the number of people applying for asylum fell slightly to 4,844 in the first three months of 2012, with 706 applicants from Pakistan and 575 from Iran.\n\nThe number of people detained for immigration reasons in Britain, which is already the highest in Europe, reached new record levels with 7,516 incarcerated in the first three months of this year – an increase of 7%. They included 53 children, of whom 35 were detained in the new \"family-friendly\" Cedars pre-departure unit near Gatwick airport. The coalition pledged to put an end to child detention.\n\nMinisters will be concerned to see that removals and deportations fell again during the first three months of this year to 13,386, a 6% drop compared with the same period in 2011 and more than 25% down from a peak in 2008 when a major effort was made to deport jailed foreign nationals.\n\nThe number of people granted settlement in Britain in the year to March 2012 fell by 35% from 226,478 to 148,144 but this was mainly because of a backlog of long-term asylum \"legacy\" cases moving out of the system. The number of new British citizens also fell by 10% to 175,298.\n\nThe immigration minister, Damian Green, said the figures show signs of progress: \"Our tough new rules are now making a real difference with a record 62% drop in student visas in the first quarter of 2012, and overall falls in work visas, family numbers and people settling.\n\n\"As these policies start to bite we are seeing an end to the years when net migration was consistently on the rise. But the hangover from the old system of weak controls means it is still too high and we will continue our programme of reforms to bring net migration down from the hundreds of thousands to the tens of thousands.\"\n\nHowever, the Migration Watch UK chairman, Sir Andrew Green, who campaigns for zero net migration, said \"tough measures\" were now needed: \"You cannot expect to repair 15 years of mismanagement in 15 months, but it is still worrying news that net migration is running at a quarter of a million a year. There is no sign of any reduction from the huge numbers that developed under Labour.\"\n\nYvette Cooper MP, the shadow home secretary, said the government was failing badly on",

      "New data shows substantial benefit in eliminating or reducing consumption of red meat and substituting healthier proteins.\n\nRed meat: in addition to raising the risk for colorectal cancer and other health problems, it can actually shorten your life. That's the clear message of the latest research based on data from two ongoing, decades-long Harvard School of Public Health studies of nurses and other health professionals. It appears \"healthy meat consumption\" has become an oxymoron.\n\n\"This study provides clear evidence that regular consumption of red meat, especially processed meat, contributes substantially to premature death,\" according to Dr. Frank Hu, one of the senior scientists involved in the study and a professor of nutrition at the Harvard School of Public Health.\n\nHow should you respond to this latest blow to red-blooded American cuisine? How much meat can you eat? And if not meat, what types of protein should you substitute?\n\nMeat and mortality\n\nIn the study, published April 9, 2012, in the Archives of Internal Medicine, a team of Harvard researchers looked for statistical links between meat consumption and cause of death. The populations scrutinized included about 84,000 women from the Nurses' Health Study and 38,000 men in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study.\n\nPeople in the study who ate the most red meat tended to die younger, and to die more often from cardiovascular disease and cancer. These people also tended to weigh more, exercise less, smoke tobacco more, and drink more alcohol than healthier people in the study. Yet even when the researchers compensated for the effects of unhealthy lifestyle, mortality and meat remained associated.\n\nPortion Control A 3-ounce portion of meat would fit in the palm of your hand.\n\nWhat the study found\n\nAfter 28 years, nearly 24,000 people in these two studies died from cardiovascular disease or cancer. How much and what kind of meat did they eat while they were alive?\n\nUsing questionnaires, the scientists asked the people in the study to estimate how many servings of meat they consumed. Unprocessed red meat included beef, pork, lamb, and hamburger at serving sizes of 3 ounces, or a portion about the size of a deck of playing cards.\n\nProcessed meat included bacon, hot dogs, sausage, salami, bologna, and other processed items. Two slices of bacon represented 1 serving; so did one slice of cold cuts.\n\nThe study determined that each additional daily serving of red meat increased risk of death by 13%. The impact rose to 20% if the serving was processed, as in food items like hot dogs, bacon, and cold cuts.\n\nWhat it means for you\n\nWhat does a 13% increased \"risk of mortality\" (for each additional serving of unprocessed red meat) mean for an individual? Dr. Walter Willett, a senior scientist on the team and the chair of the departments of nutrition and epidemiology at the Harvard School of Public Health, suggests this way of looking at the study results:\n\n\"If someone is age 60 and has a 50% chance of dying in the next 25 years, adding one serving a day would increase his risk of dying in that time to about 57%, and if he had two servings a day, this would be about a 63% risk of dying in that time.\"\n\nIn other words, the effects of unhealthy foods are relative to where you start, and eating red meat—the study shows—comes with a mortality tax. But there is also a hefty mortality dividend to cutting back on red meat. Consuming less than half a serving (1.5 ounces) per day of red meat could have prevented about one in 10 premature deaths in men in the study.\n\nProtein substitutions for\n\nred meat that can reduce your early mortality risk Substitute a daily portion of red meat with a healthier protein source to reduce mortality risk by the indicated amount: Red Meat Substitute Reduced Risk Fish -7% Legumes, low-fat dairy -10% Poultry, whole grains -14% Nuts -19%\n\nSubstituting healthy proteins\n\nThe study points to an even greater benefit if you substitute meat with equivalent servings of more healthful protein sources, such as fish, poultry, nuts, legumes, low-fat dairy products, and whole grains. The benefit was 7% for substituting fish, 14% for poultry, and 19% for nuts.\n\nAgain, says Dr. Willett, there is a clear mortality dividend for such substitutions. \"If someone who has a 50% risk of dying in the next 25 years replaces one serving of red meat per day with chicken, the risk is decreased to about 42%, and to about 40% if nuts replace red meat.\"\n\nWhat should you do?\n\nThe prudent course would be to try to reduce red meat consumption if you already haven't. On an individual level the exact benefit is hard to predict, but you can bet that reducing meat consumption",
      "President Donald Trump's penchant for well-done steak is well-documented, and yet somehow the Commander in Chief managed to commit yet-another offense against the beef industry of America. According to a report in the Independent Journal Review, during a Saturday-night dinner at the D.C. location of BLT Prime by David Burke, which is inside Trump's D.C. hotel, the president ordered his 28-day dry-aged New York strip steak well-done — and then ate it with ketchup (or catsup if you prefer for some reason).\n\nPer the BLT Prime menu, the $54 cut was also finished with herb butter (unless, of course, the prez asked for it without), and the unorthodox condiment must have been a special request, as ketchup does not appear on the BLT menu as a suggested sauce:\n\nThe Meat Show host and beef expert Nick Solares has gone on the record as to why the cloying sweetness of ketchup should be banned from all beef products, particularly high-quality steaks. \"Why on earth would someone choose to cover up such a carefully crafted ... beef with a such a sweet, overpowering condiment?\" Solares wrote in 2010. Meanwhile, Eater's Helen Rosner can't get over the well-done steak as an order in an of itself: \"Adults who won't eat pink-hearted steaks might lean on any number of reasons for their position, but almost always it comes down to this aversion to risk,\" she wrote in November, in response to the news that the then-president-elect was a firm-steak fan. That preference, she writes, \"is at its core an unwillingness to trust the validity and goodwill of any experiences beyond the limited sphere of your own.\"\n\nIJR reporter Benny Johnson, who supposedly booked a table a BLT after receiving a tip the president would dine there, writes that steak wasn't the only order: \"The sides and appetizers on the table were shared. Three jumbo shrimp cocktails were delivered before the meal.\" No word on what Ivanka Trump ate for dinner, or if there was any unorthodox condiment use.\n\n• Inside Trump's Secret Dinner: A Side of the President You Don't Ever See [IJR]\n\n• Trump Holds Court at BLT Prime [EDC]\n\n• All Donald Trump Coverage [E]\n\nWatch: How To Tell Your Steak Is The Right Temperature",
      "Earlier this week, I had a fun discussion with Dave Donaldson of Max Foundry about software craftsmanship.\n\nI think it's worth reading the quick Twitter discussion, but I want to be clear that I mention Dave because the respect him as a developer, and he was being a bit facetious in his comments.\n\nBottom line, Twitter's not the point of this post – it's simply setting the stage.\n\nI've written before about WordPress Craftsmanship which generally covers my thoughts on the entire process, but I don't think I've ever mentioned my thoughts on software craftsmanship as a whole and why I think it matters in WordPress.\n\nAs such, I thought this may be a good opportunity to do so.\n\nOn Software Craftsmanship\n\nThough I covered a bit of this in my WordPress Craftsmanship post, it's worth re-iterating that a craftsman is defined as:\n\nA person who is skilled in a particular craft or art.\n\nAnd that I personally believe that all softwares craftsmen are developers, but not all developers are craftsmen.\n\nHistorically, the order of rank that people followed were as follows:\n\nApprentice\n\nJourneyman\n\nCraftsman\n\nNow, Bob Martin has been one person who has been championing this in the software development industry for sometime, and seeing as how writing code for WordPress is a subset of that particular industry, I don't know see why the labels can't be adopted.\n\nDon't read me wrong: I don't see us setting up guilds or anything to do this, but I do think that we could do a bit better than using a combination of copying and pasting code from a Google or Codex search to introduce developers into WordPress programming.\n\nI think that this would go a long way into solving many of the problems that we have with theme and plugins conflict, but I digress on this point. For now.\n\nWhy Does This Matter?\n\nThe reason that I'm particularly interested in software craftsmanship is because I believe that building software should be treated as building anything else tangible in the real world.\n\nAfter all, we're working with a set of interconnected, moving parts all of which have to be able to communicate with one another, but also work in tandem and/or in sync with one another in order to ensure that the program works as expected despite a variety of external conditions.\n\nThe problem is that we've gotten lazy.\n\nBecause software can afford the luxury of generating bug reports, and get away with \"just working\" regardless of how poorly constructed the code is, many developers take the path of least resistance in order to ship something.\n\nWhen we do that, we end up sending ourselves not only to maintenance hell, but we make it difficult for the code to operate within the greater context of the WordPress application (let alone the WordPress economy), and we throw any type of engineer principles that have been developed for the past decades to the wind.\n\nAnd for what? To ship something quickly.\n\nBut the way I see it, companies that ship well-respected hardware and or software take their time to fine tune their product that maintain for more complex issues than many of us ever face.\n\nYet, we consider it good enough to ship themes that don't work in a number of browsers or that break compatibility with WordPress, or ship plugins that might work for some but break others (or break other plugins).\n\nWe can do better than this. And this is where craftsmanship comes in.\n\nBut How?\n\nIn terms of a practical application, I'm don't have a particular approach but I know that we're beginning to experiment with this a little bit at 8BIT with our newest intern.\n\nSpecifically, we're going to be having him work on some development and we're going to aim to treat this is as a true software apprentice process.\n\nSure, apprenticeships could be equated with internships, but there's a problem with doing that: Our culture looks at interns as paper pushers, and I'd rather treat the people that I'm working with who genuinely want to level-up their development skills with a title that's more descriptive of their role.\n\nAt any rate, I don't think software craftsmanship can be completely disregarded. Sure, it's easier to talk about, but it's a challenge to follow through on, but that's what I want to do.\n\nSo in the next few months, we'll see how this goes.",
      "Any manager who tries to create a strategy out of worn-out clichés and unexamined nostrums is dismissed. Yet in the United States and other Western countries we have grown comfortable with the government following outworn nostrums about free trade. We have elevated the economic theory of free trade to the status of a national theology, and we follow its simple dictums as if they were immutable laws. We appear prepared to follow the precepts of free trade wherever they lead us, even if that means plunging lemminglike to our economic ruin.\n\nToday the evidence should be clear to anyone who wants to look at it: our blind allegiance to free trade threatens our national standard of living and our economic future. By sacrificing our home market on the altar of free trade, we are condemning ourselves and our children to a future of fewer competitive businesses, fewer good jobs, less opportunity, and a lower standard of living. These unacceptable outcomes threaten us in ways that are all related to our practice of free trade.\n\nAmerican business's stake in these matters is clear. If we do not wish to live with these outcomes, then we must construct a new and effective way to think about trade that will serve the interests of both business and the nation.\n\nThreats of Free Trade\n\nAs we practice it, free trade has profoundly destructive results for the United States and other Western nations. First, nations that do not play by our rules practice unequal competition. Second, free trade puts us in direct competition with low-wage nations, countries that have a lower standard of living than the United States. Third, by allowing these nations to take over big sectors of our market, we permit the permanent interruption of an important relationship between demand and supply that has been the main engine of economic growth in American history.\n\nUnequal National Competition\n\nClassical economics teaches us that free exchange works to produce the best results for all, whether the exchange takes place within one nation or across national boundaries. But this concept works only when the exchange is an equal one that occurs within a common framework of laws, customs, rules, and regulations. Economic competition conducted under the law of the jungle leads to chaos and failure. The price system becomes a guide to nothing that is sensible or tolerable.\n\nThe laissez-faire approach to economics fashionable in the United States permits distorted outcomes precisely because it neglects the essential role of rules and regulations in preventing destructive competition. When each nation creates self-serving rules, free trade across national boundaries becomes destructive—an unequal competition under inconsistent and inharmonious rules.\n\nMost American companies facing international competition have encountered the problem. Most governments are playing a simple game: they use their myriad powers—subsidies, favorable banking practices, local content requirements, exchange control, and the like—to win jobs and gain higher incomes for their people or to achieve a favorable national balance of payments.\n\nAmerican companies, therefore, end up competing not with foreign companies but with sovereign foreign states—states intent on winning jobs and sometimes whole industries for themselves. Foreign competitors are able to beat out a U.S. company not because of superior economic efficiency but because of subsidies. Japan grants favorable credit terms to certain industries, and many countries give cheap export-finance loans. European nations have special treatment for the value-added tax on exported goods. Most of the Pacific rim nations have weak or nonexistent environmental regulations, and Taiwan often fails to enforce its patent and copyright laws. Laborers in places like China lack the rights of U.S. workers.\n\nWage Competition Among Nations\n\nAmong nations, competition over wages causes desirable industries and jobs to move from countries with higher standards of living and higher wages to countries with lower standards of living and lower wages. It is an unequal form of competition that explains much of the recent movement of industries and jobs out of the United States, undercutting our production.\n\nLow-wage nations can raise their standards of living at the expense of ours in two ways: export their people to the United States or import U.S. jobs to their people. The result of either approach would be the same—our wages and standard of living would fall to match the level of the lower-wage nation while, at least temporarily, those of the lower-wage nation would rise.\n\nIf there were free immigration and truly open borders, workers from the lower-wage countries would stream into the higher-wage countries. These new arrivals would compete for jobs, accept work for lower pay, and force the existing jobholders to accept either lower wages or unemployment. Precisely for this reason, of course, no one accepts or supports the notion of free immigration.\n\nWe do, however, accept and support the notion of free trade, which has the same effect. Instead of exporting workers to the United States, lower-wage countries simply import our jobs and industries to their workers. As the higher-wage nation suffers cutbacks in production, failures of companies, and losses of jobs,",
      "AT&T has shown an enormous amount of swagger throughout the entire story arc of its merger attempt with T-Mobile USA, much of which has come directly from the mouth and pen of Jim Cicconi, AT&T's EVP of external and legislative affairs (pictured above, far right); it got to the point during the merger proceedings, in fact, that the FCC said it was \"deeply concerned.\"\n\nBut today's comments by Cicconi on AT&T's Public Policy Blog regarding T-Mobile's announced layoffs border on the bizarre, saying that \"normally, we'd not comment on something like this\" but that \"AT&T promised to preserve these very same call centers and jobs if our merger was approved.\" The entire piece sounds like he's quite literally lecturing the FCC's commissioners, reminding them that \"decisions have consequences\" and that T-Mobile's layoffs didn't have to happen if only they had elected to allow the merger to proceed.\n\nTo use the layoffs as an opportunity to chide the government at T-Mobile's expense seems in poor taste at best — particularly since the deal is completely dead in the water and AT&T has nothing to gain.

We ran the included NiMH some, but also ran the truck on 2s Kinexsis LiPo packs. We skipped the included charger and used an iCharger 308.\n\nTurning: The Ruckus turns predictably. Its servo is a bit on the slow and weak side which means it doesn't do anything darty, but when asked to turn it certainly does so without washing out or oversteering. It can be made to turn tight by using a tap of the brake on corner entry, but it is at its best by railing outside lines.\n\nJumping: We only had one complaint with the way it jumped and that was its soft rear suspension which liked to bottom out hard on landings. Otherwise, the Ruckus was a joy to jump. It tended to jump fairly straight and level, while a quick tap on the brake or punch on the throttle would quickly level it out. It doesn't have a center diff, so some drivers thought it was a bit touchy in the air, but it couldn't be called overly sensitive like some of the other trucks in its class.\n\nBumps/Whoops: Damping and spring rates are right in the ball park on the Ruckus helping it handle quite well in bombed out rough sections. Its big tires and relatively high ground clearance also help in this regard. The Ruckus is truly great fun to pound through big rocky sections, over big dirt clods, or through the blow out sections on a track.\n\nOn-Road: While the Ruckus could be traction rolled by steering aggressively at speed",
      "This is more like it.\n\nA deal being announced today with Genentech points the way for 23andMe, the personal genetics company backed by Facebook billionaire Yuri Milner and Google Ventures to become a sustainable business – even if the company's discussions with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration stretch on for years.\n\nAccording to sources close to the deal, 23andMe is receiving an upfront payment from Genentech of $10 million, with further milestones of as much as $50 million. The deal is the first of ten 23andMe says it has signed with large pharmaceutical and biotech companies.\n\nSuch deals, which make use of the database created by customers who have bought 23andMe's DNA test kits and donated their genetic and health data for research, could be a far more significant opportunity than 23andMe's primary business of selling the DNA kits to consumers. Since it was founded in 2006, 23andMe has collected data from 800,000 customers and it sells its tests for $99 each. That means this single deal with one large drug company could generate almost as much revenue as doubling 23andMe's customer base.\n\n\"I think that this illustrates how pharma companies are interested in the fact that we have a massive amount of information,\" says Anne Wojcicki, 23andMe's chief executive and co-founder. \"We have a very engaged consumer population, and these people want to participate in research. And we can do things much faster and more efficiently than any other research means in the world.\"\n\nAlex Schuth, who heads technology innovation and diagnostics business development at Genentech, says he was drawn by the 12,000 patients 23andMe has recruited with the help of the Michael J. Fox Foundation, and by the physical data on those patients. \"That is something unparalleled,\" he says. \"Obviously the goal for us for this collaboration is target discovery to find new medicines for patients in a disease-modifying sort of way.\"\n\nThe deal comes at a critical time for 23andMe because in late 2013 the Food and Drug Administration told the company it could no longer return health information to its customers. This has hurt sales. It also makes it difficult for 23andMe to build its database and make it more appealing to large pharmaceutical companies.\n\nThe Genentech deal is not the first one with a drug company that 23andMe has done – it has had collaborations with pharmaceutical companies going back to the company's founding. Last year it announced a collaboration with Pfizer to enroll more than 10,000 patients with colitis or Crohn's disease in its database to look for genetic clues to the cause of those bowel disorders.\n\nBut the new deal shows the scale and power of 23andMe's existing database (or, as 23andMe refers to it, community) in a way that others have not. Genentech, the U.S. unit of Swiss drug giant Roche, will make use of one of the biggest communities on 23andMe's website: the one for Parkinson's.\n\nWojcicki and her husband Sergey Brin (the two are now separated) have been very public about their desire to understand Parkinson's, which runs in Brin's family. 23andMe has signed up 12,000 Parkinson's patients and 1,300 of their parents and siblings. These participants are amazingly willing to volunteer for research. In one study, one of 23andMe's partners wanted to take a deep skin biopsy from 24 patients in 23andMe's database who had a particular Parkinson's mutation. Eight patients volunteered within 24 hours.\n\n23andMe's tests only scan the genome for known variations. Genentech wants to go deeper, and will pay to get full genome sequences – that's all of a person's DNA – for 3,000 Parkinson's patients or their first-degree relatives. The goal, Schuth says, is to discover new targets for drugs and diagnostic tests. The companies have not yet decided who they will hire to do this DNA sequencing.\n\nPeople who have bought 23andMe kits and agreed to donate their data to research (that's about 600,000 of the company's 800,000 customers) automatically consent for 23andMe to sequence their genomes. 23andMe says that it is also able to share anonymous and pooled data about their self-reported health traits without asking. But Genentech wants even more: it wants to look at health and genetic data on an anonymous but individual basis. For that reason, the company will have to ask customers if they want to enter the study.\n\nOne big question behind 23andMe's business model has always been whether customers will be happy or upset when they find out that they realize they have paid to be used in for-profit research projects. \"I'm sure some people will feel great, no problem, and some will feel cheated,\" says Hank Greely, director of the Center for Law and the Biosciences at",
      "Manufacturers of airport security equipment have a message for travelers who fear they will have to give up laptops and tablet computers on international flights: They have a solution.\n\nAt least four of the largest companies making screening devices say they are developing scanners so much better at detecting explosives than existing X-ray machines that passengers could leave laptops, other electronics and even liquids in their bags, vastly simplifying airport security.\n\n\"It's a no brainer,\" said Joseph Paresi, chief executive officer of Integrated Defense & Security Solutions Inc., which has developed one of the new scanning machines that has passed initial U.S. government testing. \"It's not if. It's when it's going to happen.\"\n\nBut the speed with which U.S., European and other security agencies can put them into widespread use remains an open question. After being burned by attempts to roll out new screening equipment in the past — such as having to warehouse hundreds of so-called puffer machines designed to detect explosives because they didn't perform well in real-world conditions a decade ago — the Transportation Security Administration has instituted multiple layers of performance tests.\n\nAnd Congress hasn't appropriated funds for large purchases of the machines. Adding the devices, which list for several hundred thousand dollars each, at thousands of airport security lines in just the U.S. could cost $1 billion or more.\n\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security in March banned electronic devices larger than a mobile phone from airliner cabins on flights from 10 Middle East and North Africa airports to the U.S., citing concerns that terrorists had created ways to conceal explosives in them. Since then, the agency has been considering expanding the ban to Europe — over the objections of the European Commission and air carriers.\n\nAt the same time, TSA is conducting tests of closer screening procedures for electronics at 10 U.S. airports with an eye toward expanding them nationwide.\n\nGroups representing airlines and airports say they are hopeful that new technology could ease the need for the new security measures.\n\n\"The ban on large personal electronic devices in the cabin has certainly highlighted the importance of governments stepping up their support for more capable checkpoint screening technology to respond to emerging threats,\" Perry Flint, spokesman for the International Air Transport Association trade group, said in an interview. IATA represents 265 airlines around the world.\n\nThere is optimism over the ability of these machines — which borrow computed tomography or CT scan technology from the medical world to create a high-definition, three-dimension view inside a bag — to address the new threats.\n\nThe TSA has tested two of the devices and plans to place one of each in airports later this year to study how they operate in the trying environment of airport security lanes. The devices are built by IDSS and L3 Technologies Inc.\n\n\"CT technology has the potential to significantly improve security as well as the checkpoint experience for travelers,\" TSA spokesman Michael England said in an emailed statement. \"However, while this technology has shown promise, more testing is needed before it can be rolled out nationwide.\"\n\nThe current X-ray machines at airports shoot two views of a bag or bin, providing TSA screeners a color view of the interior. While superior to earlier generations of X-ray machines, they have their limitations. In tests by government agents, screeners frequently miss weapons and simulated bombs.\n\nCT machines provide a far more detailed picture of a bag's contents. A spinning X-ray camera can capture more than 1,000 images of a piece of luggage from different angles, allowing a computer to create a high-definition, three-dimensional view. By calculating the densities of material, even small amounts of explosives can be automatically detected.\n\nThe same CT technology is used in machines installed at airports after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks to detect explosives in checked bags.\n\nIn promotional material, L3's Security & Detection Systems division said its CT checkpoint scanner could streamline airport screening. The device has a lower false-alarm rate than current X-ray systems, which decreases the need for time-consuming, hand searches of bags, the company said.\n\nBecause passengers could leave laptops and other devices in bags, it reduces the number of bins that must be scanned, which also improves efficiency, according to the company.\n\nSmiths Detection Inc., the Smiths Group division that makes security screening devices, is making a CT scanner that it will submit to TSA for testing, company President Dan Gelston said in an emailed statement. The company uses CT technology in its checked-bag screening machines.\n\nAnalogic Corp., a Massachusetts-based company making medical and security equipment, has also developed a CT scanner for airports, according to the company's website.\n\nWhile there may be logistical issues installing the new machines, which are heavier than traditional X-ray devices and require more power, airports would welcome an upgrade, said Christopher Bidwell, vice president of security at Airports Council International-North America.\n\n",
      "DETROIT, MI -- The state plans to argue against a federal judge's order that water must be delivered to the homes of Flint residents, according to a document filed in federal court on Thursday.\n\nIn a preliminary injunction issued Nov. 10, U.S. District Court Judge David M. Lawson ordered door-to-door deliveries for Flint residents which authorities couldn't prove had functioning filters. Water is currently distributed through sites where residents can come pick up bottled water.\n\nBut the deliveries the judge ordered had not yet begun, and now attorneys for the state treasurer are arguing that the directive should be paused until they can appeal.\n\nFlint water delivery won't begin immediately despite court order, state says\n\n\"The required injunction far exceeds what is necessary to ensure Flint residents have access to safe drinking water,\" attorneys for the defendants argued in a filing on Thursday.\n\nFlint residents are relying on bottled and filtered water after a water source switch overseen by the state resulted in more corrosive water leaching lead from pipes and into the city's supply. An unknown number of adults and children were exposed to the neurotoxin.\n\nThe preliminary injunction ordering water delivery came as part of a lawsuit brought by Concerned Pastors for Social Action, Flint resident Melissa Mays, the Natural Resources Defense Council, and the ACLU of Michigan against the State Treasurer and the Receivership Transition Advisory Board.\n\nState attorneys say the preliminary injunction would require a \"tremendous expenditure\" of taxpayer funds -- an estimated $10.5 million per month to taxpayers. The state claims that 90 percent of homes and 99.7 percent of apartments had water filters, according to the court filing.\n\nDelivering the water, the state contends, would take funding away from other efforts related to the water crisis, like supporting food banks, school nurses and lead abatement.\n\n\"If the appropriated funds for Flint relief are redirected solely to comply with the Court's order, some of the broader relief efforts will be left without funding,\" the filing reads.\n\nTo deliver the required four cases per resident per week state and local authorities would need an additional 137 delivery trucks and drivers, the filing said, and increase warehouse capacity and staff.\n\nAlso, the state said residents switching to bottled water from filtered water would slow the system's recovery, as moving water through the pipes helps distribute a protective coating.\n\nLawson found the state's motion to stay the preliminary injunction warranted consideration, and ordered the plaintiffs to submit a response by Nov. 23.\n\nNote: The headline of this article has been changed to reflect that delivery is estimated to cost the state $10.5 million per month.",

      "Casual Arena's team has been developing Flash game browsers since 2008. Within the past year, they have specialized in game development cross-platform mobile and tablet games, studying different technologies and specializing in Cocos 2D and Unity 3D. This article highlights the differences between the two environments and compares them explaining their respective differences.\n\nDevelopment of 2D platform games\n\nMost mobile and tablet game developers want to make their game available for a multitude of platforms, or at least available for iOS and Android. Of course, it is always possible to make 2 or more parallel developments using native code (Objective-C for iOS, Java for Android …), but this is not recommended. The most efficient option is to use a development environment that allows you to target multiple platforms from a single instance of game development. Here arises the first big question: What technology do I use?\n\nThere are various frameworks and technologies available to the user: Unity3D, Cocos2D, Marmalade SDK or Adobe Flash, among others. Adobe Flash is virtually only used when your application is already developed in Flash for browser use and you wish to quickly migrate to mobile. If you have a very simple application (e.g. a board game) then it is possible to use this technology, however, if your application requires more processing power (e.g pool games, games with heavy graphics or animations, etc) Flash stops being a viable option. Cocos2D is a comprehensive framework, open source and completely free.\n\nThis is the main reason for it being the most used development platform, surpassing Marmalade or Unity which are not completely free. Unity3D has been and still remains the most used development platform to develop 3D games. With new versions of Unity, which include specific functionality for the development of 2D games, it has also positioned itself in a very solid position for this type of game, making Cocos and Unity the current two options for 2D game development. From our experience, we recommend choosing one of these 2 platforms for the 2D game development. But the big question still remains:\n\nWhat is the best platform for game development: Unity or Cocos?\n\nOn the internet, you are able to find many comparisons between these two platforms. When we started the development of our games we read all available data and information and used them to make our decision. The problem with these comparisons is that they were almost all very subjective. Developers who had specialized in Cocos were defending it. Those who used Unity defended Unity. There are really very few comparative expert game developers on both platforms. We have studied and developed for the 2 environments and we have an objective opinion: Unity is clearly a better platform. Actually, a more accurate answer would be: \"if you can afford it go for Unity, otherwise Cocos is a good back up\". Unity3D is a much more advanced than Cocos2D technology while Cocos2D is free and an open source. Consider the differences between them. At all times when talking about Cocos2D (or simply Cocos), we refer to Cocos2D-x, which is the platform Cocos2D extension (initially oriented for iPhone).\n\nCocos2D advantages versus Unity3D\n\nCocos2D is free, open source and more up-to-date. Unity, however, is expensive. It has a free license but is insufficient for professional game developers. The license cost is between $ 1,500 and $ 4,500 more per person (plus tax), which is a significant barrier to new developers. Cocos2D uses C++ programming language and light libraries, making it somewhat simpler than Unity. You can see the complete code for Cocos2D, edit or adapt it to your needs. If you are an expert in C ++ and do not want to pay expensive licenses for Unity, Cocos2D is the best choice. It has some very positive features, but there are not many advantages, compared with Unity. It has good physical engines, a huge amount of examples for each and every one of the features of Cocos2D, and a large community of game developers that support and improve every day, etc. But all this done by Unity too.\n\nUnity3D advantages versus Cocos2D\n\nEverything else. Of course, we always talk about 2D, as Coco does not support 3D software.\n\nDesign Environment\n\nCocos2D has no integrated design environment. The design of screens or interfaces should be done with programming, loading images and positioning them with C ++. You can, however, use external graphics editors like Cocos Studio (also free), to help you position elements on screen and configure certain objects. But this editor is much less powerful than that of Unity. The Unity editor is fully integrated. Cocos Studio, on the contrary, is not, and its operation is based on an XML file and it also generates a series of images from",
      "If the 2016 presidential election is all about Donald Trump, the gubernatorial landscape remains, to a large degree, about a more commonplace issue: the economy.\n\nFor the first time since 2013, we've ranked the overall economic performance of the 50 states. The results show a connection between a state's economic performance and its governor's approval ratings.\n\nTo determine which states are doing well and which aren't, we looked at six variables from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Bureau of Economic Analysis: the current state unemployment rate; the improvement in the state unemployment rate over the past year; the per capita state GDP in 2015; the percent change in real state GDP between 2014 and 2015; the percent change in state personal income per capita, from the third quarter of 2015 to the first quarter of 2016; and the percentage growth in year-to-date increases in jobs for 2016.\n\nThese variables were chosen to offer a mix of static and dynamic measures of the states' overall economic performance. (See details on our methodology at the end of the story.)\n\nAs in the 2013 rankings, we decided to focus on the top and bottom of the list because it's hard to say whether the states in the broad middle have relatively strong or weak economies.\n\nOur results are notable for their degree of flux. Only two of the top 10 states in 2013 -- Oregon and Utah -- repeated on the list in 2016. And only three of the bottom 10 states in 2013 -- Connecticut, Mississippi and New Mexico -- remained in the bottom 10 in 2016.\n\nAlso of interest, a majority of the top 10 states are either blue or purple-to-blue on the presidential level, while most of the bottom 10 are red or purple-to-red states. States with favorable economic results the past eight years would presumably be more eager to support Clinton, whereas states with unfavorable economic results would be more hospitable to Trump.\n\nThe parties of the governors, meanwhile, don't line up quite as neatly. For instance, two of the presidential blue states in the top 10 have Republican governors -- Massachusetts' Charlie Baker and Maryland's Larry Hogan. The red states of Louisiana and Alaska, which are in the bottom five, respectively have a Democratic governor and an independent governor who ran on a ticket alongside a Democrat.\n\nHere is the full list of states, ranked from strongest to weakest. Duplicate numbers indicate a tie.\n\n1. Massachusetts\n\n2. Oregon\n\n3. Delaware\n\n4. Colorado\n\n5. California\n\n6. Tennessee\n\n7. New Hampshire\n\n8. Utah\n\n9. Virginia\n\n10. Maryland\n\n11. North Carolina\n\n12. Hawaii\n\n13. Florida\n\n14. Idaho\n\n15. Georgia\n\n15. Minnesota\n\n15. Nebraska\n\n15. South Dakota\n\n19. Arkansas\n\n20. Wisconsin\n\n21. Texas\n\n22. Washington\n\n23. Michigan\n\n24. New Jersey\n\n25. Vermont\n\n26. South Carolina\n\n27. Indiana\n\n28. Maine\n\n29. New York\n\n30. Ohio\n\n31. Montana\n\n32. Missouri\n\n33. Nevada\n\n34. Illinois\n\n35. Rhode Island\n\n36. Iowa\n\n37. Kentucky\n\n38. Kansas\n\n39. Pennsylvania\n\n40. North Dakota\n\n41. Arizona\n\n42. Connecticut\n\n43. Alabama\n\n44. Oklahoma\n\n45. Mississippi\n\n46. Louisiana\n\n47. New Mexico\n\n48. Wyoming\n\n49. Alaska\n\n49. West Virginia\n\nHow the Rankings Coincide With Governors' Popularity\n\nOnce we compiled the state economic rankings, we cross-referenced them with gubernatorial approval ratings to see whether governors of strong economic states were being rewarded by the voters.\n\nIn general, they have been.\n\nWe used the results of a 50-state series of gubernatorial approval polls conducted by the online publication Morning Consult between January and May 2016. We also spot-checked other gubernatorial approval polls in the past eight months and found them to be generally similar to what Morning Consult found.\n\nThe approval ratings for governors of the top 10 states averaged 62.1 percent, while the gubernatorial approval ratings for those in the bottom 10 averaged 50.8 percent. No governor in the top 10 states had an approval rating lower than 54 percent, while six of the governors in the bottom 10 states had approval ratings below 50 percent and one -- Connecticut's Dannel Malloy, a Democrat -- had an approval rating as low as 29 percent.\n\nHere's the list of governors, and their approval ratings, in the top 10 states:\n\n1. Massachusetts Charlie Baker (R) 72 percent 2. Oregon Kate Brown (D) 54 percent 3. Delaware Jack Markell (D) 66 percent 4. Colorado John Hickenlooper (D) 60 percent 5. California Jerry Brown",

      "It varies by company , but at the two places I once worked ( which were on the lower end of the industry ) we basically had a layer of API code that sits between the game engine and the platform , and that API layer translated all of the inputs from a particular platform ( from the controller , keyboard , mouse , etc ) into platform - independent input data that the engine could process without knowing the platform . Then the engine would spit out generic outputs , which the API layer would transform into platform - specific graphics and whatnot . Our art teams , meanwhile , would typically have to export all of their materials in a different format for each platform , to best leverage that platform 's graphics system . The advantage of this approach is that you spend less time customizing the game for each platform . The chief disadvantage is that it 's harder to really push the boundaries of what each system can do , and you end up with games that are a bit less ambitious , have less jaw - dropping visuals , and run a bit slower . Higher end studios , like EA Sports , probably put a LOT more money into customizing games for each platform . This is also really only true of the large - format platforms : Xbox , PC , etc . Handhelds , especially with all the phones and tablets on the market now , have such wildly different technical capabilities that developers at all levels have to do a lot more customizing for each platform .",

      "Programmer , sometimes web developer , here . Internet Explorer has the perception of two problems : 1 . The perception that it 's insecure . 2 . The perception that it 's difficult to get websites to work in it . Obviously , 2 applies only if you 're a web developer . The real issue with Internet Explorer is that old versions stick around forever . The number of people running IE6 ( more than 10 years old ) is mind boggling . That means they are running a browser that does not have the last 10 years of security fixes , ability to handle plugins , show webpages correctly , etc . On the other hand , IE9 is reasonably secure and even performs better than some other web browsers in some standards compliance checks . The usual alternatives are Opera , Firefox , and Chrome . The have the perception of being more secure , and better able to render webpages . This was more true in the past , but the latest version of each is pretty close . Opera is the little browser that could . They were for a long time the most secure and best able to render websites browser out there . But nobody heard of them . Firefox , which comes from Mozilla , which was born of the ashes of Netscape Navigator , was for a long time the big competitor to IE . It was free , open - source , secure , and rendered pages better . Unfortunately , of late it 's become kinda slow and bloated , and the version numbers went crazy .

They are also supporting the Kurds , a population that identifies more with it 's ethnicity than religion . The Kurds are seen as a threat to Turkish interests , as Turkey has a large Kurdish population that they have been suppressing by force . The Kurds have seized large portions of Northern Iraq and Syria and the long term goal appears to be to found a homeland for the Kurds out of former Iraq and Syrian territory . As inconvenient as this is for the US , the Kurds are also hardened fighters who have won major battles against ISIS . As for the terrorist groups , there is Al Nusra , an Al Qaeda affiliate , and ISIS which is violently opposed to Al Qaeda . Al Qaeda does n't like ISIS because ISIS 's leader declared himself the Caliph of all Muslims . They are direct competitors and fight battles against each other on the ground . There are some ' moderate ' rebels left , defectors from the Syria Army who were not Islamic extremists . However , they rarely go on the offensive and are mostly protecting their own territory . Their power has steadily weakened and they are also being targeted by Russian air strikes . Turkey has made noise about possibly invading from the north , and have previously proposed a ' buffer zone ' in northern Syria . The international community does n't trust Turkey 's leader Erdogan on this because of Turkey 's occupation of Northern Cypress for the past few decades . Turkey is anxious to prevent the formation of a Kurdish state on their border , and there is even speculation that they are supporting ISIS financial so they can go after the Kurds .",

      "Disclaimer : I 'm not a doctor , have just been prescribed antidepressants in the past and it was explained like this ; Common antidepressants work by changing the level of specific neurotransmitters in your brain , which can affect your mood . For example in people with abnormally low levels of serotonin , SSRIs can be effective in bringing it back up to a normal level , the idea being that this will make you feel normal . Problem is , we currently have no way of physically testing for these low levels , so figuring out what kind of antidepressant might work best for a person means having them try different ones and seeing which ones help , if any . This means that if your levels are n't out of whack , then antidepressants can make them out of whack , possibly making you more depressed .

      "First of all , let me explain the concept of bail . Bail is an extremely old way of making sure that people show up for their trials without having to hold them in jail until the trial . To make sure you do n't run ( since , the logic goes , a guilty person would probably run before his trial ) , you have to pay a considerable sum of money . You get the money back if you show up at your trial . You do n't get it back if you do n't show up , or if you commit more crimes . This system was obviously very important in the days before photo IDs and modern record - keeping , and it is still important today . But what if you do n't have the money to pay your bail ? Enter the bail bondsman . They agree to pay your bail for you , at the cost of a non - refundable percentage of the bail . If they did n't provide this service , you would just have to sit in jail until your trial , assuming you had no friends or family to bail you out . If you do n't show up to your trial , the bondsman loses the bail money , * unless * he can find you and bring you back to court . This gives him a financial incentive to make sure his customers do n't flee . If they do , he can hire a bounty hunter ( in most states ) , whose job is to track them down and arrest them , taking them back to face trial .",

      "Think ahead to ten years from now . You 've just gotten married , about to adopt a kid , and your new family is thinking about buying a house . More than thinking ; you 've got one picked out . It 's going to cost $ 200k , but you only have $ 50k in the bank . You need a loan ( a special kind of loan called a mortgage , which is mostly just for houses ) . So you go to the bank , and ask them to lend you the money ; you 'll pay it back a little at a time , you say . This is the kind of thing the bank exists to do , but they still have to be careful : what if you and your husband turn out to be deadbeats who never make a single payment ? Or , what if you 're just in the habit of being sloppy about bills ? One of the things the bank does is call around to other people who might have done business with you and ask , * does CharcoalPhoto usually pay his bills on time ? Has he ever just stopped paying ? * If a few other people ( companies , really ) answer back , * yeah , we 're a credit card company , and CharcoalPhoto always pays his bills on time , he was never late once in the last five years , * then the bank thinks it 'll probably be safe lending you the extra money you need to buy that house . In reality , there are special companies , * Credit Reporting Agencies , * who ask different lenders about you- and everyone else- all the time , so banks just ask one of those special companies when they want to find out about you . You can ask them , too , so that you can make sure they have n't made a mistake . It 's a good idea to to to URL_0 and check once a year ; it 's free . So that 's why you want good credit . Now let 's talk a little bit about how to get it . The very simple answer is , borrow a little bit of money all the time , and pay it back on time , every time . The number one thing that credit reporting agencies look at is how many times you 've missed payments , and how recently . The other important thing is , how much of the money you * could * be borrowing , are you * actually * borrowing . Less is better . So if you get a credit card , buy a tank of gas per month , and pay the whole bill at the end of each month , that looks very good . The credit card company will tell you in advance how much money they 're willing to lend you ( when you first get your card , it will be something like $ 500 or $ 1,000 ; you can ask them to raise that limit later ) . If you borrow , say , 50 % of that , and only pay it back slowly ( this is n't against the rules , but it 's not a good idea ) , that can be a sign that you 're already struggling to pay your bills , and you might not be able to make bigger payments ( and , so , lending you more money might not be a good idea ) .",

They borrow money to buy X , hoping that the eventual price appreciation would justify the interest charged on the borrowed loan . This is called leveraging . What if price of X goes South ?

      "If your father is still able to make financial decisions and sign contracts, I see a better option. Have your father borrow against his equity to finance the renovation.  Example: the house is worth 400 now. He can borrow 100 against that. He spends it on the addition, making the house worth 500, with the same 400 of equity as before. (In some cases, spending 100 might add 150 to the house value, but let's assume here the increase is just what was spent.) When he dies, the mortgage has to be repaid. If he has no other money (that the two of you would otherwise split) then the mortgage has to be repaid by the two of you putting in cash. So you pay your brother 250 (half the new total value of the house) but he gives 50 of that to the bank for the mortgage. You also give 50 of your own money to the bank for the mortgage. Net result: your brother has 200 (the same as if he had inherited half the unimproved house), and you have a 500 house after paying out 300. Your gain is also the same as if the house was unimproved. Now if the house went up 150 by spending 100, or went up 60 by spending 100, you and your brother would also be sharing this profit or loss. If you don't want that to happen, you will need a different agreement. The advantage of the approach I'm suggesting is you just need one appraisal after your father dies.  Not accounted for in this is that you lived (without paying rent) in your father's house for some time, and that you worked (without being paid) as a caregiver to your father for that time. Some families might think those two things balanced, others might feel you need to be compensated for caring for him, and others that you need to compensate the others for your benefit of living in the large house. Be sure to discuss this with your brother so that you agree in advance whether a plan is fair or not.",

A lone ember, cast away from the fire trailed through it, before vanishing. \n \n He sat up, slowly, the stab wound in his chest aching, and peered out the window. It was pitch black. There were no lights. No campfires. Not even the ominous green glow of a mutants eyes. \n \n He sat back, and played with the small patch of snow next to him, which was slowly melting from the fire. He looked at his chest, his wound bleeding again. \n \n He shut his eyes. It didn't matter if he didn't wake up tomorrow. There was nothing left for him. A gust of wind blew through the window, putting the fire to rest. \n \n Kevin sighed, and was sheathed in darkness ",

I may be all in on a story about the lottery when I read about a Greek myth, which will get me thinking about how I can use that myth in a new story. Suddenly, all that I can think about is the new idea. I can sometimes incorporate that idea into the current story, but more often than not I find myself half-heartedly writing one story while outlining another.

South Korea ’ s obsession spread throughout the world like a pandemic. Everyone absolutely had to look picture-perfect at all times. Blemishes were shunned ; physical aging was taboo. God forbid you leave your house with the very visible scars of melanoma or the like ravaging your body. I still remember the day it infected my friends ( and though mindsets are not vector-borne, this one was infectious all the same). One day, we were all talking and laughing ab",

I learned get by reading lips but I could never sign so it was hard for people to understand me. My parents always said I had to learn so I could communicate. After they passed I was left with one thing. A piano. I had never seen it before. I guess they must've gotten it after I left for college. That was three months ago. Today after 21 years of dead silence I hears something. A ping or a ding I could feel the vibrations before I heard it. It was amazing. Intrigued I went to the piano and pressed a key. Nothing. Still silence. I sat down. And placed my hands over the old yellowing keys. Before I knew it I was pushing keys faster than I could think. That's when I felt someone grab my shoulders and hug me from behind. ``Hey sweetie.'' I read on my wife's lips ``whatchya doing there?'' I signed, ``I have no idea, my hands just started moving.'' ``let me hear it,'' she said with a smile popping up on her face. The moment I pressed the first key me hands knew what they were doing more than I did. It was like a switch had turned on when I pressed the key. I looked at my wife, she looked like she was in shock. I had only ever seen that face when I had proposed to her but today it was different. I stopped and asked ``what?'' ``That was amazing! How did you do that? Where did you learn to play?'' I read on her smiling lips. ``I don't know. I never learned.'' I signed. That's when she hugged me so tight I could feel her heart beating, no it was racing. So was mine. Even though I had no idea what I had done. I felt a tingling in my stomach. Why was I so giddy? It felt amazing to finally after all these years to be able to make my wife smile so hard and feel her heart racin",

Don't need to be published to make money. \n \n Most people do it for fun.

I watched as she was drug down the stairs, taken into the yard, and forced to stand across from her father, who pleaded with the leader of her captors – a tall man, with yellow, spikey hair, to spare her life.

What's on that list, you ask? Just a collection of names and addresses of people who didn't tip their pizza delivery drivers. \n \n This year, I'm charging $ 200 per name. That's in addition to the 50x hourly rate that my boss is paying me to just deliver the pizzas. What makes it better is that a couple people who are on the list have ordered pizza tonight. I'm going to make out like a king, tonight! \n \n Despite popular belief, nobody really messes with the pizza delivery guys during the purge. Most have higher priorities than to mess with people ferrying around food. Sometimes someone will stop a delivery guy just steal the food and hope the delivery guy tries to make a second trip ( so they can steal more). We do make that second trip, of course, which makes them happy. The customer's not happy, but we we get to stay alive in those rare occasions.

I provide her nutritious balanced meals, but what of me when that pompous new restaurant opens? I am there at her every whim. She conjures me to her side as she pleases, then leaves me to die when she's had her fun. \n \n I won't stand for it any longer. Yes, this time was the last straw. She tries to call me forth at her convenience yet more, but I was tired. I didn't want to. But she commanded, with more and more fervor. She kept poking and prodding. Shame to say, this time it was too much. \n \n I've never been so angry in my life. I berated her for all her trickery, all her manipulation. She cowered beneath me, suddenly so fragile. Instead of pity, I felt power. I was in control this time. I grew until my former self was but a dim memory. I was strong. \n \n I hear her whimpering escalate to full out screams of anguish, and I liked it. I watched every moment of her agony with joy. Her cries fueled my desire, her struggles satiated my desire for revenge. She crumbles at my wrath, pain flickering across her body. With a final spasm, she collapses. \n \n I ",

In his youth he would have longed to destroy these oblivious sheep, but with old age comes complacency and his drive for destruction dissipated years ago. He thought about the moment his villiany became old hat and tiresome. It was shortly after his most memorable victory, when he threw Captain Infinity, or as he knew him, Hank into the incinerator of American Eagle waste. \n \n The two were opposites in everyway. Hank with his brute strength, ability to fly, laser beam eyes, control of wind, and his glorious brown hair that had a curly q tip. Then there was Clark, he was weak, could not fly, wore glasses, bald, and had no control of the elements. Currently he struggled controlling his own bowels, wind or fire had always been impossible magic to him. \n \n ``That damned beautiful hair'' Clark angrily cursed under his breath.

He doesnt seem to enjoy the extra time ; I'm not sure if it's his senility, or if his dying prevents him from keeping his memories like the rest of us. The hospital is the worst.

Franz was normally not one to forget this sort of thing ; he took pride in his hair. \n \n ‘ Nessa, ’ he said quickly, coming up to my chair and leaning down so that the water from his oilskin dripped down onto me, ‘ Get up. We need to go out. ’ \n \n I roused myself from my half-asleep stupor and slowly stood. ‘ Why? ’ I asked. ‘ What ’ s going on? ’ \n \n Franz hissed at me, darting a look over to the others still sleeping on their chairs, and gestured outside.

The man says something in return but whether for distance or attention I could not hear him.

High school was still getting to him, and it seemed that his weight went up as his grades went down. His parents encouraged him of course, but he just didn't really have it in him to not procrastinate. Besides, with his potential just sitting at 60 on an average day, he wasn't really motivated to do much to change. \n \n As usual, he showered and shaved. As he stepped out of the shower, he looked at his POTENTIALITY+ Scale™. ``Fuck it'' he thought, maybe I'll break 70 ( he rarely did). He stepped on, and the scale left and made a meeting sound as the number began to skyrocket up, 100- 10,000- 100,000- 100,000,000. \n \n ``Jesus Christ'' he whispered to himself, this was unprecedented. The highest he had ever read about was someone hitting 60,000, and that was the President.

That should shut them up. ``Make sure the peasants don't loot the bodies, gods forbid they find any possessions they claim to own.'' One of the guards brought me a blood stained note. I tucked it away in my pocket until after the ceremony ended. I then read the note, it was in fact a detailed list of a famous slave trading caravan and all of their stops through our bordering states. I meditated on this wondering what to do. I then decided I would report this list to the United Nations, if nothing else it will postpone the strike that they are no doubt planning at this moment which my military is much to puny to resist. \n \n Surprisingly the United Nations rewarded me for my efforts with the entire profits of the caravan, 10x my nation's GDP.

I didn ’ t question him at all, to my regret. \n \n When I died, I expected to fell relief. I expected to feel relieved of my ordeal. I did not. Instead, I could only feel regret and remorse. You might be surprised by the fact that I was able to feel anything at all. Death was responsible. He stood next to me when my soul left my body, as if he was watching over me. \n \n “ You know, ” Death said without speaking, “ I always pity your kind. ” His non-existing eyes turned towards me. “ Are you religious? ” I was too overwhelmed to speak. “ Speak",

      "I could hear buildings crumbling. People crying and perishing. And yet, I could not do anything about that right now. At the center of the main street, surrounded by massive skyscrapers and with thousands of people watching, me and August were furiously exchanging blows. Every single hit released a shockwave, which tore down more and more of the scenery. And yet, we were so close in power that I just had to continue fighting. Not even an inch of ground can be lost. \n \n Finally! With a brutal elbow strike to the chest, I overcame the never-ending struggle. My former friend was sent crashing across the street, breaking asphalt and cars on the way. I immediately looked up, and saw an enourmous skyscraper, with it's lower levels completely wrecked by our fight, starting to collapse. I saw people inside, through the glass walls. They were terrified. They thought they were going to die. People should not ever think they're going to die. I won'tvlet them. \n \n I leaped up, and as fast as my upgraded body could let me, flew upwards, until my arms grabbed onto the falling building. I have never tried moving anything as big as this before, but my strength did not fail me. Slowly, I started moving the tower back to it's place, when... I saw a metallic chain, with a kunai on it's head, fly and stab itself in the concrete. Oh no... August came after it - his metallic constructs helped him to get here - and slammed his feet right to my chin. We started falling back to the ground, and all tha time, he was constantly pummeting me, beating me and shouting. \n \n ``You're a traitor!'' ``You're a bastard!'' ``You're a fool!'' ``You're going to die here, Frank!'' \n \n Bullshit. He fights for the Empire, I fight for the humans that made it up - it's he who is the bastard and fool. He stood on top of me and leaped away as I brutally crashed into a small building.

When my boyfriend puts his cock inside me at first it hurts a little bit but when he gets his hard rod all the way in I moan and my wetness coats his penis. I feel this pleasurable pressure inside of my vagina and I feel the thick fullness of his cock. He goes gentle at first and slides in and out slowly and gets wetter every time. He begins to easily go in and out. The sides of my vagina throb with the pleasurable pressure and I want him deeper. I grab him putting my legs in the air and say ``deeper.'' He obliges. I lay there moaning loudly and pulling him into me. I like to feel my breasts rub against his chest and bounce with his thrusts. He gets in a rocking rhythm. He pulls his dick out, and I feel my grip on him with my inner labia. He is teasing me and plays with my nipples. I feel this wonderful tingling sensation, but it feels like my vagina is burning with intense pleasure. ``Get inside me'' I say. He pushes his cock into me and I feel full of him again. He thrusts faster now reaching the G-spot and I feel him hitting the swollen bump like an itch that NEEDS to be scratched. I rub my clit against his pubic bone and go insane. I convulse and yell ``FASTER DEEPER HARDER OHHHHHHH'' and feel my body shaking and my vagina pulsates. He cums deep into my belly and it's warm and filling. We are both VERY satisfied.

Unwashed for the number of days it has been, there is genuine concern for his health, but this man had the tried and tested immune system of a bachelor. \n It would be tested again. \n In these routine mornings, the mug is accompanied by a similarly unkempt plate.

None of it matters, because the end result is the same : My blades pierce right through the concept I can never let my mind take part of. \n \n In the same way a mortal being can never understand eternity, an immortal being can never understand the passing of time. That is what I have learned on my journeys ; the only way to destroy that which knows everything is to force upon it the idea of nothingness. \n \n ``Only the weapons of a mortal could ever stand a chance of killing an immortal.'' \n \n I ",

The sadness was usual, he got it when leading the souls of those where were filled with regret as they died. It seemed like more and more people were dying with regret, and less contentedly. But the joy was because he would be able to see something he rarely gets to see, and at least ease one of the man ’ s regrets before taking him to be judged. \n The spirit of the man he was here to shepherd was leaning forward reaching towards the panicking women in the bathtub, while his body was laid out on the floor, blood pooling around the bodies head.

      "Sitting there alone was the sad inventor of immortality. Every day he would sit by the fountain in the floating park, feeding birds and staring listlessly into the sky. Humanity long ago outclassed his once superior intellect, leaving him with not much else to do other than exist. \n \n Immortality at first was wondrous for him, the rush he gained from discovery and all the time he could devote to research were truly a gift. He never shared his secret with anyone, preferring to work outside of the public eye to better humanity. Eventually, his work in scientific discovery gained recognition and caused humanity to shift focus. \n \n Slowly, the world surpassed him. Amazing breakthroughs were made from his unresolved findings, marvellous advances in political relations, and fantastic progress on interstellar travel. Humans kept moving, evolving, and advancing but not him, he was stuck. Never aging and lacking the knowledge for a cure he eventually fell behind, unable to comprehend the great leaps humanity had undergone. Ridiculed for his menial and rudimentary understanding of things he was viewed lesser than by most. \n \n Stubborn, the man would not reveal the one thing he figured out centuries before. His curse, the torment he bestowed unto himself and the last vestige of his once sprawling intelligence. Immortality. For all their marvels and wonders humanity could not solve the oldest of riddles, death. Spiteful of their success the man vindictively held his secret close, waiting for the right moment where his intelligence would shine again. \n \n Silently and calmly the inventor of immortality rose from the bench. He began to stroll down his favourite path ; stopping to admire the trees, a long sigh escaped him. \n \n -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- - \n \n I hope you liked it!

When they had resorted to such violence, it had been convenient for them as they had already been in line, waiting for their chance to throw away their transgression. \n \n Realizing this, the world committed sins almost on purpose, superfluously, and flippantly because as soon as they had cheated, lied, killed or stole, they could take their regret and dump it, free now to do what they pleased without consequence to their person. It soon became people had only wished to be free of morality but able to own happiness like some leashed pet. \n \n When I would once watch with the smile I have seen practiced on TV, I now could do nothing but weep.

Who the fuck was this drunk asshole to pity me? \n \n ``Think about it. Do you remember waking up this morning? Do you remember your parents or your job? Can you recall a single fucking thing outside of this pit of a bar?'' It felt like no matter how hard I tried to move I couldn't get out from under the weight of his stare. He was talking complete nonsense. This morning I... \n \n My parents names are... \n \n...

Then the shuffle sound of a boot turning, and two steps away from me. I heard the slide of my closet door, and the steps go inside, and I saw the dim light of my closet turn on through my comforter. \n \n ``Ah, yes.'' I heard. ``These will certainly do.'' The voice was his, the well-dressed beggar. The boots turned towards me again, and walked. Boom. Boom. Boom. ``Mr. Questions.'' I heard the smile. ``Are you really hiding under the covers?'' \n \n He ripped the blanket off me and threw it to the floor. He stood over me in a shiny black suit, a massive hammer in hand, and with one massive swing crushed my left leg at the knee. I spun, flipped, floundered and screamed for help.

Sooner or later I would have to stand up and fill my drink. \n \n ``What about you? ``, I asked, out of politeness. The girl almost seemed surprised by my question, and I sure did saw her raising an eyebrow. But she did not give me the time to poke some fun at her. \n \n ``The usual.

Then, she put some order in her golden hair, and I almost lost myself in her light. June was a shining star. And she knew it.

My wife told him I had stomach problems. \n \n I continued. \n \n ``Last week I took 15 painkillers washed down with a bottle of Pepsi max cherry, I didn't leave a note, your mum found me and helped me. You don't know this about me but when I was your age I got diagnosed with depression and anxiety. \n \n I could feel the single tear roll down my cheek. Justin faltered. \n \n ``Dad? Is this true?

No one would have known that chapel existed if it wasn't for the glimmering torches trail, since it was the darkest night of the month ; new moon hanging insipidly, along with bashful stars hiding behind clouds. Passing torches after torches, a woman was seen walking towards the chapel. \n \n In front of the door, the woman stopped. She lifted her arm like she was to knock yet she didn't. Instead, her hand was going to a pocket in her cargo pants and not for long her hand was out along with crumpled paper in her palm. \n \n The woman unfolded the paper, trying to unflatten the creases and started reading it. \n \n ``The congregation of St. Dismas is looking for the services of gunslinger, physician, and preacher.

I stared him down disdainfully. ``Obviously.'' \n \n With a shudder, he began to cry, sliding down to the sidewalk. I moved on, nearly late for my meeting with the city council. My project was simple, elegant, yet ground-breaking ; a work of art, yet practical, and above all, profitable.

He ``popped'' the soldier on his backside, in some sort of scolding attempt. It made no sense to us. They never killed any of us. They got a bit aggrassive with the more rowdy ones, but they werent blood thirsty killers. On the final day, our last attempt was made and sent a volley of nuclear warheads at one of the larger vessels that had landed in a remote area of Nevada. They didn't even attempt to stop us. They had been building something, so many of there kind were outside of the ship. The equivalent of 500 megatons landed on them.

But it was what she was looking at that really caught Rob's attention. \n \n At the far end of the office, where Nick sat at reception, a filthy-looking homeless guy was hammering on the glass door and screaming to be let in, a look of manic terror on his face as he kept glancing behind him down the stairs. \n \n On the office side of the door, Nick was half out of his seat as he tried to talk to the man through the intercom and reach for his phone at the same time. \n \n ``Sir, I'm sorry but you really can't come in without an appointment, I already said.

      "I came to the country of Liberia to help people. I really did. I was brimming with optimism and idealism. I was going to be a humanitarian. Then came the introduction at my first SGBV Conference here. A wonderful, beautiful little girl. Her voice the first ``voice'' I heard. Olivia spoke of how her family was displaced by war and how she lost her father, moved in with her uncle, and then it all began. He... took her. He climbed into her room, wrestled her brother out of the way and simply took her....repeatedly. Day, night, weeks, months. Her mother denied everything to keep their family fed. \n \n When the SGBV Joint Programme was finally able to help her she had developed a fistula. She couldn't control her bowels and this beautiful girl was....fuck it man... she was destroyed. She would have to be cared for her entire life. \n \n Then I started to work. I realized that this place can be hell and heaven all at the same time. That ex-pats ( aid workers) were psychologically different because of this environment and that local people were both good and aggressively bad. I developed a life here....I grew roots. \n \n Then, some three or four months later....Olivia died. Infection and the clinic not being able to support her. The recording... the one I listened to when I first arrived... had been playing on the radio repeatedly. Now it was cut off. The first ``voice'' I heard diminished in nothingness. \n \n And then, when the aid workers were making the talking rounds about this new event. I heard that everyone at the programme were in shambles. All of a sudden... the head worker stood up and said ``Listen... guys... she's in a better place but there are others we need to look after. We all know she would have wanted this'' \n \n I came to the country of Liberia to help people and by damn it I'll give every ounce of myself to d",

      "The Ix'Ath race had played their last card. Last night, as the peace negotiations between the Earth Government and Ix'Ath Ruling Group were failing, they had managed to send out one of their telepathic signals to their troops and started bombing the whole of Eastern Europe. And they were using the strongest weapon in their arsenal, their Dry Bombs. \n \n Dry Bombs were, in theory, pretty terrifying. They would suck out all the moisture from the atmosphere and immediately create a super-dry area which would try to suck in moisture from anything and everything, which included plants, animals and people. And while it was not immediately lethal, it was pretty painful and then lethal. \n \n But the Ix'Ath had 2 problems. One was their naming scheme. Their Earth names were words randomly picked from a dictionary, since we humans couldn't pronounce their real ones. And the other problem was that they had overlooked one thing. Or rather two things. One, was that dry bombs were ineffective at all coastal areas. At the most, they caused heavy rainfall as moisture and clouds rushed in from the sea onto land to fill in the moisture-less areas. And second, they did not know enough about Garth, Earth Government's closest thing to Desmond Miles, the one person who terrified them, whose name Ix'Ath mothers used to scare their children, the one enigma, who was Earth's greatest weapon - fear. \n \n As soon as news of the bombing reached Garth, he started 2 things. One was a mass information propaganda campaign, broadcast on alien frequencies, with the simple message, ``You've angered Garth. Now you're dead.''. \n \n And the second was the release of hundreds of photos of Garth, shirtless, all his oiled muscles on display, sitting, reading a dictionary, and appearing to write on a notepad titled, ``Kill List",

      "``Welcome to Earth!'' \n \n Supreme Commander Graelak awoke with a start to see one of Earth's greatest warriors, a Will Smith, deliver a powerful blow to the cranial region of what appeared to be a Hydroid-type life form that had crash landed on Earth. S.C. Graelak had fallen asleep several times now while trying to understand how the Earthlings had overcome a foe as great as those he witness in the historical archive labelled ``Independence Day''. Surely there was something he was missing. It seemed that time and time again, despite extreme statistical improbability, and all laws of physics that S.C. Graelak was familiar with, the humans always seemed to triumph. Precious little time was left now before the invasion, and S.C. Graelak was feeling very uneasy. \n \n'Beedoop', Graelak jumped as the com pinned to his left shoulder buzzed and chimed. Slightly embarrassed, and very annoyed, Graelak lifted his blue reptilian hand to activate him com. \n \n ``S.C. Graelak, this is Ensign Craol, all of the generals are currently located in Strategic Ops on deck 3, and await your presence.'' \n \n ``About fucking time'', thought Graelak. He had called for a final meeting to discuss strategy several hours before. \n \n ``I'll be right there. Thank you, Ensign.'' \n \n ``Thank you, sir.'' \n \n As S.C. Graelak neared the Strategic Ops room, he reminisced about how much more he liked just being a soldier. ``Back then life was simple,'' Graelak thought, ``You did what you were told, you killed as many of the enemy as you could. Now everyone is looking to me to design a plan to take down the most adaptable, and dangerous species we have ever come across. If it were really up to me, we wouldn't even be here''. \n \n A round of applause erupted as S.C. Graelak entered the room. The twelve Arkaegan generals sat around an oblong table, which was currently set to display the Arkaegen fleet's approach toward Earth. \n \n Graelak smiled and took his seat at the head of th",

I paused. ``Why aren't you in stasis?'' \n \n ``I don't need it. Better said, why aren't you?''

After a few seconds, Joe made it to where the man was, and turned to see him in the kitchen pouring two mug of coffee. The man motioned for Joe to sit down at the seat with the coffee mug “ Joe ” written on it in gold plated letters. \n \n Joe sat down and lifted his coffee mug to his lips. The coffee was obviously burnt. Joe faked a smile. \n \n “ Do you like it? ” The man said. \n \n “ Yes, it ’ s very tasty ” Joe lied, still trying to keep it down. \n \n “ Good!

It was me. Well, a younger me. Much younger. It was my sixteen-year-old self. She was staring at me with a curious look, sadness shining behind her eyes. I couldn ’ t believe this was happening. I had put all those years behind me, the first fifteen years of my life. I had been to countless therapists, countless psychiatrists. Begging for meds, begging for help, begging to make me forget what had happened to me. What I had ended up doing to myself. I was old now, nearing ninety.

Most of them were put down. Of those who weren't often found jobs a guard dogs in less than reputable places. We were questioning all the war vet dogs we had on record.

Around the world, the cardiovascular and immune systems of our most able bodied men, women and children began to fail, for no logical reason. It seemed that any heartbeat had the possibility to form a fatal blood clot, and even the smallest exposure to bacteria could break out into a mass infection. By the end of day one, half of the world ’ s population was lost. \n \n The root of the problem was easy enough to discover, once the data had been compiled. After a week of skyscrapers collapsing, airplane engines failing in mid-air, and thousands of winning lottery tickets being sold every day, it became clear that the probability of extremely unlikely events occurring had skyrocketed. As it turns out, we had built a pretty safe society for ourselves. But that had now become our biggest problem. \n \n But that wasn ’ t the worst thing. \n \n N",

It had been more than a year since there had been any reports of a zombie sighting but we were still in danger of dying out. We were spread too thin. There hadn ’ t been any births reported in years and too many of us were still out there dying of starvation and sickness.

I'm not saying that I really enjoyed crime and violence, but let's be real ; that's my job, isn't it? So I settled on heading to the warehouse and having a mature, sensible conversation with him. Maybe a pep talk. \n \n Maximus needed it ; he hadn't had a good evil plan since the heist of the 3rd street bank, which was back in February. \n \n When I arrived at the warehouse, it turned out to just be him and some fun-looking torture devices.

After a moment I found my breath and decided to call out. ``Hello, who's there?'' \n \n There was a pause and the deep voice came back. ``Hello. I'm Phil.'' I looked about, but saw nothing and then suddenly the voice was behind me. ``Hello!'' \n \n I kicked to turn the piece of wood and found Phil floating on the water, roughly five metres long, lounging happily in the sub, kicking its tail slightly to keep apace with me. It nodded as I turned and smiled, a wide grin of razor sharp teeth. \n \n ``Jesus fuck!'' I kicked backwards, trying get some space, but Phil kept up easily. \n \n ``What's up mate?''

Your generosity and intellect knows no bounds,'' he stated before he rose to his feet and left. I let out a captive, shaky breath. I was no king. I was no ruler.

On a whim I asked about the bodies. \n He shrugged and rolled his eyes, then took me through to the storage room where they were kept on ice.

I didn't exactly know what was waiting for me there, but it wasn't something I had expected. \n \n The backyard was a beautiful flower garden, which was filled with black flowers. The target clearly liked dark colors. I sensed something around the corner. I leaned against the wall, trying to listen if it was anything that I should be aware of. I heard heavy thud from the corner. I checked really carefully. I saw a line of blood, leading to a trapdoor. On the trapdoor, there was also a body of a man. Not the target, but something was off here. The target had been in my sight all the time, except at the corner. I couldnt see him anywhere. As if he had vanished. I should have left at that moment. \n \n But being the greedy bastard I am, I decided to see what was under the trapdoor. Was the target hiding something? Maybe he was a murderer. The city was full of those, so that wouldn't be much of a suprise. I sneaked towards the trapdoor, bending the shadows for the first",

My first experience at the DMV had lead me to believe that the foundations of the government were not resting on the Constitution, but the mind-numbing labor of soulless drones who have long been empty of any trace of vitality. My idea of the everyday bureaucrat was the semi-formally dressed ``man'' with dead eyes and the inability to smile. \n \n \n I'd shudder to think of what my young, naive teenage self would think of me now. Or rather, I would, if I wasn't preoccupied with hundreds of forms. \n \n \n If I wanted to, I could change what I thought about bureaucracy.

Just... let me go, and we can talk,'' I whispered as her arm pressed harder into my throat. She shook her head. \n \n ``I didn't know that they could make you forget so much.

Everything looks strangely stable despite being blown to bits - and the atmosphere somehow is still viable and holds on to the platforms. \n \n I go back to my brother in arms - who had been waken up by the deafening shred as well. One of them went back to sleep - but he needed to see this. I tried waking him up. \n \n Fucker turned to dust. We had seen him moving five minutes prior and now he's dust. That was bad. Everyone was tired as well - this could only last for so long. \n \n We tried everything. We consumed our rations of coffee, tried to keep us entertained. It was not enough. One by one, they would nod off. A single second of sleep was enough. Jake was the second to fall. We were playing Poker. He dozed off - and BAM. His head didn't even reach the back of the chair that he was dust too. \n \n Then Carter. He snuck off to the edge of our little patch of dirt to have a look at the surroundings. He noted that it looked like large chunks of crust and a good part of the core were just erased from existence. Some caves were lifted to the stars - barely visible against the backdrop of the night skies. He relaxed a bit too much. He too was dust in the wind. \n \n And then Jenn and Adrianna.

Humanity had enjoyed 700 years of peace, and only a thousand militiamen flocked to the banners. But the United Human Navy brought this handful of brave men and women to the front lines, with enough ammunition for 10 million of these creatures. By the end, the navy brought in another 2 supply drops for the militia. By the end of the Kepler campaign, 16 million, three hundred and 76 thousand, 743 Beltids were killed. \n \n The campaign lasted 3 earth years.

It was a wishing star. \n \n When Lake saw this wishing star, he did as any of us would do. With a swig of cheap bourbon not quite all the way down his throat, he wished for what he most desired. He wished for the ability to see inside his opponents minds. \n \n \n And I'll tell you, it went great. The next day, Lake went to meet with the head of the Siberian company, and exercised his new found power.

It's been 15 years since we landed on this rogue world, leaving behind friends and family to travel into the unknown. At a constant temperature of 65F, the planet was not too hot and not too cold. But there were no seasons. There also weren't any plants or oxygen, but in only 6 months we had made enough progress with the planet's first pass that by the time it came by for the second pass, the air was somewhat breathable, at least in short bursts. \n \n We had planted some small trees, greens, weeds, anything that would provide us with oxygen. Our biggest issue was photosynthesis. Without a sun, making plants grow proved to be nearly impossible. \n \n At least until we discovered a unique form of plant life already existent on the planet. We called it ``Ground Fungus'' because that's all it really was to us. In reality it was more of a mossy texture, but the really great thing was that it turned electricity into oxygen in a manner scientists hadn't yet deduced. All we had to do was harness some geo-thermal power to create a constant flow of electricity, and the growth of the Ground Fungus exploded! Within one year, oxygen in the first'Dome' was at 50 % of Earth's levels. By the second year we had almost too much oxygen and had created a system that monitored the Dome's oxygen levels and only provided electricity at key intervals. \n \n But 15 years later, the 10th dome was just being finished.

A time when we were cold and our food was tough. A time when we became sicker in the Winter, with only the caves as our shelter. A time when we feared the light that falls with the rain, as if the gods of the sky were warring with us. \n \n When the rains came, we would run for shelter under the overhangs of caves and we would wait.

I see only HER, and SHE is beautiful! ” Final inscription on the Monolith of Fables \n \n The Morrigan is the Goddess of Chaos, Mother of all Life, and the Mistress of War and Queen of Death. She was most powerful before the creation of the world, living in raw, untarnished Chaos, the raw essence of the universe, which was subjugated by Lugus and turned to Artifice. She seeks to regain her former glory and turn all to Chaos again and as such created life, Artifice infused with Chaos. How life will turn Artifice into Chaos, no one but the Morrigan knows, but both Lugus and Father Dis know that the key to gaining ultimate control is to control life, and thus the divine war on earth began. Even though she created life, the Morrigan still does not have as much direct power over it as Lugus, since life is still essentially Artifice and as such must act to destroy Lugus ’",

My brother told us to listen, for he had a story that we had yet to hear. \n \n My brother explained that most of the battles were essentially diversions. The Sayian commanders were waiting for a champion to prove himself. They would send this champion to find Super Kami Guru and destroy him, for they knew that the Namekians were only fighting under his threats. For once, they tried to keep the bloodshed down. The King had acknowledged that the Namekians were a powerful race, and he wanted to keep them as allies. Eventually, my brother was involved in a battle where a squad of Namekians laid down their arms and surrender. When Super Kami Guru arrived to wipe them out for insolence, the Sayains followed protocol and retreated, except for my brother. He took the full force of Super Kami Guru's ``Kyōda to Kyō no Furu'' ( Wave of Lord and Slug). The Namekian squad was able to escape and join the Sayains, but my brother was left f",

The polka-dotted curtains rustled, as an intangible wind swept through the increasingly-colder room.

I shouted as I hunched over on my living room carpet. ``Typically only one itches, but goddamn both of them are itching like crazy!'' \n \n But what happens if both itch at the same time?

Usually one is good, I can deal with losing my favorite book, or my dog shitting everywhere, or even that one time when the entire yard went up flames. \n \n And definitely I enjoy the pleasant good stuff like receiving a bonus from work, even when it's not a holiday, or finding the coffee pot filled even though I used up all the water. \n \n Could I endure great things coexisting with horrible things? \n \n I must! \n \n I threw my palms onto the carpet and began to furiously rub them against the spongy surface.

The judge apparently didn't want any of my shit and just asked the Devil if he would rather pay the payment or go to jail. *Alright, easy peasy* I tell myself, *all he has to do is not be a retard, nothing can go wrong. * \n \n Mr Devil did not hesitate with his answer ``Jail? For a parking ticket? Good fucking laugh judge, I've done things way worse than park in the handicapped spot.'' \n *He's a fucking retard*. So I paused time for a second..

A little easter egg.'' \n \n ``Well the Oberführer didn't take too kindly to it.'' \n \n Franz tugged at his collar. He'd been born into the regime, the only way of life he'd known, but his grandfather had told of the fight against the capitalists and communists. How the war had turned in their favour. Hearing his father talk of storming the streets of London had been one of Franz's favourite memories as a child. \n \n When Los was taken for expressing his preference for other boys, Franz and the others didn't say anything. \n \n Katrina had mentioned attending a rally, to drum up support for returning some of the powers absolved during the war.

The computer's monitors are covered in data being sent back from the probes. \n \n \n So far everything has been going pretty standardly, they would receive some data from the probes, usually about stars and how far away they are from them. \n \n \n Thinks were going pretty normal until one of the computers started picking up some data that looked out of place among all the information about star patterns. The person monitoring the computer looked at it in confusion, at first they through it was just a glitch and dismissed it at first. \n \n \n But very soon he started getting more odd data from the probe, he decided to call over a su",

He didn ’ t know whether the bullets had found their mark, or just made the soldier duck for cover. \n \n Regardless, the rifle was now useless. Wrapping its strap across one shoulder, he freed up his hands to bring out his pistol and continued to take pot-shots. \n \n A strong gust of wind blasted at their backs, the sound of rotors now deafening. The surrounding air had been cleared of smoke, giving Soders a good chance to take a breath. \n \n Behind them, the huey had finally touched down, its machinegun cracking as the gunner continued to suppress the treeline. \n \n Frantic, they both took the Corporal ’ s limp figure into their arms. \n \n Soders sensed something was wrong. As they hefted him up, there was no more crying, no more groaning. Looking at his face, his skin was pale, and his eyes had glazed over. \n \n His heart dropped at the sudden realization. \n \n *We ’ re too late. * \n \n ",

Too many deaths. Too many lost resources. Too much time invested by both nations. But one side decided it went on too long. They knew they couldn't be the victors, because at that point, nobody would have truly won. \n \n He only had to say one word, and it would all end.

I jumped back, shocked, and then secured my left hand by my phone and radio, wondering if they were still functional. \n \n “ It is okay to be alarmed. This is unusual and does not fit into your current world view. ” I registered that the being was laughing, only to realize immediately after that it wasn ’ t making a laughing noise, nor had its body position changed whatsoever. I forced myself not to consider if the being could control my mind ; there was no escape from that problem. \n \n “ Missingno? ” I asked. That answer had only confirmed that the entity was sentient, which did little in the way of judging threat level. I figured communication was the only safe option at this point. \n \n “ Y",

The times when the Ban on Poetry was merely a distant thought within our leader ’ s mind. ” Spoke the guide, whom hardly managed to force a smile upon her own lips. \n \n Ah yes, the infamous Ban on Poetry. A little act implemented a mere decade ago whose purpose was to limit the freedom of the people. It had of course been labeled not as an attack on freedom, but rather as a measure to protect the people. The government must have found some perverted sense of enjoyment throughout their campaign to push forward such a pivotal change in the history of their people. After all, they ’ d gone through such trouble to release the documentation of terrible poems that people had ‘ written ’. \n \n “ It is rumored to be the only remaining piece of poetry. It serves as a foul reminder of the terrible powers of poetry. ” The guide explained. \n \n She wouldn ’ t believe any of it. No, there was more to this than they were ",

For years we listened to their communications. We learned about their people, their customs, their culture. Eventually their transmissions began to ask us to come find them. They told us where they were, and they detailed everything we would need to get there. We followed their instructions and began building the ship. We were surprised by how efficient their technology was. \n \n I was appointed captain and we were sent into the stars. \n \n We continued listening to all of their transmissions throughout the trip. Today they were telling us about their change in leadership.

Their society was over and they were doomed to extinction. \n \n Minutes after receiving the transmission, we saw it through the viewing screens. We don't know what that thing is. But here in the voids of space it rushes towards our craft. \n \n To any spacefarers intercepting our transmission... I warn you to stay away.

I started to check under my pillow each night. I started testing as well. I hid something of my roommate's, then checked after he said he lost it. It was gone until the next morning, when it appeared under my pillow. \n \n I couldn't take this mystery. I had to know what happened. I took my roommate's camera and filled the bateries.

I would later come back to the shop and berate him for getting the eyes wrong, to quote me ``They didn't harbor enough hate.'' He simply looked at me sadly before shoving me out the door and banning me from the shop. \n \n A week later I found myself holding onto the same photo and asking people on the street to describe her. Most would simply walk away, but the few who were unlucky enough to assume I was a decent human being were locked into an incredibly uncomfortable session of listening to my drunken self loathing.

Walking down Monroe Avenue, John stopped to stare out over the inlet ; the sun light refracting in waves of pink and amber off the softly churning water. He sat for a while, casually watching as people passed and reveling in the autumn air, picking up the faintest hints of salty water and the conglomeration of touristy restaurants. As the soft breeze tasseled his hair, he felt a soft vibration in the pocket of his pants. After fumbling for a moment with his phone, he saw that the call was from the hospital. \n “ Hello? ” John said, almost irritated that the call disturbed his picturesque view. \n “ Is this John? ” a small, female voice spoke back. \n “ Yes? ” John said, skeptical of the innocence in her voice. \n “ This is Rossana with General Hospital.

You could not have asked for a more beautiful day. The sun was out and illuminating the perfect valley below them. Tier upon tier of rice paddies, just plowed, ready to start growing glorious Heichi rice, that the village was know for. Row upon row, until you reached the edge, going down and down untill.. nothing. For miles. The cliff just ended. Occasionally as Yeii watched, a small island would gently bob up past the edge and float out further away from them, enjoying the huge expanse of space it had, as if were showing off. What Yeii wouldn't give to be on top of one, watching the world go by, off on some amazing adventure. Off in the distance, the huge man-made skybridge of Zai-an-bok, proudly joining the gap between the two giant floating islands they lived on. Who would have imagined that something so incredible could ever have been constructed by man's own hand? \n \n Yeii was fed up, because he couldn't go and explore it. How could his parents stick him and his smaller siblings, Joy and Buki with their boring old uncle and go off without them? Well, he would show them. His rune powered kite was almost ready to take to the sky. He checked behind him once more, to make sure his Uncle Bookie wasn't watching and that his siblings were happily engrossed in their game, and silently lowered himself down into the water below, pushing himself off the wheel of the plow and further underwater. If he could just make it home undetected he could grab his kite, finish off the final levitation rune and take to the skies. What could possibly g",

When she read the last phrase of the book, ``all knowledge is now yours,'' she was 25. \n \n She stretched her arms, her bones cracking and giving her an instance of relief. Her hair had grown too long that it scattered on the ground, yet its luster and color remain, bright gold that shone like sunlight. Her small clothes had come undone because of her growth, but she didn't mind, she fancied her long limbs and developed body. \n \n She closed the book and stood up, admiring everything that she sees.

Barbara never took lunch. She simply worked through her pile of books, one after another. Adding the figures, hiding the profits, placing the spent books in her out tray. Hour after hour until she went home. You see Barbara has a unique power - she absorbed the emotions from books. The triumphs of fantasy, the passions of love, and the sexual energy of erotica. But her favourite was the dusty misery of the books, the latent energy of the firm's employees slaving away for the benefit of the directors.

Behind him marched the rest of his command lance, advancing like iron titans amongst mere mortals. Beneath them, shuffling towards the rear was a river of civilians, men and women torn from their homes on the western side of the river. They were bundled against the late autumn chill, their children led by weary hands or carried against their breasts, the able bodied pushing wheel barrows and hand carts in some crude reenactment of Terra's own bloody past.

Anxious, perhaps. He had awaited this match for a long time. The year was 1969, the place was Berlin, and the room was full. Ned had seen this as a sort of proxy war, as ridiculous as it was.

      "Elizabeth, \n \n I know it's kind of shitty to do this in a letter but I can't think of any other way. I need some way to organize my thoughts and get them together and this just seems like a good way to do it. I really hope you can forgive me for this some day, because you've been a really great friend and person to me. \n \n We're not working out, Elizabeth. I know you feel the same way, we both have for a while but we just ignored the reality. Mark, Jake and all of your friends are asking why we are still doing... ``this.'' From our first kiss this has been nothing but just an awkward situation... I was hoping that maybe things would warm up but I don't think we are getting anywhere. I think it's time we just stop beating around the bush and end this. We've been great friends for so long and I was hoping that there was a chance to be something more. I had a crush on you for quite some time but things just didn't turn out the way you or I thought they would. We are two different people, on two different pages, interested in totally different things. \n \n I know you feel the same way and I'm sorry if this letter just made things more uncomfortable and awkward between us. I hope that we can still stay friends after this and just kind of forget about the whole experience? \n \n - Max \n \n P.S. I still have that copy of ``MMLP2'' that you",

      "By of the\n\nGreen Bay — Aaron Rodgers didn't start his post-Super Bowl visit with the U.S. national team until Monday and did not make some key throws during warm-ups at Soldier Field, according to U.S. coach Bob Bradley's post-game statement.\n\nBradley, however, said he still has high hopes for the Green Bay Packers quarterback, whom the U.S. is currently coaching after an 0-2 start in the World Cup qualifying tournament.\n\nBradley, whose team traveled to Mexico on Sunday, said he has yet to watch Rodgers play for the Packers — in part because of the Green Bay team's preparations in the preseason. And the coach noted that Rodgers will not take part in Monday's practice at Soldier Field unless it's absolutely necessary.\n\nRodgers was a full participant in practice with the team on Monday morning.\n\n\"Today, he didn't play for us because of his physical situation with the team, which was not healthy enough,\" Bradley said. \"He's not participating in practice for us until we are ready to practice. So we're still waiting to start our season. He will miss our game. And while we don't know exactly, we have high hopes for Aaron. We think he can go. He can go, and I think he's willing to go. . . . We want him to play.\"\n\nBradley spoke from the team's hotel Thursday evening.\n\nHe was asked if Rodgers was at practice because he was being forced to or because he wasn't capable of participating.\n\n\"He's an important part of what we do, and he had a very big part in getting us here and making us feel that way,\" Bradley said. \"He obviously hasn't played the ball for us yet and is trying to adjust to being out there the way we expect, but he's an important member of our team.\"\n\nIn the three games in which Rodgers has participated with the U.S. national team in 2014 and 2015, he has been sacked eight times and has completed only 19 of 50 pass attempts for 190 yards with no touchdowns and a pick during those two games.\n\nBradley also discussed the lack of depth the U.S. has at wide receiver and cornerback behind starters Michael Crabtree and Terence Newman. The team has also struggled with injuries to both cornerbacks and has called on veterans Randall Cobb and Jarrett Boykin at different times than expected.\n\n\"You've got to give a little something to everybody on your roster,\" Bradley said. \"It wasn't as high, I thought, to the degree that some of your other teams were because we didn't have as many guys on the roster when we played in March, when we're at our highest level, that will take some of our guys off the field.\n\n\"We got a good group out there, and we're probably a better team if we didn't have a couple guys suspended at that level. But with how many guys you really have that can help you, it shouldn't take that many guys off, either.\"\n\nBradley acknowledged he hasn't seen enough film from the NFL regular season to be sure that certain players, such as safety Ed Reed, aren't simply benefiting from playing in the NFL. The U.S. national team has not played in a post-season tournament since it lost to China in the 2002 World Championship.\n\nLast week, Bradley was asked if he felt the U.S. players were simply playing under the circumstance of their current NFL contracts.\n\n\"We will look at everything that's going on and, as we've always done, and the players know our philosophy very well of doing things on a one-on-one basis without a lot of distraction of any kind, and they've got a great support group back there,\" Bradley said, before adding his opinion is based on what he's seen and heard through team meetings. \"The players don't have the time to do much of that, which is why they're playing at this level.\"\n\nThe Packers open their regular season on Sept. 11 against the Dallas Cowboys. Bradley, meanwhile, is hoping the team is better prepared for the league opener next weekend against the New Orleans Saints.\n\nThe Packers' regular season opens Sunday, Sept. 11, against the Dallas Cowboys at AT&T Stadium. The Packers' full schedule is below.\n\n2015: Sept. 11 at Dallas (home opener)\n\nOct. 1 at Oakland (wild card game)\n\nOct. 8 vs. Kansas City, Arrowhead Stadium\n\nNov. 13 vs. Arizona, Levi's Stadium\n\nNov. 20 vs. Seattle, University of Phoenix Stadium\n\nDec. 10 vs. New Orleans, Mercedes-Benz Superdome\n\nJan. 1 vs. Dallas, AT&T Stadium",

      "Finnish authorities have been investigating the possible involvement of a North Korean military officer in the abduction of two teenage Japanese nationals by North Korea and later returned on \"special\" missions for Pyongyang in 2014 and 2015 to carry out espionage, Japanese news agency Kyodo reported on Tuesday.\n\nKyodo cited unnamed sources as it said that the officer was a senior lieutenant colonel stationed at North Korea's Munsu military unit in the southeastern port city of Wonsan. It reported that the officer was also involved in the recruitment, training and execution of spies among Japanese nationals in Japan.\n\nThe two teenagers, who were abducted from the coastal town of Ryoji on November 22, 2014, and brought to Pyongyang in late 2015, are alleged to have been recruited by North Korea's military spy ring.\n\nNorth Korea's UN ambassador Ri Kil-Song on Saturday strongly refuted any suggestion of an abduction plot by Pyongyang, adding that it was \"totally false and insulting\" with regards to the abduction allegation.\n\n\"As the North Korean side has repeatedly made it clear, they have nothing to do with a human abduction, nor do they have any human rights abuse problem,\" Ri said in Beijing at a regional security conference.\n\n© REUTERS / Larry Downing Russia, Japan Share Cooperation to Fight Nukes in Korea - Lavrov\n\nThe two Japanese citizens, who were born in 1987 and 1992, are thought to have been abducted as possible defectors from Japan's private security industry.\n\nThe two are accused to have been involved in planning the abductions of two Japanese nationals, a South Korean man, and a Korean woman, all believed to have been killed before their forced return.\n\nWhile Pyongyang denies allegations that its agents have committed or are suspected of committing human rights abuses, the UN Security Council has repeatedly stated that there are \"reasonable grounds\" for suspicion.\n\nPyongyang has denied the allegations while urging Japan to release the remains of the two missing people so that a proper investigation can be carried out to reach final evidence.\n\nJapan is holding a diplomatic spat with China, its traditional ally, accusing it of not doing enough to prevent Pyongyang's suspected human rights abuses and demanding Tokyo explain the cases from which it took action.\n\nJapan's Foreign Ministry spokesman Yoshihide Suga said Japan was considering all options to hold Pyongyang accountable for the abductions.\n\nTokyo has accused Pyongyang of abducting the Japanese nationals, but Pyongyang has never acknowledged responsibility for the alleged abductions.",
      "In a video that's rapidly gone viral, police can be heard on their radio: \"We have an individual down in the parking lot.\" Within seconds, officers arrive, guns drawn, and begin their search with a search protocol that demands the immediate evacuation of a large building before an investigation takes place.\n\nThe suspect was a 51-year-old male, identified as Joshua Witt. According to WTAE, he walked into the building alone on Tuesday when his wife, who lived there, called to inform him the day before that he wouldn't be returning home after Labor Day. She told him that he was required by law to tell his neighbors where he was going.\n\nAfter he walked in without a note, police told a witness to call 911. When she refused, the police handcuffed her.\n\nAs part of their \"custody protocol,\" police ordered Witt out of the building while a search was underway. He didn't comply. He refused to leave, even calling 911 several times to ask why he was being singled out and be told \"no one is listening to you. Leave.\"\n\nEventually, police found Witt wandering in the parking lot. He was arrested and charged with domestic disorderly conduct. That search will also be video-recorded.",
      "Chen's mother, Lin Zhizui, said that, in the past year, she was unable to see her family's three sons, two of whom are in their 20s, because their mother was so severely injured.\n\n\"In the beginning, I told them they should just find a job and support themselves, but they don't know how to do that yet,\" Lin said.\n\nShe also worried about being able to return to her former workplace, the Changsha General Hospital where she worked for eight years.\n\n\"I don't want to tell my family that I won't be able to find my former home again,\" she said.\n\nAnother victim, Hu Guangyu, 29, has worked in a restaurant for three years. A regular customer of the restaurant, he was last seen on Jan. 6, when he left around 4 p.m.\n\nThe police said Hu's cellphone had been found near the scene of the crash. When investigators examined the phone, they found that Hu had sent a text message from his phone to a friend around 3:39 a.m. on Jan. 6, saying he was taking a taxi across the border from the north-western city of Guizhou to Guangzhou with the objective of finding his mother in Guangzhou.\n\nHu used his phone to call the friend again around 4:10 a.m., about four minutes before the accident. Police said that shortly after that phone call, Hu, who was living in Guangzhou, told his friend he had met a man from the United States on Jan. 6. Police said the man had told Hu at 1:30 p.m. on the ride across China that he could get to his mother in Guangzhou if he bought a plane ticket.\n\nChen's mother, Lin Zhizui, said that Chen has had difficulty adjusting since he was sent for rehab in the north-west city of Kunming, the capital of Yunnan Province.\n\n\"It took a year for Chen to recover from that, and we can only pray that his recovery time would be better,\" she said.",
      "In this blog post you will find a sample SQL query to create an entity from two columns for a given model:\n\nCREATE TABLE `tbl_info` ( `id` int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, `id2` int(11) NOT NULL, `name` varchar(255) NULL DEFAULT '', `address` varchar(255) NULL DEFAULT '', `fld_id` int(11) UNIQUE );\n\nAs you can see, two columns are specified, one column with a value of 11 and another column with a value of 11. The values of both columns are the same: 1,1. Now we need to create a table for which to store the entity's values:\n\nCREATE TABLE `tbl_info` ( `id` int(11) AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY, `id2` int(11) NOT NULL, `name` varchar(255) NULL DEFAULT '', `address` varchar(255) NULL DEFAULT '', `address2` varchar(255) NULL DEFAULT '', `fld_id` int(11) UNIQUE );\n\nSo, how does it look?\n\nSo, what does this command do? First, it inserts the entity's data into the database, so it will become visible to our customers:\n\nINSERT INTO `tbl_info` ( `id`, `id2`, `name`, `address` , `address2` ) VALUES (`1`, 1, 'John', '123 Main Street', 'USA', '12345' ) INSERT INTO `varchar` ( `name` ) VALUES (`John`, 'John' ) INSERT INTO `date` ( `created` ) VALUES (1, 1, '2016-02-10 11:31:55.999') INSERT INTO `date` ( `modified` ) VALUES (1, 1, '2016-02-10 11:31:55.999', '2016-02-11 02:31:55')\n\nNotice that the query's arguments are defined by the user, including the model class name and its name as parameter. The column values are declared in the same place within our model class:\n\n-- model class varchar(255) = 'dbl' AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT NOT NULL DEFAULT '1' DEFAULT '1' -- name VALUES ('John', 'John')\n\nAt this point, we can use the query's method to retrieve the generated id values:\n\nhstore.hstore(tbl_info.fld_id)\n\nThis call returns a unique number that is generated by Hstore; one is generated every time the database's table is opened.\n\nAnd here's the result:\n\nYou can see the original column values:\n\nYou can also see the original values for both the column's primary keys on my test database.\n\nIn SQL Server 2017 (15.11), this call would be more efficient, because Hstore does this internally to avoid storing the column values in a remote table.\n\nIn this blog post, I will show you how to build a simple query that queries the remote table and retrieves the corresponding values.\n\nI will use an example table named 'info' that I've created earlier:\n\n-- createinfotable.sql CREATE TABLE info( `id` int NOT NULL, `name` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf 8, `address` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf 8 ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1;\n\n-- testserver.sql DECLARE @info TABLE ( `id` int NOT NULL, `name` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf 8, `address` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf 8, `address2` varchar(255) CHARACTER SET utf8 COLLATE utf 8, `info` varchar(255) NOT NULL, PRIMARY KEY (`id`), KEY `info` (`id`, `name`), KEY `address` (`address`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=latin1; SELECT @info.fld_id, @info.name, @info.address FROM #testserver.sql INNER JOIN #teststore.info #info AS info ON info.fld_id = info.id WHERE info.info_id IN (1",

      "I got the new Moto X Play (2017, 7.0) for review last month after waiting for this phone over 3 months. My first impressions of the phone were very positive. It was easy to find my way around and I was very impressed with the performance. The camera was very good and it felt like the device could even hold its own against the best mid range phones. The Moto X Play has no real competition to speak of so when you take a look at the price, you might not be too worried.\n\nThat being said, when I have to say a phone is good it doesn't take much to put it over the top. The Moto X Play comes in at $200.00 so it does have a bit of the pricetag of a midrange phone, but it definitely does better than some of the higher priced flagships out there.\n\nWhen it comes to design the Moto X Play has a simple look but a solid feel thanks to the Gorilla Glass 4 screen. It also manages to stay within the limits of $200 on most carriers. It's just a shame that Motorola didn't give the Moto E a proper metal back. Now that Motorola has removed the Gorilla Glass 4 on the Moto G5.2 I am hoping Motorola will offer this phone in a metal build.\n\nThe Moto X Play does cost a little more than the regular Moto E since the base model sells for $180 from Motorola. That being said, the Moto E is a very good phone on its own. For most people the extra $20 over the Moto X isn't that much of an extra. The phone does what it's meant to do.\n\nThe Moto X Play has a few other decent accessories including an additional 3m cable and the Turbo Charger.\n\nHardware Specs\n\nSpecs at a glance: Motorola Moto X Play Screen Size 5.7 inches Display Type IPS LCD (IPS 1.5D) Processor Snapdragon 630 SoC Quad Cortex-A53 (4x1.7 GHz Cortex A53 @ 1.8GHz) Dual Kryo @ 1.9GHz with Adreno 506 GPU RAM 4GB Storage 32GB Battery 6410 mAh Starting Price $200 Cameras Rear Camera 21MP, f/2.0, Phase Detection, Dual LED, 2.0µm pixels, OmniVision OV5635 Additional Features Dual Ambient Light Sensors (dual tone) Front Camera 8MP, f/2.0, OmniVision OV5635 Storage 32GB, microSD up to 256GB Connectivity Wi-Fi\n\n\nBluetooth 4.2\n\n\nGPS (A-GPS/GLONASS)\n\n\nNFC USB 2.0\n\n\nUSB-Type C\n\n\nNanoSIM Display 5.7-inch 1920x1080 IPS LCD Processor 28nm Snapdragon 630\n\n\n2x1.7GHz octa-core + 3x1.9GHz + 1.4GHz dual-core GPU 1.85GHz Quad Cortex-A53 @ 1.8GHz RAM 4GB LPDDR4, 64-bit, 2GB LPDDR3 Operating System Android 7.1.1 Display Type AMOLED Software Android 7.1.1 Colors AMOLED Battery Size 3,000 mAh",
      "\nThis is a story about a man.\n\nOn August 25, 2007, a man was found dead on a road near the town of Oakey in northern New South Wales. After receiving a report of the man's body at around 11:45 p.m. that evening, detectives from the South Coast Homicide Squad were called in to investigate.\n\nIn the ensuing investigation, it was found that the man, who was known as \"Nick\", had walked more than 600 kilometres from his home in the northern Sydney suburb of Marrickville back to his hometown in Oakey.\n\nThe day after his body was found, an official cause of death was declared as heart failure. A coronial inquest into the man's death is ongoing, but preliminary findings suggest that Nick took his own life.\n\nNick's family have since been joined by the wider police community in a campaign to raise awareness of suicide, with a series of posts appearing on his son's Facebook page. Nick's brother, Jake Pritchard, spoke about the family's love for their late brother and how tough it is to have \"an awful thing happen that you never want to feel again.\"\n\nJake, 27, told Fairfax Media he \"felt so empty\" after learning his brother had taken his own life.\n\n\"It was the first thing I said. I can't express how empty and empty it made me to find out his suicide had had an out, that it was not due to anything on the outside. It was something that he had to go through in his own mind.\"\n\nThe campaign has already gone some way towards shedding light on a highly publicised but relatively uncommon cause of death — suicidal behaviour.\n\nThe number of people committing suicide in Australia has risen over the past decade and, in 2015, it was the 13th leading cause of death for males. According to the latest data from the World Health Organization, on any given day some 10,000 children between the ages of 15 and 24 in Australia will attempt suicide, about 2,500 will complete suicide, and 20,000 will make a successful, lethal attempt.\n\nThe number of suicides in Australia has doubled in eight years after increasing at a rate of almost 4 per cent a year between 2000 and 2006. However, the proportion of those seeking aid is rising more slowly — from 1.35 per cent between 2000 and 2006 to 1.5 per cent in 2015. There were also more attempts made by men than women between 2006 and 2015.\n\nIt's estimated that at least one person attempts suicide every six minutes in Australia.\n\n\"The problem is nobody believes it when people have suicidal thoughts. So what we're seeing now is a real challenge in providing support around those kinds of issues. So when someone has suicidal thoughts, we want to make sure they don't get into the situation where they attempt suicide. We want to make sure that, if someone does attempt suicide, we intervene and get them the help they need to prevent them from dying,\" said Dr. Jo Wright, the director of the National Suicide Research Foundation at the University of New South Wales in Sydney.\n\nThe NSW government has taken measures to help reduce the likelihood of suicides by setting up a national suicide prevention hotline and making it easier to access support including mental health treatment, among other initiatives.\n\nDespite these measures, some of the most vulnerable communities are still at risk of suicide, and there are still pockets of the community in which suicide is not perceived as a major problem. For example, there are pockets of high concentrations of Indigenous Australians with high levels of mental illness, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture and lifestyles that may exacerbate suicidal behaviours.\n\nThe Australian Research Council and the United States Centres for Disease Control and Prevention are funding a study of suicide in Northern New South Wales as part of the Suicide Research Consortium, which aims to improve the understanding of patterns and trends of suicide across Australia.\n\nAccording to police, suicide rates remained relatively stable across all age groups in 2016, with two young people dying and six adults dying from suicide — mostly men.\n\nBut for Indigenous Australians, suicide rates continued to rise in 2016, with Indigenous Indigenous people between the ages of 15 and 34 accounting for over 55 per cent of all suicide deaths.\n\nOver the past decade there has been a significant shift to a higher proportion of females dying from suicide compared to males [see graph]. This decline in the proportion of males dying from suicide — from 12 per cent in 1995 to 7 per cent in 2016 — has been accompanied by a more pronounced rate of increase for females.\n\nAAP\n\nIt's not just in Northern NSW, however. In the same period, rates of women and girls in all states and territories continued to decline in suicide for both sexes, even as the proportion of males continuing to die from suicide increased over the same period.\n\nWhy is this happening?\n\nFor some, the link between suicide and Indigenous culture is difficult to understand.\n\n\"There",
      "The New Brunswick Conservative leadership race, in which four candidates are vying to lead the province's sixth federal riding, is set to begin March 13, but some potential candidates, including the current incumbent and MP Scott Reid, have already decided to move forward with other campaigns or do not expect to run, reports the CBC's Jennifer Graham.\n\nReid has reportedly decided against challenging NDP incumbent Greg Selinger, who had to relinquish the leadership of the provincial Tories last November following a near-wipeout from the legislature.\n\nHowever it's expected that the two other leadership contenders, former cabinet minister David Alward, who was re-elected in 2012, and former deputy prime minister Peter MacKay, have also decided to leave the seat vacant.\n\nThe NDP's Selinger, who has been prime ministerial-like as leader of the provincial party since 2000, currently holds the seat he has occupied since 2002.\n\nWith his election win, he gained the confidence of many federal Conservative MPs across the country.\n\nThe Liberals are hoping to replace former minister Peter MacKay as leader. (Canadian Press)\n\n'I'm a very happy guy'\n\nHowever Reid told CBC Radio's The House on Sunday that that was still up in the air.\n\n\"I'm not saying no, but I'm not sure how to answer that question. I really don't know yet,\" he said.\n\nReid says he and Selinger talked over the weekend about the idea of moving onto other things but also said that he's hoping to give Reid more time to heal from the surgery he had in December.\n\n\"I'm excited for the next four weeks ... I think it's all about healing the wounds,\" he said.\n\nAsked if he thinks there will be any surprises or surprises in the race to succeed John Baird as the prime minister, Reid said he expected there would be some, but also said that with no federal byelections this time of year, he did not plan on putting himself in a race.\n\n\"I think it would be a complete mistake that would put an incumbent incumbent in a situation where he would have to step aside. That is simply the wrong circumstance.

      "The Obama administration's new regulations for small businesses will force more American employers to raise the minimum wage.\n\nThe wage floor is expected to rise to $10.10 per hour by 2016, from its current level of $7.25. The new rules, issued by the National Labor Relations Board on Thursday, are the president's latest attempt to ensure that Americans earn at least minimum wage.\n\nSince the minimum wage was last raised in July 2009, wages have increased more slowly than prices across the United States, according to the National Employment Law Project's analysis of federal data. As a result, the hourly pay of lower levels of Americans has not kept pace over time.\n\nMany U.S. businesses rely heavily on low-skilled workers. Because they are often the lowest paid workers, they are often excluded from raising pay. However, a rising minimum wage would benefit all low-paid workers, not just those in low-wage industries. As NPR has reported, \"Economists tell us that by raising the minimum wage in a country as large as the U.S., it can raise the pay of low-paying low-skill workers in such major industries as construction and hospitality, or even all low-skilled workers, in areas like retail and fast-food.\"\n\nPresident Obama has made improving the wages of low-wage workers a priority during this year's State of the Union address. \"Let's not forget all working moms and all American dads that are working hard right now,\" he said. \"They just got a pay raise or a raise of 20 percent or more, but we've got to keep up the pressure here at home to let the next generation of young Americans have that chance, too, so that we can create decent jobs for our kids and the future of their families.\"\n\nIn October, the president issued an executive order requiring federal contractors to pay the minimum wage, as well as an increase in overtime pay. In addition, he created an advisory board on workers' rights in small businesses.\n\nAs of Feb. 28, 3,086 businesses with more than 50 employees had not reached the minimum wage by the rules established by the administration, according to a Government Accountability Office report cited by The Verge. The report noted that workers earning the minimum wage made up just 3.5 percent of all U.S. workers, but represented 15.4 percent of restaurant workers and 18.3 percent of housekeepers.\n\nFollow Stories Like This Get the Monitor stories you care about delivered to your inbox.\n\nThe National Restaurant Association is strongly opposed to the new rules, telling the New York Times that they would lead to greater job losses in the restaurant industry and \"force some small businesses operating out of their homes, such as the family-run diner and bakery that Mr. Sanders described in his speech, to close their doors.\"\n\nRead more from the Washington Post's On Labor Blog.",
      "Pineapple Chock Full of Cheese\n\nI'm not much of a sandwich guy. It's not that I don't enjoy the variety of things in a sandwich, it's that sometimes my sandwich tastes very similar to others I've eaten. It doesn't help that a friend who is obsessed with the concept of sandwiches took me to a little sandwich shop to try this one for lunch last week. It's one of those things where someone is just trying to get all the different elements of a good meal together. But then the result is almost always a meal I won't be able to eat at home again if I haven't been starving. So I gave it a try.\n\nThis pizza is something that I would eat all the time if I wasn't busy making it. My brother loves making anything with cheese on it, so what better way to create this than stuffing a whole pizza with cheese? My brother is awesome. (My brothers name is Brian… he can eat… a LOT!)\n\nIngredients (makes 6 servings)\n\n3 slices whole wheat pizza dough (recipe found here)\n\n1 cup pizza sauce (see notes below)\n\n1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese\n\n1 teaspoon garlic powder\n\nsalt\n\npepper\n\nToppings:\n\n4 pineapple chunks\n\n6 slices pepperoni\n\nolive oil\n\ntomatoes\n\ntomatoes + greens\n\nchopped spinach\n\nonions\n\nolive oil\n\nsalt & pepper\n\nDirections\n\nWrap your pizza dough in plastic sandwich bag or greaseproof paper and lay in a large bowl to chill.\n\nMix Pizza Sauce and Parmesan Cheese together. The goal is to get the taste of pizza sauce in the pizza dough.\n\nAdd in the garlic powder, salt and pepper to the crust. You may also need to mix in some of the veggies, if you aren't feeling them.\n\nSprinkle cheese mixture into the dough and smooth out with a spatula or your hands.\n\nIf you want to, add in other toppings of choice.\n\nRoll and slice your pizza. Place in your preheated oven for the desired amount of time. I baked mine for roughly 10 minutes.\n\n\nAs you can see… this tastes pretty much exactly like a true pizza. While it's a little hard to eat this way every day (you wouldn't want to pass down a food you couldn't even try to eat in college), the fact that it is all cheese will help curb your desire to eat pizza. (It's just like college. You're out for a meal, trying every food you can get. You eat all of it! Except for this pizza. I don't want anyone to be sad, so I didn't give it that treatment.)",
      "The Washington Nationals and Washington State University's Cougar Baseball team have announced that the Cougars will host a two-game series against the Nationals beginning Sunday, April 25, 2015, at Cougar Field against the New York Mets, at Washington State University's Pullman Field. The series is sponsored by AAA Ballpark in Las Vegas. It will begin at 1:05 PM, and will be televised live by MLB Network.\n\nRoster and Schedule\n\nThe Nationals are back in Pullman, taking home a 4-6 victory over the Washington Huskies on Saturday. Washington State's Roster includes seven freshmen in their first season who will be part of Roster's Top 40 prospects, making them the only top 10 teams from Power 5 conferences to have multiple top 40 prospects on their roster in 2015.\n\nThe Nationals have a strong core of returning players from last year and have added a few new ones, making them a team to watch this fall. Some of 2015's top prospects and college players to watch this fall include:\n\nAaron Barrett, RHP, Stanford University – Barrett will throw exclusively from the pen for the Nats and is said to be on track to graduate in 2020 after finishing up this season with 11.9 K/9 and 3.3 BB/9 in 18 games for the Cardinal. Last year in 20 games, he posted a 1.86 ERA and a .204 opponents batting average against him and posted a 2.65 ERA and .208 opponents hitting average against collegians. His fastball has a fastball that reaches 100 mph and can touch 100, a curveball that projects as around average, and perhaps a changeup he's been working on. He's got a fastball that touches 93.\n\nJoey Rickard, RHP, University of Tennessee – Rickard, the team's top returning pitcher, is 6-foot-8 with a fastball that usually sits 94-96 and has a slider that should be around 85. His ability to sit 94-96 and throw a slider that's at a high 83 is a good sign that he has three viable pitches of 100+ mph. He had a 3.05 ERA, 1.12 WHIP, and 41 strikeouts in 46 innings of relief last season for Tennessee-Chattanooga in his senior season. His fastball sits in the low nineties, his slider can reach the low nineties, and a second offering he can throw is his curveball. He was drafted by the White Sox in the 28th round of the 2012 MLB Draft. The Nats have other good pitching prospects including:\n\nCody Avant, RHP, University of San Francisco – Avant was a key contributor on the San Francisco Giants' 2015 National League Divisional Series team. He was the team's sixth-round draft pick in 2015. He was also a member of the 2015 Collegiate Baseball All-America Team, being selected a finalist for the Most Outstanding Player. Avant is a 6-foot-8 right-handed pitcher who was recruited by the Washington State baseball team as an outfielder. He has a fastball that reaches the low nineties, a sinker that can touch triple digits, a curveball in the low nineties, and a changeup he's said to be working on. He also has a decent change at 78-80 mph. Avant has an easy delivery, and looks to do more of that with experience. He was a semifinalist for the Cal-State Fullerton Athletic Coordinator of the Year Award.\n\nTyler Beede, RHP, University of California – Beede was drafted in the 19th round of 2013 and the Nationals signed him for $1.8 million in 2014. He struggled to stay out of the bullpen last year but should be able to make a push, because he'll be the team's closer. Beede has a fastball that could reach 95, a slider in the low nineties, and curveball when he gets to it. Beede has a changeup to go with the fastball and slider, he was working on a change but has said he has nothing. He can hit 90-91 but it's at a low and inconsistent level.\n\nHannah Foslien, RHP, University of Minnesota – Foslien was signed as a college student. She's the team's best pitcher and a key position player on the women's soccer team. She was the team's starting pitcher last season and has a fastball that regularly sits 90-94 and a curveball with a decent chance it reaches 100. She also has a changeup that flashes above average and flashes a slider, although it's hard to tell that is what's in it. Foslien can also run and plays center field in addition to pitching. She was picked fourth overall in the 2015 MLB Draft by the Texas Rangers.\n\nSebastian Valle, RHP, University of California – Valle was a key piece of the 2015 team that advanced to the College World Series. He pitched in all of the games but",
      "The U.S. Federal Reserve made an interest rate hike on Wednesday, and that's already created another big headache for a major Bitcoin exchange that has been targeted for fraud.\n\nBitcoin exchange itBit says the FBI is looking at fraud allegations surrounding its Mt. Gox operation. Mt. Gox was the world's largest exchange for trading the digital currency until it filed for bankruptcy and shut down at the end of 2014 after losing 850,000 of customers' bitcoins. ItBit was one of only a handful of banks that agreed to serve as the sole bitcoin custodian for Mt. Gox's customers.\n\nThe FBI is looking at allegations itBit has been selling customers' bitcoins in fraudulent bids for them, The Wall Street Journal reports, in what it says could have been as much as $5 million in fraudulent transactions. It was first contacted about the issue by a customer who has an account on the exchange that is believed to be fraudulent, the newspaper writes.\n\nItBit has shut down Mt. Gox's service and will take another week to review the transaction records. The company declined to comment to Newsweek about the investigation or what actions it might take against its customers based on the findings. An official at the FBI told Newsweek the agency hadn't been approached and that it's \"pursuing all available leads to identify a suspect.\"\n\nOne of the company's CEO, Scott Rubens, told The Wall Street Journal that a small group of people have attempted to sell Bitcoins to him before for as little as $100, and he doesn't know who they were. He believes whoever is behind the fraudulent accounts is targeting other Bitcoin exchanges, and he plans to take legal action against them.\n\n\"It was my view for quite some time that we weren't the only one under scrutiny and had been under scrutiny for quite some time,\" Rubens told The Wall Street Journal. However, he's not surprised that a large exchange is under investigation, considering the large number of fraudulent accounts being reported.\n\nItBit is in discussions with authorities about working together to get more transactions blocked. So far, more than 12,000 transactions on itBit had been blocked in the past week, a spokesperson said. Many of them are in violation of U.S. sanctions, the spokesperson says. Another 10,000 transactions were canceled due to fraud. Rubens told The Wall Street Journal it would be relatively easy for authorities to target the fraudsters, and says he has been told the FBI already knows who it was. The company is willing to cooperate, he said, though it's unclear if he expects the FBI to act on its offer.\n\nThe U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission is also investigating itBit. Reuters writes the CFTC hasn't determined if the company may be selling fraudulent bitcoins, Reuters reports, citing people familiar with the matter. ItBit declined to comment on any investigation.\n\n\"After an in-depth investigation, the CFPB has not uncovered any instances or cases in which any laws or regulations have been violated and it believes it hasn't done so,\" a spokesperson for the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, told Reuters.\n\nThe Federal Reserve made its annual rate increase announcement on Wednesday. The central bank said it plans to raise rates from near historic lows at 1%. The two percentage point increase in both the federal funds rate and the target federal funds rate is meant to encourage more lending and investment and to counteract an economic slowdown.",
      "In a bid to better identify the most effective strategies for increasing the number of women in leadership roles, a new study published in the Journal of Management found that organizations most likely to achieve the highest levels of female leadership are found in countries and companies that have the \"right attitude.\"\n\nResearch by an interdisciplinary team led by Duke University associate professor Karen Hohman examined a broad range of factors that contribute to female representation in senior levels. Specifically, the study focused on four factors: organizational culture, leadership skills, gender role expectations, and the use of gender-inclusive leadership styles.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\n\"We knew that having a diverse workplace is good for a business, but it makes no sense to just measure diversity by looking at the number of women,\" Hohman said. \"Instead, we've found that the best way to increase gender diversity goes beyond counting. Instead, businesses should view gender diversity as an opportunity for growth. That's the only way we can make progress on gender inequality.\"\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nHohman and her team analyzed 10 separate factors that relate to gender diversity, including leadership practices that include gender-inclusive leadership styles, the willingness of senior managers to include women in their organizations and the likelihood of women moving up the rungs of an organization.\n\nAs expected, the findings found the United States as the top country and company. The study also showed a strong correlation between gender role expectations and the likelihood of senior men and women forming strong bonds.\n\nAccording to the researchers, businesses are most likely to achieve the highest levels of female leadership if they have the right attitudes toward women. They believe that such attitudes include being tolerant of diversity in all forms of leadership, embracing the idea that all businesspeople are both individual and team players, and recognizing that women bring many unique skills to the workplace.\n\n\"The best way to achieve this goal is to create a culture that acknowledges diversity and supports women so they don't feel isolated,\" said Hohman. \"We found that the ability to develop this mindset is one of the clearest indicators of the likelihood of women having greater success in a workforce with a higher percentage of women.\"\n\nShe added: \"We are seeing all the signs that we have to do to truly create a diversity-based organization.\"\n\nHohman and her co-authors also identified the different ways organizations can leverage gender diversity to their advantage. They believe that organizations can use diversity as a strategy to:\n\nIncrease the number of women in senior leadership positions by promoting more women to leadership roles and by increasing the acceptance of gender diversity within the team.\n\nPromote gender integration within the workplace, which means the inclusion of women in activities and functions that are typically reserved to men.\n\nPromote male/female alignment of roles so that employees view their work similarly and are able to communicate effectively on issues of gender diversity.\n\nInclude women in other leadership-related assignments that would otherwise be a man's job – which could include serving as a team leader or being the top decision maker when an important decision is made.\n\nLeadership style and attitudes can also be used to boost female representation. Hohman and her team believe that these three approaches – which the authors think are currently \"overlooked\" in how organizations increase the participation of women in leadership positions – offer the strongest results in increasing diversity.\n\nA previous study conducted by Hohman, which was supported by the Department of Defense, examined differences in gender diversity between the military and the civilian workforce. She also found that the military consistently shows the highest levels of female leadership positions, while the civilian workforce shows similar gender discrepancies.\n\n\"The findings in that study are more or less identical to what we found in the military, but, of course, not everyone feels comfortable reporting these findings,\" Hohman said. \"The reason we did the military study is that we wanted to understand the reasons behind the differences, which would inform the question of how best to make diversity work in the workplace.\n\n\"We had a very good response by the military, and it seemed to point to the right approach based on the results of that study. What we wanted to know was how to replicate that, but in a more comprehensive way.\"\n\nThe findings published in Journal of Management suggest two additional ways in which organizations can take advantage of this research – as a way to more effectively recruit women to leadership roles. The researchers explain that by recognizing women as team players rather than just individuals, they believe organizations can increase confidence within and among women. This confidence can in turn increase the number of women in leadership roles.\n\n\"By showing that the best way to increase the size of your leadership team is to make your team less homogeneous, and by making your team more diverse, you are basically telling workers, 'We care more about you than just your gender,'\" Hohman said. \"…And you",
      "MEMPHIS -- The Memphis Grizzlies held off the Atlanta Hawks in Game 2 of their first-round playoff series Friday night in an 88-82 victory.\n\nIt was a tight one as the Grizzlies lost the first five games of the series before closing it out with a big 3-pointer from Rudy Gay with 3:30 left in the fourth quarter to hold on and advance to Sunday's Game 4 at home against another one of their former Southeast Division rivals.\n\nThe Grizzlies took the early 21-4 lead and never looked back.\n\n\"We had no energy, we had no focus in the first half, we had no direction,\" Memphis guard Mike Conley said. \"After a while, when you don't do something right - that's all it comes down to -- it's all about the next day and the next game and taking that experience away. And that's what we did.\"\n\nMemphis shot 50 percent from the field and held a 50-34 advantage on the glass, and the Hawks shot just 35 percent from the field. The Grizzlies also had more players in double figures (14 for 23) than the Hawks (13 for 30).\n\n\"We're still a team that has a lot of heart,\" Grizzlies forward Zach Randolph said. \"We just keep battling and believe we can do it. Hopefully, we can finish this off and get a series win here, win a Game 3 and take it to Atlanta.\"\n\nThe Memphis win was the Hawks third in a row, a stretch they'll surely hope to snap with Sunday's Game 3 at home.\n\n\"These are the playoffs,\" Atlanta coach Larry Drew said. \"This is the game where it's important for the teams to play well and we didn't. I've said this before, so I'll say it again, we need to get better in all areas. This isn't the first time I've said this. There needs to be consistency from all teams.\"\n\nGay was strong from the floor in the second half. He scored 15 points, grabbed 13 rebounds and blocked five shots. The Grizzlies reserve player now has five blocked shots in the playoffs, matching his total for the third full season - the last two as a starter. He started the second half, which ended at the end of a 23-6 spurt that sent Memphis cruising to the win.\n\n\"We've won this series before,\" Atlanta's Kyle Korver said. \"I think the big thing is to respect each other. It was a close game. And this is the second time we've played each other, so we know what to expect.\"\n\nAfter Atlanta made a jumper to take a 38-41 lead, the Grizzlies came out swinging and hit five 3-pointers in the first six minutes of the quarter with Kyle O'Quinn converting a three-point play with 11:13 left in the half. It was six consecutive points for Atlanta, which got one point off four free throws by Gay.\n\nConley, who got into the scoring game early with a triple in the first, put the Grizzlies ahead at 55-54 with 10:51 left in the half with a 3 from the top of the key. The Hawks had gone to Gay at that point of the period, but went with Dennis Schroder and he went with back-to-back 3-pointers, too.\n\nThe Grizzlies had a six-point halftime edge but the Hawks cut that margin to three with less than two minutes left.\n\nConley, the Hawks' leading scorer at 18 points, missed an open 3-pointer with six seconds left in regulation, but the Grizzlies scored the next six points to take a 73-70 lead.\n\nThe last time these teams met, Memphis outscored Atlanta 45-27 in the second half.\n\nThe Hawks lost starting forward Paul Millsap for an undetermined amount of time in the opening half, but he returned when the teams finished off a double-overtime win against the Detroit Pistons on Wednesday night.\n\n\"The main thing is we don't have Paul Millsap,\" Hawks forward Josh Smith said. \"We've got to find a way to win - whether it's Paul Millsap or another guy, we just got to find a way to win. But we can't give up. We've got to keep fighting and we've got to figure our way to be in it, I know it's a tough series, but we've got to keep battling and we're going to do anything to win.\"\n\nThe Grizzlies outscored Atlanta 48-30 off the bench in the first half, with Gay adding 16 points.\n\nThe Hawks had the game on the line the entire second half, and they made it a one-possession game when Smith hit a 3-pointer and a free throw. But the Grizzlies held on, and that was all it took.\n\n\"I don't know if we're nervous, we're just trying to win,\" Smith said.",

      "In our last post about the most important thing that you know about Python, we talked about the difference between the two major programming languages. It's the difference between \"Object Oriented and Functional programming\" and \"Programmer-Centric programming\", and it has many implications about your future work. In this post, I'm going to focus on one simple thing, but it's an important one – you have to know the difference between the two kinds of programming. I'm going to show you a very simple example, and I'm going to make it easy to understand! Let's do this!\n\nI want to focus on a simple file that, when run, prints an error message: \"This file's syntax isn't compatible with this Python interpreter!\" What kind of program does that print? How could it be useful? The answer is: a simple little library of utility functions that, when called from the command line, prints an error message. I'll use Python 2 in this example. If you run that file, it will display an error message:\n\n>>> import bs4 >>> print ( bs4 . B1 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> SyntaxError : cannot concatenate \" bs4.B1 \" and \" 1 \"\n\nHow was that written? In Python 3, it would be written like this:\n\n>>> import bs4 >>> print ( bs4 . B1 ) B1\n\nThe function bs4.B1 has a parameter called string , and in Python 3, that parameter takes a string! What does it mean for the string variable to be a string in Python 3? Let's look at the syntax for Python functions. You've seen them before, and you can probably define a function with just a few more lines of code than is required to make it print the error message. The syntax is pretty easy:\n\ndef bs4 ( name ): return bs4 ( str ( name ))\n\nThe output we get from this function will contain the name of the library we're using, and then we'll return the string itself. In Python 2, the function would be written as\n\ndef bs4 ( name ): return bs4 . B1\n\nThe two lines before you see the import , which tells Python that the above function is for the current Python interpreter. If you run that script as-is, it fails to run. Python 2 is not able to call its own function (because it does not know what a string is), so when the Python interpreter is run, it makes an unnecessary call to a different function. So this is the Python 3 equivalent of the function that we used in the previous example.\n\nHow does the above print the string that we want to print to the script? How can we tell if there is a conflict? Well, the above example uses a print() function, which prints the string on screen. But what if the string is not going to print on screen? How can we tell? Python has two functions that we know will print the string. one is print , and the other is print_function :\n\n>>> print ( bs4 . B1 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 1 , in <module> SyntaxError : cannot concatenate \" bs4.B1 \" and \" 1 \"\n\nWe can see that print is a function, and print_function is the function that prints the string to the screen. These are the two basic functions that Python has. That's enough to tell us if the string is going to print on screen. If it doesn't, we know that that value can't be part of a function:\n\n>>> print_function ( bs4 . B1 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 2 , in <module> SyntaxError : cannot concatenate \" bs4.B1 \" and \" 1 \"\n\nWe can use this information to tell us something else about if our object is part of a function that can do printing! How could we possibly write something if we didn't know or care about whether it was an error? Well, that's easy. We could just ignore the string that is printed on screen, and simply print the whole thing to the screen:\n\n>>> print ( bs4 . B1 ) Traceback (most recent call last): File \"<stdin>\" , line 2 , in <module> SyntaxError : cannot concatent [ \" bs4.B1 \" ] and \" 1 \"\n\nIf you run that, you should see something like this:\n\nI am a string. I am a string. I am a string. I am a string. I am a string. I am a string. I am a string!\n\nThat's a string. It means",

But I don't know why they seem more special to me than others who get to hear music all of the time in their families. Are there songs that I can add to my repertoire?\n\nIt's not just a problem for me…\n\nAccording to Music Advice writer, Jon Caramanica, you should listen to music at least twice a week. In his latest podcast, he tells the story of this very same guy – and how he changed the way he listened to music and the way he spent his time.\n\nThe man in question was a music teacher who used to give weekly musical lessons in a public school playground when he was in grad school. He taught all kinds of different instruments like a violin, sax, piano and drums. But one of his students was a jazz aficionado who loved music and had a lot of friends who listened to it. One day, during a lesson, he told his student of the time he played a concert and had gotten a lot of people going. When the student asked Jon if he could hear that concert, he asked if she wanted to hear it. She said that she did, and she liked it. Jon listened to that music over and over.\n\nHe found that his students grew all the time. Some started playing more complicated pieces. The student he gave the lesson to decided to play it on his own, and play it for herself. Then he met a lady who just so happened to be a drummer (his students also played piano and bass, but they were much newer and would listen to one another). He gave a lesson to her, too, and he got her to play her own song, too. The two students became friends, and that became the model for many future jazz classes at that public school.\n\nJon Caramanica: I remember being in school that year and hearing a trumpet player play for the first time. This was a guy with only four years musical training. I remember thinking how amazing it was that he was able to play like that – not very well, no rhythm track, no backing tracks. But he could play the trumpet, and he had a voice like he was going to go places.\n\nThe next time I heard one of those trumpet players play, I started thinking: this dude is going places. It was an old school jazz style at a public school in New York. And you could hear it in the way they were moving their head, how they were breathing. They didn't know what note they were playing, but they knew they were playing it, and they played it. They were not really looking at the piano player as a player. They were looking at the piano player as a musician. And what a cool way to be an instrument's instrument, and you could do it yourself.\n\nOne day, in the middle of a lesson one of these girls said, \"Okay Jon, you got to play something cool for me. What did you play back then?\n\n\"Well, I played a few things, and I think you and I need to work on our improvisational skills.\"\n\n\"I don't want you to play one of those. I want you to play an old style.\"\n\nSo we went back to where I taught and we played the whole band. One of the players started to play \"I've Got My Own Life to Live,\" and I said, \"Hey, we've got to learn to improvise again. And you know what? I'll let you solo.\"\n\n\"Really?\" I said.\n\n\"Yes.\"\n\n\"I'm really interested in it.\"\n\n\"I'm not telling you what to play,\" I said. \"No, really. You want to improvise.\"\n\nOne of the girls did it, and it was pretty successful. You could tell she put a lot of thought into it. By this time, the teacher didn't know what she was doing. She played this thing which she heard on a radio song – it was a country record of mine",
      "The University of Minnesota at Morris has a big year ahead of it - on-campus enrollment and faculty size grew at a 15% and 16% clip, respectively, in 2014.\n\nTo meet the expected growth, the university and the community are looking for new leadership to guide the next chapter in Morriss-Tate College's story. For the school's next president, the search is starting with campus leaders, said the University's president, Dr. David Dorton. \"As we move forward, we will continue to develop a strong, forward-looking strategic leadership team by consulting with our broader student body, faculty, alumni, donors and partners.\"\n\nStudents and faculty are asked to vote for their favorite choice in the 2016 MTC presidential election to become the new president-elect.\n\nThe candidates for president for the incoming fall semester are Emily Fenton, senior in political science at the University of Minnesota, and Kevin Fenton, senior in sociology and senior in government and international studies at the University of Minnesota.\n\nFenton is in the running largely due to a strong academic record. She is currently writing her master's degree, which she earned at the University of Texas, Austin, and is studying for her doctorate in history at the UC Berkeley. Dr. Fenton has served on the MTC executive for two years and is a well-respected leader in the University's executive.\n\nFenton said her major focuses on her candidacy are diversity, inclusiveness of the university community and social change.\n\nHer top three priorities as president are community engagement, diversity and equity, and transparency in government.\n\n\"I am motivated by the need to be a part of a very community-driven campus community where we are all learning to work together,\" she said. \"I think I can bring my experience working at the Austin campus with community organizations in San Antonio [to the MTC] with the ability to work collaboratively and bring diverse perspectives together.\"\n\nDr. Fenton said she is looking forward to getting to know the student body and faculty before the election is officially announced.\n\nDr. Dorton said he also has to make sure that student voting choices will have a positive influence when the college votes on Oct. 24th to select its next president.\n\n\"There is a lot riding on this election,\" he said. \"I am hoping more students will vote than have in the past. We want students to have a say in whom the next president should be and I want them to choose our best representative.\"\n\nIn the past, students have voiced their opinion on the election by posting their vote on The Daily or on the Facebook page Students for Change-MTC. This year, however, campus leaders said the administration is encouraging students with diverse opinions to use their voice to encourage students of all races and demographics to vote. Dorton, Dorton said, also wants to encourage students to take a larger part in campus life – such as participating in campus-wide events, such as the annual MTC Day Celebration.\n\n\"I want as many students as possible involved in this process,\" he said. \"There will always be someone in some capacity that is critical of MTC, but I hope they get on board the next time we have a change.\"\n\nThe new president will continue Dorton's leadership efforts to encourage the campus community to consider its role in shaping a brighter future for the University, Dorton said.\n\nDr. Dorton said he hopes to establish an executive presidency that includes a variety of departments. \"We expect that our next president will work hard to ensure that the core responsibilities of the position are fulfilled, and that is to build a supportive team as well as advocate for the future of MTC,\" he said.\n\nAs part of his responsibilities as president, Dorton said he would work to ensure that students at MTC are well acquainted with the institution's academic programs, curriculum, and research goals and values.\n\nHe is looking for new perspectives and perspectives from students and faculty alike to expand campus-wide understanding of their educational goals, he said.\n\nAs the search for the new president is underway, Dr. Dorton said he would not take part in a search committee in the interim. He hopes to keep that process as informal as possible. \"I will work with faculty, administrators and other staff to work out a plan that will best address the needs of students and faculty and our community as a whole.\" he said, and he will also listen to his community in a way that will provide them with opportunities to have meaningful input as the search is conducted.",
      "This section is from the book \"Bible Classics: Stories & Short Stories\", by John Henry Smith Jr. and Lorna Henry, Jr. Copyright © 1996 by The MacMillan Company. Reprinted with permission of the publisher. All rights reserved.\n\nThis question appears regularly in the Bible. When does the devil, or his power, first appear? In our Bibles it is always preceded by the angel. Now here is the question: Why did the angel have to appear first? Why was he allowed to appear first? Why didn't he appear before? The answer is as easy as it is obvious: because the angel was the devil to us. When the angel came, he had to represent what the devil was to us. That's why he appeared first. The devil wanted us to think he was the real deal. But the fact is, he was a projection of our own fears and anxieties—the way we know ourselves when in a fight with an enemy. The angel represents the real power within us when we're afraid. The devil says you're never safe. He says there's no escape. The devil says your life is not good enough. He's right. Our lives are never good enough, and he's right about that.\n\nWhat did all this show us? What did it show me? It showed us that the devil is always with us. He's always in our thoughts. He's always in our fears. He's always in our doubts and in our doubts about ourselves. But he's been on our side the whole time, playing the part. The devil is like the real enemy we all have in our lives. Only he didn't get the job in life because he was born the perfect physical specimen. He was born the perfect liar. He was born the perfect fraud. He was born the perfect psychopath because his heart was always in the right place. In the world of the human, the devil lives like any other, just disguised. It is Satan who lies most. It is the devil who is most cunning. It is Satan who is most deceptive. It is Satan who is most seductive. He is the devil who gives us gifts and gets our money.\n\nThe angel appeared first not to protect us or make us innocent but for the very purpose of making us his instruments. All the same the devil appeared first with his false god, the angels who he says are the true representatives of God. And Satan was able to win their trust, get within their power, and thus get to use them. He would not be able to do that if he had to represent himself first and then the false god came forward. That would have meant we were going to have to stand before this false god who was actually the devil, and Satan was going to have to stand before something he couldn't relate to or understand. And that doesn't work.\n\nHe's going to have to take the bull by the horns. He's going to have to confront it face to face. All right? That's what the angel is for. And he shows up before the devil. He shows up before the angelic powers. The angels are not in authority over the devil. Satan is the master. Satan is in the power. He's the one in the driver's seat. Lucifer was the servant. God was the master. Jesus is the master. And they are all under one ruler God, the Lord Jesus Christ. That makes this whole thing clear: there is a real god behind that scene. In front, all the angels are his servants. They are like pawns on a chessboard on which Satan is the master. He's the one in control.\n\nNow let's think about this for a minute. The devil is not Satan the deceiver. You don't have to be the deceiver to make money. You don't have to be the deceiver to be successful in life or to deceive your enemies. You don't have to be the deceiver to be powerful. You have to be able to use your gifts to get what you want.\n\nWhen the devil appears before us he has got our attention. He's a man with a lot of power and he's telling us what his game is. His game is based on fear. He's telling us that we have all the power in this world and he has as much as we do. He's telling us that we need to be fearful. He tells us that fear is power. He tells us that fear makes us strong. He tells us that fear makes us free. He's a master of fear.\n\nBut the fact is that Satan knows that we cannot become strong by fearing. We can be afraid but the fear of our fears is not the power that is needed by our life. To be free we have to fear, but to be powerful we have to fear not, with power comes control, but to be free, we have to not fear.\n\nAnd fear isn't what the devil is trying to",
      "If you would like to get a free quote on your car, check out our extensive car loan calculator!\n\nHere's how to pay down your vehicle loan.\n\n1. Pay off at least 85% of the outstanding balance to qualify for a down payment loan\n\nIf you've already paid off 75% or more of your current car loan's balance, and the remaining balance is about the same, you may qualify for a down payment loan to help you pay down your next car loan. With a down payment loan, you pay less toward the loan, but you still have to pay for maintenance and car insurance.\n\nDown payment loans for vehicle loans start at 1.5% – 2% of the remaining loan balance, as shown in the chart below. Some lenders will give you lower interest rates if you make a down payment loan payment for part of the car loan.\n\nYou may also be able to qualify for a loan with a 10-year term on a car loan, but your minimum payments while the loan is in process will vary. For now, our best advice is to find out exactly how much you can afford. Also be sure to ask your bank or credit union to tell you exactly how much they will lend you if you qualify for a down payment loan.\n\n2. Get a car loan that isn't at its wholesale cost\n\nThere are some low-interest deals available to people with car loans - or cars - that are less than they would normally be.\n\nIf you go to an auto dealership and the finance professional offers a car worth less than what you paid for it, but that car is at its wholesale cost, you may qualify for a low-interest or no-cost financing option.\n\nLet's say you have an income $10,000 a year and make monthly payments of $220 a month at 3.75%, but the car costs $10,000 and is at its wholesale cost. Under an interest rate of 4% and with a payment of $220 a month, you would pay $5,000 of monthly interest, or $2,920 a year, towards the car payment. However, if the car is at its wholesale cost, $500 will be paid annually in financing expenses, saving you $4,840.\n\nYou may also qualify for this if the car dealer's finance professional tries to sell you a vehicle, usually at more than their wholesale value.\n\nThe lower the payment you agree to, the less you can pay in credit card debt while you make monthly payments.\n\n3. Reduce financing fees\n\nMost people don't know about the extra fees - like tax, insurance, registration and license fees - that some lenders charge to people who are financing their own vehicles. But they are expensive, and they're never justified.\n\nWhen comparing financing options, take note of these fees. Then consider using an online car shopping portal like Cars.com to compare quotes.\n\n4. Consider a secured car loan with at least a 6-year amortization period\n\nIf you are looking to secure a car loan, then a 6-year amortization is a good choice. While you are paying less than 1.5% interest, you are also paying for things like maintenance and insurance on time.\n\nIf you are refinancing, see if you qualify for an extended warranty program that can extend the car's useful life, or use a no interest loan. Also make sure you can afford the new loan, and make sure the loan is secured.\n\n5. If you can't qualify for a secured car loan (or if you have an interest rate under 1%), consider financing a car with 3rd party financing\n\nYou might have to pay a higher interest rate for some secured car loans. Some lenders might try to charge more for a secured car loan if you can't qualify for the secured rate, or if you have an existing secured car loan.\n\nIf your car finance specialist won't approve a secured car loan, don't take it lying down. Ask for a 3rd party vehicle finance lender where you can get the financing you need at a reasonable rate. Find a trusted, well-established 3rd party financing lender in your state using the online car shopping portal Cars.com – they can help you.\n\nIf you've already had your car loan secured with an existing secured loan, ask yourself if you are really ready to finance a car through a lender who is new to the car financing game. Many people that find secured financing are really hoping to be able to refinance a car to a new loan term at a lower interest rate or with a lower monthly payment, or simply to make money on the car. If you are not ready, and you decide to finance with a lender that is new to the car financing world, you may still end up getting paid off less than your original car loan, or paying a higher interest rate.\n\n6. Ask for a no-money-down, 3-",

      "What does the law of gravity say about \"gravity's pull\"?\n\nThis is not the place to try to explain the concept of gravity, or how it describes why we can't see the ground. I'll do that elsewhere. I'm just going to state what the law says, and offer some possibilities as to what this means for our experience of gravity.\n\nFirst of all, if we think of gravity as \"weight,\" then we have no idea what \"gravity's pull\" might mean to us.\n\nDoes a heavier object pull us upward? No. We just assume it does. But as a concept, there's nothing in the \"gravity's pull\" concept that doesn't apply to some things, especially not our own bodies.\n\nConsider this example that I used in the answer to the previous question: A balloon is attached to a post and held up in the air. One of the balloons is at a higher \"height\" than the other. Does the balloon push the other balloon down, or does the other balloon pull the balloon (that weighs more) back up? When you think of a rope as something hanging from the post above, this is a common example, and the answer is obvious.\n\nHow about the \"pull\" caused by gravity? If you're looking at your feet, your feet are on the ground, so they're in contact with the ground. They'll exert force on you -- if they weren't, you wouldn't be able to see. But if you stand up, your feet will still be on the ground, so your feet just \"pull\" you upward.\n\nBut if gravity is the gravity of \"weight,\" then how is gravity \"pulled\" by things?\n\nLet's think about a basketball in your hands and a basketball suspended from the ceiling, and imagine that we're trying to catch a basketball. That might be hard to do when you're thinking about gravity as \"weight.\" But it certainly happens when we take things and use them in their natural state.\n\nConsider this example: You're floating in an ocean in a bathtub. You try to grab your toe, but instead you end up grabbing a piece of string wrapped around some object, and then another object wrapped around that. This way, you'll be pulling a larger object, and your body weight will be pulling your hand towards the object. This is your weight \"pulling\" the string, and that's why you end up grabbing that string and then your toe. (And, of course, this is not how gravity works -- that's an example of \"gravity's pull\" that doesn't relate to things.)\n\nOne more idea about gravity's pull.\n\nWhat about gravity's pull on an object when you do something to it that causes any number (or \"force\") of negative quantities to be added to the amount we call the weight? (Remember that a negative quantity \"pushes\" an object toward the negative direction -- negative gravity -- and a positive quantity \"pulls\" the object to the positive direction -- positive gravity.)\n\nThere should be no force on the object, so the weight should just stay where it is. This is how we define \"mass.\" But what if I have another object attached to that same object, and that object also has another object attached to it? I can pull that weight toward me, because I can pull both of them toward me at the same time. Does that mean an object of mass m can pull an object of mass m from \"up\" by pulling down on them at the same time?\n\nYou'd think that this is the case, because we would call this an \"isotropic\" force. But it's not. An \"isotropic\" force doesn't say anything about how one object exerts its exerting force on the other. If there was an isotropic force on an object, then there would have to be a number of objects that were attached to that object, and those objects would also have another object attached to them, and those other objects had an object attached to them, and so on. Each object would exert its own exerting force, and the total amount of exerting force on the objects would be the same. If any of the objects were to exert its own exerting force on an object of the same mass, then that would mean that the object of that mass had a positive exerting force, and the object that it exerts an exerting force on could pull that object of its own mass upward. It would mean that, if we let two numbers be equal to the mass of objects and two numbers be equal to the force exerted by those objects, and we then let each of those numbers be the same as the sum of all the exerting force on the two objects simultaneously, then in reality there would be two objects of different masses. We couldn't explain that.\n\nIf we had an isotropic force that we called \"gravity,\" then that \"gravity\" would have a",

      "SACRAMENTO — In a wide-ranging interview with The Sacramento Bee, U.S. Rep. Ami Bera (D-Laguna Niguel) has expressed support for a federal bill in Congress that would create a public option to compete with private insurance in California and the rest of the country\n\n\"Our health care system is broken,\" Bera said. \"We have to move forward, we have to do something. And the way to do it is to improve health care for all the American people, not just the rich.\"\n\nHis office released the following statement on Bera's support for the Protecting Americans from Insurance Company Abuse (PAI) Act:\n\n\"The legislation is based on bipartisan legislation introduced by Congressman Peter DeFazio (D-OR) and Rep. Jim Cooper (D-TN) and bipartisan support from other legislators, advocates, insurers, and consumers. The bill would address the problem of abusive insurance companies charging excessive premiums, failing to provide essential health benefits, and denying coverage entirely, while at the same time protecting consumers by ending federal prohibitions and regulatory barriers to setting up a new health insurance plan. \"As a proud champion of a bipartisan effort to strengthen Americans' health coverage, Congressman Bera is pleased with the bill. He remains committed to working with the administration to advance it and will look for ways to support it in Washington.\"\n\nUnder PAI, insurance companies would have to provide a public insurance plan that has the same benefits, price, and regulatory requirements as traditional insurance plans and could not restrict consumers from choosing that insurance. This type of public insurance would also guarantee access to the law's public option.\n\nState lawmakers such as Bera and U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders' (I-Vt.) legislation to create a Medicare-for-all single-payer health care plan have gained momentum in recent legislation.

      "\"I don't think that there will be a war, I don't think that Donald Trump is going to put the United States back into a war against Russia. I think that if Trump does anything, he'll make it much clearer what he wants to do,\" Putin told reporters after the U.S. election, adding that he hopes Trump will work closely with Western countries to resolve differences in relations and that, after the first 100 days of his presidency, the U.S. and Putin would begin discussing potential problems in the relationship.\n\n\"I want to say that I'm positive about this [U.S. presidential] process,\" he said. \"If Trump is going to become our president, I would hope that it will become possible to settle our differences, to build a partnership based on mutual respect and interests.\"\n\n\nPutin's comments are the most detailed comments yet about Trump's policy toward Russia, a point of contention in their first meetings as candidates in July. While Trump has appeared to shift his position on Russia in the months since Election Day, and has pledged to improve relations with Moscow while in office, Putin remains skeptical about Trump's intentions.\n\nPutin was less reserved in his assessment of what he might expect from the U.S. president if Trump wins: that Trump's \"personal qualities and his behavior may, in fact, be similar to the ways of the KGB officer.\"\n\nAfter the election ended, Putin said at a press conference he would be discussing Russian concerns with incoming President Barack Obama. However, Trump did not mention any new U.S. policies to improve relations when meeting Putin in St. Petersburg on Friday.\n\nAsked about Trump's repeated praise for Russian dictator Vladimir Putin, Putin said that, if it is true, \"the question arises 'How come? Why are there people who praise the other side?'\"\n\nU.S. intelligence agencies concluded at least two years ago that Russia interfered in, encouraged, or directed cyberattacks against the Hillary Clinton campaign and other U.S. political organizations, and a senior Trump campaign official said this week Russia's influence operation was \"a step further than anything we've been involved in.\"\n\n\n\"I won't go into details of what we do because I want to keep it absolutely secret. But as far as the interference of our diplomats, I can't imagine that they didn't do it,\" Putin told reporters Saturday.\n\nPutin also said Russian officials are trying to understand whether Trump and President Barack Obama could work together to resolve U.S.-Russian tensions and that the two should \"try to prevent incidents between U.S.-Russian war vessels.\"\n\n\"It has been made clear that the situation is complex that it can't be resolved by verbal contacts,\" he said.\n\nPutin has also sought to use Trump's victory to further his own agenda, by claiming that Trump will have more cooperation with Moscow than Obama and suggesting that Trump will put the U.S. in a stronger position to counter Russian aggression in Ukraine and Syria.\n\n\"Our experts are talking with him and discussing various initiatives for further strengthening Russia-U.S. cooperation,\" Putin said. \"We have very serious differences in some of the most crucial areas, such as Syria, Iran, a number of other areas that have to do with international law… But what is important is that all this should continue.\"",
      "The story of what's driving the decline of Arctic sea ice is not just about climate change -- it's about political power and the global economy.\n\nThe Arctic is an intensely political place, and not just for people who live there. Political leaders on both sides of the North Pole have an impact not only here but in every corner of the world, especially those in the Arctic Circle.\n\nThe decline in sea ice in the Arctic is part of a larger trend of ice loss around the world. Arctic sea ice is shrinking but ice is not the only thing that is melting on this planet. Earth's oceans and the Earth's atmosphere were both warming until roughly the 1980s. Since then the oceans are actually cooling.\n\nThe oceans are in fact absorbing and reflecting the sun's energy, making the warming more modest over time but at a higher level, especially in the Arctic where snow and ice cover keeps solar radiation out. As temperatures warm, the oceans absorb some of their heat, while the atmosphere traps some of the heat.\n\nWhen this absorption and reflection occurs at the same time, things can get very interesting. It was such a phenomenon that made us humans a species and helped us survive. It means the oceans absorb some of their heat, and we are absorbing theirs. What that suggests about future sea ice changes is unclear, but it also means that the changes we might make in response to the changes happening right now, are not going to be so dramatic.\n\nThe story of what is going on in the Arctic ice, and why it's melting, is a tale of climate science and politics. It's also part of the story of global warming and what happens to the world economy when an ice-free Arctic becomes a reality.\n\nThe story begins in 1986, when the U.N. climate program came into being. The scientists and engineers working on the program were the same people who had been doing research on ozone depletion and atmospheric acid rain in the 1960s. That research had also led to a scientific consensus for the global atmospheric acid rain problems that were becoming increasingly prominent as the Soviet Union was falling apart. As a result of this research, all of those countries that had been using chemical fertilizers developed policies that would cut their use in the Soviet Union.\n\nAfter the end of the Cold War, the United States, European nations and Japan took what we today call the Kyoto protocol into effect. Under the Kyoto protocol, the industrialized countries and Japan agreed that they were committing to cut their use of the chemicals that had contributed to global warming in the past.\n\nThis was a controversial treaty, and in the early fall of 2006, the European Parliament voted down the treaty. They said that if it were ratified, it would make their countries subject to an obligation that might make their economies less competitive in the world economies because those commitments would also apply to them.\n\nAt first the U.S. and other industrialized nations agreed that Europe should not get any more penalties that the Kyoto treaty did not require them to pay in. As a result the Kyoto protocol, which has never been fully implemented, was abandoned.\n\nHowever, during the negotiations Europe and the United States agreed to keep negotiating again. The Europeans thought that there was a chance that they could get the United States to come over to them on the other issues they were concerned about -- for example, on reducing carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nIt was during this time after the initial failures of the Kyoto treaty negotiations that another scientist wrote an essay entitled: \"Global Warming: When Everyone Knows Everyone else Knows No One.\" That was one of the first pieces of evidence that started pointing the way to a consensus among science community members on why the greenhouse effect is happening and that humans are playing a role in it. The essay was written by a scientist named Jonathan Jones at the University of Washington.\n\nIn 2006 when the Kyoto protocol failed, that scientist wrote that he was certain that the greenhouse effect had now become a consensus that had been established through the work already done by other scientists.\n\nHowever, not all scientists who thought that climate change was happening wanted to get involved in taking action, because they thought that if they did so they would come under more pressure to say that they weren't at fault for climate change. So the science community chose to put a huge amount of economic pressure on the world in trying to get the emissions and use of the chemicals that had resulted in global warming stopped right when Kyoto was negotiated, even though it turned out that the Kyoto treaty would not work at all, and it had failed.\n\nDuring this time the United States, European nations and Japan agreed that the Kyoto protocol should be abandoned. In effect that was the end of the Kyoto protocol negotiations. This would only lead to more pressure.\n\nThis was the time that some of us came across what we thought was a remarkable piece of research that came from the North American ice and snow research establishment on sea ice changes. When you see the research paper, it's a pretty long paper,",
      "The Obama administration is moving ahead with plans that will allow the military to use unmanned surveillance drones in domestic drone strikes, reversing a years-long ban on domestic drone use that was put in place by the George W. Bush administration.\n\nOfficials say the use of U.S. drones to strike targets overseas may eventually expand beyond targeted \"signature strikes\" of a suspected terrorist or militants, to more regular, broader drone strikes. The administration's proposal to use drones is expected to be presented on February 6 as part of an application for a new law permitting the administration to take part in the surveillance for use in overseas drone strikes.\n\nThe Obama administration is proposing a new counterterrorism target list designed to eliminate Al Qaeda leadership, but the administration says the drone program is a means of combating global terrorism. A key question in the Obama administration's drone strike application is whether the U.S., rather than Al Qaeda, is the main enemy of the U.S. on behalf of terrorists.\n\nObama's proposal still has to be approved by Congress. But critics say it does nothing to reduce the risk to citizens from future drone strikes. They note that drones have already killed many innocent civilians.",

      "Kelley L Cox-USA TODAY Sports\n\nThe NFL is expected to unveil new rules regarding helmet-to-helmet hits in the coming weeks, but the results of a new survey of more than 30,000 NFL players conducted by the National Football League Players Associations have already led to a debate about the role a player should play in preventing concussions.\n\nAccording to the NFLPA's survey data, over 85 percent (84) of players believe that concussion prevention is the priority of their team.\n\nYet, an alarming number (29.6 percent) believe that the players' safety as the primary responsibility. This finding comes after research that found 70 percent of the country's general population is not sufficiently protected against concussions. And according to the concussion experts who responded to this survey, this is a serious problem.\n\nAccording to Steve Buckley, vice president of health policy at the NFL's Medical Advisory Committee, \"When I see that many of my players believe they need to take the health and safety for themselves first, it's a problem.\"\n\nAs noted by the NFLPA:\n\n\"Over 90 percent of players feel that we need to take immediate action, such as removing the helmet first, and as many as 85 percent of players agreed that it's the responsible thing to do.\"\n\nThis may actually be an issue that we can address. But a question remains: As we prepare to push forward with new NFL rules changes, who should the player responsible be?\n\nAs a result of the helmet-to-helmet hits, numerous injuries have been claimed. The Washington Post's Stephen C. Webster documented how multiple players have already been diagnosed with CTE, which is a degenerative disease that begins in the brain. With the knowledge that many players will be retiring soon, why don't players take a stand to prevent future injuries?\n\nThis isn't a problem that only affects players who are retiring soon; the players that will be coming out of retirement are also at risk. This can be seen in the statistics as well. According to ESPN, former Packers tight end Martellus Bennett (who announced his retirement recently) has suffered nine concussions since 2000. Meanwhile, former Chargers tight end Jeff Cumberland—who played nearly 300 games in the game—continues to battle concussions.\n\nEven with the growing attention the NFL is gaining due to its growing concussion issues, this seems like an issue that can be solved by both sides of the spectrum. Players could continue to take steps to avoid the kind of head injuries that they face, while the league could encourage their members to take preventive steps in the hopes of reducing the injury rate. The NFLPA, after all, is currently considering banning helmet-to-helmet hits within the next year and a half.\n\nUltimately, these new rules could help to reduce concussions among football players.\n\nBut, at the same time, these changes should make both players and the NFL even safer. In an age where sports fans know the statistics on head trauma, it is important that we keep in mind that we still have a long way to go.\n\nMain Photo",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union today released a detailed report that details the extent and scope of the National Security Agency's domestic spying apparatus.\n\nThe NSA's Prism program allows it to gather information about phone calls, email messages and other online communications made by U.S. citizens and residents. Its existence first came to light in April, and the report provides a comprehensive account of just how broad the NSA's surveillance system is.\n\nIn the report, the ACLU points out that the law permits the government to monitor all of U.S. residents' domestic communications, though it only does so with permission from a secret court and in response to a specific request from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, also known as FISA. The law allows government eavesdropping on foreign leaders and private citizens.\n\nThe spying is carried out under highly complicated legal regimes that are opaque even to those whose communications are being monitored. Those targeted for surveillance can be forced to reveal personal information about themselves for no apparent reason. The intelligence community also is allowed to engage in invasive, secret surveillance of U.S. citizens' email and other electronic communications even when communications are routed through foreign facilities or other providers, or even when that activity does not have anything to do with their contacts.\n\nThe most damaging part of the report is that the report found NSA surveillance to be \"particularly abusive\" against people in groups that it considers politically active: namely, Arabs, Muslims and foreign nationals living in the United States. \"This pattern of surveillance has been followed with more than once target groups, indicating that it extends beyond actual foreign intelligence targets.\" ACLU staff attorney Mark Rumold writes.\n\nThe secret FISA court has given no clear rationale for why the NSA is required to retain the phone records of millions of Americans; even the FISA judges who approve secret surveillance requests don't know why. That's in stark contrast to the NSA's own internal policies, which the NSA claims allow it to gather vast amounts of data from the telephone calls and Web communications of everyday Americans without any warrant or court order.\n\nThe ACLU's report also describes the use of the FISA Amendments Act, which allows the government to ask the FISA Courts at secret locations to authorize surveillance even when it targets U.S. persons. The law is used by the NSA to get court orders authorizing it to intercept Internet communications and search through the Internet's records for suspicious activity on a massive scale.",

These people and the people of other religions do not have as one group of people a religious community (or a community of people). The people of every other religion have many different sects: some are Jews, some are Christians, some are Hindus, some are Moslems. There are many different kinds of churches, and there are various kinds of sects. They are different from the people of Islam. They differ between them, as they are different from each other. Allaah says (interpretation of the meaning):\n\n\"Say (O Muhammad): Who is the nearest of the brethren (i.e., those in truth)? The one whom the people call brother (i.e., the Muslims). Say, He is Allaah, the One, the Everlasting; and He is the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.\"\n\n[al-Haakim 80:10-13]\n\nTravellers tell us that there is a difference between the people of Juhaina and the people of Islam according to whether they are of a religion which forbids the worship of others, or of a religion which allows worship of others. In both cases, they are of the same religion. They are of one group, which is called a community.

The difference of the ruling of the two groups is the ruling of worship.\n\nThere are a large number of differences between the people of Islam and the Juhaina, but these differences are not what is meant by the words \"a single clan,\" even though they can be referred to.

      "Travis Bickle (center) arrives at his first hearing in a Santa Monica courtroom, where his sentence of 14 years to life in prison was reduced to a three-year term for the 1997 robbery and shooting rampage that left three people dead. (AP)\n\nThe man who drove a car into crowds, and then went on the rampage at a gay nightclub that left 49 people dead, received fewer sentences than two men he targeted in an earlier killing of a former UCLA basketball star in 1997.\n\n\"His sentence is no less harsh than what his victims received,\" Orange County Superior Court Judge Jeffry H. Hallock said in the courtroom.\n\nThat man was Eric Frein, who pleaded guilty to killing New Hampshire state trooper Garrett Swasey during a shootout after he stopped to question Frein about breaking into his neighbor's house.\n\nThe Associated Press initially reported that a third shooter was going to have his sentence reduced to two years for killing the soccer hooligan. In reality, a prosecutor told the judge, the shooter wasn't even part of an accomplice charge — the shooter who killed the U.S. soccer team's captain had just been arrested and charged with murder.\n\nAuthorities in Pennsylvania charged Frein as an accomplice to the fatal attack, but no one else was charged. He was charged with first-degree murder in the deaths of Cpl. Bryon Dickson and trooper Alex Douglass shortly after Dickson and Douglass stopped to question him.\n\nThe same judge who sentenced Frein on charges of first-degree murder in the double slaying of Eric Garvey and the United States soccer team's captain announced the sentence of the man he said killed the soccer team.\n\nTravis Bickle (AP)\n\nFrein's lawyer denied that a connection existed between Frein and that shooting or that Frein had killed anyone in that case. Judge Hallock noted it was possible the U.S. attorney's office and defense attorney did not know one another, and agreed with prosecutors that no connection was apparent.\n\nThe first of his crimes, which resulted in a 14-year prison sentence and 10 years' special parole supervision, took place Sept. 11, 1997, the day before an early-morning shooting in which he killed three people. Frein was the sole shooter and wounded two men. Three months later, he shot and killed a police officer. A third, more senior officer killed the soccer team's captain, Bryon Dickson.\n\nBickle, a 33-year-old former Boy Scout, attacked a couple, an Army staff sergeant, and his sister after they walked inside a trailer in which he grew marijuana in northern New York state at the beginning of 1997. Bickle wounded the sergeant and tried to drive away after driving his pickup into one of the military man's cars. Then he shot and killed the sister. The trooper eventually killed Frein, whom the trooper had stopped for questioning about the shooting of the U.S. soccer team's captain, on June 10, 1997, in Blooming Grove, Pa.\n\n\"He had to stop to get to the shooting scene,\" the trooper said. \"The first part of that crime was when he was driving over by Blooming Grove.\"\n\nHallock handed down the sentence of 14 years to life for the shooting spree that left three dead and three wounded. He added a three-year term for each of the other two shootings to send him to prison for 17 years.\n\nFrein's lawyer David Freund, who spoke on his behalf during the sentencing hearing, indicated he would appeal for Frein to get more lenient treatment.\n\n\"I'm confident that Mr. Frein will be treated for a mental health disorder that is present in many cases,\" Freund said.\n\n(AP)\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
      "Sprint's strategy of using HTC's low-end phones in some form to get consumers connected is changing, it seems — at least in India. On Monday, Indian carriers Jio announced that the company had acquired an unspecified number of Nexus phones in a \"exclusive partnership.\"\n\nThat leaves HTC in a precarious position. Despite not being the best-performing smartphone maker in India, HTC is the main seller of its Vive virtual-reality platform that is available through Jio.\n\nJio spokesman Pranjul Bhardwaj confirmed the deal, telling The Hindu that the company was acquiring a number of devices from a Taiwanese hardware manufacturer. But it doesn't say whether the devices include the HTC-made Vive headset.\n\nHTC, which is currently a subsidiary of Google, confirmed to Mashable that it is not partnering with Jio in any way. Jio's new partnership and partnership with a Taiwanese manufacturer aren't necessarily a problem, but they could be trouble for HTC on multiple fronts.\n\nOne problem is a potential conflict of interest: HTC has a stake in Jio, despite it being a wholly owned subsidiary and being a rival to the Google-owned entity. In fact, according to The Wall Street Journal last year, HTC sold some of its HTC One handsets for money raised on the platform. HTC is also a co-developer of the Vive headset with Valve Software. It therefore has a financial incentive to market Vive to consumers using HTC devices.\n\nAnother problem is that HTC has no brand name to speak of. It operates under the name of HTC USA, which is also a subsidiary of HTC — meaning the same devices can be sold either under the HTC brand name or under a brand with another HTC subsidiary.\n\nIt remains to be seen what Jio plans to do with the HTC devices. As of now, Jio's Indian website only has a few pages of HTC's website for customers to check out. At least one HTC representative told Mashable that no devices will be released, so we'll have to wait to find out if Jio is releasing anything other than the Vive.\n\nGiven those circumstances, any deal that HTC could strike with Jio will be a blow to the Taiwanese company's brand. In the near future, it will probably have to shift its efforts toward new hardware as it looks for a viable platform to keep the Vive competitive against the Oculus Rift and Viveport.\n\nOn the upside, HTC could get a shot at more success as it tries to win back customers now that it does have one — and as it works on its next generation phone. A number of HTC's products are already on the verge of obsolescence, but the Vive is in a different category.\n\nHTC's best-selling devices in China, a region that accounts for roughly 35 percent of Vive sales, include flagship phones like the One M9, M9+, and M8, and budget devices like the M8 SnapDragon F1, F1 Plus, and One M7 Mini. The Vive will probably be a better option for HTC's budget phones as compared to the current generation of \"flagship\" phones by Samsung and Apple.\n\nSprint and Jio's HTC partnership was first reported by The Verge.",

      "1. We have used the best available evidence to determine that it is generally accepted and scientifically established that the ingestion of a wide variety of foods and beverages at one time does not increase the risk of breast cancer.\n\nThis statement applies only to information on food and beverage intake that was generated prior to the World Cancer Research Fund–American Institute for Cancer Research (WCRF-Ac) guidelines on food and beverage consumption, published in 2004, which have been reviewed and approved by the WCRF-Ac scientific advisory board and the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC).\n\n2. Although a substantial body of scientific evidence supports the concept that occasional consumption of high-fat, high-calorie, low-nutritional-value foods and drinks, such as red and processed meat and chocolate, are not associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, the WCRF-Ac concluded that data from epidemiology and case-control studies were insufficient to support an association with overall consumption. The WCRF-Ac therefore, on behalf of all the WCRF committees, advises that prudent adults should limit consumption of these foods and drinks in favor of a diet that is lower in red and processed meats, which are known to increase the risk of colorectal cancer.\n\nThe 2004 WCRF-Ac report stated that there was insufficient evidence to support a positive association between chocolate and colorectal cancer. However, in the most recent meta-analysis, the findings were still not entirely clear [6].\n\n2.1. Evidence from the epidemiology of cancer risk\n\nThe epidemiology of cancer risk\n\nThe WCRF considered all epidemiological and laboratory studies that looked directly at cancer risk. Some of the findings are:\n\n1. A significant relationship exists between dietary fat intake and colorectal cancer. However, other studies have not found a consistent relationship with different types of fats [7, 8]. It is probable that different types of fat may be linked in a dose-response association.\n\n2. Diet has been associated with risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, including lymphomas, and ischemic heart disease. However, there is no evidence that there is an association with any other cancer-causing agents [9–13].\n\nA major report published by the British Dietetic Association and the World Cancer Research Fund in 1998 found that higher intake of dietary fat was associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer in several cohort studies [11]. In contrast, a Cochrane review by the European Association of Cancer Registries (EACR) that included eight epidemiological cohort studies and one case-control study concluded that there is no evidence that high fat intake is associated with an increased risk of any particular type of cancer [14].\n\nA few studies have suggested, at best, a small association between high saturated fat intake and cancer and that this association may be caused by the fat itself [15, 16].\n\n3. Epidemiology of specific cancers\n\n3.1. Breast cancer\n\nThe association between dietary fat intake and breast cancer risk is not very clear. The Nurses' Health Study found no association between fat intake and breast cancer risk [17]. However, a cohort study done in Singapore and The Netherlands [3, 18] found an association between high fat intake and increased risk of breast cancer, but again, this association was not statistically significant. The findings from these studies were generally consistent. The WCRF has noted that \"results from case-control studies, and from studies of postmenopausal women where the participants were under 50 years of age, suggest an increased risk of breast cancer\" [5, 19].\n\n3.2. Prostate cancer\n\nIn men, the association between high saturated fat intake and prostate cancer risk is not clear. Both a meta-analysis conducted by the National Cancer Institute of Canada and a systematic review of cohort studies conducted in China found neither an association with fat intake nor a decreased risk with greater fat intake [20]. It seems logical to hypothesize that one of the components at both the cellular level and the biochemical level, i.e., in the form of hormones, may be involved in this association. This hypothesis is supported by animal studies that have found that high fat (e.g., from fatty fish) diets induced a variety of biologically active hormones, such as adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and androgen receptors, and prostate specific antigen (PSA) [21].\n\n3.3. Lung cancer\n\nIn men, there is a strong association with high fat intake and risk of lung cancer (RR=1.24) [22]. A cohort study by the National Cancer Institute of Canada that looked at 4,093 men with a recent history of lung cancer and 14,848 age and sex-matched controls with no history of lung cancer found a significantly increased risk of lung cancer in men who had a high intake of dietary fat (RR",
      "It's amazing how much information is released every year on the different drugs that are available, how much they cost and whether they take effect. So let's check up on what's still out there that no one's actually taken their drugs yet.\n\nIn the following pages, I'll be looking at a couple of drugs that have made major news in recent months. Of course, as with most drug information, there are some drugs that have been around so long that they've practically become a cliché. A large number of these will be drugs that are not on this list for various reasons, but if you're interested in the drugs that are still on the market without much attention or hype, you don't want to miss these two.\n\nThe first drug of interest was called dibenzoxazepam and is a popular sedative used to treat anxiety and insomnia. It was first introduced in the 1950s by a British drug producer called Alexander Shulgin. You can buy the drug online, so if you find yourself in need of relief, you can try it out. If you've tried D-bol or cocaine before, you'll have a good feel for the drug. However, it is by no means as intense or addictive as those drugs.\n\nAnother drug on this list that will have you thinking about cocaine is called oxazepam. When it was first discovered, oxazepam was thought to be just a powerful anticholinergic, but many people took it for different reasons. The first of these was as a sleep aid, although it can be addictive and may cause insomnia in those who become dependent.\n\nYou can buy oxazepam online and it is typically used by doctors and patients for panic attacks and anxiety, but it's used for a whole range of illnesses, including depression, obesity and migraine headaches. Although it is very difficult to prescribe the drug because it is a benzodiazepine, it has proved to be useful to patients in treating their symptoms and has been used to treat seizures, PTSD and some medical conditions.\n\nAnother popular and common drug that has recently received a lot of media attention is Kalydeco, a generic version of the benzodiazepine alprazolam that is used for treating anxiety. Like benzodiazapam, it is a benzodiazepine that has the potential to cause seizures or have profound mental issues in those who abuse it excessively.\n\nBoth of these drugs are still under study and there is a lot of concern about their safety. It has become increasingly more important for doctors to have reliable and fast-acting options for treating anxiety and insomnia because they can greatly improve people's lives. It's hard to predict if people will become dependent on one of these drugs in the future, especially because there is no specific treatment, so this could prove to be a deadly combination.",
      "\"I'm not a good liar,\" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Comey in a television interview this week.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat statement, taken verbatim from Mr. Comey's notes, suggested to some experts that Mr. Comey had lied about some key facts of the case, including Mr. Trump's request for loyalty and his firing last month. If that is indeed Mr. Comey's meaning, he has raised profound policy dilemmas in the intelligence communities and among law enforcement officials around the world.\n\n\"If it's true that he lied, that is an act that I think needs to be investigated as a possible crime,\" said James R. Clapper Jr., the former director of national intelligence. \"It really is extremely dangerous. We will have to have very rigorous investigations as to how this was done.\"\n\nMr. Clapper said one interpretation of the Comey testimony on Wednesday was that Mr. Comey had \"taken a very direct position that he was not able to support,\" and that did not look good for American intelligence agencies.\n\nThe Russian government, however, said the remarks by Mr. Comey revealed no wrongdoing. \"The fact that he was not willing to give any details on what he did and what he did not do and did not order does not give the impression of illegality,\" Maria Zakharova, a spokeswoman for the Russian Foreign Ministry, said\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nOn Wednesday, a spokesman for the British Government, Simon Schama, took the same view, calling the remarks on the Hill \"a remarkable admission.\"\n\n\"It seems perfectly reasonable to take what Mr. Comey said seriously, particularly if he does suggest that Mr. Trump's request for loyalty was a lie,\" said Mr. Schama, director of the School of Oriental and African Studies. \"But we also have to take him at his word on this — and it's not the first time he has given such a statement.\"\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThe timing of Mr. Comey's testimony and his apparent admission of a serious misstep has added to the furor, some analysts said, making it a potentially devastating moment. And those who served in senior positions within the Trump administration on intelligence matters say that Mr. Comey had acted in an \"extraordinary\" and \"unforgivable,\" manner.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\n\"If true, this would be the single greatest political scandal since Watergate and could well topple the presidency of Donald Trump,\" said Michael K. T. Flynn, former national security adviser to Trump with a PhD in comparative politics from Princeton. Mr. Flynn said his first reaction to Mr. Comey's remarks was \"the biggest mistake I have seen the president make.\"\n\nBut James R.

      "(ANSA) - Rome, December 1 - A former Italian minister of state at the U.S. embassy has been arrested in Italy on charges of accepting tens of thousands of euros in bribes, judicial sources said Thursday. He was also accused of being an owner or director of two companies, and was suspected of having an offshore company.\n\nThe man, identified only as Stefano Mauri, served for seven years as a undersecretary at the United States Embassy in Rome before resigning in 2009.\n\nHe was arrested in Milan on December 9 and brought back to Rome.\n\nIn a statement, the government ministry said the prosecutor-general's office had filed charges against Mauri following an investigation carried out by the public prosecutor's office. According to the statement, Mauri had been found to be in possession of a number of bank accounts, which included \"large sums\", which had been deposited by American citizens and companies.\n\nThe U.S. embassy made no comment on the incident.\n\nUnder Italian law, any conviction for a financial crime in Italy carries a prison sentence of four to five years or up to €50,000 ($59,680) fines, making the case a serious one.\n\nIt is not known for how long Mauri has been a resident of the Mediterranean country, where he has been staying since 2009.\n\nThere are no known political links for Mauri, who has no known mafia association.",
      "For example, a few weeks back I got a letter stating that, on behalf of our company, an ad agency for our own publication had written to our board, and on our behalf, about why it wasn't the best move for a number of reasons. Their letters are always polite. So one day, I was wondering why I hadn't received this letter when on the day of the meeting I had been given an email address I could use to get the response. So, without reading it, I called up, got disconnected by the receptionist, and when I called again the person who had taken the message at my old number was not available. So I called the new one at that address to ask.\n\nI got a polite reply, which was fine, but when I pressed for some information the woman there said she couldn't tell me. When I got off the phone with the receptionist, it was just before 10pm. I've been at work since 8am that morning, but I was able to get in contact with that receptionist by the end of the day.\n\nSince that last conversation I've not heard back from anyone. I've sent emails to the board and to every lawyer in our offices, but no response. The next step would be to see if there is a claim procedure in place for journalists to use, but to use that procedure I would need to contact the BBC. So far no sign of it.\n\nIn general, the BBC doesn't seem to be very keen on taking on responsibility for stories that break. Their approach to this case, as to most other similar cases has been to write to the offending writers to try to get them to correct their mistakes, and to send them a warning so they know what's going on. For instance, this story about \"the man who died laughing at the news of an earthquake.\" That piece included a quote from the writer's family, who described his final moments on Facebook before he died: \"He said it was a big deal, but then the phone rang… and then the tsunami.\" Of course that's totally different from what the journalist said when he was on air.\n\nTo recap, I would like the BBC to:\n\nsend letters via email and post to every editor and owner or their representative (not just to me, because we've got enough editors and owners who have read my letter here to have a general agreement to act)\n\nsend letters via email and post to all writers for any BBC programme with which we have an obligation to air, either current or past. (Not just my programme, because I had sent a copy of that letter to some people involved in the program as well, but for the programme that was the subject of my complaint, which I expect they know about)\n\nsend letters via the BBC's public complaint, which requires the writer to prove that they understand that they are wrong and they are not in any way making up a story\n\nsend letters via the complaints procedure on a regular basis, particularly when our staff have to write about matters of public interest in any of our programmes.\n\nI would also like an apology and an acknowledgement that one of our staff committed this grave breach of trust. These are very serious matters, and they require serious action.",

      "Mauricio Pochettino will bring Tottenham's pre-season schedule to an end on Thursday as the side prepare for two matches in China. But the coach admitted that the club had still yet to find a date for an exhibition game in the South China.\n\nThe head coach will spend the next week in China having watched every game of the club's tour. But after two warm-up matches, which took place on July 12 in Shenzhen and July 23 in Shanghai, Pochettino will take the players to Hong Kong, Macau, Japan and Singapore.\n\n\"We just had a lot of games this summer, but we have now started another preseason for the new season and this one is longer than the other one because the main objective is for us to be here for three months to prepare for next season,\" Pochettino said. \"So the first four weeks were the preparation for next season but also for another pre-season. So I think with three more weeks we can have a proper rest and I think the players will have a lot of energy to go to Hong Kong, Macau and Singapore and I think it's also important for us to have a good week together.\n\n\"We did a lot in the summer, in China as well. We were in Hong Kong for one week, we did [Shenzhen] for one week, and we have now two games. So I think we have five days to prepare mentally, physically and tactically, so we can have a good week together.\n\n\"On the Chinese side, there are three Chinese Super League clubs. So our first game is in Hong Kong, our second game is at Shanghai SIPG, and our last game is at Macau, so that is a week of preparation. But that first game won't take place in a friendly environment. It's a friendly game in a Chinese stadium against a Chinese team, so it will be a little bit different from previous years and also with different players and teams.\"\n\nTottenham will spend the next three weeks in China.\n\nWhen asked to name the players Tottenham will likely face in Hong Kong and Macau, Pochettino said: \"We don't have a clear squad to prepare for, but we know already that we will have players to play against. I don't know many [names] at the moment.\"\n\nAsked whether his decision to play three pre-season games followed the advice of the club's medical teams, in an attempt to prepare the side in good condition ahead of the Premier League season, Pochettino added: \"Before the season starts, we work a lot with the coaching staff to prepare for all competitions. We do a lot with conditioning tests, we do a lot with injury investigations. So I think a lot of things have changed because what happened last year, we work a lot in pre-season.\n\n\"To play three games in the same time is not easy because you have training camps, you have international tournaments and we have a lot to prepare for in China. So I think I have done all in my power to prepare for three games so I think it's good for the players, because last year they played two games in a month, so the same situation this year.

      "There is growing evidence that the US Senate, and especially the US president, could vote on Monday on a bill that would allow the National Security Agency to legally collect Americans' phone records. On Wednesday, some legal analysts said that the measure is almost certainly to be voted on, with or without the White House's formal endorsement.\n\nThe House of Representatives is in a similar position. There are now indications that the House Judiciary Committee is holding hearings on the Senate bill, so the bill might already be on the fast-track to passage if the Senate and House do not work out a compromise bill before next Monday, when the USA Freedom Act is scheduled to come up for a vote.\n\nSo how likely is the NSA bill to be voted on? A new analysis by the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, a US government agency, estimates that the bill, which was passed earlier this month by both the Senate and House of Representatives, has a 61 percent chance of successfully getting through the Senate and a 64 percent chance of getting through both chambers and then being approved by President Barack Obama.\n\nOf course, an analysis of public support for the measure would be more authoritative. According to polling by Quinnipiac University released last week, support for the measure is strong but tepid. Forty-four percent of all Americans, including 60 percent of independents and 59 percent of Republicans, say the NSA program is about right. Only 27 percent say it is \"much too\" about right.\n\nThe poll also found that 56 percent of Americans see no threat of the NSA phone surveillance program to democracy in some kind of mass movement.\n\nAccording to this, 51 percent of Americans disapprove of the phone surveillance program while only 38 percent approve. And according to the findings provided by a Pew Research Center poll conducted in July, only 28 percent of the American public have heard enough about the program to say whether \"the government is doing enough to protect security for the American people.\"\n\nAnd finally, only 23 percent believe \"the government is not treating the information people give it at the government's request fairly. This figure is similar among Republicans (21 percent), Democrats (28 percent), and Independents (25 percent). The poll by Pew also found that only 30 percent had heard enough to say whether \"the government is doing enough to protect security for the American people, and how important it is to protect the privacy of Americans when the government is collecting their data.\"\n\nBut given all these polling numbers, there is a strong possibility that the NSA bill gets through both houses of Congress.\n\nAnd the White House and the Obama administration may have helped bring it about, because it is almost certain that the Senate would pass a bill with a White House-backed endorsement.\n\nDuring the Senate testimony Tuesday from the director of the National Security Agency, Gen. Keith Alexander, Alexander stressed that his agency had always cooperated with the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, the secret court that authorized surveillance programs, and had never requested access to private phone records of Americans.\n\nLast month, on the basis of that testimony, a group of 26 civil liberties advocates signed a letter to US Senate leaders demanding the US government declassify documents regarding the surveillance programs that have caused such outrage among Americans.\n\nThe letter notes that \"the public's knowledge of these activities is largely the result of a series of disclosures in April 2013, of classified documents provided by former NSA systems analyst Edward Snowden to journalists.\"",

      "What is a Cylinder?\n\nA cylinder is an iron, cylindrical, tube-shaped, solid and solid-based container with a narrow opening. As the name suggests, a barrel cylinder or a rifle cylinder, it is often the container used by shotgun companies to store their shells.\n\nIt can be the perfect container for your next event if you have your own gun safe, or if you want to host a non-profits event in your own house.\n\nThe easiest way to build a barrel/cylinder container is to use the same kind of lock you use for your doors and lock boxes.\n\nFor this tutorial we will use the TINY Cylinder Lock. You can download a free PDF version of this lock from the TINY Cylinder Site.\n\nWe want to make 1 cylinder. The template we will use is the same for 2 or 3 cylinders if you want a barrel. You only need to measure the width and depth of the container you will use for your cylinder. The dimensions will be the same for all the 1-cubic foot containers that we build. We have included two different templates which you can download from the TINY Cylinder site, as well as the dimensions of the small cylinders themselves.\n\nOur Cylinder Template\n\nTo make your container.\n\nStep 1. You need to measure the width and the depth of your container. Cut a strip of 3/4\" thick corrugated cardboard and draw it on the inside of the container using a marker.\n\nStep 2. Draw a circle measuring 3/8\" in diameter, in the center of the circle. Draw a hole in the circle measuring 2\", the exact size of the hole that the 1\" brass tube will go through.\n\nStep 3. Lay down your template and cut the cardboard. You can use the crescent wrench and the paper-towel trick if you want to help. You will need to drill a few holes into the corrugate-like cardboard before you can use it, after.\n\nTip: Make sure you clean the crescent wrench before and after you use it. When you use the corrugated cardboard, the paper-towel technique can scratch the cardboard with scratches which can cause the corrugate pieces to stick together.\n\nStep 4. Now use the PVC pipe, or tubing as you prefer, to make the tube that the brass tube will go through. In the picture below you can see the pipe with the 1-in-inch shank.\n\nStep 5. Cut the plastic pipe to size to fit the 1-in-inch brass pipe. Cut it to 3/4\" long so it fits into the circle. Cut a hole in the center of one end.\n\nTip: There is a little trick you can use to help you get a good fit of the pipe into the circle. Hold the pipe with one hand and use your other hand to grip the end of the tube. Use both hands to compress the middle of the tube until the PVC pipe fits snugly in the circle.\n\nMake sure your pipe doesn't hang out the end of the container.\n\nStep 6. Put the tube into the circle to match the size of your 1-in-inch brass tube.\n\nStep 7. Using the template that you printed from the TINY Cylinder site, cut 4 rounds of plastic tubing that fit to accommodate the holes that the brass tube needs to go through in the container. Use some rubber bands or pliers to tight the tubing down. I cut about 4 rounds with a 4.7mm square cutter but you can use any kind of cutter that can take your tube into the circle.\n\nStep 8. Cut 2 cardboard squares the size of the diameter of the shank from your corrugate cardboard, about 1/2\" x 5\" (6cm x 16cm). Place one circular piece about 5\" across in the box to be your cylinder and one square about 2-1/2\" across to be the barrel of the cylinder.\n\nStep 9. Use a small screwdriver or needle tip to screw the cardboard onto the corrugate cardboard. Place the corrugate cardboard to the metal cylinder. Make sure the circular piece is flush with the circle on the side of the lid.\n\nStep 10. Put the other cardboard square on the side of your lid. Now you can use the corrugate cardboard as a guide to put the brass tube into the circle.\n\nIf you prefer you can use a small piece of foam core board that fits over the container and then tape it together.\n\nIf you don't use corrugate-like cardboard or foam core board you can use a rubber dome or any other kind of non-absorbent material that will fit into the cylinder and keep it in place. I have used a 1\" x 4\" x 8\" piece of cork as a",

      "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Earlier today, the head of the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission said the Obama administration planned to announce legislation targeting electronic cigarettes, potentially creating new rules that could effectively ban them. Speaking Tuesday at an American Bar Association event in New York, Tom Wheeler urged the regulation of e-cigarettes.\n\nTOM WHEELER: In the near future I'm going to be unveiling a proposal to take a new look at this—at this new category that's now called electronic cigarettes. And we're working on a proposal that I think is likely to garner a lot of support from Congress, but also from the Department of Health and Human Services, the Centers for Disease Control, the Food and Drug Administration. And we're going to present it to [President Obama] very soon.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, Sen. John Thune, said he expected the proposal could take months.\n\nSEN. JOHN THUNE: It does pose some challenges, to be truthful about that.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Meanwhile, the White House also says it is pushing back against a proposal to regulate Internet gambling. The Obama administration says it won't consider proposals to regulate online gambling until after Congress passes major new laws to deal with the issue of online gambling, including reforms to the nation's bankruptcy laws.\n\nOn Wednesday, CNN reported, quoting an administration official, the administration would not formally implement the so-called online video\" regulation that was part of an omnibus gambling bill that passed Congress last year. The regulations have yet to be made final, but CNN reported there is growing concern over online gaming not being treated at the same level as traditional games such as poker and black jack, making a potential legal clash. President Obama told CNN's Jim Acosta Wednesday, quote, \"It's not a regulation; it's a statement of intent. It does not force anybody to change the way that they do business.\"\n\nWell, for more, we go to Denver to talk to Chris Hansen, the author of the New York Times best-selling thriller novel, Under the Banner of Heaven, which is about the struggle between the CIA and the Church of Scientology.\n\nChris Hansen, welcome to Democracy Now! How many movies do you think you've written?\n\nCHRIS HANSEN: About 30.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: So, tell us about this film. We'll start with the title, Under the Banner of Heaven, this movie, which is about the CIA plot to assassinate Billie Sol Estes, an enemy of the state, under the guise of a terrorist. Explain it.\n\nCHRIS HANSEN: Yeah, so, it's about that—this idea that—in the late 1970s, this idea around the CIA and drug trafficking and so forth that the CIA has a—this sort of shadowy force that's operating from its heart in Langley, Virginia, and that it's all part of this—some sort of global drug enterprise that we call \"The Church of Scientology.\" And so, this is how it has—there has been a lot of, you know, conspiracy theories, but there's really very little hard evidence to back up some of the things people believe. But there seems to be this idea that when the Cold War comes to an end, and the CIA says, \"We're going to take over, you know, the world, and we're going to run it for the best interests of global freedom,\" that that's kind of where things start to get really hazy. And I was fascinated, in particular, by this kind of internal CIA history of how this all ended at the moment when Hubbard was going to be indicted for trying to kill a congressman. And it starts to play out through these different characters' thoughts and feelings and stories, kind of like a kind of anti-hero thriller.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: That's called Under the Banner of Heaven.\n\nCHRIS HANSEN: Yeah, yeah, it is. But, you know, I've been writing since I was 14 years old. And I just feel like I wrote this really intense, visceral story after talking to people around the country who had these stories, and a lot of them are not in the movies, although a lot of it is in the books. There is this kind of thing happening that's happening in the shadows that a lot of people believe is important. But there hasn't been a movie that's really explored that yet. And now I'm trying to do it, because I know a lot of people who feel the same way, like, \"We can't wait for it,\" which is just kind of what everyone says, but there's a lot of people who—people who have had serious experiences with what goes on with the CIA and what goes on with Scientology. So, I'm trying now to make that kind of movies, because—\n\nAMY GOODMAN",

      "The most common mistake I see is people believing something like this:\n\nSo, you could go to the store and buy a gallon of milk for about $1.75.\n\nI'm sorry, but if you're using that rate, you're not buying two gallons of milk. The milk is sold at $1.75 for a gallon.\n\nOr, you could buy a 3-ounce container of milk for 40 cents (it's $1 a pack in the store, although you can't really compare that to the price on the corner. When you buy it, you're not buying a pack of three 3-ounce containers, but just $1 worth).\n\nYou're not just buying one of the three packs of $1 containers of milk you get for $1.75 in the store. We're talking about the same 40 cents worth of milk, but you're paying only 40 cents per container.\n\nSo, do you buy the three ounces of milk? Yes, that is an equivalent purchase.\n\nOr, do you buy the three packs of milk? Yes, that is also an equivalent purchase.\n\nDo you buy a 4-ounce container of milk for $1.30? Okay, that's more like three packs of the same 40 cents worth of milk (there will be four containers and then you'd be spending $1.70 at the store instead of $1.75).\n\nSo, if you do the math, you'll conclude that if you really wanted the four-ounce container, you should be saving for a 3-ounce container.

Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium and simmer until the onions are just tender, about 15 minutes.\n\nStep 7 Add in the sausage, celery, bay leaf, tomato paste, Worcestershire and salt and pepper to taste. Cook until the sausage is melted and the seasonings are absorbed, about 3 minutes. Stir in the reserved beer.\n\nStep 8 To finish off your brisket, brush a tablespoon of olive oil over the outside of each brisket and rub each brisket a few times with the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil. Heat 2 teaspoons salt in a sauté pan over medium-high heat (or use a nonstick pan and heat on the stove top if using a nonstick pan). Once hot, add the brisket to the pan and cook until tender and no more pink remains in the meat; about 3 minutes per side (or until the meat is cooked all the way through).\n\nStep 9 Transfer the brisket to a plate and allow it to rest while you finish preparing your sauce. Serve the sauce and brisket along side the baked potato with a salad.",
      "There is no doubt that the New England Patriots are the class of the league. From 2007 to 2012, the Patriots ranked third in both total points (5,903) and total yards (6,208). They also won back to back Super Bowls, beating the Chicago Bears in a historic 23-17 win. They were a team on the rise, a legitimate contender, and they would have been great.\n\nInstead, the Patriots have fallen to sixth place in 2014, despite having a record of 9-5. It will be tough for them to bounce back this season in any fashion. That is because they have already lost five-one games to teams that currently have playoff hopes, including the Pittsburgh Steelers (-4), New Orleans Saints (4), St. Louis Rams (5), Detroit Lions (-3) and Philadelphia Eagles (-8)\n\nI'm not going to get into a debate on which of the two teams is better. The bottom-feeders of the AFC South are certainly capable of winning this year and would be the perfect opponent for the Patriots. But at the same time, the division is filled with teams that have a legitimate shot at winning. The Carolina Panthers, Atlanta Falcons, Houston Texans, Tennessee Titans, & Indianapolis Colts have legitimate playoff chances; the New York Jets will have a very tough road to make the playoffs, though they will likely be the only AFC team able to make the playoffs.\n\nAt this point, there isn't really any difference between being a great football team and being a mediocre football team. The problem is that teams such as the Colts or the Texans can't play like the Patriots and the teams that will be fighting back from the cellar in the AFC East can't play like the Patriots to the extent the Patriots do.",
      "When I wrote in the spring that some states had begun to decriminalize possession of small amounts of marijuana, I was expecting opposition. I never expected to be in meetings with leaders of both parties that made clear the need to decriminalize small amounts of marijuana.\n\n\"This issue is never going away.\"\n\nThat's how New Jersey Gov. Tom Kean said last week on the Fox News Sunday program. \"Our citizens should not be arrested for possession of a small amount of marijuana.\"\n\nAt the end of 2013, a total of 24 states had decriminalized possession. This issue is never going away. As one executive in a marijuana-treatment program said today, \"It's not going to just go away.\"\n\nI had dinner with Kean a few weeks ago, and asked him if he considered decriminalization an issue where a Republican could work with a Democrat. Kean's answer: \"Yes. This issue is never going away.\"\n\nWhy is this happening now? In the 1960s, marijuana became a big deal to politicians and voters. That's when the first drug war laws were passed. Then, in the 1970s, there was a public outcry and legislators got scared (though polls indicated support for full legalization hadn't increased in a decade).\n\nMore recently, voters in Colorado and Washington approved the legalization of limited possession of less than an ounce of marijuana. This is not a political issue or a moral one. It's a matter of public safety.\n\nThe number of people who are arrested for marijuana \"sales\" (or possession or use) is staggering. In Colorado, for example, there were more than 12,000 marijuana related arrests in 2011 alone. A similar number of arrests occurred for \"traffic-related offenses,\" the report says, but that was far fewer than for marijuana itself.\n\nAccording to the report \"Confronting the Tide: The High Cost of Mass Marijuana Arrests to the Taxpayer,\" in those states that legalized, \"In fiscal year 2011 alone, Colorado spent $66 million of additional revenues on police and prison costs.\" The same could be done for a similar number of arrests in neighboring states, and more, say, in neighboring and other states that passed decriminalization laws (but the authors do not make those comparisons).\n\nSome opponents are worried that decriminalizing marijuana may increase the flow of marijuana into the community or bring it to the streets. A \"study of the impact of marijuana decriminalization on California's illicit drug market found no increase in the quantity of cannabis consumed, and found that the criminalization of cannabis users for small amounts actually reduced use over time.\" (Washington State decriminalized marijuana in 1998. Washington has since done the very opposite.)\n\n\"Decriminalization can be a means of limiting the number of people arrested for marijuana possession and driving the illegal economy,\" says the report, \"because individuals who are not arrested due to the state of Washington's decriminalization laws have less incentive to move illegally.\"\n\nDecriminalization is less the moral issue that most people are thinking, and more the social need. We're talking about the cost of arresting, charging, prosecuting and incarcerating people for possessing a low-level, non-violent drug with very few serious effects.\n\nAnd that costs. In Colorado alone, there are now roughly 30,000-plus people in jail for marijuana-related offenses. A study published by the University of Colorado Boulder concluded that those jailed for marijuana have substantially lower life outcomes than people arrested for other crimes.\n\nThis is good public policy.",

      "A federal judge in Philadelphia on Friday struck down the Obama administration's controversial plan to shield thousands of illegal aliens – most from Central America – from deportation.\n\nU.S. District Judge Joseph L. McMahon in San Francisco issued a nationwide injunction against the Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful permanent Residents program, also known as DAPA. The program, part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, is at least partially responsible for about 1,000 illegal immigrants illegally arriving into the country in the first five months of this year.\n\nThe program's main aim was to allow illegal immigrant parents and grandparents of U.S. citizens to obtain legal representation and work permits during their time in the U.S. McMahon's ruling states that DAPA is not designed to make the lives of these families any better.\n\n\"This case centers on the proper interpretation of immigration law. That reading goes against well over two centuries of public policy based on the principle that people deserve due process before they can be deprived of their liberty,\" the judge wrote. \"The government does little to explain how the DACA program serves the public interest.\"\n\nThe program is a part of Obama's Deferred Action for Parents of Americans and Lawful Permanent Residents (DAPA). Obama is seeking to extend the program to the children of illegal immigrants born in the U.S. who are currently enrolled in American schools. As Breitbart News has reported, the program would grant amnesty to many of the children of illegal aliens.\n\n\"In striking down the president's amnesty, Judge McMahon has ruled against the law,\" said Chris Newman, the legal director for the Center for Immigration Studies, an organization that works to cut legal immigration to the U.S.\n\nThe ruling is the latest in a series of defeats for illegal alien agenda-makers in federal courts.\n\nDuring Obama's first term, President Obama's executive amnesty for illegal immigrant parents and grandparents of American citizens and permanent residents was struck down in federal court as well and is currently on the verge of being overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nOn December 23, 2015, U.S. District Court Judge Rosemary Collyer struck down President Obama's 2012 \"Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.\"\n\nIn 2015, President Obama's amnesty for illegal immigrant parents of \"DREAMers\" who were brought to the U.S. as children was struck down in Florida federal court as well. The 2016 amnesty for illegal immigrant parents and grandparents of \"DREAMers\" that would provide them work permits, social security numbers, and a path to citizenship was again thrown out in federal court.\n\nFederal courts have also ruled twice in the first half of 2016 that Obama's illegal amnesty for illegal immigrants who came here as children was illegal and unconstitutional.",
      "Hugh Freeze's Ole Miss Rebels got back to some sort of bowl form last week as the defense limited a ranked Oklahoma offense to its second-lowest total (22 points) in over a year.\n\nSo, maybe it's safe to take things one week at a time. Maybe there could be a silver lining in what happened the last time these Rebels got into the playoffs with a dominant Week 13 performance.\n\nAt a press conference on Monday, Freeze said the Rebels have to prove they belong in the league and not have an overabundance of wins. He wants the Rebels to become the \"next BCS team\" if they can't prove they can beat the next two or three teams the league brings up every year. Those other teams have to get beat — and often.\n\n\"When we played the (Alabama) Crimson Tide, we were the next BCS team,\" Freeze said. \"Everybody thought (LSU and Florida had) no chance, they're the two defending champs. We wanted it so bad. We didn't get it because they beat us and I felt like every time I heard somebody say we had no chance. We had to be the next BCS team.\"\n\nThe Crimson Tide won and then beat Florida State, Notre Dame and Auburn over the next three games. It may have been hard for folks who hadn't seen those games to get their minds around the idea that something special was happening in Starkville, but when you've got a team as talented as the Rebel defense right now -- with a handful of returning starters on both sides of the ball and 10 returning starters from last year's team -- there are a number of teams in the nation who better be looking over their shoulders right now.\n\n\"It took us a while to get there, but we're there now,\" Freeze said.\n\nThere are plenty of things the Rebels need to do to prove they belong.\n\nFirst and foremost, the defense needs to shut down one of the best offenses in the country and force the Sooners into a very tough time-of-possession battle at Oklahoma City. Oklahoma was fourth in scoring in the country last year, but that was the second-lowest total allowed in the country.\n\nThe Sooners scored just 32 points, and when it wasn't blowing it (they scored just three points in Oklahoma State), the Sooners had struggles to come up with the balls to win. They were sacked 18 times on the season, and they threw it 25 times with a whopping eight dropped passes.\n\nSo, if the offense can't get the ball, the defense just might be the one holding down the fort for the Rebels.\n\nThis is the first time the Sooners have hosted the national title game since 2001. It's also the first time this season the Sooners have opened with their conference championship hopes on life support. The national title is the ultimate one-game show.\n\n\"The way they played against Arkansas, we've got to be prepared for them to come down and play us hard,\" coach Bob Stoops said last week. \"I felt we were very good last week. They were very good against us.\"\n\nThe Sooners played better against Tulsa and Marshall, but they were simply too hot to be beaten and too old to be beat when they took on an Ole Miss team last week that will be a little bit fresher. If the Rebels can shut down one of the best offenses in the country or at least slow it down -- which should happen easily against an Oklahoma team that ranked 22nd in scoring last season -- that's a lot to overcome.\n\n\"The biggest thing is us showing everybody we belong in the league,\" defensive tackle Robert Nkemdiche said. \"We want to prove (we belong) and not have overabundance of wins.\"\n\nAll the offense has to do is win one of the next three games.\n\nIf the defense proves it can stay on the field, we could have a real reason to believe this team will be the SEC favorite next season. That'd be just about the only good thing about the Sooners taking the spotlight away from the Rebels this week.\n\nAnd if the Sooners are in the conversation and the Rebels are still looking to get back to that place they once were? That'd be a long way for the Rebels to go in 2017.",
      "If we want to see the future, we need to look at past trends and consider how we can affect what we see in the future. In that vein, I have a theory that there might be a way not only to create faster, cheaper, but even more powerful 3D printers, but a way to use them to solve the challenges the world faces, such as food, medicine, and clean water, as well as reducing the carbon footprint of energy.\n\nWith food printing now a pretty basic concept, I figured it's high time we went more in-depth on how we can use printers to help bring about more sustainable food production in the future. I'll start with food waste, as in: how can we create more efficient, cleaner methods for producing and disposing of food?\n\nWe see food waste for two main purposes: we throw away food because it has gone bad or its not fit to eat. We throw away food because it's been grown in a polluted environment or because we ate it after it spoiled. We throw away food because it's not fresh enough or it's not grown in a sustainable way.\n\nThe problem with both approaches, aside from the loss or waste of valuable resources, is how to ensure that our food will be eaten in a safe and responsible manner. In my view, a 3D printer can provide a solution that is both feasible to produce and more environmentally friendly than current methods.\n\nThe first step towards making sure our food is consumed in a responsible fashion would be to print in clean food grade plastics where the edible portion was processed, mixed, and packaged at the beginning.\n\nIn order to achieve this, the first step is to find a process that can produce clean plastics in a clean environment. Currently, 3D printing in plastics can only be done in a specific process called heat treatment (heat treating plastics in a sealed metal chamber causes the plastic to cure before it actually shrinks or hardens; when 3D printing in a heat-treated plastic, it is referred to as \"bonding\") – but this has its own issues.\n\nCurrently, only a handful of companies are producing plastics that were heated in this fashion. Most companies using this process use it to produce plastics that only undergo a single heat treatment (which is actually a fairly simple process), or it uses a multiple-step process to \"bond\" a composite resin – and even then not everybody is happy with the finish of their end results.\n\nThere are some advantages to heat treating plastics, particularly regarding the process of thermosetting that occurs in many forms of plastic. Thermosetting plastics can result in the plastic actually growing a protective, more complex structure over time – which is something that is much harder to achieve during heating.\n\nBut there are even more challenges to thermosetting plastics. For example, if your thermosetting resin is mixed on a large scale to form a composite resin, it would be incredibly difficult to manufacture this composite resin at the temperatures that the 3D printer would require, meaning the materials would require a large amount of raw material as they undergo thermosetting, a time consuming process that doesn't lend itself to small-scale production. Another, and even more common, issue with thermosetting plastics at temperatures approaching 40 degrees Celsius involves a lack of thermal adhesion, or \"stickiness\" – there's an important distinction between being able to stick things together, and being able to set things on fire. It's important that if a thermoplastic can be easily and naturally thermoset to achieve its strength, that it will form a strong bond with other parts of the plastic, such that they become attached to each other – otherwise, they can easily peel apart. This happens often with the thermosetting process that produces plastics with the \"heat molding\" finish of many polymers.\n\nAs we've seen, heat treating plastics has its own issues and challenges, not the least of which is the risk of thermosetting and potentially making the plastic melt.\n\nAnother challenge is that plastics in 3D printing can only be printed where they are heated above a certain temperature, which is currently the temperature at which it takes a certain amount of pressure to cause the plastic to melt due to the increase in viscosity (which is an increase in the number of molecules in the plastic). For some plastics, heat treating can achieve an adequate viscosity without thermosetting – but this can have unintended consequences. For example, a thermoset plastic may bond to its partner's side and thus prevent it from sliding – but this means they cannot slide through each other to pass their food throughout the cooking period – a major concern of food safety concerns, especially on small kitchen tables.\n\nThese are just two of the issues with current 3D printing methods of food manufacturing, but they are important enough that there are already many companies and startups who are attempting to develop other possible methods that minimize and resolve these issues.\n\nIn addition to thermosetting, a third option for",

She said Trump knew about Gorka's comments before they were made, though Gorka told the New York Post he had \"no recollection of making it.\"\n\nBut Gorka reportedly made his remarks during a discussion with the hosts of the conservative website The Resurgent in which he defended an alt-right attendee, claiming he was \"not a white supremacist, by any stretch,\" the Los Angeles Times reported. The guest, Kevin MacDonald, said the alt-right should stop claiming to be the \"voice of conservatism,\" according to the newspaper.\n\nGorka responded to the reports by saying he was merely quoting other people's statements, \"I didn't say what I'm accused of saying.\"\n\nGorka said in a statement to the Los Angeles Times that he's \"not a white supremacist, by any stretch of the imagination.\" He also added that his interview with MacDonald happened before he became an official White House advisor.\n\nA reporter for the conservative publication cited a report on a far-right conspiracy website that said MacDonald had written a 2015 post in which Trump was represented in a drawing of a person wearing a Star of David while giving a speech.\n\n\"A video that circulates on far-right sites was shared on MacDonald's Facebook page in which Gorka can be heard describing Trump in a glowing but distorted fashion as a savior of Europe from multiculturalism, who would stop Islamic terrorism.\" the statement said.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\n—Updated 8:16 a.m.",
      "A former top lieutenant to the United States Army's top general has been arrested in California for possessing child-pornography, federal officials announced Wednesday.\n\nRetired Brig. Gen. Charles Cleveland, an expert on cyberdefense, was arrested Wednesday morning after an investigation revealed that he had downloaded child-pornography content from the internet.\n\n\"From a cyber security perspective, these are the most egregious actions you can make,\" John Carlin, assistant secretary of defense said in a statement Wednesday.\n\nThe pornography Cleveland was found to have downloaded consists of images of children, and the Department of Justice said investigators were searching for more illegal material. They said Cleveland traveled widely and may have had an alias and is not in any immediate danger.\n\nCleveland will be moved on to another location. The military, which released the following statement Wednesday: \"The Department of Defense takes these investigations very seriously, and those responsible for the conduct and consequences will be held accountable if found guilty.\"\n\nCleveland is currently stationed in Fort Leavenworth, Kansas. At the time of his arrest he was director of operations for the U.S. Army Cyber Center of Excellence in Tallahassee, Florida, which has offices in Washington and Stuttgart in Germany.

      "When the time comes, to use your skill, to use what you learnt in the lessons to create a piece of music that is yours alone.\n\nMusic Theory\n\nIt makes no sense for you to take a music lesson unless you know how everything works.\n\nHere are the fundamentals for all scales:\n\n1. Root note\n\n2. Second (or third, etc)-tone note\n\n3. Third (or fifth, etc)-tone note\n\n4. Fourth (or sixth, etc)-tone note (aka octave)\n\n5. Fifth (or seventh, etc)-tone note (aka diatonic)\n\n6. Equal or perfect fifth\n\n7. Scale with three notes on same string\n\nAs for a musical scale, you can define this either by writing the notes from left to right from the top down, or by writing the notes from right to left from the top up.\n\nYou cannot define music by just counting notes. You need to apply the basic principles of chords and scales.\n\nIf you do not want to spend the entire course learning these tools, here are a couple of ways you can apply the theory:\n\nPlay one scale over a chord or two in any key\n\nPlay a chord over a scale (usually to the end of the scale)\n\nWrite down 3 ideas for each scale you are playing, based on the notes you are playing\n\nIf you are a beginner, we recommend to start out with scales in major or minor, in order to gain the intuition for the chords and then progress to a more complex piece.\n\nIf you prefer more information about scales, you can always listen to one chord and a scale, and learn from those in just 2 to 4 hours.\n\nMusikalisch\n\nIn this course, we will take a step back and learn music theory by playing. That means, learning by ear.\n\nWhy play this? If you are already a piano player, you already know piano theory and can go through some videos to have the knowledge for music theory, but if you want to learn to play piano by ear, then this course is for you.\n\nHere are the basics of music theory. These are just the basics, I suggest listening to some great music to learn and memorise about the fundamentals of music theory more.\n\n1. Scale degrees\n\n2. Harmonic minor = major-minor scale\n\n3. The major scale\n\n4. Major-minor scale, harmonic minor and diminished\n\n5. Harmonic minor scale, major-minor scale and diminished\n\n6. Whole-half-tone scale\n\n7. Whole tone scales\n\n8. Whole/half tone scales\n\n9. Whole/2 tone scales\n\n10. Whole, half, two tone, and octave scales\n\n11. Half-tone, whole, and 2 tone scale\n\n12. Whole tone, root, 5th, 1st, and 6th scale\n\n13.

      "Cisco Blog > Threat Research\n\nTWRP\n\nCisco's Trusted Computing Group (TCG) and the Internet Society (ISOC) announced today the first release of TWRP, an application-level remote firmware update mechanism which can be used exclusively within the TCG Group, and other network members, to enhance existing firmware and to deliver new firmware to end-users when necessary.\n\nCisco's Trusted Computing Group and the Internet Society have been working together on technology in anticipation of the general availability of software patches for the IOS, NX-OS and SCADA platforms, which require secure software updates from the TCG. Currently, TWRP provides the TCG with the capability to push firmware updates to the network without the need for an administrator's knowledge, as an added layer of security.\n\n\"Although we are always looking for ways to secure the firmware deployed within the TCG, there are cases where security enhancements can be implemented by an untrusted party without requiring a change in the firmware itself,\" said Peter G. Neff, Cisco's chief security officer and head of the TCG. \"With TWRP, TCG can now deploy secure firmware updates from anywhere within the world on any other network member with the TCG's trusted hardware.\"\n\nTo ensure the firmware is secure, TWRP requires the same level of protection as a TCG member – complete trust – and requires authentication from each network node to push the update to it. The TCG communicates with network members across the internet using its proprietary protocol to notify the member of a change in functionality and to request authorization. In order for the upgrade to occur, the TCG must validate and accept the authorization of each network node that wants to run TWRP.\n\n\"Once TWRP is initiated, the system performs a series of checks to ensure the firmware is safe to use on the host,\" said David Darnell, director of engineering for the TWRP initiative. While TWRP is only active on member networks, it is also effective to use outside of member networks.\n\nFor more information, please visit http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/cloud-computing/tswp/.",
      "When people look at Donald Trump's tax returns, some think about the rich, about how much he is really worth. And some think about how much Uncle Sam has been taking from the American people.\n\nThese are two big questions. But they are related. And it's very surprising to see those big questions intersect in politics this year.\n\nWhen the Trump campaign released his returns and they showed that he had paid zero taxes, I expected the Democrats to go crazy. The Washington Post's Fact Checker gave the claim \"Four Pinocchios\" and concluded \"Trump is likely right about this -- that it would be extremely difficult for him to legally deduct all his business losses if, hypothetically, he lost $916 million in 1995.\" But the Democrats did not go that far.\n\nThey kept quiet. Instead they attacked Trump for having paid zero taxes. They said it was something wrong with his tax plan--that it wouldn't be possible.\n\nThe Democrats should have said that it would be interesting to see the returns. \"Trump made $2 billion in real estate investments (more on that when we analyze his returns).\" But all of these tax returns have been released since the beginning of the campaign, and no one has asked Trump any questions about his tax returns. Why the silence? There was also some noise on the question when Hillary Clinton was under public scrutiny about the Clinton Foundation and paid some taxes--but Trump has not been under scrutiny.\n\nThe Democrats were trying not to get distracted by the issue of his real estate investments. At that point, most people did not know what exactly Trump did with so much of his income besides rent and buy, and he was the first president in 70 years who had paid no federal income taxes.\n\nWe now know that this was a massive tax deduction. And this could show that Trump paid even less taxes than he says.\n\nIf this is true--and some say that these returns show the opposite--then the 2016 campaign will have really been about income inequality as Trump sees it.\n\nFor several decades the American tax code has favored tax lawyers, business owners, and owners of small businesses over working and middle class taxpayers. We have a tax code that favors large income, wealth transfers and investments. That has caused many to believe that they are getting a good deal for income, income transfers and investments.\n\nBut what if that is not the case. And what if the American tax system is, in fact, a massive tax shelter?\n\nIt would be interesting to see the documents. I can imagine some tax professionals complaining to their clients that it is a huge waste of money to do this, but it will show us who is actually who.\n\nWe can see that a large part of Trump's income came from investments. He had an investment portfolio of about $500 million. We can learn much more from this if he releases his tax returns. Maybe even more if some tax professionals complain.\n\nWhat they are doing now is going about an issue that is not really an issue. They are taking over Trump's time. They are the ones that made his tax returns public and are now using that as their reason to not talk about an issue which is not an issue.\n\nThat is the same reason why these tax documents have not been released. It shows that Hillary Clinton is on a campaign to distract and create division. They are doing it because it is what the Democrats do. It is the same reason why the Republicans do not release their tax returns. The Democrats have been using a \"nothing to see here\" strategy all summer, refusing to take over the narrative of the media.\n\nAs the polls show this presidential campaign is the worst of all time, they continue to avoid taking responsibility or answering questions. Because to answer the questions they risk undermining the entire Clinton campaign. They have to be ready right now. Because they are so predictable and boring.\n\nInstead there has been no more debate about their tax returns. There is nothing left to talk about. It is up to the voters to put the Clintons on notice. Trump has taken the lead. He now has all the time he needs to make his tax returns public.\n\nWhat the Democrats hope to do is distract people from an issue that the American people have become very clear on. It is income inequality.",
      "LARGEST MATCH EVER OF PICKING 10-0\n\n\nBengals-Patriots, 3-14 (4-5). The Bengals made a great deal of noise this year. One of the more interesting results was that the team picked up the number of yards lost in losses. There was no other team who posted a better differential, while every other playoff team failed to win at least half of their games.\n\nThe reason for this is simple. The Bengals have the second longest drive in the game with 18. The Patriots have the 2nd longest with 19. This suggests that the Bengals have gained more yards in their losses than they have gained in their wins:\n\nF-O-G DVOA DAL 18.6% NYG 19.3% CAR 12.5% OAK 12.2% BUF 9.8% SF 9.4% CHI -12.9% DET 4.8% SEA -4.8% NYJ -7.6% MIA 2.6% BAL -9.4% SFO -9.7% DEN 4.2% BAL -10.6% BAL 2.9% PIT 32.3% MIA 22.2% DET -8.9%\n\nA quick comparison of yards gained and yards lost in losses can tell us if any of the other teams' performances on this list are any indication of what we can expect from them in the playoffs. Since 2002, each team has posted an average differential of 10 yards in losses and 7.5 yards in road wins.\n\nOf the teams who did worse in their losses (DAL 13.2, NYG 14.0) the only teams whose F-O-G differentials in their home-games improved significantly were the Patriots in 2004 and the Broncos in 2008 (both 13.6). The Jaguars showed promise with a 9.7 differential, but it has not been enough to get them past Arizona or Carolina in any season:\n\nA few more teams have a difference of 8 or less:\n\nIf we are looking for the team likely to have the most favorable schedule they would then look at the following (in this order): the Bengals, the Eagles, the Broncos, the Seahawks and the Colts. Each team is expected to face 8 teams in the playoffs and all of them played 6 of those 8 games without their main starting quarterback. If we were to just look at their losses, all of these four teams would have the following differences of 7, 6, 5 and 5, respectively. The Broncos would be the least attractive of these four teams on a regular basis and the least likely to go all the way:\n\n\nSo here are the two teams likely to go all the way to the Super Bowl, the Bengals. They have the 2nd longest F-O-G differential in their losses with 6.5 and the Patriots have the 3rd longest with 8.5 yards. If anything, the Bengals would need their 1st round bye to go to New Orleans for games against the Jaguars, Redskins and Chargers. The Patriots would need the 2nd round bye to play the Jets, Bills and Dolphins, while the Broncos would be in better shape for games against the Cardinals and Buccaneers.\n\nThe Bengals should have a better week of practice this week as they have games against Houston, Pittsburgh and Jacksonville between now and the playoffs.\n\nNext Sunday the Patriots will play their first road game of the season, so they will be trying for their 10-0 start to the season against an injury-riddled Jets team, who have given up the 2nd most rushing yards of any team this season.",

This study aimed to determine the effects of dietary supplementation with vitamin B6 supplements in rats on behavioral tests, such as passive and active avoidance of sucrose. Animals were randomly divided into six groups. Groups were treated with vitamin B6 supplements (100 mg/kg kg, p<0.05 for each dose), vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide (100 mg/kg kg), vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide plus vitamin B6 (250 mg/kg kg), vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide alone (100 mg/kg kg), vitamin B6 alone (100 mg/kg kg), or vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide. The animals in the vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide group were supplemented for 21 weeks with 250 mg/kg kg vitamin B6. The rest of the groups received vehicle (sucrose solution), except for groups for which there was no dietary change for 15 weeks, as the rats are not treated with any form of nicotinamide. All groups were challenged 1, 6 and 12 h after the last treatment and then examined for passive avoidance of sucrose solution (n=4, * = p<0.05). The results show that all the groups supplemented with vitamin B6 had reduced passive avoidance compared to control rats. Supplementation with vitamin B6 alone or vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide decreased active avoidance and no effect was observed for vitamin B6 alone and vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide (both p>0.05). The effect of vitamin B6 plus nicotinamide was greater than that of vitamin B6 alone. The combined vitamin B6 supplementation reduced the response in animals previously treated with vitamin B6 alone.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nThe vitamin B6 supplement did not affect passive avoidance in animals previously fed a high-fat diet or in the presence of nicotine. Although the effect of vitamin B6 on the response of subpopulations of the rat is not clear, its effect was greater than that of placebo in rats previously treated with vitamin B6 alone.\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nThe effect of the vitamin B6 is greater than that of nicotine alone in rats that have been treated with vitamin B6.",
      "On March 6th, The Atlantic published an article on \"The Uncomfortable and Unhealthy Relationship the US and Russia Have Had Over the Past 10 Years\". The article provides a clear exposition on the real state of relations between the U.S. and Russia. For the sake of clarity, it is of extreme interest that American intelligence has been spying on President Trump since the early days.\n\nThe article quotes former acting CIA Director Michael Morell, who states that his former colleagues \"came down harder on Russia because we were clearly violating these norms against Russian spying.\" He added that this created a \"perception problem\" for the Obama administration.\n\nMorell also admitted that the White House has been aware or even encouraged the spying and that the President himself was concerned about the damage it was doing to U.S.-Russian relations.\n\nIn light of this information, it is understandable that the American media would be covering the NSA-Snowden espionage scandal, while ignoring Russia's efforts to hack into the 2016 election process. The media is doing exactly what the CIA, NSA, and FBI were doing back in 2013.\n\nThis is exactly what the Obama administration intended with the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). The original intent was to increase U.S. government surveillance and espionage power, ostensibly to combat an \"existential\" security threat. However, the real purpose was to enable the U.S. government to crack down on independent media and criticize the policies of the U.S. regime.\n\nIn March 2013, the New York Times reported (Google Translate):\n\nThe Senate on Tuesday passed a bill, approved by the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies, that would strip the Central Intelligence Agency of the legal grounds for surveillance under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) [2] and for conducting electronic espionage under section 1821 of the National Security Act (sic).[3]\n\nAccording to the Times, NSA Director Michael Hayden testified on the matter, stating:\n\nWe must have the tools that are available to us. What they are is legal in nature. They are a tool that enables us to engage in intelligence gathering, targeting terrorists in the air, targeting terrorists within the United States.\n\nHayden continued:\n\nThere are some important limitations as to the nature of the equipment that can be used. Under section 1821 of the law, which applies to U.S. persons, equipment which is directed at U.S. persons is illegal. Equipment which is part of a broader intelligence program is lawful: it's a U.S. government program which is directed against U.S. persons. There's all sorts of provisions here that apply to specific equipment which is directed against U.S. persons — [but] equipment that's part of a broader intelligence collection program — is lawful. I believe that in both cases the laws that we're approving are lawful, which allows us to have the equipment to conduct these activities and to do our job as necessary to protect the nation.\n\nIn December 2013, the Wall Street Journal reported on Section 1812 (FISA) (Google Translate), which states:\n\nThe President shall, so far as practicable, delegate to the heads of other departments and agencies authority to collect telephonic, electronic, documentary, and financial information about U.S. persons under this subchapter.\n\nSection 1812 (FISA) is entitled 'Authorizations to Conduct Operations of National Intelligence Authorities'. Section 1812 (FISA) states:\n\n(b) Authority to Collect Telephone Addresses of Persons in Contact with Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Agencies and Other United States Persons.—\n\n(1) GENERAL AUTHORITY.—The term \"authorized officer\" means the head of any element of the intelligence community (as defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003(4))), as defined by section 3 of such Act (50 U.S.C. 3003), who has received advance approval from the Director for the acquisition, for purposes of foreign intelligence, of phone numbers or other identifying information or records to be used to contact such element(ies).\n\n(2) EXCEPTION.—The term \"authorized officer\" does not include any officer described in section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003) if the information or records collected or sought is within the scope of a reasonable need for obtaining that information or records by such an officer (including the specific need to investigate or protect the safety of any person, property, or entity).\n\nIt is unclear whether the term \"officers described in section 3 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3003) \" means the director of national intelligence, the director of the Central Intelligence Agency, or the head of an element of the intelligence community such as the National Security Agency.

      "A A\n\nLAS VEGAS -- The NBA is taking another look at the state of its lottery to see if it can keep Las Vegas as the only lottery in the world.\n\n\nThe league has considered the issue a handful of times since its inception, and commissioner Adam Silver said it's something he wants to take up again at some point.\n\n\n\"I will say we have considered doing a lottery in Las Vegas, it has been considered several years ago, and it was discussed at a league meeting in September 2006, and it is something that is under review at league meetings,\" Silver said after Sunday's All-Star weekend festivities.\n\n\nLeague executive vice president, Joe Lacob, said the NBA has not yet made a decision about whether it will make a visit to Sin City. The NBA is in the midst of a national competition to make the top four teams in the Eastern Conference that won't be decided until its 2017 All-Star Game in Toronto this month.\n\n\n\"The thing we wanted to look at was all the options, everything that has been under consideration, and the only way to do it was to look at it with the current structure that exists,\" Lacob said. \"We're exploring the options that we have within league rules. That's really all that it is.\"\n\n\nLeague rules require the four teams in each conference that win a playoff spot in their respective conferences to play a seven-game series as they bid for home-court advantage for the postseason and the opportunity to draw first-round picks to supplement the two spots in the lottery available to the worst finishers in the league per the present system. The league decided last year not to add another lottery, so the teams get picks one through four in their respective conferences.\n\n\nThe process works like this: First a committee of five -- the commissioner, the three general managers of the four teams in the conference -- selects the team with the next lowest record. Then a playoff spot is purchased, at the price of $1.5 million per bid. In the event a team does not win a playoff slot (the first spot goes to the team with the next-lowest record), it can still try to make the playoffs by finishing in the top four and winning a game against the team of the next-worst record. In this scenario, the NBA makes the lottery picks for the four teams based on the remaining teams' records.\n\n\n\"We looked at it and said, 'Look, if we do it (the lottery) here, we are putting the teams with the best basketball in a position to be successful. We don't want the lowest overall team to be eliminated from the playoffs because of their lottery results. We're really trying to work toward a structure that is fair to the other teams, to the fans, and to the players,'\" Silver said.\n\n\nIn addition to the current lottery system, the NBA also conducts a \"one-percent\" rule, which is applied when two teams in a three-way tie with the lowest combined records in a division are not able to finish above second in their division, in that case the tiebreaker is a coin-flip, with the winner determined by the lottery pick won by the team finishing first in that division. Since 1996, only one team has been awarded two first-round draft picks by this system: the Miami Heat in 2007, when they came away with LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.\n\n\nSilver said \"the only teams that benefit from the lottery system are the teams that end up with the worst product. They get the best talent, they get the best odds to get the first pick, and they're really the only ones that benefit from the lottery system.\"\n\n\nAlthough the league considers the NBA lottery system effective \"regarding the overall level of competition,\" it is not considered equitable, in that it favours some teams above others, and that the best lottery teams do not have the best teams on the court, according to Silver. Silver said he would be in favour of a different system.\n\n\"The one percent rule does not seem to work for us,\" the commissioner said. \"We have a lot of teams that end up with an incredibly lucky draft pick and it seems to favor all the non-elite teams and the non-champion teams, and as a result we don't have the best overall product, even with the 1 percent rule.\"\n\n\nLacob said the lottery \"hasn't been working for a long time\" and that Silver knows how to fix it.\n\n\n\"For all the talk I've heard about him listening to people in basketball, he listens to people in baseball. He's listening, he's taking a hard look at it and he's going to make a decision and he's going to make it well,\" Lacob continued. \"Like I said, it's one of our most powerful mechanisms with an organization that he can have, to get his point across. If there's another system I like better, he",

These stories show us the harsh reality that many prisoners have endured in their years of imprisonment — but they also point the finger at those who are profiting from these injustices, asking where would we have been if this had not been industry business as usual.",
      "[1] The number and type of particles in each jet have varied as a consequence of different atmospheric conditions, the motion of the atmosphere, and different modes of heating and cooling of the surfaces and particles in it.\n\n[2] The energy of each particle in a jet will be either kinetic or thermal (energy of motion is equal to mass times velocity of the particle) in this experiment. The kinetic energy is calculated based on the size of the particle and its velocity, while the thermal energy is derived from a linear fit to a numerical model of the particle scattering.\n\n[3] The particle in the middle of the jet (i.e., the one furthest from the source) is at rest and thus will absorb all of the energy of the wave in which it is located. This part of the wave energy may be converted to mechanical energy by heating this particle up, and in turn that part of the wave energy will be converted to thermal energy to heat this particle. This latter conversion has been done in several previous experiments, for instance, E. C. Tewari & I. G. M. B. Bajaj, \"Scattering of a solid in a viscous jet at air temperatures of 10–11 °C using particle-free and fluid-free diffusive schemes,\" Appl. Phys. Lett. 61, 741-744 (1993). See also B. C. Ebeling, M Sjöstedt, and I. Sipilä, \"Scattering of a solid in a viscous jet at air temperatures of 1–10 °C,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., 64, 1281–1282 (1996); A. J. M. Verweij, B. M. Hsu, and I. T. Wijffels, \"Thermal emission of a solid on thermal radiation at 0 °C and 50 °C,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., 63, 1278–1280 (1995); M. A. A. C. Korte, \"Optical absorption spectra of a liquid in a viscous turbulent jet,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., 63, 2485–2487 (1995); Y. S. Y. Ng, M. L. I. M. P. Ngi, and X. Diao, \"Scattering of a solid in a viscous jet at 0 °C and 1,000°C,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., 58, 3151–3154 (1992); T. A. Ebeling, A. E. Healy, M. J. R. Joughin, and M. J. Deane, \"Wet-bulb-cooled laser-cooled gas-liquid jet systems,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., 57, 1180–1191 (1992); M. E. P. Verweij, \"Scattering of a fluid and solid in a vortical jet,\" Science, 264, 2077–2079 (1975); and C. T. Hsu, S. J. Y. Chung, and J. P. Aoyama, \"Heat transfer from a jetless vortex-like channel,\" J. Phys. Chem. A, 66, 4641–4645 (1992).\n\n[4] The air at the tip of this jet is heated in the thermal-wave mode because of its near-side position and the large air velocity in this region. This heating can be quantified by using the amount of heat per unit area of the fluid, which can be derived from a linear approximation. Since the temperature difference between the air at the tips and a distant point where the jet enters the nozzle from below is the same as the difference between the temperature of the jet and near-side air temperatures, one can use equations of state for the heated fluid as in S. C. Srinivasan, \"Thermal-wave properties of a two-dimensional viscous jet,\" J. Chem. Phys., 105 (1979), 645–649; T. A. Ebeling, A. E. Healy, M. J. R. Joughin, and M. J. Deane, \"Wet-bulb-cooled laser-cooled gas-liquid jet systems,\" Appl. Phys. Lett., 57, 1180–1191 (1992).\n\n[5] The heated particles will have a different temperature than the air near the tips of the jets. For instance, in the figure, the temperature of the hot particles, T h (x), will be higher than T a on the jet on the right and on the left; in particular, the temperature of the hot, wavy gas on the left will be higher than the hot, steady gas on the right. Note that the temperature difference between the fluid near the hot particles and near-side air is equal to the ratio between two vectors whose dot product is: T",

In addition to the ones to Brett Lawrie and Ryan Richter, the Blue Jays have dealt with three other key players. Michael Bradley is out with a concussion; Marky Delgado will miss three weeks with a sprained shoulder; and Jonathan Osorio is out with a leg injury. However, the Blue Jays are 4-2-4 since these injuries have occurred. Toronto FC's first away match of the season will be on Sunday.\n\nMatch Stats\n\nNew York Red Bulls XI: Luis Robles; Kemar Lawrence, Sean Davis, Ibrahim Sekagya; Daniel Royer, Ronald Matarrita; Felipe; Bradley Wright-Phillips (Justin Bilyeu 88'); Sacha Kljestan (Brandon Barklage 74').\n\nToronto FC XI: David Osorio; Kyle Bekker, Justin Morrow, Gale Agbossoumonde, Steven Beitashour (Jonathan Osorio 66'); Marky Delgado, Tosaint Ricketts, Justin Braun; Eriq Zavaleta (Robert Earnshaw 66'), Benoit Cheyrou; Jonathan Osorio (Brayden Irwin 84').\n\nScoring Summary\n\nNY: Luis Robles 25' O: Sacha Kljestan.\n\nNY: Bradley Wright-Phillips (Michael Bradley, off a free kick from 18 yards) 53' O: Bradley Wright-Phillips.\n\nDiscipline Summary\n\nNY: Sacha Kljestan (caution), Michael Salazar (caution), Ben Spencer (caution), Luis Robles (caution), Kemar Lawrence (caution).\n\nNY: Bradley Wright-Phillips (caution), Sean Davis (caution), Rafa Marquez (caution), Ben Spencer (caution), Luis Robles (caution), Kemar Lawrence (caution), Gale Agbossoumonde (caution)\n\nNY: Luis Robles (caution), Daniel Royer (caution), John Kempin (caution), Ben Spencer (caution), Kyle Bekker (caution), Luis Felipe (caution), Justin Bilyeu (caution)\n\nNY: Bradley Wright-Phillips (caution), John Kempin (caution), Bradley Wright-Phillips (caution), Daniel Royer (caution), Bradley Wright-Phillips (caution), Bradley Wright-Phillips (caution) - Tim Cahill, Kyle Greig.\n\nTie Scorer: Bradley Wright-Phillips (unassisted, 68'), Bradley Wright-Phillips (unassisted, 90').\n\nTOR: Eriq Zavaleta (inj.), Steven Beitashour (inj.), Brandon Barklage (unassisted), Richard Eckersley (unassisted), Richard Eckersley (unassisted — yellow).\n\nTOR: Robert Earnshaw (penalty kick, 47'), Jonathan Osorio (penalty kick), Eriq Zavaleta (penalty kick, 47'), Drew Moor (penalty kick, 55'), Benoit Cheyrou (penalty kick), Robert Earnshaw (penalty kick, 59'), Benji Hoppenot (penalty kick).",

      "The first thing you need to do when the next update is available for the X2 is to upgrade to version 1.20.0. This is the update that fixes most of the issues encountered during 1.21 beta testing.\n\nIf there's a problem with that version and you still can't wait to go for the new versions, you don't have to worry, because X2 is still a very active software development. As a result, the X2 is a good hardware platform for development since one can easily install different kernels, graphics drivers, and other important packages without worrying about how them will affect the hardware.\n\nUpdate #1 now available\n\nI'm happy to announce that one of the most important features of the stable version 1.21 is now available. The new feature is a \"Power management\" system which allows to save battery power when the CPU isn't being used and then to use it again when needed. This is an advantage since if, for example, you need to take photos in the day when your phone is off, you'll save your battery in the process.\n\nThe first step to enabling this is to enable \"Battery Saver\" on your device by simply starting the software and selecting your device.\n\nThat'll be the only one you have to click on – this is the first step.\n\nAfterwards, a dialog will give you the option to run Battery Saver and then click to turn on Power Saver or not.\n\nYou should choose to turn on Power Saver, because it won't be used (but it can still be turned off by switching the ON/OFF switch).\n\nThe best thing about the system is that it will work automatically, without you having to do anything more!\n\nAfter enabling the system, the screen will be dark and you can start the update.\n\nDownload X2 1.20.0",
      "You Can Not See the Full Video, But Here's a Footage of President-elect Trump Calling for a 10% Tax on Mexicans\n\nOn January 20, Trump tweeted out this (original) tweet:\n\nThe only way to fix our country & its problems is to stop illegal immigration. We must be smart! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 6, 2017\n\nPresident-elect Donald J. Trump then issued this (revised) tweet:\n\nI pledge to reduce taxes and regulations on businesses big & small, protect American worker, eliminate job-killing restrictions, & add millions to take-home pay. #ForTheMany,NotTheFew — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2016\n\nThe only problem:\n\nWhat happened to the 10 % tax? https://t.co/Z0b7RdI8nB https://t.co/zVxjK1Z5QH — Benjy Sarlin (@BenjySarlin) December 28, 2016\n\nOn January 25, Trump tweeted this (original) statement:\n\nMy message to the Mexican Government and people is that YOU HAVE A COUNTRY TO RUN AND WIN. Mexico will pay for the wall! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 25, 2017\n\nThen…\n\nThe wall may be the worst idea since Trump.\n\n…Then this (revised) tweet:\n\nI have a running war with the media. They are among the most dishonest human beings on earth! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) January 30, 2017\n\nThat's it.\n\nThe original tweet was just a reaction to a press conference Trump did where he said Mexico would pay for the border wall. (Here's the part from ABC's Brian Ross where he reports on the fact that there was no deal with Mexico.)\n\nBut then Trump gave a press conference in which he said Mexico would pay for the wall and then he followed that up immediately with a tweet saying Mexico would pay for it. His entire message of \"the wall is really a way to bring us together,\" was undermined.\n\nAt the beginning of the post, I wrote this:\n\nYou'll notice the tweet that I'm referring to (on Twitter) was a re-tweet (that was on my own Twitter timeline.) But the original tweet was a tweet from an account that never tweeted under the original Trump account, and then I realized it was the original Trump account, and it was retweeted by a guy in the Philippines. But that guy also has an account on Twitter under the name \"Donald Trump with the DeploraBall.\" So that's three tweets that appear to come from the same account. If we apply his \"verified\" check marks to the tweet on my timeline, we get the actual tweet:\n\nAnd then I went to the official @realDonaldTrump Twitter and they're now using the \"verified\" badge for the original tweet:\n\nOf course – because this is the Trump administration – the original Twitter account has now been deleted from the @realDonaldTrump timeline. And that makes it even more suspicious.\n\nBut I decided to use a screenshot for the original tweet, so I could send this link to my readers:\n\nHere's the original tweet, and then I went back to this screenshot I took of the Twitter account on Donald Trump's page after the tweet was deleted. I then looked at two other tweets which appear to come from the same account on July 27, 2016:\n\nAnd then I took a screenshot of the June 15th tweet from the same account:\n\nSo that's 3 different tweets that came from the same account. These 3 tweets are very different:\n\nThe first tweet does not contain any text (though it's a picture with no content.) It's just a black screen with the words \"Walls will come\" next to it.\n\nThe second tweet includes the words \"bigly.\" (A tweet which actually came from the campaign is here.) It's just a black screen with the words \"bigly\" on it.\n\nThe third tweet that is the clearest example of the original tweet (from July 26, 2016) contains the following text:\n\nWhen Mexico sends its people, they're not sending their best. They're sending people that have lots of problems, and they're bringing those problems with us. They're bringing drugs. They're bringing crime. They're rapists. And some, I assume, are good people. — Donald J. Trump\n\nNote that these messages have different sentences and different punctuation. All of them are grammatically correct by themselves.\n\nBut here's the key thing:\n\nThese messages are all identical. They're all the same text with different sentence structure, different punctuation, and different punctuation for one word, \"sending.\"\n\nHere's the original message again:\n\nWhen Mexico sends its people, they're not sending",
      "I will be attending PyCon this year to give a talk on the following three topics.\n\nThe first is how we can use data science to better design web APIs, or, as we call it \"API design using statistics and data science\". We will use Python, R and NumPy, and some of the code examples will be in a notebook. It is very early days in the new Data Science API movement, but the talk will start off with a brief intro of what Web API is for (the Web is a distributed, unstructured, non-programmable web), and the motivation for doing something about this. Once I'm done talking, I recommend watching the video of my talk on PyCon for further details. I'll be posting it to YouTube along with the original slides, as well as here on this blog when it is completed.\n\nThe second topic we will cover is \"data science as a discipline\". We have been exploring different aspects of data science in the past several months with this talk, but have not yet started putting the concepts into practice (or, as we like to say at OSCON, \"getting our hands dirty\".) That said, I hope this will be an opportunity to discuss some of the basic ideas and ways we might do something more concrete. We may also have the time next month to do some more in-person workshops in the field. It should be an interesting discussion as we continue digging into many of the exciting new areas of data science.\n\nA third topic I wish to speak about is our favorite \"newbie\" tool: The R Developer's Toolbox. I don't know how many of you will attend, but I would love to get your feedback on it's viability (and in general, a better development environment) during this time of year.\n\nPlease give me any and all feedback you possibly can after watching my talk so we may better plan this event.",
      "The new year brings with it all sorts of resolutions and one for 2013 is to start eating healthier. But if you don't stick to the plan, you can be facing some serious health ramifications.\n\nThe American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE) found last year that the number of overweight and obese people aged 20-59 in the United States was the second highest on record and has continued to rise annually.\n\nA report from the AACE and Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius indicated that the number of children and teens who suffer from health problems related to overeating has increased. In 2013 the percentage of children and teens who have high blood pressure and diabetes are higher than in 2000. The percentage of teenagers and young adults who have a body mass index of more than 30 has also increased over the past decade from 17.3 percent to 19.9 percent. These are all risk factors for cardiovascular disease which in turn affects nearly everyone.\n\nBut even more troubling is the fact that more than 10 percent of teens are now considered to be at \"extremely high risk\" for heart disease.\n\nAs a result of such numbers, weight may be one of the biggest variables contributing to a person's overall health issues including heart disease, high blood pressure and even arthritis.\n\nTo cut back on those risks, check out the eight tips below that will help you shed that extra pound or two in no time.",
      "As part of the upcoming release of the Windows 10 Technical Preview, Microsoft is enabling BitLocker startup on supported storage devices that don't meet the BitLocker data volume size requirements.\n\nBeginning with the Windows 10 Technical Preview, if a BitLocker-protected system has less than 20 GB of free space per drive, BitLocker does not offer the option to start BitLocker on boot. Instead, Windows 10 adds the new startup option to Windows Update to allow you to enable BitLocker via the Microsoft Update service.\n\nAfter BitLocker is enabled, this feature has the following additional implications:\n\nIf the system is connected to a BitLocker-protected hub that is in use, the computer will not be able to boot from physical disks that use different firmware. However, any other storage will start BitLocker without issues.\n\nIf the system is unmounted, unencrypted startup media is available and can be used to start BitLocker. To enable BitLocker, follow these steps: On the Start screen, click All Apps > All Programs, and then click BitLocker Drive Encryption .\n\nClick Turn On BitLocker , and then click Allow . The Start menu will change to the BitLocker Drive Encryption window and will display a list of devices containing BitLocker-protected drives that can be used to start BitLocker on that system. To stop BitLocker, click Turn Off BitLocker .\n\nThe same feature is also available through Windows Update, with the same caveats.\n\nAs with any feature, it is recommended that system manufacturers consider adding the option to prevent BitLocker startup on smaller devices that meet the data drive size requirements for the BitLocker driver and firmware.\n\nThis article was prepared by David Schuster",
      "B.J. Penn is finally heading to the Octagon.\n\nPenn (29-14 MMA, 6-6 UFC) told MMAjunkie.com (www.mmajunkie.com) on Tuesday that he's officially returned to fighting after undergoing a physical. UFC president Dana White said it was done.\n\nWhen he first suffered a torn bicep against Matt Mitrione at UFC 155 in October, Penn believed that would be it.\n\nThat didn't happen, however, as White said earlier this month that Penn was still waiting on some medical clearance.\n\n\"I'm ready,\" Penn said to MMAjunkie. \"I've got some blood work to go through and the doctors at the UFC are still waiting on the results from a CT scan.\"\n\nPenn, who lost to Mitrione via strikes at UFC 161 in May, said he's been dealing with the injury for years and he's never felt better. That's despite the fact that he has a lengthy and troubled past.\n\nThe latest chapter has stemmed from a 2009 incident when, in the midst of a fight against Mitrione, he allegedly attacked his rival with a kitchen knife in a drunken rage in Las Vegas. He pled guilty to reckless endangerment in 2010, when it was a misdemeanor for a person to use a weapon in connection with an incident such as the one at hand but was sentenced to two months in jail and three years' probation.\n\nThough he was released, Penn was ordered to complete 40 hours of community service and served one day in jail. He was also placed on five years probation with mandatory alcohol counseling.\n\nHis current suspension, which extends from six months of no competition to two years of no competition, was set to expire at the end of September. But that expired on Sept. 1 and Penn is out at least eight months, with no timetable for his return.\n\n\"The suspension is up with the Nevada State Athletic Commission,\" said UFC spokesperson Dave Sholler.\n\nPenn said he's already made arrangements for his return, which is likely to be a late 2015 or early 2016 fight on an official UFC card (he would not necessarily have to fight twice in the same calendar year).\n\nPenn has been off the UFC's roster since July 2012 due to the incident at UFC 159, at which time he was suspended by the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency (USADA). He later sued USADA for damages. In that suit, obtained by MMAjunkie.com, Penn claimed USADA was using the information it gleaned from the incident against him, and said he was the victim of a deliberate public relations campaign. The suspension ran through December 2012.\n\nHe was eventually cleared by USADA and issued a lifetime ban by the Nevada Athletic Commission (NAC), which has a similar sanction against Penn that he filed and won with USADA.\n\nHe then filed a protest against USADA, saying it had violated federal, state and federal laws in the process of enforcing the four-year suspension. That appeal and the NAC's enforcement of the two-year period of no contest came to a head at UFC 165 in April, when Penn was initially ordered to pay his legal fees, but then granted a reduction in attorneys' fees. That set everything up for a June 12 hearing with the Nevada State Athletic Commission (NSAC) to determine what was fair.\n\nThe NSAC ruled Penn was in the illegal class in the fight, but the NAC's board of directors – all of whom voted to deny a reduction in attorneys' fees – ruled that the NSAC hadn't applied the correct law in the matter and thus wouldn't grant Penn the reduced fee.\n\nThe NSAC is scheduled to schedule a meeting on June 12 in Las Vegas to discuss a possible reversal of its decision, with no time certain for a ruling.\n\nWhite said the NSAC, as well as officials at the UFC, will likely need to examine the UFC's procedures and if something needs to change, so does Penn as well.\n\n\"We're going to look at our fight week practices in Vegas and look (at B.J.) about his camp and check in with him,\" White said.\n\nPenn told MMAjunkie.com on Tuesday that he had been training in Nevada for weeks prior to filing his state appeal and he's been working the training camp in Arizona.\n\nWhen it comes to the actual injury, Penn said, the worst he's ever felt is that bicep issue. Once he's cleared, he'd like to see a fighter he's working with fight him in a title match.\n\n\"That fight is still on my mind,\" Penn said.",
      "A man charged with making and selling synthetic marijuana has filed a lawsuit against the city of Austin and officers of the city's Central Precinct.\n\nBrian John Dabney, 43, of Austin, filed his lawsuit Wednesday in Travis County court, claiming excessive force was used against him during his arrest July 9. According to the suit, Dabney was stopped by an Austin police officer for speeding in north Austin at 4:25 a.m. The lawsuit says officers found a plastic bag made to look like marijuana and an empty package.\n\nThe lawsuit, filed in the office of State District Judge Orlando Garcia, claims Austin police officers struck Dabney with a Taser for trying to retrieve the plastic bag that he was found with, and that an officer also used a knee on his head when Dabney attempted to retrieve a package of plastic from a car. The suit also alleges Dabney was detained for two hours.\n\nThe suit claims the arresting and detention were unlawful. It states that Dabney was not charged with any crime and no arrest warrants were issued. He only got his driver's license suspended.\n\nAccording to the suit, when police asked Dabney whether the drugs used to make the \"smokable\" drug package that police found were marijuana, he said yes.\n\nGarcia scheduled Dabney's hearing for Tuesday, when the criminal case will be assigned to a public defender to review any evidence.\n\nThe suit said Dabney is disabled and has an ongoing battle with cancer.\n\n\"Since this arrest, Mr. Dabney has had no opportunities to speak publicly about what happened during his arrest,\" the lawsuit states. \"While this is unfortunate, it was not a case of police excessive force against a disabled man.\"\n\nThe lawsuit asks that Dabney be assessed damages, including medical expenses and attorney fees.\n\n\nIn a statement, a spokesperson for the Austin Police Department said the lawsuit \"is without any merit, and we will vigorously defend the case.\"",
      "The European Commission has started an investigation in Ireland following claims that the government may have broken EU tax rules, a commissioner involved in the case has told media.\n\nSergi De Gucht, a member of the EU Commission's competition authority, has reportedly begun formal talks with officials in Dublin and London over what has been described to TheJournal.ie by a person closely involved in the matter \"as a first step towards launching a formal procedure\".\n\nDe Gucht, whose predecessor Joaquin Almunia was forced to resign last year over what was at the time deemed a conflict of interest, will be the third EU commissioner to have to return from an overseas trip due to an investigation into the possible breaches of a EU rule on state aid.\n\nThe investigation into the tax arrangement announced by Ireland last February has been described as the \"largest-ever state aid investigation\".\n\nIn a statement released on Monday evening, De Gucht said the Commission was working with Ireland \"to explore the specific matter raised by the Irish authorities at the time of its audit\".\n\n\"The commission has been very clear that this is an important and complex matter, and a case in which the rules have been very carefully applied,\" he said.\n\n\"The commission will do everything it can in the way it sees fit to resolve the matter in line with the rules.\"\n\nThis latest round of talks comes as the European Commission has yet to present its final report from its investigation.\n\nThe Commission's last investigation of a state aid affair, over the tax incentives offered to Airbus by the Netherlands, was in 2008.\n\nIn that matter, the Netherlands was found not to have acted in an anti-competitive manner and handed an €8.3 million fine.\n\nIreland, which is seeking to recruit more foreign direct investment in the financial services sector, has been at the forefront of efforts to address global concern about the level of corporate tax avoidance.\n\nThe Irish finance minister, Michael Noonan, said last month that the government's latest tax plan would involve a \"huge increase\" in corporate tax.",
      "It's no secret that I love coconut. I'm an obsessed with coconuts and have been since I first had one a little over six years ago. Since then, I've been experimenting with different ways to eat and use coconut. One thing I've learned about coconut, though, is that some recipes aren't all that great in the first place. Like, a lot of coconut's great uses aren't as good in baked goods. But then a coconut cake? Oh man, that thing is good. Even better than the good uses. So, my advice to my lovely readers, who might be looking for new coconut recipes, is to try this cake! The key to a good coconut cake is to use coconut that is at least semi-ripe. I mean when in doubt go for the good stuff! When making a coconut cake, you'll want to be sure that you are using semi-ripe, but not the sweet (yet) coconut creamers, which are usually the most bitter and unripe. Then your coconut needs to be cooked in batches. Once the coconut is done, you should be able to crumble it fairly easily into flour. (If you don't have coconut flour, just use rice flour in this recipe.)

      "An Israeli settler has stabbed three Palestinian men in a suspected revenge attack for earlier terror attacks that targeted Jews across the country.\n\nThe stabbing happened at a checkpoint just outside the West Bank city of Hebron on Monday, the Jerusalem Post reported.\n\nA Palestinian, 20-year-old Mahmoud Zayed, was in the midst of a knife attack at the checkpoint when a man in his mid-20s approached, stabbed him once in the shoulder and then slashed and stabbed another Palestinian man in the leg.\n\nZayed was able to reach for his phone and dial the police, and he was rushed to hospital by police. The 21-year-old Palestinian, who was lightly wounded in the attack, and who was not named in the reporting, was later released. The attacker, a resident of a Jewish settlement, was arrested.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Close\n\nThe attack came just hours after a Jewish man stabbed and seriously wounded a 16-year-old Palestinian boy in the city of Shuafat. The suspect was a resident of the ultra-Orthodox Jewish settlement of Neve Tzuf, according to a statement made by the Shin Bet, Israel's domestic security agency.\n\nThe attacker, from the ultra-Orthodox Yizhar settlement near Jerusalem, yelled \"God is great\" while attacking the Palestinian, who was left with light cuts to the upper part of his head, neck and torso. His condition was said to be stable.\n\nThe Israeli government has announced a sweeping expansion of Jewish settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, leading to heated clashes between Palestinians and Israelis as well as frequent clashes between Palestinians and Israeli forces in Palestinian towns and villages across the West Bank.\n\nIsrael captured the West Bank, East Jerusalem, Gaza Strip and the Golan Heights in 1967 and later annexed East Jerusalem, the West Bank, Gaza Strip and all Israeli settlements in the latter into \"Israel.\" The international community considers annexation an illegal move in violation of international law.\n\nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the attack, adding that the Palestinian attackers are \"scum\" and \"criminals.\"\n\nOn Monday, two Palestinian children were injured as the result of stabbing attacks across the country. In the northern West Bank city of Hebron, a 16-year-old boy who was seriously wounded after being assaulted and kicked by three Israelis was in the hospital.\n\nMeanwhile, in Jerusalem a 30-year-old Palestinian man was shot and killed in an attempted car-ramming attack by Israeli forces. The assailant opened fire and rammed his car into a police vehicle killing the man in what appeared to be a revenge attack for the spate of Israeli terror attacks.",

      "1.5K Shares Pin 1K\n\nOne of the most fascinating culinary mysteries is that, while many people know what is hot and what is not, it is rare to actually figure out whether a food is truly, positively, positively spicy. I mean, that can't be right, can it?\n\nOne such food is chili.\n\nIf you know what to do (read: if you know a guy who can cook), and have been working hard to increase your skills, you can easily make a tasty dish called chili. It consists of ground spices. To create chili, however, your kitchen should be filled to the brim (which it won't be). Therefore, your chili should include all the ingredients needed to make it.\n\nNow, let me give you a hint on how to know if chili is good or not. Simply cook it and eat it first. If you're eating it first, don't stop there and eat it as chili is a hot food. You know what I mean.\n\nNow that you have some experience with chili, it is time to learn how to make it! You'll need a few things, but I'll do my best to make it easy for you. Here's what you need:\n\nYou're going to need the following:\n\n1/2 cup dried ancho chiles (this can be pre-chopped if you want).\n\n2 tablespoons cumin seeds.\n\n3 ounces chipotle peppers on a stick.\n\n1 1/2 Teaspoons chili powder or a combination of spices. Note: If you like spice, you can use cayenne pepper.\n\n1 tablespoon garlic powder or a combination of garlic powders.\n\n1 teaspoon salt.\n\nA cup of fresh tomatoes.\n\nYou can get a great deal on cumin by heading to Amazon and searching \"cilantro cumin powder\" (this is a combination of 3 different cumin seeds).\n\nOr, you can also buy 1-2 cups of cumin seeds and grind it yourself (this is where you can find Chipotle Chili & Cilantro Seeds). I don't like using pre-ground cumin, but it is available if you have a need for it.\n\nNext, I add my diced tomatoes.\n\nThis is where you really decide who's cooking. Some people like their chili on the mild side, others want more heat. If you're not sure what heat means for you, the best way for me is to cook it for 3 hours to try a variety of dishes. If it's not what you like, it will still taste great; if it is, well…you will know right away. You are allowed to add any fresh veggies you may have on hand. It is best if you are able to cut off as much of the stem as possible, so you will be able to serve the chili without having pieces of tomato stuck all over it.\n\nIf you've followed these instructions to the letter, you're ready to go. It might take a few tries, but as long as you work hard to get the perfect chili, you will have a beautiful dish and a satisfied, satisfied belly.\n\nNow, you can also add your desired toppings. For a kick, add a chopped jalapeno and onion! For a sweetness, add sweet corn on the cob! Just follow the guidelines above and you are all set.\n\nIf you want to learn how to put this delicious chili into chili powder, be sure to watch this video tutorial:",
      "A recent study showed that the majority of our children are not prepared for future life challenges – for example, financial, housing and jobs. More than half of the respondents were 'at risk'.\n\nThe challenge lies both in improving the current learning system and in identifying and supporting the brightest people in society.\n\nTo address the problem, we recently launched a comprehensive report.\n\nWhat's more, we will be publishing a similar report every two years, with more details of the issues and opportunities in 2018.\n\nOur report will not only highlight our efforts to improve the performance levels, but also show how well we are doing.\n\nOur new report focuses on seven key areas of improvement:\n\nAccess to higher education\n\nEarly years\n\nHigher-level skills\n\nWork-based learning\n\nChild and youth development\n\nEmployment\n\nOur work on each of these areas will help us to identify opportunities to achieve greater returns in the next couple of years.\n\nAchievements\n\nOver the past five years, the proportion of 16-25 year olds with a higher quality Leaving Cert (C) has increased by 5 percentage points.\n\nFurthermore, last year it was the highest number of students ever to graduate from the high school cohort with the highest degree entry qualification.\n\nOur efforts now are aimed at improving the success of all our students, including those who have already been in higher education.\n\nImprovements\n\nIt is well known that the number of children with disabilities is increasing. They may have had a relatively difficult start to their lives.\n\nOur work on inclusion includes our work to ensure that all our students are supported, at home at school and later in life, regardless of their background.\n\nBetter access to higher education\n\nAn increasing number of new students are opting for a higher education course, a process which usually takes four years.\n\nMany find they have had a difficult start to their education because of the financial strain. We hope to reduce financial strain by ensuring we can deliver these students with the support they need at home, when they are still in year 12.\n\nWe are also working to improve access to higher education for parents of those who cannot afford it.\n\nOur programme of 'Better Living For All' aims to improve the lives of every young person every day by helping them grow the talents to earn themselves an education, and a career which is financially stable and secure.\n\nWhat we are doing\n\nThis year our first major intervention was to deliver our Higher Education Reform Programme.\n\nThe programme is designed to make universities more attractive places to apply. We are investing £15m of public money in five flagship universities – Oxford, Cambridge, Leeds, and Sheffield – to build the best teaching and learning environments for our students.\n\nIt's an exciting new stage in the Higher Education Revolution and is an important step towards closing the education sector's gender gap.\n\nWe are also working on the 'Better Living For All' initiative, which aims to improve the lives of all young people every day by helping them grow the talents to earn themselves an education, and a career which is financially secure and secure.\n\nIn addition to building the best teaching and learning environments, we're focusing on two key measures to improve student outcomes:\n\nOur 'Quality Standard' will apply to each student's higher education course, which will be assessed on their level of learning, experience, employability, and other qualities.\n\nInnovating 'Work-Based Learning'. It will be the first time in higher education that all students receive an extra £7 per hour per week through paid work experience.\n\nTo get a sense of just how big these initiatives really are, we have created a dashboard to show how these and other measures are impacting on student outcomes.\n\nIn addition to helping our learners, the programmes are producing tangible and tangible benefits.\n\nFor example, in 2013, more than 700 students were employed by a Higher Education Provider while undertaking an advanced placement or internship programme with a third party.\n\nOver the past three years, we're investing £11.8m of public money in an ambitious programme called 'Schooling for Life, based on the National Teaching and Learning Strategy'. This programme will ensure that schools have resources in place and tools to help students succeed and progress to higher education; while making our schools safer and stronger.\n\nOver the next couple of years, we will be investing the equivalent of £7.7m to extend the 'Schooling for Life' programme, which will see new resources and skills introduced to help parents understand and support their sons and daughters to succeed in education.\n\nIn future years, we will spend more than £70m in support of the programme. We believe this will be an example of well-targeted investment that can make a significant difference to hundreds of thousands of children and young people every year.\n\nOur work will also focus on the following:\n\nPromoting the values of learning and",
      "A federal judge has dismissed a lawsuit filed by the family of a man who was fatally shot in the back by Portland Police officers last year.\n\nU.S. District Court Judge Michael McShane said the family's lawsuit against three Portland officers who shot and killed Richard Mackunov in a Northeast Portland parking lot should be dismissed because the shooting occurred before Mackunov had the legal right to confront police.\n\nThe judge also said he had no choice but to dismiss the case in light of a state Supreme Court ruling. That ruling said that if an officer's use of force results in death or serious injury and that person was shot or otherwise killed while confronting an officer or another public official, the person is no longer responsible for making any statements to officers afterward. Mackunov died about seven months after the shooting.\n\nThe judge said he took into account the fact that the officers involved in the shooting did not immediately contact any medical services and Mackunov was in the parking lot of an apartment complex when he was shot.\n\nMcShane said the officers knew Mackunov was an armed and dangerous man and that at a later point they used deadly force to stop the threat.\n\nAfter the shooting, the officers gave conflicting accounts about where they saw the armed suspect, who was also known as K.F.M. The officers also told detectives that their own gunfire did not hit Mackunov.\n\nA lawyer for Mackunov's family, Andrew Clough, said the ruling is \"a very significant step\" and that he's confident that the officers will be held accountable.\n\n\"We hope that this case will have the deterrent effect that the family has always called for, and that is the ultimate accountability,\" Clough said in an email. \"That is what will ensure that nobody on their watch, particularly on their worst day, will ever again act in such a violent and abusive manner toward an unarmed public safety worker such as Officer Sean Williams.\"\n\nAt least one of the officers involved in the shooting was not available for comment, said police spokesman Sgt. Pete Simpson. An attorney for the officer, John Worthing, declined to comment.\n\nClough said he and his client will also be filing a civil lawsuit against the City of Portland for failing to address the officers' conduct.",

      "There once were two cities in this city: one that was good, and one that was not. It was said that it was the city of angels, and the city of men.\n\nHe looked at the city and saw it was good.\n\nHe looked at the place where the city was, and he heard a voice saying, \"This place is good.\"\n\n\nIt was good in the city of angels, where God had put his name.\n\nJesus said, \"What is this good place?\"\n\nAnd they asked, \"This is the city that brings out good, and makes people glad.\"\n\nHe looked at them and said, \"How well they are able to do what the Father has done.\"\n\n\nThey asked him, \"We have seen what your word does in us.\n\nTell us now about this good city.\"\n\n\nHe said, \"This not only is good, but it is the mother of your God, Jesus Christ, and God has given it to these people who come from your descendants.\n\nFrom it come the good of this world, and also the power to heal the sick and the righteous, and all other good things that there are in this world.\n\nThis is the good that is here, the city for which all of you were prophesied, and for which Jesus Christ was crucified\"\n\n\nAnd one day there was a sabbath day in the city, and the disciples came to Jesus and saw the tomb that was nearby, and they saw his body lying there.\n\n\nThey asked him, \"Does this tell us that he is alive?\"\n\nJesus answered them, \"How come you do not believe?\n\nHe who said, 'Here is my body,' was telling the truth, because there is no other place where one can be.\n\nDo not believe him who says there are many graves, because there are not many graves.\n\nOr do you not see the shroud of those who rose from the dead, for they also came out of their graves? \"\n\nWhen his disciples heard these things, they began to fear and say, \"Surely, something is wrong with him.\"\n\n\nPeter said to him in reply, \"Rabbi, you are the Son of God.

      "On Saturday, April 23, 2014 we saw the first episode of a new documentary series about the history of the San Marcos, TX-based Hays County School Board. Hays County School Board has been the focus of criticism for the way it implemented the state's Texas Equal Access Act, which made all districts in the State of Texas have to comply with equal access legislation, including sex-based restroom and locker room access. In the documentary, we learn of the \"Polly Boys Club' that the school board would have established and what caused the school board to get rid of its students and teachers who were fighting for the rights of their transgender students to be included in the sex-segregated areas in the girls' locker room.\n\nYou can check out the documentary \"Transgender Warriors: Who Will You Stand With?\" here:\n\nhttp://transgenderwarriors.tumblr.com/post/122401242950/transgender-warriors-who-will-you-stand-with\n\n\nhttps://youtu.be/q4Wy-jQCn9g I know that it is a lot to digest but I hope that you will watch this documentary that follows the Hays County school board as they fight against this law, in order to allow their transgender students to use the restrooms and locker rooms that align with their gender identities. I think that the \"Polly Boys Club,\" as the school board would refer to itself, is an extremely powerful way to educate the public regarding this issue and hopefully bring it to a head in the hopes that this issue can be rectified.

      "1. I'm Not the Only One\n\nIn this era of the Internet, where our entire existence depends on our ability to be connected to everyone else, it's been harder and harder to be alone. As in, not alone. But the Internet can be a big friend, too. When we get together with people from all over the world, we can feel very warm, like our closeness is a necessity. There's something soothing about those feelings of community.\n\n2. Friends Are People Too\n\nThe Internet has made it easier than ever to be friends on a deeper level. There's more information on your phone, so a whole group of people can be in one place, and you can always talk to a person who you like, and feel like it's a safe place to be yourself.\n\n3. People Are Just Like Us\n\nBecause the Internet exists, so do people. If you can connect with someone from another country who makes your life better, then why wouldn't you like someone from your own country? And that's not just because they like our songs and movies or clothes; we're not exactly the same either. In some cases, they'll have more money or are more attractive, so it makes sense to treat people as if they're like us so we can be happy together.\n\n4. We've Got Friends All Over the Place\n\nYou may be working online all the time, but maybe you don't have the best connections with your friends. You might prefer them over your coworkers and feel more comfortable talking to a friend than asking a stranger out on a date. For all we can learn about what makes people happy, how do we learn to have more of them?\n\n5. It's About More Than Friends\n\nBecause online it's possible to keep in touch with so many people and still feel like you're not alone, there can be loneliness when you're not having that easy time communicating online with your friends. On the other hand, there are also lots of benefits to being around people with similar tastes as you, and it doesn't hurt to be connected with those around you, either.",
      "On Friday, the federal government's top climate change scientist, Richard Black, announced it had withdrawn from the Global Warming Policy Foundation, the think-tank that employs him – an arrangement that has drawn sharp criticism of the federal government from both sides of the aisle.\n\nThis came just a week and a half after the group released a report saying the global warming \"pause\" may be \"due to natural oscillations that were not caused or affected by anthropogenic global warming\".\n\nIt is yet less than 48 hours after Mr. Black's resignation was announced, prompting outcry from climate change activists, who said the withdrawal showed the government was a \"climate denier's delight\". It is the second time in less than two years that the United States has severed ties with an Australian climate sceptic think-tank.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"This is quite remarkable and very concerning,\" said Chris Mooney, an editorial writer for The Guardian who was one of the first to raise the issue of Mr. Black's departure.\n\nThe Global Warming Policy Foundation released the report earlier this year and found \"there are strong indications of a cooling of the Northern Hemisphere\". It pointed to \"strong evidence\" that the change may be a natural cyclical phenomenon, \"not caused by human-induced warming.\"\n\nA day and a half before Mr. Black's resignation this week, the organisation published an email response from Greg Hunt, the Minister of Resources and Northern Australia. In a letter to the group, he expressed concern over Mr. Black's views and urged the organisation to be prudent about \"providing such advice to the government.\"\n\nIn a statement announcing Mr. Hunt's dismissal, the Department of Environment and Energy also noted \"this report was reviewed by senior Climate Change advisers and considered to be of substantial scientific and policy merit that clearly did not comply with relevant standards.\"\n\nMr. Black did not respond to a request for comment.\n\n\"What is really striking about a lot of these responses to climate change is how quickly you can throw someone under the bus,\" said Mr. Mooney, who added that he remains unconvinced that the pause exists. \"It's not a matter of if there will be further warming, but when.\"\n\nA spokesperson for Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said Friday \"it would not be appropriate to comment\" on the Global Warming Policy Foundation's conclusions. The spokesperson said the government values Australia's research and development ties with \"all nations.\"\n\nMr. Black has been a prolific critic of climate science who has repeatedly asserted the Earth's surface temperature had been warming for years when this wasn't true.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn July, he published a short piece to his home blog titled \"Pause: A Deliberate Deception, by a Team of Climate Change Deniers.\"\n\n\"The fact that the IPCC continues to accept their data as valid without question is itself an exercise in scientific fraud,\" he wrote.\n\nClimate change proponents have accused Mr. Black and others in Australian climate change politics of peddling out-of-date, climate change propaganda.\n\n\"It was a very sad day when Richard Black was made to resign from the organisation he has spent more than 25 years building up,\" said Richard Heede of the Climate Institute. \"It's a disgrace, particularly coming from a government that has a big role to play in addressing climate change.\"\n\n\"It is extremely embarrassing that a long-standing academic and political opponent is trying to destroy the credibility of the United Nations' climate science,\" said Professor Michael Mann.\n\nBut Mr. Turnbull, who announced on Thursday the government would be investing $150-million for a green bank and a $200-million research centre focused on renewable energy, said the group should have been more forthright in its report.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\"If there's one thing we will be more open to, it would be reports of the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] which have an error-laden record, which is, I think, inexcusable,\" he said.",
      "We've all been there. Maybe we're feeling down, we're bored, or we were just hanging out and needed someone to chat – and your Facebook friend immediately came up on our doorstep. But is it really okay for him to come over?\n\nWe've always prided ourselves with how accepting we were of everyone, and we pride ourselves that we never had a \"friend zone.\" But even if we were to accept every guy who came over, there are always going to be a handful of creepy guys who slip through the cracks, because the definition of \"creepy\" or \"manipulative\" has never really been defined by us. When you're talking with your friends about dating apps like Tinder, then maybe a guy who seems a bit too interested in you could be a potential problem because it'll be a whole new world for you. Plus, how many of those creepy guys would ever have given you the time of day before that moment of connection?\n\nAnd then there's the \"creep factor,\" which just won't go away. While on dates, most women have stories about some weirdo creep following them up the street or through the store or in the hallway as they're trying to walk into their friends' rooms to hang out. It can make you nervous just hearing the tales of the creepy on Tinder, as it is like the equivalent of someone trying to pick your pocket while you're on a date. If Tinder does say your date is a \"creep,\" you may feel even more of a responsibility toward the guy you're chatting with to not allow someone to come up to you. Because if any guy can ruin your night, it's that guy.\n\nSo where do you stand when a guy walks up on you and looks at you, you immediately go in for a kiss, and he pulls away when you get in his way? Or does he say all of this, or doesn't do anything even when you politely ask? If you're a woman of any gender, then you are likely to end up on a date with someone who is creeped out by you.\n\nWhat kind of creeps are acceptable on Tinder?\n\n\"Creepy\" creeps are a thing.\n\nHere's everything you need to know about some of the more common \"creepy\" types of guys you may encounter on Tinder, from the kind you want to have on a date to the kind you think may just be a serial killer.\n\nThe \"I'm trying-to-be-creepy\" creep\n\nYou've heard this one. Or you know a man you're chatting with who just can't quit his eyes. He's just so intent on saying he has your picture/photo ID/username, he makes you feel like he's staring right into your soul.\n\nDon't be that guy. It's fine to say, \"Cool pictures, where are you from?\" or \"Hi I'm a football player, would you rather win… or date?\" and get to know who the person is and what they do before you get creeped out. Just don't take off your hoodie or ask the person to take a selfie with you if their eyes are locked on you. He gets it, it's just weird. And it's easy for him to blame it on you if his eyes are fixated.\n\nThe \"I will never stop staring\" creep\n\nIf he keeps following you, and he stares into your eyes long after you ask him to stop, it could be a case of \"I stare into your eyes too much and cannot decide to either not do it to you or to do it anyway.\" I'm not saying you have to let him get away with it, but just be aware of the guy's creepy habits so he'll know to keep his eyes away from yours.\n\nThe \"I'm staring and will never stop\" creep\n\nSome guys are simply looking a bit too long, or just staring longer than they need to. It's okay to get a little concerned or creeped out. It's a perfectly normal response for you to look into the man's eyes for a split second, as you're scanning the area, thinking if he will take off once he gets your contact information. Then once you get the \"I'm gonna go take a drink\" text or swipe right button (but not because you're concerned.)\n\nThe \"I'm just interested\" creep\n\nSome guys are going to be pretty upfront, but others are not. There are a lot of guys who make things too clear that they're just interested in you, and they might seem like they are very much like a friend that just wants to get to know you a bit to have a conversation about something. They're just trying to get you interested and might come on more as a \"casual friend\" than as a boyfriend. You still want to check out if they're going to have an actual relationship with you, because you're going to be stuck with",
      "After the US and Cuba announced a thaw in relations earlier this month, the question on many Cuban-Americans' lips was clear: When will Congress allow American tourists to visit Cuba?\n\n\"I would welcome a visit of a couple dozen\" Americans \"to show them how much better life is there,\" said Roberto Gonzalez, a lawyer in Miami who has been living in Cuba most of his life. \"But I also think our country should be able to make more money on the sale of our petroleum.\"\n\n\"I would like to see if we could build a casino in Cuba,\" agreed Jose Diaz Rivera, a businessman in Miami. \"I was surprised when the President announced the thaw and how relaxed things have been.\"\n\nThe thaw in the US-Cuba relationship could mean the opening of access to US vacation areas like the Caribbean islands of St. Thomas, the Turks and Caicos Islands and Puerto Rico, in addition to Florida.\n\nIn Cuba itself, many Cubans are welcoming the decision because it gives them an opportunity to make money and travel freely.\n\nUS-Cuba relations got off in dramatic fashion in 2011 when US President Barack Obama announced he wanted to reestablish diplomatic ties with the island after more than 50 years, after a previous diplomatic thaw that began in 1961.\n\nBut the thaw has been slow in coming.\n\nUnder pressure from anti-Castro Cuban exiles in Florida, Congress for the past four years has refused to reapprove a law that allowed Americans to travel to Cuba. Obama announced the beginning of the thaw on Nov. 20, calling it \"an historic step forward.\" The White House has promised the American tourist traffic will surge to $1.5 billion in this fiscal year.\n\nIt's likely that by the end of this year, US tourists from the six countries will be able to travel to Cuba on government-to-government tourist tour, along with their families.",
      "Lebanese soldiers walk in front of the Syrian-Israeli border. Ashraf Amra APA images\n\nThere are no signs of life inside Syria. This is why, in an attempt to stop Hezbollah's military incursion into Lebanon, Israel has begun bombing Hezbollah positions on Lebanese soil, particularly those near the Syrian border.\n\nIn the last week alone, Israeli air force raids killed at least four Hezbollah combatants and an Israeli soldier, according to the Israeli army. Most of the wounded were taken in for treatment in Israel.\n\nThe Israeli army calls their target, \"Hizballah, Hezbollah's military wing in southern Lebanon.\" Hezbollah is a Shia militia and political faction that took up arms against Israel in 2006.\n\nIsrael has made the same accusations against the Syrian regime, accusing them of using Iranian-made weapons to target civilians in an airstrike against a UN-licensed relief organization, the Violation Documentation Center in Syria, near Aleppo.\n\nThis week's bombing of villages near the Syrian border and the death of two Hezbollah fighters is reminiscent of Israel's bombing of Southern Lebanon in 2006, which killed at least 1,200 civilians and left 1,700 wounded.\n\n\"Hizballah is a proxy for Iran; it's a Shia militia that Israel has to confront and oppose,\" said Ilan Goldenberg, a former military analyst for Israel Defense Forces who is now a security counselor.\n\n\"It's quite a striking escalation,\" said Ben White, an independent terrorism researcher who has worked in the Middle East. \"Their aim is to stop Hezbollah expanding its operations in Lebanon and Syria.\"\n\nThe Israeli army had not responded to The Electronic Intifada's requests for comment in the time frame they were available.\n\nBut in an interview with Haaretz journalist Ari Shavit, Lt. Col. Ofer Winter, commander of the Golani Brigade, told Shavit, \"We cannot stand it as long as Hezbollah uses Syrian soil to attack us on these fronts.\"\n\nThe army launched its first incursions into Syria against Hezbollah targets in May. Since then it's carried out more than 1,000 airstrikes while its aircraft have targeted Lebanese civilians and even Hezbollah targets in Syria.\n\nIn fact, the Israeli army's use of military force in Syria and Lebanon, which it calls \"operations against the terrorists,\" has a long tradition.\n\nWhen Israel carried out its initial assault on Lebanon in 1982, Israeli bombers destroyed a military compound in South Lebanon after a suicide car bomber targeted an army compound near Amman.\n\nThe Israeli bombing campaign in Lebanon, called Operation Peace for Galilee, killed thousands of Lebanese civilians and forced a nearly 15-year stalemate.\n\nThere have only been a handful of Hezbollah fatalities in Israel, including the killing of two of the group's suicide bombers by a Mossad team in 1994, according to Israel's national security website. While Hezbollah has suffered high number of casualties in the Israeli raids, its political leadership and fighters have managed to evade the Israeli strike and continue terrorizing civilians in Lebanon.\n\nYet Israel's targeting of Lebanon has not come without controversy.\n\nThe killing in April of the Hezbollah commander Hassan Nasrallah, who was the group's military chief and was widely hailed as the architect of Hezbollah's current military strategy, sparked international concern.\n\nIsrael has been targeting Hezbollah bases outside Lebanon as well, including on the Syrian side of the border in the town of Qunaitera.\n\nDespite concerns by international law and human rights groups, Israel says its attacks cannot be attributed to retaliation for the recent bombing because Syria didn't retaliate. Last month, Israel also admitted that Hezbollah has infiltrated Israel, suggesting that the group's fighters are now moving closer to Israel than they have been in the past.\n\n\"That is what we are most concerned about,\" said Goldenberg, when asked if Israel now views Syria as an adversary. Israel could, of course, be retaliating against Hezbollah for the latest missile attack on Israeli towns.\n\nThat said, Goldenberg said the recent attacks have caused concern in Israel.\n\n\"The only country that we see as a threat in the region, that is a direct threat to us, I think, is Iran,\" he said.\n\nThere is some hope that there could be less fighting between Hezbollah and Israel in the near future.\n\nLast month, the Lebanese parliament voted to allow Israelis to live, work and study in Lebanon. Lebanese President Michel Aoun also announced a plan to allow 500 Jews to immigrate annually from Israel between 2013 and 2017.\n\nThese moves are aimed at stopping the stream of Israelis who choose to live in Lebanon, a country where the Jewish community is mostly Jewish, but where Sunni Arab Muslims do make up a majority of the population. As Israel's largest minority, Jews are barred by law from immigrating to Lebanon, where they can risk a backlash from locals.\n\nIsrael has also begun to provide humanitarian aid to the refugees of Syria, who are trying",

The appellants have had substantial success in obtaining such advice and the advice involved this disclosure of a substantial part of the appellant's financial circumstances and of the nature of a significant investment in land. In the appellants' words their success at obtaining these confidential services has involved:\n\n\"a substantial reduction in the appellant's taxable income in order to achieve a level of compliance which is in the national interest; and the disclosure of confidential information to the applicant which materially affects its future operations at the appellant's establishment\"; and,\n\n\"the disclosure of information to or about the applicant which, had it been disclosed in the normal course, would have induced him to resign his employment\".\n\n3 The parties disagreed as to the legal validity of the provisions that were challenged. The appellants' challenge, based in part on the s 99A provisions, was supported by affidavits from Mr Burt J, Mr Ritchie and Mr Drennan. The appellant's challenge, based in part on the Taxation Administration Act 1961, was made on the basis that under s 99A the relevant provisions violated the appellant's privacy rights by interfering with his ability to determine how the information would be used and disclosed. Mr Bourke, the appellant's tax adviser, was a witness for the appellants.\n\n4 Pursuant to s 99A for information in relation to the applicant's operations is an offence. It is also an offence to disclose such information where an offence under the Taxation Administration Act 1961, or another law, applies, to a person whose identity is known to the disclosure party in relation to the information in question under s 99A(2). The offences referred to in s 99A(6), such as the operation of s 5(2) of the Taxation Administration Act, are offences under the Taxation Administration Act 1961, as is the operation of s 5(1) of that Act in relation to the information or information being disclosed. In order to obtain orders under ss 99A(1)(a) and (d) an affidavit made by the disclosure party is required. There is no need to obtain any such declaration where an offender is in proceedings before the court, or is, by virtue of a recognizance, placed under recognizance. The appellant sought orders under ss 99A(5) and (6). It is also an offence under ss 39D, 39E and 39G to commit a breach of any of these provisions.\n\n5 The appellants contended that the operation of ss 99A(5) and (6) was inconsistent with the provisions of the Taxation Administration Act that allow disclosure of such information to persons who can legitimately rely on its veracity for a substantial purpose other than taxation, and s 99A(2) of the Act provides that the disclosure must be made to be of assistance and no other purpose. The appellants did not seek any direction as to what purpose those other purposes should be served by the disclosure. In any event s 99A(6) made provision only to the extent of the application of the relevant provisions. That section did not preclude or restrict other provisions of the Act.\n\n6 A number of authorities support the interpretation of the relevant provisions that I adopt. Section 39A(4) is concerned with disclosure to the Commissioner of Taxation. The provision makes it an offence for any person to make a disclosure of information in relation to which s 39A(4) is a contravention.\n\n7 On its face the provisions of s 99A and the relevant provisions of the Taxation Administration Act, including the s 39B provisions make it an offence for an accountant to advise the practitioner in respect of his or her compliance with the section or the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, not only for the purpose of assisting the practitioner to advise him or her to comply with the section, but also to advise the practitioner to advise the Commissioner in relation to the tax matters which are the subject of the advice. Subsection (2) of that section says that information about an auditor's advice is disclosed to the Commissioner for the purposes \"of the assessment of his or her compliance with this section\". The appellant submitted that the operation of the provision is inconsistent with the operation of s 39B of the Income Tax Assessment Act, as in that Act, it is an offence to give information to the Commissioner of Taxation so that the Commissioner might",
      "A year after the death of a transgender teen after a car accident, the family of 15-year-old Katelyn Nicole are considering legal action against TransLink after a security guard prevented his body from being transported to a funeral home.\n\nThe body of Katelyn, a trans girl, was cremated and her ashes scattered at Port Moody with no mention of her gender identity.\n\nKatelyn, who was 16, was at the wheel of her mother's car Oct. 14, 2013 when it plunged into a ditch in the middle of a busy intersection in Port Moody after hitting a pedestrian. The car landed several feet off the road and landed on its roof near a fence, where it crushed another two individuals. Katelyn died at the scene and later died at hospital three days later from her injuries.\n\nHer parents discovered that Katelyn had gender identity disorder after her death and wanted a proper funeral for her. According to Katelyn's parents' Facebook post about the death and funeral plans, Katelyn's ashes will be cremated and her body returned to her parents after an autopsy is conducted. The family's lawyer, David Allen, said that was never part of the original plan for the funeral.\n\n\"They do not want a funeral that resembles a typical funeral,\" Allen said. \"They are not seeking a traditional funeral.\"\n\nAllen said the family has not ruled out the possibility of filing a claim against TransLink, though they plan to discuss this further.\n\nTransLink has now agreed to hold a funeral for Katelyn's body but is refusing to allow it to be cremated, according to Allen.\n\nBut Katelyn's transgender friends in Port Moody say the family's request to do anything different is ridiculous and in violation of their civil rights.\n\nBryan Smith-Gander said he and Katelyn would often go out together when in high school or on their \"boy trips\" to the beach.\n\n\"She was always a confident person who never let people stop her from what she wanted, which was to be herself,\" said Smith-Gander. \"So to have someone decide that she's not, I guess that's unfair to her. It's their funeral and they can do what they want.\"\n\nSmith-Gander said he and Katelyn had a lot of friends in common and would enjoy going out as friends. He was also upset that TransLink wouldn't allow them to have the body of Katelyn's friend Kaitlyn to represent them at their own funeral rather than a transgender friend.\n\nBut Smith-Gander said he understood how the family feels and would understand if a transgender friend's body is used. For Katelyn's family, it also means the body of a trans woman will never be returned to her parents after her death.\n\n\"I see it as kind of hypocritical,\" Smith-Gander said.\n\nAccording to TransLink's statement at the time of Katelyn's death, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) and the BC Coroners Service (BCCS) provided the \"first priority in the case of a missing adult.\"\n\nAccording to TransLink's statement of facts, Katelyn's body was discovered by police after an ambulance was called to a gas station in Port Moody around 5 p.m. Oct. 14, 2013. The body, which was located in the driveway behind the home, had been removed from the vehicle by police officers and transported to a BCCS station for an autopsy.\n\n\"Once it was identified that the person was a minor, Transport Security Services officers had to take custody of the body for the investigation and then return it to a designated location. This took approximately 30 minutes,\" TransLink said in the statement of facts.\n\nTransLink is bound by the federal government's Trans Pass, which requires all passengers entering or leaving Canada to present a valid identification, including a drivers' licence and passport, at any time of the day or night. TransLink said the adult passenger had to be checked in with the passenger drop-off/pick-up area at the airport before the passenger's car was escorted into a secure area for a passenger drop-off.\n\nThe security guard who checked Katelyn's belongings at the airport was not the person who checked her out of the terminal.\n\nAllen said as to the TransPass' legality and necessity, \"TransLink is under no obligation to have any sort of ID that they check you into transit.\"\n\nTransLink said if anything was missing it was just a bag that contained her personal effects for the funeral.\n\nKatelyn's friends were told during the summer they had until the end of last week to submit all their materials to TransLink. The last minute was used to collect Katelyn's clothes to send to her family.\n\n\"The fact that this was made all so rushed and in their own rush and out for publicity, that's just not",

      "From the time one knows one's name, one lives through and with each new day - one's heart beats with anticipation and fear. All of us live in fear of death. It is the ultimate burden in that which is so most dear to our most precious existence. It has been said \"when the days got long, I used to say I had only eight days left to live; it was no longer a fear, but an expectation\" – Robert Frost. If we take these thoughts and emotions along with some great music to help us remember, we can remember all too well our life's journey as we prepare for one day coming to a close.\n\n\"When you see your life passing before your very eyes, You'll be sure you've only gone six paces... You're a living poem – it's time to start another.\" ~ William Carlos Williams\n\nThe Song's Meaning and History\n\nThis song reminds us that we can never change the past. \"We all know the days when we'll die. Every time we look on life, The way it is, every day is dying – Every breath we take, our time is running out… And this is for all your life, the same way death is.\" ~ John Lennon\n\n\"When you're ready,\n\nPut your head down,\n\nAnd sing your song.\" ~ Bruce Springsteen\n\nThe Theme and Meaning of the Song\n\nThe lyrics of \"When the Days Get Long\" are very simple. They express the song's core emotion. The main theme for \"When the Days Get Long\" is the notion that we cannot change the past. We can, however, learn from the mistakes that have been made. The only way out of the cycle of life is by changing what is happening. This message is very powerful.\n\nAlthough the lyric doesn't say this directly, the meaning of this song has been found in ancient Hebrews and is well-known to most. The meaning of \"days of your life\" is something so important to our individual soul and purpose that it can be summed up and stated simply:\n\n\"You will live, though your days be many:\n\nYour days will be as long as the sun,\n\nAnd your days as bright as the morning mist,\n\nAnd the days in between shall be a misty night.\" ~ Isaiah 51:10–11\n\nThe Song with a Message Behind it, or Why Does Life Even Exist?\n\nThe \"Days of Your Life\" and the song itself may sound like simple, everyday topics and yet, to most, they have some incredibly important messages.\n\nIn the world, the vast majority of people are completely oblivious to our purpose. They see our lives as routine and mundane. Their lives are devoid of meaning - the life is completely meaningless. That is why it is so important to have spiritual, sacred, and sacred writings about life of any kind. The Song is one such example of such.\n\nMany who do not have the ability to be aware of their purpose or spiritual awakening are unaware that there is anything going on beyond their own perception. They are unaware of the world around them. Acknowledging that life has a purpose is very profound. The Song, however, is not just a simple hymn of praise to God but it tells one of its main themes: that what is going on is so profoundly significant that it does not just affect one's personal life, but a world where it is necessary for everyone to be mindful. This song serves as a lesson on where we are, who we are, and what is going on. It is a song that you can sing each and every day as a reminder of yourself and of your purpose.\n\nLyrics\n\nI've been a busy man lately\n\nSo I had to forget all my hopes\n\nAs the clock ticked,\n\nA day in time flies by\n\nAnd just when I was going to give up\n\nThe days get long\n\nIt's just another day\n\nIt takes time to grow old\n\nIt's time to say good night\n\nNo one is perfect,\n\nNo one is good enough\n\nI think of all the things I want to give\n\nOf all the things that I have to leave behind\n\nForget all of this and say goodbye\n\nI'll try to hold on till I can't stand it any more\n\nI'll try to make a place for myself\n\nI hope to make an effort\n\nTo look around and smile the same way I used to\n\nBut the days are long\n\nI feel my time will pass by the day\n\nThe days get longer every day\n\nAs time goes by my hope grows\n\nAs day becomes night\n\nI think about every life that passed me by\n\nAs the days get long\n\nSo much for hope in the end\n\nWhen you see your life passing before your very eyes,\n\nYou'll be sure",
      "[This is a new weekly blog post. For previous blog posts, see my archives.]\n\nA few days ago, I had the pleasure of getting to spend some time with Matt and Travis Johnson, the co-founders of OCamllang. I've been following their progress to great interest since they recently raised more than 15 million dollars in venture capital from venture capitalists to build the first commercial OCaml language, and I'm now glad I finally got a chance to visit their house in the suburbs of Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nThere is so much that I'm proud of with OCaml, and I'm going to go on a bit of a tear here to tell you everything I see and everything I think I believe!\n\n1. OCaml is more powerful\n\nIn my opinion, the most useful thing about OCaml is that it's more powerful than any other language I know of that's been used to develop programs today. The language provides a large number of tools to make the development of software even more fun on the Unix platform, it does a fantastic job of supporting type inference and provides excellent library support.\n\nIf you're a C/C++ programmer, you get all of the benefits of having a statically typed language (static, as opposed to dynamic, for C), you get the excellent performance you expect, and you get easy code generation. The tool chain that we use to build OCaml for our desktop languages in the past is about 40x more powerful than the tool chain we use to build OCaml for the Unix platform: if you had to rebuild your entire toolchain every time you wanted to deploy someone's program or have someone contribute to the OCaml ecosystem, it would not be possible.\n\nThe OCaml world is small and vibrant and growing up quickly, which is good for us.\n\n2. OCaml is a solid language\n\nFrom the very early days when I discovered functional programming and OCaml in 1994, OCaml continued to move through an ever expanding set of features. It now offers fully functional programming, the possibility of a full type-indexed representation of expressions, partial application, multiple return values, recursive functions, higher order functions, and much more. The quality of implementations of these features in the wild is remarkable: OCaml is the first languages ever to be developed that have both the expressive power of an early functional language and the robust and efficient nature of a current high-level object-oriented language.\n\n3. OCaml allows for the creation of a full compiler\n\nThe biggest single reason this is such a great language is that it allows programmers to write programs that are compiled to executable programs. We use OCaml's compiler to generate byte codes for some of our operating systems and to build a runtime system around them. This gives us complete control over the performance characteristics of applications we write, since the compiler can provide complete optimizations for the parts of the application that actually run.\n\n4. OCaml is not just a syntax sugar\n\nMany people confuse the use of \"syntax-sugar\" with semantics-sugar. Many people think of syntactic sugar as the addition of new syntax that's only meaningful in certain places within a program. The use of syntax-sugar in the OCaml language is mostly a means of expressing concepts (such as pattern-matching) that are not directly related to the semantics of the language.\n\nSome programmers argue that syntax-sugar is a means of adding expressive power to programs, which is true even for programs written in higher-order functional languages, but to me, syntax-sugar is much more related to concatenations of symbols that can be used to express concepts that are not immediately related to the semantics of the language (in the sense of \"this program is correct but I don't care too much about what the semantics of it are\").\n\n5. OCaml is the right tool for the right problem\n\nMy personal view is that each of the languages listed above is a good fit for a different set of problems. I've found that the most useful part of OCaml's strengths is its versatility. It can be used to develop any sort of software that's not fundamentally \"object oriented\": web applications, network clients, databases, etc.\n\nWhat I've learned over the past few years is that when you start coding your first C program, you're usually going to be unhappy with code that doesn't require any data to be read on the stack before it can be executed. So how do you get data to have a meaningful meaning in your program? By making it as close to garbage as possible. The OCaml community has been pushing this idea for several years now: data on the stack has been eliminated from OCaml code. This has the effect of drastically shrinking the size of the compiled executable that comes out, which dramatically speeds up the compiler while reducing the size of the resulting execut",

      "After my second round of the US Open last week, I had a chance to talk with two of the players and coaches who had helped guide me through my second career as a professional tennis player: Nick Bollettieri, the former ATP pro star and the father of Andy Bollettieri, and former American women's tennis coach Jim Payne.\n\nWith the United States now being represented by two women's U.S. Open men's champions, and a British star in Serena Williams, what can we learn from their experiences during their tennis careers to help other girls get back to tennis as quickly, cleanly, and without pain during their young tennis career?\n\nHere are the questions I had them answer. A transcript of the full interview is after the jump.\n\nHow do you think Andy and Nick's experiences as high-level female athletes helped them during their tennis careers?\n\nNick:\n\nWell, I think Nick and Andy are extremely smart people and as smart as a lot of us are. They probably learned their value early on.\n\nHaving experienced everything from the first few months of college to the high stakes of this year's US Open, I think they have a lot of great strategies to utilize during their careers.\n\nAndy:\n\nThey both kind of had to be strong women of course. It takes a lot more than having good legs and good hips to get your career off the ground. Being that they were both smart people, they weren't afraid of learning, and they got to where they were because they had to learn through trial and error.\n\nWhen I was 18, I really didn't know what I was doing, at all, but when I got to the finals of the USGA tournament I had done everything the right way and had been playing right from the get go.\n\nThey both did something similar to me, but it was a little different in that theirs was a lot tougher in terms of where they had to learn from because tennis is such a big sport!\n\nIt is such a big, intense, physical sport that in order to succeed you have to understand the fundamentals of what is going on.\n\nHaving Andy and Nick's experiences and knowledge around tennis helps them navigate the physical pain, mentally the mental pain, as well as the competitive pain. This helps them go out and perform extremely well at any time of the year whether that is junior or high school or college!\n\nWhat do you think has helped these two guys get from where they started, to where they are now and do you think they could have done any differently on their tennis journey?\n\nNick:\n\nI think we look at tennis as an entertainment and they've learned that. I think they are both great entertainers on the court as well as off the court.\n\nI definitely think that being a little bit more athletic allows them to have a larger canvas to paint on; they get to go outside of themselves in a good way.\n\nAndy:\n\nThey have two-ways where they are able to have access to that outside, because a lot of their education and their background was about the game [laughs].\n\nI think they could have taken different paths, but they have always kind of been able to be like the two-way entertainers on the court as well as off the court.\n\nWhen I went off and competed in the junior tour, I had a lot of success. When Andy was younger, he didn't have that same success in the junior tour. That's not to say that he wasn't talented, but I think he had a slower way to achieve his goal.\n\nI think they both have the skillset to do what they need to do to get to that goal.\n\nThere are other athletes, whether they be female or male, who have the talent and the knowledge to go the opposite way as Nick and Andy did and be just as successful as they are and maybe a lot faster.\n\nIf they had the chance to take the same path that Nick and Andy did, I think they could have turned into great tennis players.\n\nWho is more difficult for them mentally, Andy or Nick? What are their strategies to getting back on the court after each has given up tennis after their collegiate and WTA careers?\n\nNick:\n\nNick I think has more of an overall understanding that just keeps him pushing harder. From a mental standpoint, obviously the fact that he is now the professional athlete and can have his parents to bounce things off of, that just helps him.\n\nFrom the perspective of Nick and Andy, it really is based mainly on the things they put their head to when they are trying to get back on court.\n\nBecause I know both of their parents really well, and they have been such strong advocates for both of them in that area, there was never any real issue with either of them not being able to do what they felt needed to be done.\n\nThey went out and put their head",

      "The World's Oldest Coffee Planting is in a French Forest\n\nRaphael and Rose are the main coffee plantation owners in Menton-Blague and they are passionate about coffee. They planted their first coffee seeds in the forest in 1983, so when they founded the French Crop Development Agency (CAD) they wanted to do our coffee planting as the beginning of a new coffee enterprise in the world's oldest coffee growing area.\n\nThe trees they planted in this region of the forest are over 50 year old. This is very unusual for this region of France: it is known for the younger and smaller trees here.\n\nMenton-Blague is at an altitude of up to 3,300 meters. At these high altitudes the roots are constantly being pulled towards the earth, and this produces a very different growth pattern: older and bigger trees.\n\nThis means that our trees produce higher levels of flavor and color, so a new coffee plant in Menton-Blague is usually bigger and higher than older trees. Even the coffee trees in Menton-Blague have older roots, which make them produce a stronger taste.\n\nAfter the harvest the trees are moved to another part of the forest and we let them grow for another 10 years before we plant new coffee trees. In order to plant new coffee we first need to find a new farm to work with. The French Crop Development Agency's mission is to bring new agriculture to France and we are very happy to have found a farm as good as the one we work with.\n\nAfter we harvest the coffee, the coffee is brought to the farm to cure for about four weeks and then put in bags, where it stays for another seven months, during which time the process of roasting is repeated several times. This is all done for $10 per kilo.\n\nThis has never happened before in the world at all and it is very expensive. You get the money for the coffee, but there are costs associated with creating the process behind the cups of coffee, from developing a process and making coffee for the first time to developing a market so you can sell coffee to people in your own home area.\n\nIt costs about $1,500 dollars to create a cup of coffee at home. By spending that much money on making coffee the farmer still pays to own the coffee plant and all the equipment and the coffee, so he still has the full responsibility of producing the coffee, which in France it is very difficult to do.\n\nBut with our process the farmer pays nothing.\n\nThat means, after spending the farmer's earnings he gets $5 per kilo of beans produced with our process. He still pays for the coffee, but he has all the profit potential at the end of production. We think that is very important.\n\nThis process produces all our premium coffees. When we do the process right, it turns out to be one of the richest ways for producing coffee in the world. Of course, it has a cost and we pay for it. But when you brew a cup of coffee the coffee is the money, and you don't want to miss out on all the money you can make.\n\nWith our processes, we can produce a really top-quality coffee in small quantities. Because of the complexity and the costs of developing a process, it is very hard and time consuming, like many things in our business, and very costly. But that is the beauty of this business.\n\nThat is why the World's Oldest Coffee Planting needs your support: It is the start of our whole business. We hope that by raising a lot of the money we need, you will help us open our coffee farm in France and help us raise the level of coffee in the world as much as possible. We hope you will feel empowered and comfortable in our process and will be able to support our work and our farmers.\n\nThanks,\n\nRebecca, Rose and Raphael\n\nFrench Crop Development Agency",

      "Well, you need to use force, for example, to pull it out.  Luckily, there are a couple of methods you can use to remove food that are useful.\n\nFirst, you can just use a mouth guard.  These are devices that are similar to a mouthpiece, but smaller and less formal.  They are usually made of rubber or foam, and can be placed between your teeth and remove some of the food.  If it’s difficult to remove the food because the mouth guard isn’t helping you, you can also consider using a wet cloth.  These are typically a bit more elaborate, since someone can take them to a dentist to treat the problem.  But also, if the food is stuck in your teeth, it’s usually best to avoid using too much force, since an excessive grip creates a greater risk of injury.\n\nSome other potential techniques for removing food stuck in your teeth include:\n\n-A spoon.  A spoon is a small plastic implement that you can use to press down on some force, and just pick up and move your mouth.  This works better if there is some space between your teeth for the spoon to grasp the food.\n\n-To get the rest of the food, you can bite down with an angle toothpaste.  Or maybe something like a special paste designed for dental foods.  After that, you can just pull the food out by grabbing it with your fingers, with your mouth guard still in place.\n\n-You can also use a soft toothbrush.  If a food is getting very stuck, you can soak it and use a brush to brush away the loose particles.  Then, as your mouth guard is now removed, you’ll need a hammer, preferably hard, to remove it.",

We would also need to be able to preserve the brain and keep it functioning after it has been removed from the original body.\n\n\n\nThere are many scientific and technological challenges that would need to be overcome in order to achieve this, and it is not clear if it will ever be possible. Additionally, even if we could switch our brains to new bodies, it is not certain that we would be able to preserve our memories, personality, and other aspects of our identity.\n\n\n\nIn short, while the idea of switching our brains to new bodies might seem appealing, it is not something that is currently possible and may never be possible.",
      "Our taste preferences are influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, cultural and social influences, and individual experiences.\n\nGenetics play a role in determining certain aspects of our taste preferences, such as whether we are more sensitive to certain tastes or flavors. For example, some people are more sensitive to the bitterness of certain foods, while others may be more sensitive to sweet or sour tastes.\n\nCultural and social influences also play a role in shaping our taste preferences. The foods and flavors that are common in the culture we grew up in can influence what we like to eat. For example, if you grew up in a culture where spicy food is common, you may be more likely to enjoy spicy flavors than someone who grew up in a culture where spicy food is not as common.\n\nIndividual experiences can also shape our taste preferences. For example, if you had a positive experience eating a particular food, you may be more likely to enjoy that food in the future. Similarly, if you had a negative experience with a food, you may be less likely to enjoy that food in the future.\n\nOverall, our taste preferences are a combination of many different factors, including genetics, cultural and social influences, and individual experiences.",
      "The autobahn in Germany is a network of highways that does not have a general speed limit. This means that there are certain sections of the highway where drivers are allowed to go as fast as they want, as long as it is safe to do so.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that not all parts of the autobahn have no speed limit. Some sections, particularly in urban areas or near construction sites, may have temporary or permanent speed limits in place for safety reasons. Additionally, all drivers are required to follow traffic laws and drive safely, regardless of the posted speed limit.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that having no speed limit does not mean that drivers should always drive as fast as possible. In fact, it's important for drivers to use their own judgement and drive at a speed that is safe and appropriate for the current road conditions.",
      "To find the dollar amount that, when adding the Massachusetts sales tax of 6.25%, equals $200, you can use the following formula:amount = 200 / (1 + (tax rate / 100))Plugging in the values for Massachusetts, we get:amount = 200 / (1 + (6.25 / 100))amount = 200 / 1.0625amount = 188.1047So the dollar amount that, when adding the Massachusetts sales tax, equals $200 is approximately $188.10. Note that this is just an approximation, as the actual amount may vary slightly due to rounding.",
      "There are many reasons why people might not save a larger portion of their income. Some of the most common include:High expenses: Some people may have high expenses, such as rent or a mortgage, that leave little room in their budget for saving.Debt: People who have a lot of debt may feel that they need to use most of their income to pay off their debts, rather than saving.Short-term thinking: Some people may prioritize short-term goals and desires, such as buying a new car or going on a vacation, over saving for the future.Lack of financial knowledge: Some people may not understand the importance of saving or may not know how to effectively save their money.Lack of discipline: It can be difficult for some people to consistently set aside a portion of their income for saving, especially if they face financial challenges or unexpected expenses.Low income: Some people may simply not have enough income to save after paying for their basic needs and expenses.",
      "Stock splits and dividends can both affect the price of options.A stock split occurs when a company increases the number of outstanding shares by issuing more shares to current shareholders. For example, if a company does a 2-for-1 stock split, each shareholder will receive an additional share for every share they own. This effectively halves the price of each share.The effect of a stock split on the price of options depends on the type of option and the terms of the split. Generally, the price of call options will decrease by a proportional amount to the decrease in the price of the underlying stock. For example, if a stock with a current price of $100 per share splits 2-for-1, the price of the stock will decrease to $50 per share, and the price of call options on the stock should also decrease by about 50%. The price of put options may also be affected by a stock split, but the effect is more complicated and may depend on the terms of the split.Dividends are payments made by a company to its shareholders out of its profits. When a company announces that it will be paying a dividend, the price of the stock is likely to decrease by an amount equal to the value of the dividend on the ex-dividend date, which is the date on which the stock begins trading without the right to receive the dividend. The price of call options may decrease by a proportional amount to the decrease in the price of the underlying stock, while the price of put options may increase by a similar amount.It's important to note that these are generalizations and the actual effect of a stock split or dividend on the price of options can vary depending on a variety of factors.",
      "It's difficult to give a definitive answer without more information about your specific circumstances and goals. However, here are some general considerations to take into account when deciding whether to pay cash, finance, or lease a car:Paying cash: If you have the financial resources to do so, paying cash for a car may be a good option. This can help you avoid paying interest on a loan and may also allow you to negotiate a lower price for the car. However, paying cash may also tie up a large amount of money that you could potentially invest elsewhere.Financing for 0.9%: If you don't have enough money to pay for the car in cash and need to borrow money to make the purchase, financing may be a good option. A 0.9% interest rate is generally considered to be very low, so this could be a good opportunity to borrow money at a relatively low cost. However, you will still need to make monthly payments to pay off the loan, and the overall cost of the car may be higher than if you paid cash due to the interest you'll be paying on the loan.Leasing for 0.9%: Leasing a car involves paying a monthly fee to use the car for a set period of time, usually a few years. At the end of the lease, you'll have the option to buy the car, return it to the dealership, or lease a different car. Leasing can be a good option if you don't want to commit to owning a car long-term or if you don't have the financial resources to buy a car outright. A 0.9% lease rate is also relatively low, which could make leasing a more affordable option. However, you'll need to be aware of any mileage restrictions and any charges for going over those limits, as well as any other fees that may be associated with leasing.Ultimately, the best option for you will depend on your personal financial situation, your budget, and your long-term goals. It's a good idea to carefully consider all of your options and consult with a financial advisor or professional if you have questions or need guidance.",
