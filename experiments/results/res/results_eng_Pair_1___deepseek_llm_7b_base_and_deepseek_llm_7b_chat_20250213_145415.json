      "\nA tsunami is a series of very large and long-distance ocean waves created by disturbances in the ocean such as earthquakes, landslides, volcanic eruptions, or meteor impacts. These disturbances cause a displacement of the ocean's water that moves in a wave-like pattern away from the disturbance. The disturbance can be so large that the wave it creates contains tremendous energy that can travel thousands of kilometers and gain immense height as it approaches land. The physics behind this phenomenon is the result of a transfer of energy from the disturbance to the ocean where it is then transferred to the wave form. Tsunami waves are usually millions of times larger than normal waves making them have much greater destructive potential than regular waves.",

      "\"The president told the world that he would 'get rid of' ISIS,\" he told a cheering crowd in West Palm Beach, flanking his new travel ban. \"Just days later, he said that ISIS should be no big deal.\"\n\nIt was a line of attack for another reason: If he succeeds in removing Americans from the battlefield, Trump will also be sending our leaders scrambling to reevaluate the wisdom of their war against terrorists.\n\nThe president's new strategy on ISIS includes his \"zero option,\" a plan that allows the Pentagon to declare victory only when the group is no longer a threat. In other words, in military terminology, it would leave the U.S. in a \"stalemate.\"\n\nTrump's critics say that strategy was the reason his plan was abandoned by President Obama in 2011. But they ignore what's happened since then. As the president's approval rating has slipped, the Pentagon has been forced to add hundreds of Marines to Iraq, and more troops to Afghanistan than last year.\n\nAt a minimum, Trump's approach is better than Obama's in two respects: It's consistent with America's international responsibilities and it reflects a commitment to victory more than it does to the status quo.\n\nIf this is bad, consider the opposite. Take his response to terror attacks around the world. There is only one response to the horrific deaths and injuries suffered by Paris, Nice and London. It's to ramp up our intelligence-gathering and military action in the region. It's the only response.\n\nIn the wake of the San Bernardino, Calif., shooting, the president immediately declared that ISIS was a \"death cult\" and vowed a \"surge\" in U.S. intelligence and troop strength around the globe. In Yemen, Obama ordered a covert campaign to kill Qaeda and ISIS leaders without any congressional authorization.\n\nWhile Trump has refused to criticize Obama's aggressive foreign policy, he also has said in the past that he would have bombed the Assad regime in Syria — despite pleas from his generals that it wouldn't work.\n\nThe president's new strategy on ISIS includes his \"zero option\"\n\nHe called Bashar Assad \"terrible,\" and insisted \"we would be in a lot better position\" if Obama had bombed him in 2013 instead of bombing Assad himself. Trump also said that \"we need better leadership in the Middle East\" and has not addressed the question of why the U.S. government hasn't targeted Assad for his crimes against the Syrian people.\n\nBut as he told the Florida crowd, Obama \"didn't want to get involved militarily.\" Trump added, \"I want better leadership, frankly.\"\n\nThat's right, the president's \"zero option\" has forced leaders to get involved militarily in the first place. In the last few years, the Obama administration has been involved in a brutal counterinsurgency war in Iraq, where over a century of brutal repression has made the U.S. a prime target for the extremists. Over the next four years, Obama will have to escalate our participation in the war and potentially bring more U.S. forces into Somalia.\n\nTrump has also taken a decidedly hawkish approach when dealing with Russia. As Russia continues to wage a war against ISIS in Syria, Trump's secretary of state Rex Tillerson said that it would be \"a mistake\" not to improve relations with President Vladimir Putin.\n\nDuring his campaign, Trump said that he was more comfortable with Russia staying out of Syria and that he would be willing to work with Putin if he was willing to improve relations with the Syrian government. Trump also accused Clinton of starting the civil war in Syria.\n\nTrump's new strategy on ISIS includes his \"zero option\"\n\nThis is the essence of Trump's worldview: He does whatever he wants, and he thinks any military action is justified and/or necessary. He hasn't changed his mind about anything.\n\nThe Obama administration was similarly willing to give Trump carte blanche when it came to foreign policy. Obama began negotiations to end the civil war in Syria by proposing a de-escalation zone in order to allow Syrian President Bashar Assad to step down, but Trump turned them down.\n\nTrump's foreign policy wonks were similarly willing to give the new president carte blanche. As secretary of state, Rex Tillerson said he would \"take to the president whatever advice he may have,\" though he never mentioned the president's national security advisor, H.R. McMaster. Trump's national security advisers — James Mattis, Mike Flynn and H.R. McMaster — have consistently supported Trump's approach to ISIS.\n\nEven at the time, many were concerned that Trump would follow through on his threat to order a military attack on North Korea. Trump didn't want to do that, but Secretary of State Rex Tillerson convinced him to do it anyway.\n\nThis was what Trump wanted to accomplish: To use his military to \"send a message\" to China and North Korea, as he told the Florida crowd, and",

      "Cameron Slater wants you to believe he's done with the media and the political commentary he performs. But as you'll see from his latest interview with Sydney's Channel 7's Andrew Bolt, that may not be the case anytime soon.\n\nFor one thing, Slater says he still supports Labor, and Bolt is still, as usual, a Republican. \"He's pretty much a Republican all right, a big fat hypocrite who pretends to be a moderate but he's anything but,\" Slater said. \"He'll lie and do what he needs to do in order to promote the conservative agenda.\"\n\nA lot of journalists think it would make sense for Cameron Slater to give up the media and politics. And to be sure there's an argument to be made: his career as a journalist has never really been a serious one. His most notable contributions have been in the form of opinion pieces, which have often been poorly researched or simply invented for the purpose of expressing his views.\n\nAs I observed when I was covering his time at Australia's premier financial publication, the Herald Sun, the editorials from back in the day were more often than not quite worthless attempts to advance his own views. That's not to say he didn't have any interesting ideas to express: just look at this piece from 2006, which discusses a book he supposedly once read:\n\n… the book I've been reading lately, it's called the \"American Dope\" series by John McWhorter…. I'm thinking about it because as you'll recall, in late 2006 I was approached by an Australian company about having a look at a novel they had written by a Canadian author called Malcolm Gladwell. I was a bit taken by the idea! The idea of reading a novel which contained more references to Malcolm Gladwell, his theories, and his books than anything else was enticing to say the least. And when I asked the company if they could forward copies of the novel, which they did, the company took their own copy and replaced Malcolm with a character I'm sure you can imagine, the hero of the novel, Malcolm. They put the book on my shelf and called me on the phone the next morning to tell me that Malcolm Gladwell had called. It was a nice little story. Gladwell had called to complain about my taking his novel. The book had been made into an Australian movie, and the Australian film company had gone for Malcolm, making him the hero for the movie.\n\nIn this context, the idea of having a book written by Gladwell on your shelf is hardly remarkable. Indeed, it's rather more interesting, in my opinion.\n\nStill, for Bolt, what's really interesting are his political views. I've been writing about Bolt for over a decade, and one thing I've noticed is that Bolt's political views tend to shift constantly. I don't know if this is an indication that Bolt has genuine beliefs (though I highly doubt it), but I do know that he sometimes ends up endorsing candidates who he's never mentioned before, and that he sometimes even suggests they are good people.\n\nSo how can you tell? In 2006, Slater's book Why Don't You Vote? came out, and a few days after the book's release, Bolt wrote this:\n\nHe is, as the book's title suggests, a libertarian. While it's not entirely clear which party Mr Slater would be supporting, he was always a staunch supporter of Senator Ron Boswell's libertarianism and was once a member of the South Australian Labor party. It's worth pointing out that Ron Boswell was recently appointed to the Senate for the Queensland seat of Fisher as a direct result of his support for liberty and the rule of law.\n\nThat wasn't the end of it, though. Two years later, Slater had an interesting column about the current \"recovery\" in Australia – apparently this was actually an Australian Labor government's recovery! – in which he described the Australian Labor Party's \"political strategy\" as \"scathingly dishonest\" (my emphasis):\n\nNow, let's be clear. Many of the party's own members are well aware that its electoral strategy – which is, after all, what its current plan has always been based on – is the most scurrilous political strategy of them all. As a veteran of several Labor Party campaigns, I must say that this lack of trust in our national leaders really puts one in mind of the recent US election, when a number of Republican leaders such as Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann and Rick Perry openly admitted to being party hacks. A similar scenario is playing out in Australia, with the leaders of the two major parties openly admitting to operating from the same political shop. To put it bluntly, it's one big sleaze.\n\nBut in 2007, it's not Slater's views which are especially interesting, it's this: the day after a Sydney Morning Herald editorial which described Kevin Rudd's plans as a \"bizarre fantasy\", Slater posted this:\n\nRudd's",

      "The second part of my \"Telling the Story\" series is about telling a story in your games, with the focus on story. I've talked before about story in RPGs, how to design it and the types of stories that work well, including what's called \"high conflict\" stories. For the purpose of this part I want to talk about some questions that you should ask yourself before you design a story for your game.\n\nI'm not talking about the design problems of writing a story, though some of these problems may arise. And we'll be looking at some other things you might find helpful in your design process beyond story. That's the second half of \"Telling the Story.\"\n\nI'm not asking you to think through all the possible questions about storytelling and making stories. You are free to think through whatever you want. Maybe you do it in a way that we'll get there later. And let me give you some ideas.\n\nLet's start with questions about the \"story\" genre. I've asked other people about this, but the two that are the most frequently asked are, Why is it called \"the story?\" and \"What does the story tell us about the world?\" The former seems obvious: what exactly is the story that you want to tell? Is it a narrative, is it a quest, is it a drama? Are there conflicts between characters? How do the characters react? What happens?\n\nIf it's not a classic story, it'll be harder to make you realize what it is.\n\nThe other question is how to tell that story. What do the players do? Where do the player characters go? Do they save the village? Do they help the heroes achieve their goals? It's not just \"do these kinds of things.\" If the story is about two heroes facing off against the evil dragon on the mountain, you might have one character who goes off to seek assistance and the other who stays and fights.\n\nIf the story is more like a quest or a quest-like kind of encounter, maybe you say simply, \"In a quest, the heroes must deal with three things.\"\n\nWhat kind of problems does the narrative create for the players?\n\nDoes the story change during the game?\n\nHow does the story develop?\n\nDo the players learn anything from the narrative?\n\nCan players do anything to change the narrative?\n\nCan people tell the story in non-player characters?\n\nHow does the story affect the actions of the players?\n\nAre there important choices the player characters can't make?\n\nHow does the player change what happens?\n\nIs the player's choice consequential?\n\nIs the player given a lot of options?\n\nSome games are more narrative games and some are not. Some games have lots of choices, some have none. Some games have lots of conflicts and some don't. Some games have conflicts between player characters and some don't.\n\nI hope the list is not complete.

Women who consumed fewer than 60 g/day of protein had a 2-in-3 risk of bone loss. No significant interactions were observed between study-group and study-period interactions (P > 0.05).\n\nCONCLUSIONS:\n\nIn postmenopausal women, lower P intake is not associated with decreased bone mass.",
      "There is no doubt that the Republican Establishment knows full well that they are losing the 2016 presidential election. They are trying to force Paul Ryan to be their candidate, which was the original plan all along. The problem is that the Republican Party is split and the American people aren't buying into the Establishment's bullshit.\n\nThe GOP Establishment is in total disarray, as evidenced by their complete and utter inability to stop Donald Trump. They have no coherent message, they are in a total panic mode and their candidate is embarrassing. And now these GOP elites are freaking the hell out.\n\nIt is all thanks to Donald Trump, of all people.\n\nThey know that he is a threat to their power, but they can't stop looking like cretins by trying to undermine him. It is going to take a miracle if they can win the election, especially since they are in a complete panic mode. They are going to have to try to change the rules of the game.\n\nThis is where you come in, dear reader.\n\nPaul Ryan and Mitch McConnell have just announced that they, along with Mitt Romney, Mike Huckabee, Lindsey Graham, Rick Santorum, Ben Carson and John Kasich will attend the GOP convention in Cleveland, OH in July.\n\nThat is a lot of big names. The GOP establishment wants to keep its power by having as many big names as possible attend the convention. They know Donald J Trump is a threat to their control and they think that he will get the support he needs to overtake their own candidates by convincing them that he is a credible alternative.\n\nIf there is a way to stop him by having so many big names attend the convention in Cleveland, well – then I think we've found it, reader.\n\nI have this crazy idea that Paul Ryan might consider going to the Republican Convention, too. But then again, he might just make a joke of it, just like he did when he told the reporters, \"If I were an old guy from Georgia, I would say, 'Hey guys, wait 'til you see these people who are going to be there. I think they're gonna be super-old, super-senior folks,' but I think it is the best way to stop Donald Trump.\"\n\nHow will people react to that?\n\nMaybe the GOP establishment will just laugh and shake their heads in a very condescending way. Maybe he will make a grand entrance and announce, \"We have a little problem over here, the Republicans have a little problem over here.\" Maybe he will come over to us (and I am sure he would love us) to take their picture.\n\nLet's just say that Paul Ryan might decide to take the trip to Cleveland.\n\nThe point is that the establishment doesn't want a Trump president or the GOP Congress. They want Paul Ryan to be the face of the Republican Party. And they are planning to make sure that happens by having a lot of big names attend the Republican Convention.\n\nI think at the end of this crazy week, the establishment will realize that they are all going down in flames. Paul Ryan is just a mouthpiece for the Establishment, and that is why he is so afraid to debate him. The Republican Party is being run by the same politicians that were behind Bill Clinton's scandals in the '90s – and Paul Ryan is no exception. And I wonder if he knows that.\n\nThe Republican Party will be in full chaos now – and they don't want to be in full chaos. So let's all help them by putting all of our collective chips on someone other than Paul Ryan to be their leader – a man who can really defeat Donald Trump!",
      "The following is a list of the 10 best players for all positions at the 2015 MLS Draft. They have been ordered based on the players ranked first through 10.\n\n1\n\nTyler Adams, defender, Syracuse: Adams was an All-America selection in his sophomore year with an excellent senior season with 15 goals and 16 assists for the Orange. With Syracuse, he was the captain, and he has the potential to be the next USMNT prospect who goes No. 1 overall, just like DeAndre Yedlin did this year. Adams is a strong defender who likes to stay on the ball, and will definitely be a top pick come next summer.\n\n2\n\nTyler Rosenlund, defender, North Carolina: Rosenlund was one of college soccer's best players in 2015 and is in the running to be the next USMNT center back to be picked there. He has excellent speed that translates to the next level, and an excellent head for the ball that he uses to keep things organized at the back and also make good passes. He also has a good set of left foot to play right back. Rosenlund has the athleticism to go to the college level and do well, and he could slide right in at right back for the USMNT.\n\n3\n\nTyler Turner, midfielder, Duke: Turner's talent is the reason that Duke has been a perennial top-flight side both on and off the field. Turner had the first year in his career that he played in more than 20 games, and only had two minutes of playing time for Duke that year. This was thanks to a pair of redshirt years. The first, because he was recovering from a broken leg, and the second, because he was redshirting after a shoulder injury. Turner was a part of Duke soccer's biggest turnaround in college soccer history, and he will be the type of player that is a big part of that turnaround moving forward.\n\n4\n\nAndrew Carleton, defender, North Carolina: Carleton had a big year in 2015, and the Tar Heels are already starting to look ahead to next season. They finished in third place in the ACC, and Carleton is definitely one to watch for when the 2015 MLS Draft rolls around. They will be one of the favorites to win the ACC championship in 2015. Carleton has great speed, and he is a good passer. He can get up in the attack and create chances. He is more of a classic center back who can play in the defensive zone for one team or do well in the attacking zone for another team.\n\n5\n\nTyler Adams, defender, Syracuse: Adams can be a good pro from day one in MLS. He has all the potential to be a big-time player as he just keeps on getting better. Adams is a strong defender who is tough to get past, and he has the mentality of being a top defender to learn from. Adams has played in the senior version of the New York Red Bulls' youth system, but he was always better with senior teammates. His style is a little bit harder to play against and harder to read, but he will certainly be a good player.\n\n6\n\nTyler Turner, midfielder, Duke: Turner also played for the Red Bulls' Under-18 setup once, and he has a good chance to play for the senior USMNT in the not too distant future. Turner has played in nearly every college game, especially on the national team, but his junior year was a bit of a learning curve. He had a strong season with 19 assists and was the leading scorer in the ACC. He has decent strength and he will definitely be one to keep an eye on in the draft.\n\n7\n\nMatthew Fondy, midfielder, UCLA: Fondy is a true midfielder, or at least it looks that way as he has great feet and great vision. He is very athletic, and a great passer. Fondy is also very good on set pieces, and has good speed. He was a top scorer in the Pac-12 this year and will definitely be a priority to keep an eye on in the next draft. Fondy has a big future to follow as he is a versatile player who is a good all-around player.\n\n8\n\nTyler Turner, midfielder, Duke: Turner has been a leader on Duke's top team the past two seasons, and as the leading scorer this past year, will also be a leader for the Red Bulls Academy. He has good passing abilities, and is a good scorer who likes to play with the ball at his feet. Turner is also a good midfielder who can get forward and be an effective offensive threat. He can provide a good combination of defense and offense for a team.\n\n9\n\nTyler Adams, defender, Syracuse: Adams is one of the best defenders in college soccer, and the best defender in the Big East the past two years. Adams has been a member of Syracuse's national team since his sophomore year in 2013 and",

      "The last time we discussed this topic, we looked at the fact that this method is fairly effective to build out a new library.\n\nHowever - this is no silver bullet either (it's best to try out a few different ones for your own requirements). The reason for this is that each time you get new dependencies, you need to build them from scratch, including the necessary new modules. This can be a pain.\n\nSo instead of building a new, shiny module by hand - we'll automate this.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt's easy to automate, and it can be done in a relatively small amount of code if you use something like a build system. You'll also gain a lot of confidence that it will work and will always work without you changing a thing.\n\nHow?\n\nWith Node.js you can use something called NPM packages – which are exactly what they sound like - packages of a set of modules to install. They are installed in the node_modules directory.\n\nWhat?\n\nLet's take a look at the code. Here's our Hello World module.\n\nvar { name, description, hello, greet, goodbye, } = require('hello'); var app = require('./app'); hello('world');\n\nThere's a lot going on. Let's dig deep and dive into them a bit – to learn it all is to go through it and write it all yourself.\n\nWe have our package.json file. This tells node where to find the different files we want to install. We can use require to import anything we're going to use.\n\nThe rest is pretty straightforward - we have our main package.json - the main file that will contain the information our package should have. In this case - we want to use the main.js - which will tell Node what the main bundle should be like. There's also a \"scripts\" property containing other instructions.\n\nOnce we have those packages, we write all our code. We can use require to import our modules into our application. We have to specify the names (which will be defined within the package.json file) of these modules. This is done with the name attribute in our require function. It's also defined within the package.json file.\n\nOnce the app.js file is loaded we then start building out our node_modules directory. We use npm init to set everything up for us, and when we're done, we use the command:\n\nnpm i to create and build our package. This creates a directory structure called package , which you'll create with the names of the dependencies as .js files.\n\nLet's dig a bit deeper and see the code. Let's create a directory tree as normal, and make a Hello World package.\n\nCreate\n\n$ mkdir hello-world $ touch package/hello-world.js\n\nThis now gives us the directory structure that we would have if we had created this directory using the command:\n\nmkdir Hello World && cd Hello World\n\nNow we can create our package.json and use the create command for it to create our code.\n\nCreate\n\n$ touch package.json\n\nNotice that the package.json file contains:\n\n\"name\": \"hello-world\",\n\nAnd we've defined the name of our hello package. Then we define the name we want as the first key of the package manifest. It's also defined within the package.json file.\n\nThen we set the version number of our package to 0.0.0 - this will tell npm to automatically install the new package every time we run:\n\n# Create package.json # name: \"hello-world\", # version: 0.0.0 # scripts: - 'echo \"Hello World!\"'\n\nWhen we run the command:\n\nnpm install\n\nNode will download the new package.json file and save it to our package directory. This will look like this:\n\n{ \"name\": \"hello-world\", \"version\": 0.0.0, \"timestamp\": 1483544380, \"dependencies\": { \"grunt\": \"~0.2.5\", \"grunt-contrib-web-client\": \"~0.7.1\", \"grunt-contrib-css-modules\": \"~0.14.0\", \"grunt-contrib-uglify\": \"~0.2.3\", \"grunt-contrib-watch\": \"~0.1.0\", \"grunt-concurrency-streams\": \"~0.2.2\", \"grunt-html-loop\": \"~0.9.3\", \"grunt-load-grunt\": \"~0.1.0\", \"grunt-load-tasks\": \"~0.1.11\", \"grunt-contrib-sinatra",
      "I think this is a very good idea. The way it looks, I'm really sure it will work.\n\n\nIf I remember correctly you actually already have a very good idea of the cost, how much is it going to be, and how many people will use it (for example: how many apps can be supported, which apps might actually need to be updated etc). I'm sure that you already had these two things defined when you started thinking of the project.\n\nClick to expand...",
      "By: Jay Greenberg\n\nAs I'm sure you're aware, last offseason the Browns' plan to add depth at receiver was complicated by the team's impending free agency of Robert Griffin III. The Browns, who had previously attempted to sign Greg Jennings as a free agent, were unable to sign the veteran after Griffin signed with the Washington Redskins, which made Jennings, a former number one pick, expendable.\n\nGriffin's arrival in Washington did not, however, create an opportunity in Cleveland for the team's third wide receiver, as the Browns had a pair of players under contract to serve as backup wide receivers. Terrell Owens, who had been released by the Washington Redskins before the 2012 season following his altercation with an intern, returned to play with the Cleveland Browns during the 2013 season. Former Cleveland Brown Brandon Stokley had one year remaining on his contract in Cleveland, but signed with the Minnesota Vikings on April 28th, 2013. On April 28th, it looked like Stokley's stint with the Vikings would not continue past the 2013 season.\n\nOn April 28th of last season, the Cleveland Browns announced that the Stokley signing had been made official and they were replacing Stokley's role as the third receiver with Owens and former Brown Brandon Stokley, as described further below. But on April 30th, the Rams signed Stokley to a two-year contract extension worth about $2.8 million.\n\nOwens had been released by the Redskins over the weekend after his contract expired, but he had remained a part of the organization through his time out of the game. Stokley, however, had been dealt to the Minnesota Vikings after several failed attempts to sign him. Once the Rams claimed Stokley off waivers, his deal expired and he was released to make room for the signing of Owens. On April 29th, Stokley signed a re-entry waivers claim with the Browns, a process that takes place on May 1st.\n\nThere was still an opportunity for the Browns to sign Owens, but as noted earlier, there was another free agent in Cleveland that would become available if they declined to re-sign Stokley. That player is Cleveland's long-time and longtime starting quarterback, Josh McCown.\n\nAccording to NFL.com, Josh McCown was released by the New York Jets on March 10th, but he played through several injuries before being released and signed by the Cleveland Browns on March 10th. McCown played with the Jets for the first three seasons of his two-year contract and there had been talk that he might retire but McCown remained. He played well enough for the Browns not to claim him on waivers after all.\n\nThis situation was similar to the one that occurred when the Redskins acquired former number one pick Robert Griffin III. Despite what seems like an extreme amount of talent on the roster, it was clear from the outset that the Redskins' quarterback situation was going to be a problem. The team signed RGIII as a free agent, hoping his success would lead to him earning more money as a starter. But even after his first few games in Washington, there was no guarantee that he would be given any significant playing time this year and a team with a desperate need at quarterback could not afford to pay any of his salary in a season and a half. In order to create more depth at the quarterback position, the Redskins chose to release Griffin, a move that was met with immediate criticism from some fans, and some in the media. If McCown has been able to handle the offense so well during his brief time with the Browns and there are no issues with him, there is no reason to think that RGIII can't as well. His ability as a professional quarterback combined with his recent successful stints as a starter could allow him (and the Browns) to keep his job for the long haul. Perhaps, however, it was the recent history of the situation that prompted the Browns to release all of their injured and ineffective receivers prior to this season. If that is truly the case, it has to make sense from the Browns' perspective as a financial matter, rather than a football decision.\n\nDespite the success that Griffin produced this season, he has reportedly lost a significant amount of the trust of the fans, which could ultimately affect his market value, if anyone is willing to pay him. He remains to be one of the best quarterbacks to come out of college in the last two decades, but the quarterback market may have been affected by his release by the Redskins two years ago. In the end, it was the need on the roster that resulted in the Browns having to release the talented Robert Griffin III before this season began. That the Browns then re-signed the talented Josh McCown makes financial sense, despite the fact that McCown did not prove himself in the first two games of the season, and certainly did not play well during the Browns' last two games before releasing him.\n\nThis situation makes it easy for outsiders to say that McCown",

      "A few months ago, I sat in bed and cried while reading A New Beginning by John Gray; the book is inspired by an article by the Australian doctor David Livingstone that first appeared recently in the Sydney Morning Herald. In his piece, Dr Livingstone, said,\n\n\"Over the last ten years we have seen an explosion of anti-science rhetoric. People fear and distrust scientists, and for good reason. In my own field I see first-hand that scepticism about evidence is dangerous, not only for scientists, but for society as a whole, and especially for young people who are growing up without much understanding of science or evidence.\"\n\nWe live in a world where one person's conspiracy theory is another's fact. We live in an age where conspiracy theories seem to be spreading faster and faster, and where they seem to be getting more convincing. Some people simply do not like our technology, and would prefer we just ignored the technology and just relied on the bible and the church.\n\nI am so lucky to be a science writer. The Internet has given me access to the world's brightest and best science journalists, and I am grateful for their work and willingness to work with me. I am lucky that some of these people are scientists. But it's sad to see so many scientists getting infected by conspiracy theories; like the conspiracy theorists who say the moon landings were faked.\n\nMy favorite conspiracy theory is the one where the government is running an experiment on us:\n\nConspiracy Theory #1: Government is Running a \"Mind Control Experiment\" on Americans.\n\nConspiracy Theory #2: The government is running a \"Mind Control Experiment\" on Americans via the internet.\n\n\"People are increasingly trusting the government, rather than the facts. While most Americans are skeptical of the government, a new survey finds that they trust them more than they trust their neighbors, their friends or even religious leaders.\"\n\nConspiracy Theory #3: The government is running a \"Mind Control Experiment\" on Americans via Internet.\n\nWhy does this matter? The problem here is that these conspiracies are spread, not only by the people who believe them themselves, but also by \"scholarly\" writers (like the two guys mentioned above) who can spread the conspiracy without being held accountable by people who are skeptical of these theories. And, sadly, it's getting worse.\n\nPeople say conspiracy theorists have hijacked the Internet – the Internet is now full of people saying \"There is a conspiracy!\", and people who believe in a conspiracy will make up conspiracies (like that \"the moon landing was faked\", and so on.) And even worse, they will spread these conspiracy theories via blogs, YouTube, Facebook, and the like; the Internet is now full of conspiracy theories that are just made up, to be spread, and you can do it to yourself, too.\n\nThe problem with conspiracy theories is not only that they are dangerous, but that they are so self-reinforcing. In this case, those who are involved in spreading the conspiracy become more convinced to spread the conspiracy as well; and a new generation of conspiracy theorists follows each other's words with the hope that someone will believe them, so they do too.\n\nSo, where does this leave me?\n\nI want to be a voice for reason and evidence. I can't say it any better than John Gray:\n\n\"I'm just trying to give you all this – to try to take your mind off the fact that someone has written a couple of books, and one of them was a Nobel Prize winner, and one of them was a bestselling author, and you don't believe what they have to say just because you don't have the same evidence.\"\n\nThis is a pretty hard task – because there are many conspiracies that just aren't true. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all conspiracy theories; just the ones that I know are untrue.\n\nI try to share the science behind the science, in a way that's clear, and in a tone that's inviting. I try to be honest; but I also try to be clear and to explain all the assumptions and evidence I used to come to my conclusions. I try to look at the evidence in a coherent way, but also in ways that are easy for someone unfamiliar with the evidence to understand. I try to be open to debate, especially from those who are skeptical of my conclusions, but also to those who believe in my theory. I try to write clear and honest articles that I don't want to be taken out of context, as well as write posts that I know will get up-votes, but that people will agree with even if they don't agree 100% – even if they disagree – that's OK.\n\nI hope I can serve as a reminder to you that your views on things may be in line with mine, but it's not important what I think about the topic. It's important that you try to find the best",
      "Lion's Share (or Lion's Claw) is a rare set bonus for the bow, but an important one in the right hands.\n\nThe bow's bonus damage on enemies can only be attained through the use of skills, but the range of those skills is enormous. It is, simply put, the most devastating bow skill in all of Destiny.\n\nIt is one of the only skills capable of killing multiple enemies simultaneously at close range with very little effort. This means if an enemy targets you and you do a perfect arcing fireblast, you have the potential of doing 200-300 more damage to an enemy than if you took the bow to your opponent head-on. That's a lot.\n\nIt is quite easy to pull off, but its rewards in speed and efficiency are very strong. It is also very fast and easy to master.\n\nContents show]\n\nOverview Edit\n\nA very rare drop from the Nightmare of Mensis, Lion's Share is essentially a faster way of killing enemies, the same damage per second as a fast gun, but with increased range, and more than twice the speed, thanks to the bonus damage.\n\nOne of the strongest skills in the game, and with a speed of 1.0 at level 40 it's one of Destiny's best skills, although it is the best bow skill when dual wielding. It can get almost anywhere, but only if you have a lot of range. If two players are carrying Lions Share then they can go at close range, even with a sub-machine gun if you are standing still.\n\nThe Lion's Share bow, on the other hand, hits almost everything in its path. While it lacks the power of a fast gun, it's far more precise and, with its very fast rate of fire and massive damage bonus, it works much better than the Exotic version of Exotic weapon, the Vex Mythoclast. There is no way to tell the difference.\n\nIn this sense, it is more akin to a sniper rifle as it can kill several enemies as well as be accurate, which makes it ideal for taking down the enemies without taking damage.\n\nBest Uses:\n\nLions Share is the bow of choice for killing enemies in the middle of a firefight, especially around cover. It has a very high rate of fire which makes it very quick to target moving or shooting targets with.\n\nLion's Share can get you out of harm's way and even put you right between two or more enemies, as it goes through enemies at a very fast pace, taking advantage of its high speed and high damage bonus.\n\nWith the range that Lions Share delivers and the slow rate of fire which makes it slower than most guns, Lion's Share can take out two enemies when you reach a distance of about ten metres or so. It is also faster than most guns and works well against enemies like the Exotic Arcstrider.\n\nLions Share is often used when fighting multiple opponents, or when going close to enemies. This can let you get the jump on an enemy and strike.\n\nMost players, like myself, carry one in all their sets of gear. The bonus damage combined with the range to the maximum make it an essential item for players who get into a firefight and decide they want to fire a weapon from the far away.\n\nLion's Share can even be used on enemies at very close range, because it doesn't cause you to have to get too close, and because the bonuses to the area you hit your opponents aren't lost if your distance to them is very small.\n\nLions Share can also be used as an extra damage multiplier on a weapon that normally wouldn't benefit from the use of a damage multiplier, especially when dual wielding which greatly increases the number of bullets that can hit something when using the Exotic Arcstrider.\n\nGanking as Lion's Share is the fastest way of getting the most damage out of your bow.\n\nThe only way to effectively use Lion's Share as a sniper is by using its extreme range in close proximity to enemies. With a good weapon, like the Exotic Arcstrider or the exotic Suros Regime, you can pull some impressive targets out of the fray.\n\nThis also makes Lion's Share a great choice for using against a pack of enemies and not requiring an intense firefight to pull your headshot off.\n\nThis is probably the best bow skill to use as a PvE character because if you land a headshot then enemies will be dead in seconds.\n\nUsefulness Edit\n\nThe highest single element, highest bonus to critical hit chance and highest percentage of critical hit damage of any item in the game.\n\nIt is very easy and fast to pull off and can kill multiple enemies at once at very close range.\n\nGood for killing enemies quickly even at long range.\n\nCan be used at close range to get around cover and get into a firefight where",
      "A little while back, I wrote about what a bad idea it was to be a student with a low GPA, and what a bad idea it was to be a student with a higher GPA (or one who had yet to take the LSAT at all). Now it's time for the follow-up: what a bad idea it is to be in college or post-college with a mediocre GPA. A lot of people were critical of me in my first piece when I said that people with low GPAs have a lot of options to choose from, and that people with higher GPAs are in a worse position than those with low GPAs. I guess I just didn't get it. What's wrong with having a low GPA?\n\nLet me explain!\n\nPeople with higher GPA have a number of options.\n\nThey can choose a major that's more in line with their career goals and interests (like, for example, engineering; business; law; mathematics; computer science; journalism; etc.). Or they can choose another major that's a good fit (science; arts; music; etc.). And this is actually good, if you take a broad view of education. A mediocre GPA can result in a huge number of options, which can be both a blessing and a curse. That's what I'm going to focus on this article: the things a higher GPA can do for you!\n\nBut first, a quick explanation: you're not born with a decent GPA. People can learn to have a higher GPA and can improve it. (That's why this article is called \"Graduating with a Good GPA.\") It doesn't mean that people can't make the same mistakes as people who have lower GPAs, but I don't think that's the whole story. There are still some things that you can focus on:\n\nWhen students have higher GPA's, they are perceived (and possibly are) as more intelligent. Higher GPA's tend to raise your status and make you a more desirable target.\n\nPeople with higher GPA's tend to work for higher salaries.\n\nPeople with higher GPA's can more easily get loans and scholarships from banks, universities, and government programs.\n\nIf you are interested in making a career choice that involves education, you need a high GPA!\n\nWhy higher GPA's?\n\nLet me say this again – a lower GPA means you are more likely to have the same number of job opportunities, or less. The only way that you can have more options than someone at the same GPA is if you choose a career that involves education and/or a job that requires a high degree of education / skill (like computer science, or math, or engineering). Higher GPA's tend to increase your chances of finding a job (especially if you chose one that requires education) or of getting a job by showing that you're qualified in those areas.\n\nHow to increase your number of job options?\n\nOne of the most common ways to boost your number of job opportunities is to find a better (better paying, better job), better (better employer, better career), or a better (better promotion, better career advancement), higher-paying job. Most people would agree that you should look for a job that fits who you are – if you have a good sense of humor, then you would look for a job that can provide you with laughs. If so – look for jobs that offer you at least $35 per hour for the time that you work.\n\nIf you look for a job that fits who you are, then you are more likely to find a role that's easier and more fulfilling for you. You are more likely to find a less stressful career. You are more likely to find a career where you're given the opportunity to advance and learn and grow. You're less likely to feel stuck in a role, and you're less likely to be stressed while on the job.\n\nHow to choose a job that's easier?\n\nOne of the most common ways to get a better paid job with less stress is by choosing a job that involves working with people. For example, if you don't like to work with lots of people, then go with a job that involves working with other people. If you enjoy a team-oriented environment, then look for a job that involves working in a team environment.\n\nIf a new position requires you to work more with a large audience than a smaller one, then you're better off working in an environment that's heavily focused on building an audience. There are jobs that have large audiences but don't have to work with much interaction with the audience. For example, most music videos are produced with the audience's attention constantly on them, not their co-workers; many TV news shows have audiences that are never asked questions or shown any information; most commercial radio shows have huge audiences and are aired to very few people; etc. etc.\n\nHow to choose a job that doesn't make you stress?\n\nYou can't",

      "Maine Governor Paul LePage and Attorney General Janet Mills have joined the growing list of Republicans who believe that legalizing medical marijuana could be a bad idea. Maine lawmakers recently approved a medical marijuana bill that's expected to get Gov. Paul LePage's signature. But LePage is convinced that, as the president of a state, he has the constitutional right to decide which treatments his fellow Maine citizens might seek under a new law.\n\nThat's exactly how some federal agencies saw him when they targeted his medical marijuana facility in 2013.\n\nIn a lengthy statement, LePage said that, as a U.S. senator, he could \"legislate on any topic, so it doesn't matter what party I be.\" \"My constituents elected me to serve them, no matter party,\" he added.\n\n\"In 2013 Senator Jeff Merkley, who is now a United States Senator, publicly stated he believed that state-licensed marijuana dispensaries would be illegal if they served patients with a legitimate need.\" —Paul LePage\n\nWhen asked by the Bangor Daily News why he thought a medical marijuana dispensary serving pain patients, people undergoing cancer treatment, and parents of children with seizure disorders could be in violation of federal law, LePage answered, \"Well, I guess they are.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe senator was referring to the Justice Department's long-standing policy that only medical marijuana facilities will qualify for federal funding for \"the medical use of marijuana.\" It doesn't distinguish between dispensaries that provide only low-THC marijuana as a treatment for cancer-related nausea and inflammation, as LePage's facility does, and those that serve a wider range of medical conditions.\n\nGet Today in Politics in your inbox: A digest of the top political stories from the Globe, sent to your inbox Monday-Friday.

Sign up for more newsletters here\n\n\"I guess they are,\" LePage said. \"So it doesn't matter who's voted for it or who wasn't, I am not going to be bullied or pushed around any further.\"\n\n\"Because of the way the Senate acted under the leadership of Senator Pat Leahy, a Democrat who I have great respect for, I believe that state-licensed marijuana, where a doctor writes prescriptions - and there are thousands of such prescriptions in Maine for cancer, AIDS, multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and other diseases that are either hard to treat or can't be treated with the standard medications — should not be considered medical marijuana under any circumstances,\" said Attorney General Mills, according to the Bangor Free Press.\n\nMaine's medical marijuana law allows patients who show the state has a \"fraudulent or incompetent\" business plan to obtain marijuana for recreational use. They are also able to qualify if they suffer from severe side effects or severe debilitating diseases, like cancer.\n\nAs the state's chief law enforcement officer, Mills said she would investigate if her office was \"concerned about the operation of the state's medical marijuana program.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMarijuana advocates have long defended the constitutionality of medical marijuana. A coalition of legal scholars and civil rights groups has said that if the government is \"prosecuting\" the medical marijuana facility and not the patients seeking medical marijuana, then the patients are being punished in violation of their Second Amendment rights.\n\nThat has certainly been true of LePage's actions. In 2012, the Governor issued a directive to the state police \"to increase enforcement activity against [marijuana dispensaries].\"\n\nIn 2013, as the bill was passing through the Maine legislature, LePage lashed out at Lea County Sheriff Michael Zurlo. \"I understand your concerns about a physician-prescribed marijuana farm where sick people can legally obtain their medication. And I will do what I can to make sure patients have access to it and your citizens have safe access to it.\"\n\nThe letter prompted a response from the president of the Maine Police Chiefs Association, John LaForge. \"As a practicing professional, former State Police Sergeant and elected and appointed police Chief in Maine, I can tell you Governor LePage's rhetoric does not reflect the law or the Maine police chiefs,\" he wrote.\n\n\"He is absolutely wrong about what happens when people use marijuana,\" Zurlo wrote in a 2014 letter to LePage. \"Our officers are very clearly instructed on the fact that using or possessing marijuana is illegal whether or not you are receiving medical care.\"\n\nEven though LePage's state of the state's address was in Bangor, he had to miss out on the event that was scheduled for that time slot. He instead flew to Florida to participate in an unrelated fundraiser.\n\nThe attorney general added that her office would be reviewing the governor's \"potpourri of unfounded comments.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMaine voters rejected medical marijuana in a 2014 referendum. But if LePage really thinks that state-regulated marijuana would be illegal under federal law, he would likely have a strong case in court.\n\n\"Under the Controlled Substances",

      "I have a good friend named Joe, and he's a good guy, but he's not what one would call a super nice guy, especially about women. I mean he was nice, but I've never come across a guy that was like, \"Hey, I'd like to take you home\" to him. Joe knows his woman is out of his league. He knows that she's not a \"catch-all\" for his moods and that is something that Joe can't tolerate, and that is why he is never, EVER nice to me.\n\nSo I don't know how I started to resent my friend, but at some point during my early 30s (about 10-15 years ago) I did, and the reason I had the resentment is because Joe would ask me out and I would, like, say no. It wasn't that I felt like he was getting an unfair advantage over me, it was that I felt like he was using me to advance himself.\n\nI think part of why this was such a painful thing to deal with is not just that I didn't have any sort of control over it; I didn't even know how to talk about it. I know that women have their issues and I'm not trying to say that Joe is a perfect case in point, but it seems like he did this to me repeatedly for a long time before I started dealing with it. You see, I didn't even have to be dating; I just had a good job that let me have casual sex with anyone who asked about it. That's what I did, and you can see in my story how this went sour.\n\nI met Joe when I was 22 and 20. I was a pretty big, burly man, which meant that I attracted a lot of women. But I was also a lot drunk, and I was on campus for the first time at that point. And it was around this time when people start flirting with you, and maybe ask about your plans. There really isn't a way to really turn this around. I mean how can you say no to someone you're attracted to? It seems so foolish.\n\nIn any case, I did approach some guys before I met Joe. I'd start walking to my house, and they'd start talking to me about their jobs or something, and maybe they were trying to gauge if I was interested in them or not. I'd say yes to that, then later on I'd find out that it had actually been them who was interested. It happened a few times, and it was a little frustrating, especially after I started to be comfortable with things, because I'd be making a mistake later on that I wouldn't want repeated.\n\nDuring this time, when I was dating women, I was the guy who would go out in the daytime to take on any challenge that they asked. If a woman asked me out at a bar, I would never turn her down. I'd probably start dancing with her, and it wouldn't be that big of a deal to ask her out again in the evening. We'd be drinking beer together, and it'd all be fine and dandy. But if she asked me out at night, or during office hours when I was drunk, I'd politely decline, and that was that.\n\nJoe was different. When I first started seeing him, during my early 20s, he was around 20 years old. He was taller than me and bigger than me, but he was also one of the more charming older dudes I could have gotten in to. Maybe I was just a bit gullible, because he would seem like something special and the more time that went by I started to see the appeal in my friend, to think that he was a good catch for me.\n\nBut then something changed. Maybe I've grown numb to a certain kind of guy that is charming and good-looking, like Joe who always had these nice ties that would be hanging off his neck in all the photos. Maybe it's because he was younger than me at the time or that I never dated much and when I did it wasn't as much about romance as it was sex and just the two of us. Maybe it's just that I was just tired of being treated coldly. Maybe it's just that the more I got to know my friend, the more I realized that he was just a regular guy.\n\nI started to make moves toward meeting other women, but that just made things worse because now Joe was out there in the mix. It's a game to him; to put it in terms of the kind of guy he was, he was like a game show contestant who had just been told they had a good chance of winning the grand prize so they were all on the edge of their seats. We'd always make out together, and then we'd be like, \"Yo, I have something even better for you than kissing!\" He'd be like, \"Aww!\" He'd get a",
      "Catherine J. Frompovich\n\nActivist Post\n\n[ Editor's Note: I refer to this as the \"Trial of the Century.\" Also referred to as the \"Draconian Treatment of Chemtrails\"–which is still current, by the way, and continues to be supported by the federal government and many other governmental and regulatory agencies around the globe.]\n\nAs most people are aware by now—even if they might not have been aware of it—that in late 2010, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in Washington, DC, issued a report on the topic of \"chemtrails\" in relation to the phenomenon of \"weather modification.\" The factoid that they used the phrase \"climate modification\" did not cause a stir (if you want the specific report, I refer to the \"Technical Report on the National Weather Modification Program,\" which I wrote about here: http://www.drjamescomet.com/Chemtrails-Climate-Modification-Report-NIST-says-not-so-frequently-updated-by-the-Nasa-and-Nanjing-Weather-Modification-Center/?p=6.1), but they did come up with the factoid, if you could believe it, that the \"chemtrail spraying operation produces aerosols that are at least partly artificial… Some of these aerosols may be chemically or physically altered in a way that causes a biological effect… (I)magine the kind of chemical or biological changes that could follow release of a cloud of artificial contrails. They are just the kind of changes in physical chemistry that could affect atmospheric chemistry.\"\n\nNow, I am neither a scientist or a physicist. I am merely a writer and a science communicator, and as such, when I look back on the scientific background and rationale behind that claim, I am, in my opinion, astonished.\n\nThe NIST website was hacked and republished by other entities and websites as well as an article on Chemtrails Today on January 14, 2011, in which the aforementioned NIST \"scientists\" were quoted. This was the source of the \"chemtrail spraying operation produces aerosols that are at least partly artificial\" statement: http://www.chemtrailsnow.org/2011/02/16/chemtrail-spraying-operation-supports-global-warming-claims-theysays/\n\nIf you had not been reading that article, you had to wonder what in the world NIST is claiming for itself when it is writing these things of course. NIST is the National Institute for Standards and Technology (NIST). So, it must be a highly credible organization. But that does not say much other than they are competent and they are knowledgeable. So, that's a start.\n\nWell, in that article they claimed chemtrails could affect the atmosphere through the chemical reactions they could produce. For that matter, they said they could change atmospheric chemistry. So, I had to wonder how they would know there were chemtrails at all, and that they could control a chemtrail spray operation without using that term. That's the question NIST had. They certainly wanted to know, then, how they could have detected a chemtrail operation with their own instruments—if indeed they could have detected one, and not just by monitoring the skies. So, they wanted to know, then, what chemtrails might produce aerosols of various properties, and in what proportions. But that's not all they wanted to know because they would discover, in later parts of the report, that something would soon be discovered (and discovered they did) that could affect the atmosphere and the climate by that very chemtrail spray operation:\n\nA study of air samples collected around the United States and Canada (September–December 2000 to December 2005) showed that the chemical particles could have effects on climate. They found that aerosols produced by the aerosol spraying operations may produce changes in the chemistry and chemistry of the atmosphere by modifying the way in which solar radiation is reflected back to space. This has a number of possible influences on the climate. These include effects on cloud cover, rainfall, ozone, acid rain and ozone depletion, and changes in albedo [the amount of light that the Earth's atmosphere reflects back into space, which is important in that the sunlight is a heat source; without the albedo, many people believe that global warming can be expected, but that is another issue entirely that goes beyond this paper.]\n\nWhat exactly was produced out of the chemtrail spraying, and what would those have been to change the weather? Were they aerosols and would they have chemical properties that could change the climate? Who knows?\n\nAnyway, at that point, when you see NIST, you assume you are on a scientific committee, a scientific board, with your peers, in an academic setting. You can assume that you",

      "The following was written by my friend and neighbor, Gary, and published as an article in the March/April 1999 issue of The Mountain Sun.\n\nWe've received a number of emails with comments about this article. This is why we didn't answer all of them in print—I was writing this while on honeymoon. I am grateful for the interest shown in the article, including a lot of calls and emails over the years (you can't get things like that in the newspaper columns—or on TV, for that matter!).\n\nI just wanted to clear a few things up. A couple of points that sometimes get said but are not completely correct:\n\nI don't think I have any particular problem with people shooting guns, especially those at targets. It's just that I think it's good manners to do things right and don't like seeing people shooting guns in the middle of the day (which is why I don't own a gun; I don't like the way it makes me feel).\n\nThe way I feel is that I'm not the only one who sees some of this as unacceptable and irresponsible. There's a whole lot of us who feel differently. And so we don't like to see people shooting guns in the middle of the day. There's a lot of frustration with how little the local shooting community seems to care.\n\nMy friends think that the reason I don't own a gun is that I have some problem with guns as weapons... and that there are other shooters who could solve those problems for me. It seems to me that other shooters wouldn't bother to solve my problem of not having a rifle or shotgun and a place to shoot them that I could go to without worrying about someone coming after me.\n\nThere's a lot of discussion going on about whether I have some kind of problem with guns. For example, one blogger wrote: I have an opinion about that, too, except that I don't shoot guns. I have no problem at all with people shooting them. But I do not get on with people who are constantly on camera just shooting guns. I think I've been in some bad ones myself where I've let an emotional attachment overcome my common sense. I don't do that. I know it's wrong, and I don't do it again. I hate that people act so crazy for no reason. I don't know what other people's problem is--but I know mine isn't being on camera and screaming at people for no reason. I think I know what my problem is--being on camera and screaming at people for no reason. I don't know what it would be to be shot, but I do know that it would be horrible. So I have no problem being shot, if someone wants to shoot a video. What I've been trying to say is that it's OK if I'm shooting at a target. (The subject of the photo above being the same, by the way.)\n\nI haven't actually answered anything. I just wanted to clear things up.\n\nPosted by David at April 24, 2000 02:35 PM\n\nHere's a couple more thoughts on shooting:\n\nHere are a few questions about the shooting in this article:\n\nYou may not think there's anything wrong with the shooting. I would ask these questions however:\n\nWhy do you want to film anyone having a shooting match?\n\nWhy don't you make a bet on it?\n\nWhy aren't you there (to film the shooting)?\n\nWhy don't you shoot there (without filming anything)?\n\nWhy are you shooting at a target?\n\nWhy don't you make an example of someone?\n\nWhy don't you make an example of someone?\n\nWhy do you keep asking these questions? Why do you keep on asking questions?\n\nIf you are willing to take these questions seriously, then you might actually understand the answer to one of them. Otherwise you are just asking questions. If you are asking questions and not understanding why you are doing it, then you may be shooting for a target to get footage to film others for \"news video.\" This is the only reason you are shooting targets. You are not shooting for any purpose other than the camera's (film) benefit that will lead to your shooting video.\n\nIf your only goal is to film people shooting at things... then you aren't really doing anything of value other then getting into a YouTube video. I personally don't have a problem with that. But this isn't news; this isn't television, except for the camera which is the only thing that will record it. It's only \"news\" if someone tells you about it.\n\nI think there's a huge difference between doing something just for the camera's benefit and doing it for the whole world to see. There's a difference between that and what it would mean if people were actually shooting at each other or shooting at the camera. But for television and other news-type media that would be",

      "In one of the most remarkable moves of its career, the FBI has launched a criminal probe into the leak of CIA Director John Brennan's comments to Congress saying the Islamic State does not represent \"moderate Muslims.\" The New York Times first reported the memo, which also claims the Islamic State is part of al-Qaeda and is an outgrowth of the Taliban.\n\n\"It wasn't meant to be secret and the people who knew about this felt it should be secret,\" an official told the New York Times. \"What the intent of [Brennan's] speech was and what he meant to say is obviously very, very sensitive.\" That official said it appeared Brennan made the comments without consulting the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which has issued a statement backing away from Brennan's quote, saying, \"We do not believe al-Qaeda is an Islamic extremist group, and the suggestion that al-Qaeda is 'part of' the Islamic State is inaccurate and misstates the facts.\"\n\nBut even before Brennan's public statements about the Islamic State, the FBI had opened a preliminary investigation into a leak to the Times of a classified State Department briefing document about the threat posed by the Islamic State (also known as ISIS, ISIL and Daesh), but never completed any meaningful action after finding no wrongdoing that could be prosecuted, according to a recent internal memo obtained by Foreign Policy.\n\n\"The information is being shared with a variety of agencies as a result of reporting in both the national and international media that the documents have been shared,\" the memo reads. \"The New York Times has made clear that this material includes information derived from a source who is not associated with the intelligence community.\"\n\nThe leak of the memo by a former CIA official is being seized upon by Democrats who say the FBI is now looking into the leak of their communications with the press. Brennan's comments on Fox News about the Islamic State came as part of a public speech on the Islamic State in which he had previously said the United States should not use the term \"Islamic,\" because it could \"start World War III.\"\n\nObama, however, later said that the Islamic State is one of the biggest security threats facing both the United States and the United States' partners in the Middle East.\n\nBut now, with the United States embroiled in another conflict in the Middle East, the New York Times reports that the investigation by the FBI into the leak has prompted some intelligence officials to express concern that Brennan's statements could undermine his credibility on ISIS-related issues to the public.\n\n\"We're very sensitive to not tipping off anybody to what we think is sensitive information,\" one official told the Times. \"When the secretary of defense and secretary of state and the CIA director both got to the same place about the Islamic State, it's not the FBI that's handling this but the intelligence community and [the CIA].\"",
      "A recent spate of killings in Russia has raised fears of increasing violence and the risk of terrorist attacks. Russian President Vladimir Putin warned that the threat was \"very serious,\" and President Trump has spoken about the issue in his private and public conversations.\n\nBut in an interview with The New York Times ahead of his speech in Poland, Mr. Trump offered a less confrontational view and instead praised his administration's \"very strong\" policy against ISIS.\n\nIn his first public remarks on the issue, the president also said he did not feel that his new national security adviser, Michael T. Flynn, had misled him about conversations he had with the Russian government, according to a White House official.\n\nAfter the meeting, Mr. Trump tweeted his concerns.\n\n\"I had another meeting today with foreign minister from Russia. Much more in-depth than the short meetings I've had.\" Mr. Trump tweeted on May 10, adding: \"Much to learn.\"\n\nThe meeting took place on the sidelines of a NATO summit meeting in Brussels and was not initially listed on the public schedule.",

      "BANGALORE/CAIRO (Reuters) - The world's wealthiest nations on Tuesday set new targets for fighting climate change and announced a new U.N. pact to help poor countries cope with a warming planet, aimed at keeping it below 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 Fahrenheit) and preventing dangerous shifts in extreme weather.\n\nLeaders of the G20 group of biggest economies and emerging countries met for the final session of their summit, following days of deliberations in which they had worked hard to come up with a package of measures.\n\nThe measures include a commitment to do their utmost to limit global warming even if the United States withdraws from the Paris climate accord, which is due to come into force next year after being signed by nearly 200 countries and the European Union.\n\nU.S. President Donald Trump has criticized many aspects of the deal, including its requirement that rich countries pay billions to help poor countries combat climate change. But the leaders said they believed the United States would still honor its obligation under the agreement, to help poorer countries combat climate change.\n\n\"Our joint statement is a commitment that all of the world's major economies are making to move forward and to work together towards the goals of the agreement,\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron said in a joint statement that was read out live.\n\nThey stressed that the United States was still a part of the Paris Agreement and agreed to move forward in the Paris Agreement with its partners \"as it is for all countries.\"\n\nThe G20 leaders also committed to providing $100 billion a year by 2020 for infrastructure projects in countries, including $40 billion to help countries adapt to the impacts of climate change, and $40 billion in aid for disaster risk reduction and climate-related adaptation.\n\nAmong the other measures they said should be completed before the end of the century was an international tax on greenhouse gas emissions that can be used by countries.\n\nA tax on carbon dioxide, the main heat-trapping gas, would raise revenue for developing countries, and could also help poorer countries cope with climate change.\n\nAt the same time, however, the leaders agreed to provide less-stringent greenhouse gas limits to developing countries to improve their ability to adapt to climate change.\n\nThe leaders also decided to increase the financing they could spend in developing countries, and to expand assistance in disaster risk reduction and climate-related adaptation.\n\nIn a separate statement they also said that, if developed countries had been willing to provide financing to poorer countries to adapt to climate change, they would have done so by now.\n\nTrump and many of his cabinet officials have called global warming a hoax, a position that has been challenged in studies by U.S. agencies, U.N. agencies and academic institutions.\n\nThey said in the joint statement that they saw progress being made but that they were committed to the Paris accord.\n\nMany leaders at the G20 said they had decided to meet again in 2017, citing \"the urgency to achieve\" their goals in the Paris Deal.\n\nAfter the leaders, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull attended a lunch reception with leaders of the G20.\n\nThe G20 meeting will conclude on Friday.",
      "If a group of five men are looking for a female to be a prostitute for a day, they will find the following description helpful in describing the woman:\n\nHer skin is fair. She is dressed in black with silver brocade around and in the sleeves. She has white hair and eyes, which are very dark, and sometimes black in the same way. Her hair is arranged in braids, sometimes in large and sometimes in small groups. Her lips are sometimes pierced, or covered with a little ring. Her nose is very small and she has a small mouth. She has large arms and legs that go down to the knees and feet that are very rounded and pointed, like a woman who has never worked outside. She has an accent, or can be easily perceived, and is often spoken in a foreign tongue. When she looks at a man for sex, her eyes turn to him even though both are staring straight ahead, and there is the impression that her eyes may have a slight smile. She is very thin and has a small waist.\n\nAs with most descriptions of prostitute, the description is very broad and general. It is impossible to tell the specific characteristics of one individual in a situation similar to these described by one author. So, if you are trying to choose the 'right' prostitute, you should be looking for someone who exhibits all five of the characteristics listed. That is, they should be all of the following qualities:",

      "What it's like when everything goes wrong for a woman in Saudi Arabia...\n\nA woman in Riyadh has become the first woman to receive a sentence of 60 lashes for leaving Saudi Arabia to go to the UAE.\n\nNadia Khader has been sentenced to flogging for spending two months in the UAE, the same as the men sentenced to the same penalty for a similar offence.\n\nThe 22-year-old was not given any chance to appeal. She has already spent two months in detention at the women's complex in Riyadh.\n\nShe was detained as she was about to board a flight to Abu Dhabi, where she had spent her first two months.\n\n\"I was in Dubai for a month before being detained, I got to know a group of people who had come from London and they recommended I go there,\" she said.\n\n\"I got there and when I left, it was like a dream as I thought I was going to stay there for two months but I felt so bad when I got there.\n\n\"I thought the police at the airport asked me to leave because I got too close to my relatives. It was then that I remembered I have to go back to Saudi Arabia and I left.\n\n\"I am being punished for going to the UAE and for being in the UAE for two months. My husband told me I had been flogged and to do the sentence or I would not see him for 50 years.\n\n\"I know my husband will not do anything this way. We work together.\"\n\nWhile the sentence is harsh, it is also more lenient than the sentences a man is usually subjected to, which can include beheading.\n\nShe is also banned from travelling outside the country to seek help.\n\nThe woman is one of hundreds of women who have travelled from the Arabian Peninsula to the Gulf or the United Arab Emirates for the same reason.\n\nThe vast majority of them are from Yemen, but there are also women from Saudi Arabia and Jordan.\n\nWhile some are lured by fake job offers with better salaries in the Gulf, many are tricked into travelling to the UAE by their families, who convince them the countries are safe.\n\nThe majority, however, come from countries in Africa and the Horn where women are not allowed to travel without their husbands.\n\nThe United Arab Emirates is governed by a strict interpretation of sharia law, which includes punishments such as stoning women accused of adultery or taking away their children.\n\nLast month, a Saudi teenager was stoned to death for marrying a man of her own choice.\n\nMore than 800 women were stoned to death for adultery between January and October this year, according to local non-governmental organisation Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"The fact this young woman has been jailed so long and so harshly for a crime that is so common in other countries makes the punishment even more shocking,\" says Fraidy Reiss-Meili of Human Rights Watch.\n\n\"It shows how deeply men fear this kind of punishment for women in Saudi Arabia. It is a terrible message that she has received.\"\n\nA woman in Yemen was sentenced to be executed for \"illicit sex\" and \"inciting prostitution\" in May.",
      "On Thursday afternoon, in an event that should not have come as a complete surprise to anyone following the president's recent comments, Attorney General Jeff Sessions announced the Department of Justice will be reviewing its policies regarding the use of private prisons.\n\nIn the past week, Donald Trump has tweeted out that he will \"bring in [the] biggest wall on record\" to \"keep illegal criminals (along with criminals) out of this country, and to stop drugs from pouring into our country and poisoning our youth,\" but has also stated that, in addition to ending the policy of accepting federal prisoners' immigration detention fees, he will also \"close down private prisons.\" If that sounds like you've been living under a rock these past years, that's because it has.\n\nThe president's policy has always been to end federal involvement in private prisons (though he's since changed his mind), and the announcement today was hardly an endorsement of private prisons. But Sessions is right to call attention to the fact that the private prison industry has become a \"major player in the federal prison system,\" and that the federal government is \"increasingly relying on the services of private companies to house federal prisoners.\"\n\nThe Obama administration had taken an \"anything goes\" approach to incarceration, and Sessions is correct to point out that while private prison spending was declining at the federal level before the Obama administration came into office, that trend has continued in the last five years. The Justice Department estimates that the federal government now spends about $80 million per year at private prisons. At a time when the federal prison population stands at almost 2% of the total and has been trending downward, the federal government is spending huge amounts of money to house non-violent criminals, including foreigners convicted of crimes — who are often sent to these private prisons at enormous expense to taxpayers.\n\nWhen Sessions announced the reviews on Thursday, he said: \"We will be reviewing policies regarding private prisons, including those in Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Iowa, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Nevada, New York, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, and Texas.\"\n\nThe Justice Department's recent report on the private prison-industrial complex found that the industry has \"strong incentives to maintain a strong prison population.\" This results in high costs for taxpayers when inmates are housed in private prisons. It also creates \"serious potential for fraud.\" And in case you didn't know the history of the private prison industry, the Justice Department said, \"The industry has been accused of operating with lax oversight, resulting in abuses that include substandard medical care, lax security, and rampant prisoner assaults on staff. There is little evidence of meaningful competition among private prison companies and a small number of profitable corporations that control the vast majority of the business.\"\n\nIn addition to the Department of Justice, Sessions is also responsible for the Bureau of Prisons, which oversees nearly all the nation's federal prisons. He said his agency would \"develop a comprehensive policy to reduce the overburdened Bureau of Prisons with fewer privately owned detention facilities.\" The federal government already operates a little over 100 private prisons, which has helped build an industry that is worth an estimated $4 billion each year by providing the federal government with a reliable source of inmate labor for federal contracts. The federal prison system may not be privatized overnight, but what it does get cut back on should be a win for the American people.",
      "We don't have long to wait to find out if the 2016-17 NBA season is indeed shaping up to be the most compelling one in a long time. We've seen several teams make the playoffs, but only 17 NBA teams have the potential to make the playoffs and the Warriors are the only team with the talent and potential to go the distance.\n\nHowever, before we get too excited and the hype train rolling to get to The Finals, let's take a little break from the Warriors and take a look at how teams on the outside of the top 8 or so have done in their respective conferences:\n\nIn the East:\n\nTeam Record Record through March\n\n2. Boston Celtics 17-2 (16-2 @4 OT)\n\nAfter a great second half of the season which saw them win the most games in the NBA at 20 by a comfortable margin, the Celtics have been absolutely dominating the last few days, dropping a double-digit defeat in Detroit at home and putting up a 15-point win over a terrible Cavaliers team at the Garden. As expected, the Hawks were able to keep the Celtics in it, but with an early-season win at home against the Celtics and an early road win over the Clippers, the Celtics sit in the top 4 with a 5 1/2-game lead for the top seed in the conference behind the Pistons.\n\n3. Detroit Pistons 20-15 (18-11 @2 OT)\n\nIf it wasn't obvious enough with the way things have been going for the Pistons, you would think they'd already have their hands on the #1 seed and likely a 1st round series vs, LeBron and The East. The Pistons have the talent and experience necessary to reach the Finals, but as the Cavs' victory over the Celtics showed us again, you can't overlook the good teams at the end of the season. The Pistons are 5-5 on the season with an average point differential of -3.5, but the Cavs were 3-9 and had a -11 point differential. The Pistons will look to get those two wins back and take advantage of an Eastern Conference that has gotten better, but the Cavs, Bulls and Raptors still are looking like contenders.\n\n4. Cleveland Cavaliers 18-10 (18-7 @2OT)\n\nThe Cavs came out strong in the second half, putting up a 24-point lead vs. Boston late in the game. Unfortunately, the Cavaliers' defense let them down and the Celtics capitalized with two late baskets, the first coming on a missed three-pointer from J.R. Smith, to go to 22-15. The Cavs have been dominant on the offensive side of the ball and the Celtics were able to put up a fight, but the Cavs' backcourt rotation has been very impressive. I personally still think the Cavaliers are better because of their star players (James, Kyrie, Love, Irving) being able to put up numbers while playing through an injury, but I think it's fair to say that the Celtics have figured it out a little bit.\n\n5. Toronto Raptors 19-12 (17-13 @3 OT)\n\nThe Raptors had a great start, going 10-3 to bring their record to 16-7 and had a strong showing vs. Miami in London with a 27-point win at home. Sadly for the Raptors, they couldn't capitalize on Miami's poor start and have struggled to put anything together over the last few weeks. After that great stretch, they started to get on a hot streak in the 5 games, including a big win as well in San Antonio on Feb. 25 where Toronto shot well over 50 percent in the first half and got big contributions from Terrence Ross, P.J. Tucker, DeMar DeRozan and Greivis Vasquez. Unfortunately, with only 8 games to go for the Raptors and the NBA's 2nd-worst offense (107.2 ppg) there probably is a stretch of games where they can't put this team on his back, regardless of the injuries. For the Raptors to go deep into the playoffs, they'll have to win three of their last four games, which could be difficult if they don't have other players stepping up to help them.\n\nIn the West:\n\nTeam Record Record through March\n\n4. Golden State Warriors 20-6 (20-6 @5 OT)\n\nThe Warriors are still winning, still undefeated, still a little down at the start of March. The Warriors are on a 23-game win streak and have dropped just one game in the last 14 contests. The Warriors have been averaging 115.8 ppg, which is a little concerning because the Warriors don't seem to be getting good shooting in. Golden State's offense currently ranks 22nd in the league in points per game (108.2) and the Warriors are having to rely on Curry and Thompson to score the majority of their points.\n\n5. LA Clippers 16-3 (14",
      "The idea that Trump is capable of making friends for himself and his fellow Republicans is ridiculous, and it will not be tolerated – and if Trump does it, he will lose the Republican nomination and his election to the Presidency. It's not about \"pals\" and, yes, there will be Trumpkins who will be there for him. It is simply a sign that the game has changed, and there are no \"yes\" people left for Trump.\n\nTrump has a major problem in that – in spite of the fact that he is not a politician – he is being watched by hundreds of people. For the first time in more than a century, the whole country can be watching in horror as they watch The Donald make an illogical, indefensible decision that will result in the American electorate dumping him at the first opportunity. It is a huge psychological and public relations failure.\n\nThis is why, in order to have any chance of winning the Republican nomination, Trump must be seen to make sensible and rational decisions. He needs to look like he can and wants to make good decisions rather than just show that he can make bad ones. This is why Trump is, of course, under constant surveillance and has no phone (other than his own and the phones of surrogates). He needs to be careful not to look like he wants to talk to Russia, or that he wants to get rid of the nuclear triad, or that he wants to attack or torture our own enemies. He needs to look like he knows what he is doing – and when he does make mistakes he needs to immediately apologize to everyone.\n\nThe idea that Trump is capable of making friends for himself and his fellow Republicans is ridiculous, and it will not be tolerated – and if Trump does it, he will lose the Republican nomination and his election to the Presidency. It's not about \"pals\" and, yes, there will be Trumpkins who will be there for him. It is simply a sign that the game has changed, and there are no \"yes\" people left for Trump. And it has nothing to do with what a person would do if there were no \"yes\" people left for him to make friends; that person's priorities should be different.\n\nI am sure that many, many in the Trump campaign wish that they could get away with saying things like \"We're all Russians now\" or \"We're taking over the world now.\" That is not the Trump of today, that is someone who has been in politics a while, where the people are always watching you, and can spot the obvious mistakes you are making.\n\nI am certain that the Trump of today does not want to insult our allies, or even our enemies. But I will bet money that he does not wish for this campaign to end, either. After all, he wants to win. He just doesn't think he should have to.",
      "Mixed martial arts is a highly unusual sport, in part because of the number of rules it requires its competitors to follow. For an athlete to be considered \"professional,\" he must not only follow all the rules but also be competent in them.\n\nFor example, a fighter who can't beat a man with a four-ounce can of tuna doesn't become a professional — at least in the eyes of the state athletic commission.\n\nThe rules are, of course, the reason fighters pay millions of dollars to train in a sport that is extremely physically taxing.\n\nWith the sanctioning body's current guidelines, MMA fighters are required to have an \"excellent\" ground-and-pound game, or else they're no longer considered professional, according to a report from MMA Fighting's Ariel Helwani.\n\nOne rule I've always liked about the California State Athletic Commission is that its rules are so confusingly broad that even its own employees don't really understand them. That's the case with these MMA combatant rules:\n\n• Fighters have to be able to use elbows in either a forward or backward motion.\n\n• Fighters also have to be able to throw, catch and control a fighter at any point during the fight.\n\n• Fighters are either required to be able to \"escape\" from a clinch, or they have to have \"effective leverage\" to throw punches or elbows that can hurt a fighter's head.\n\nThis, of course, is the whole idea behind cage fighting, and its main focus has been to preserve the integrity of the opponent's body and head, especially as a way to reduce head injuries and give fights a dramatic, \"wow\" factor rather than simply a one-on-one slugfest.\n\nSo, for example, in a cage match, a boxer who isn't able to take a punch to the jaw may be unable to continue in the bout — even if the boxer manages to land a solid right cross to the opponent's head. But, the fighter can still escape to the back with a rear naked choke. But if the boxer's opponent has been \"crushed\" against the ropes and loses a fight to the rear naked choke, then the fighter in question can no longer be considered a boxer.\n\nSo, a fighter fighting in a cage who is unable to effectively apply the rear naked choke is no longer considered a boxer. But a fighter not able to effectively apply a rear naked choke isn't a fighter. The UFC has long maintained that fighters who can't throw punches and elbows for the most part are \"no rules fighters,\" and they're able to do plenty of damage by \"running\" and \"kicking.\"\n\nFor instance, when the UFC decided to expand the lightweight division to include more than 11 fights this year, it put pressure on the California commission to sanction some of those 12 fights. The commission passed the request along in hopes of getting the sanctioning body to issue more licenses per month.\n\nThe commission told MMA Fighting that \"anyone with a license and insurance to fight\" would be issued a license, and the commission said it was confident UFC fighters would not break any rules in any of the 12 new fights.\n\nNow that the UFC has completed 11 fights, California has yet to issue a license, and it looks like that might be coming. In this case, however, this has almost nothing to do with the legitimacy of fighters as it does with the viability of the sport.\n\nAccording to Helwani, the commission believes the UFC's recent history of not paying its fighters is an issue that has to be taken seriously.\n\n\"I'm not talking about the first fighter in your career getting $8,000 for a 10-rounder,\" Helwani said. \"That's a ridiculous payday. I'm talking about a company that's paying fighters $1 million from one bout and then $3 million for the rest of the contract.\"\n\nUFC officials have already responded to this, offering the commission's request to grant licenses and insurance to 12 fighters per event, per Helwani.\n\nAccordingly, California officials have taken the stance of \"We already give them the other 12 fights per year,\" according to Helwani. The commission is now considering the request by the UFC to increase the number of fighters each license applicant is guaranteed when it comes to the license fee.\n\nAccording to Helwani, the commission has offered to increase the fight number per event to 15, and the UFC has agreed to this.\n\nIf a fighter is willing to take those additional fights, there are provisions included that allow for those fighters to be allowed to wear additional gloves without having to pay a different license fee.\n\nThe commission has a \"minimum requirement\" for gloves. These require that the fighters being compensated for the fights be able to throw punches and elbows in both a forward and backward motion.\n\nThe California commission has offered that minimum requirement and has asked that the UFC agree not to change it.\n\n",
      "The federal government should stop prosecuting people in possession of small amounts of marijuana, Justice Minister Peter MacKay said Monday.\n\nSpeaking in London, MacKay said he has already asked the government to look at the issue of marijuana.\n\n\"I haven't looked at it at the federal level, but I would argue that the federal government should take a look at that as well,\" MacKay said in a wide-ranging interview with a dozen reporters outside the offices of Maclean's magazine.\n\n\"I think it is important for us to say we are not going to prosecute people for possession of marijuana, that is a very, very small amount.\"\n\nSpeaking at a breakfast conference hosted by Canadian Jewish News, MacKay was asked about the arrest this month of 23-year-old Michael Lacey, who has been held in jail more than three months to face a total $1-million in fines and penalties following a November arrest for possession of marijuana.\n\nLacey had been in the country several weeks before the incident but admitted to police he possessed only four grams of marijuana at the time of his arrest.\n\nHe was jailed for 15 days, and was prohibited from possession of the drug for 18 months, according to a report in the Free Press newspaper.\n\n\"I think there are circumstances when there are very real consequences in terms of criminal charges and incarceration, and I think we have to recognize that,\" MacKay said.\n\nHe said he is looking at marijuana in the same way he looked at sex offenders and alcohol abuse.\n\n\"I will look very hard at anybody who is using marijuana as an excuse to do something, who has been using marijuana, that is going to be prosecuted,\" he said.\n\n\"And it may be appropriate to decriminalize marijuana to the same extent as we decriminalized alcohol,\" he added.\n\nMacKay's intervention on Monday sets the stage for changes to the law that would see cannabis legal for medical purposes, and perhaps even for recreational use.\n\n\"The reality is that we have no laws on the books in Canada that require doctors to have a patient who is using this for their pain,\" MacKay said.\n\n\"That is our role as health authorities. We are the ones who are going to have to decide how we are going to deal with that kind of situation ... that's our obligation.\"\n\nMacKay also said he will raise the matter of marijuana with his federal counterpart Vic Toews later this week.\n\nThe minister went on to say drug legalization is a \"priority\" for his government but added the issue will be debated \"in a civilised manner.\"\n\n\"These policies aren't based on any religious or moral beliefs,\" he said.",
      "\"As a public servant in the City Council, and at the Department of Housing and Human Services, I have seen the work that you and your team have done to improve the lives of those at the greatest need in our great city. We have a great opportunity as a nation, as individuals, and as citizens to use all of the tools at our collective disposal to make our society more fair. One of those tools, which I have seen you put into action in the last year, can be found in your new housing ordinance. I am sure you will be proud of the measures that you have initiated to improve the lives of those who are homeless. This ordinance is about building a stronger, more equal society. My friends, I can tell you tonight that there is good reason why my friends on the Council are willing to accept the responsibility to make the best policy decisions that will ensure that the people of San Francisco are kept safe, our neighborhoods prosper and San Francisco remains a place where any person can afford not to be homeless. I encourage you to pass this bill, and believe me, I hope you will.\"\n\nSan Francisco District Attorney George Gascon, a former prosecutor and former judge, was one of three people who said he would vote against the legislation. The other two people were Councilmembers Mark Farrell (D-At Large) and Aaron Peskin. The other nine were not listed.\n\nIn contrast, Mayor Ed Lee said in his statement, \"Housing is becoming unaffordable for more of our residents, increasing our homeless population and threatening our entire economy. San Francisco should be a model for the country. We are on the cutting edge of affordable housing, but we need to continue to work on the problem of homelessness.\"\n\nFarrell told The Examiner that the current housing crunch will never be solved unless the city allows private developers to build more affordable housing.\n\n\"The problem starts at homelessness,\" Farrell said. \"Our goal right now is to increase the stock of affordable housing, while protecting our neighbors from the rising rents that the market is driving. We need a system that allows more housing to be built, not less. If we're serious, then we need to reduce the barriers to creating new housing by reforming the permitting system.\"\n\nHe added, \"The law that I just signed will put an end to rent control as we know it. Rent control, it was enacted as a tool to preserve affordable housing, but it's not an issue now. In fact, there are people who are renting in the District who couldn't be afford to rent in San Francisco if the law weren't on the books.\"\n\nSan Francisco State University sociology professor David Campos, who was also involved with the Housing Affordability and Livability Agenda, said he was disappointed that some members of the Board of Supervisors weren't willing to go to bat for the residents of San Francisco. Campos said San Francisco should be proud of its history of protecting and protecting the most vulnerable residents; and that the city must work for those who are already struggling.\n\n\"In that same vein, I'm not at all impressed with the Mayor's claim that he supports the homeless,\" Campos said. \"If people who are homeless are a minority and don't have large financial resources the city shouldn't help them. If we are seriously going to address affordable housing in San Francisco how do you think that's going to help homeless people?\"\n\nCampos added that while he didn't like that two of the three members of the Board of Supervisors who would vote against the ordinance had ties to the San Francisco Housing Authority, he thought it might be a good idea for them to vote his way so he could put more money into the housing problem.\n\nFarrell said: \"I think I'm going to vote against it because it has nothing to do with the people at the homeless encampments. It's simply about whether the government should intervene in the market and let some people live. I'm for preserving the city's most historic public places. This is not a real solution.\"\n\nThe mayor's decision to back the legislation was expected after he spoke out against the California Environmental Quality Act in 2016, which would require that new housing include environmental features (such as rainwater capture) and that new construction be accompanied by a certificate from the San Francisco Planning Department.\n\nThe City Attorney's Office would not comment on how much the measure will cost. It is likely to cost hundreds of millions of dollars to update the city's code to include these provisions.\n\nThe city will continue its long effort to pass an affordable housing bond in November.",
      "The following is a guest post by David Johnson, a graduate student at Cornell University and editor of The Future of Jobs.\n\n*****\n\nBy now the argument over the future of employment has reached epidemic proportions. From a global perspective, we have entered the period of the third industrial revolution, and as an economy we are undergoing changes at an accelerated pace. While those changes will have big impacts on employment, and in turn on workers' and their families' well-being, there are a handful of key questions that we need to get right to ensure that they don't create economic and social problems to plague us.\n\nThe first question is: What will the workforce look like in 2020? By 2020, many of the key features of the future workforce are likely to play out: robotics and artificial intelligence will be a more familiar and accessible force, more workers with higher education levels and skill sets will be in higher-wage jobs, and automation will be more ubiquitous in the jobs we do.\n\nWhile much of this will be happening in China, and other developing countries that are currently undergoing massive demographic changes, other countries are also likely to be affected. For example, the US's high-profile political race — and subsequent focus on the role of automation — will likely affect US employment in the near-term, both through its potential effects on wages and its potential implications on voter choice.\n\nOther aspects of the workforce can also play into this dynamic. For example, when a company's supply needs increase, the firm will likely have to open higher-skilled positions and that in turn may drive up the demand for labor within other occupations, and so on.\n\nAt the same time there is an ongoing struggle between the need for automation as well as for work that is difficult and unpleasant, with the robots and artificial intelligence revolution in particular being used by employers to replace unskilled labor.\n\nEven as the effects of robots and artificial intelligence become more evident, much remains unknown about them. For example, the robots themselves will be invisible, the ways in which they are designed and used will be mysterious to us; they are likely to be very powerful, but may operate in a way that is outside of the usual rules we have for automating tasks, such as making something easy to do; their internal structure will likely not be fully understood; and more.\n\nAnd as with any complex system, we should not get too focused on specific issues and solutions as we embark on the new workforce future.\n\nIn fact, one of the key issues that we should be careful not to focus on is the question of economic mobility. The recent political debate over globalization is the latest example of how the question of income mobility and inequality between countries is becoming the predominant concern of scholars, policymakers, and the public.\n\nThe question of economic mobility will be very important to policy for a long time to come, and policy should address it.\n\nWhat are the trends on mobility that are at play?\n\nOne factor that will be very important to the success of artificial intelligence (AI) and robots will be how effectively and efficiently we can harness the skills they bring to our workplace, in areas such as the ability to learn, the ability to think critically, and the ability to express complex ideas in clear and effective ways. By the end of the century, that will likely be a key issue for our economy as it evolves from an economic engine to a consumer economy.\n\nThis will mean that companies that are best at managing that process (as opposed to having the best algorithm) will be rewarded, and that those who are not, and who are less than the highest performers, may be left behind. We also know that the more education a person has, the more likely that they are to be in higher paying and better paying jobs, particularly in the US and other advanced economies.\n\nBut when it comes to mobility between countries and education levels, there are many factors at play; the factors that seem most significant are:\n\nThe ability of people to learn different languages and to acquire and retain relevant skills in those languages and other languages. It's well documented that the ability to learn different languages and acquire and maintain competency in such skills increases the likelihood that you become a business owner in a country with that language. The same thing is true for the ability to acquire and retain competency in skills to a high level. An education is not necessarily a substitute if one does not know, or do not have, the ability to acquire and keep competency in such skills. If a foreign company is setting up a new research facility in the United States, for example, the question has to be whether those workers are the right ones to bring in from abroad, and how well they are trained. It's also important if those workers are those with the skills that their employers have identified as necessary, in addition to the competency to acquire and retain the competency.\n\nThe ability of people to move to and within countries.\n\nThe presence of legal and enforcement frameworks such",
      "\"I've been to the White House, [House Speaker] Nancy Pelosi, the [Senate] Majority Leader,\" Sen. Cory Gardner said in a phone interview on Thursday. \"I really want to make sure that the president has the resources he needs, whether it's money or staff, to work with Congress, because that's what it feels like with this White House. People are frustrated with the lack of cooperation that they see.\"\n\nIn his interview Wednesday, White House chief of staff John Kelly said he's heard from Trump \"about a dozen times\" about health care.\n\n\"He doesn't call Congress,\" Kelly said. \"He calls the senators: I talked to him about that yesterday. I have every confidence in the ability of the Senate to get things done. He has expressed his concerns — not only about the cost, but about the repeal legislation. He would like to make certain that it's repeal and replace, because what it did for him and for a lot of people was to provide a new way forward on health-care reform.\"\n\nKelly also said there's a \"small group\" of senators who have told him \"there is no appetite in the Senate to move on repeal. If there is a single senator that wants to do repeal and replace, I could not put a time stamp on the [presidential] schedule right now and do that. He has no preference in that regard. The president hasn't said that he wants to move to repeal but not replace. The Senate is looking at repealing and replacing in one piece. We've got to get the costs down that everyone agrees are unaffordable.\"\n\nThe president has been \"very clear,\" Kelly added, that he wants the repeal and replace effort to be \"the beginning of something great.\"\n\nStill, many Republicans are skeptical that any bill — let alone legislation that repeals parts of the Affordable Care Act — can pass the Senate.\n\nAs much as Kelly insists that the Senate is a step closer to approving a bill repealing and replacing Obamacare, Senate Republicans have signaled to both The Post and Politico that they don't expect to leave town until late June.\n\n\"They were talking about it [as of Tuesday] … but it was a last-minute change,\" Sen. John Boozman (R-Ark.) told The Post.\n\nEven then, Boozman and other senators expressed hesitation over how much time would be necessary to move a bill.\n\n\"We can't go over two months,\" Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.) said.\n\nIn a joint statement Wednesday afternoon, Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska) insisted that they will not vote on any health-care overhaul until they are assured that they will be able to buy insurance on the Obamacare marketplaces.\n\n\"As we continue the work of crafting long-term reforms that will repeal Obamacare for good and lower health care costs, we plan to get regular updates throughout the legislative process to make sure our constituents have updates on the legislation we are crafting,\" the senators said in the statement.\n\n\"Despite our efforts to work together, Senate Republicans cannot agree on a full repeal of Obamacare. Our current goal is to get to 'trust but verify' for Americans and their families. That includes working with our respective caucuses to ensure that people with pre-existing conditions are able to purchase coverage in the individual insurance market and that no one is left out in the cold. Additionally, we need to pass tax reform and major infrastructure bill, among other items. The Senate remains on track to have those items completed by the beginning of September, provided we can achieve consensus.\"\n\nSenators have discussed some of their concerns with the House's plan, Sens. Patty Murray (D-Wash.), John Thune (R-S.D.), Bill Cassidy (R-La.), Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) and Roger Wicker (R-Miss.) told reporters Wednesday.\n\n\"I have heard a lot of reasons [from senators] why they don't want to repeal Obamacare,\" Thune said. \"And I would say, broadly, that on the basis of my discussions with many of our members, a lot of them have been very clear to me that they want to repeal some of the Affordable Care Act.\"\n\nBut GOP leaders have long tried to prevent senators from holding up the House bill until they agree to their own plan.\n\n\"You have to get the legislation on the president's desk that is going to be passed,\" House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) told reporters Tuesday. \"You'll have votes. But ultimately it's not going to be enough if you're going to pass a Republican bill that has zero Democratic support.\"\n\n\"I don't talk to the president much about the legislative process,\" Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) told reporters Wednesday, \"but generally it's pretty clear that [Sen. Mitch McConnell] is",

      "As the U.S. election continues to produce more and more headlines, most of the coverage has been on Donald Trump. But, like almost everything else about the race, it is too soon to tell what will happen.\n\nThat's because we have only one election to go and most polls show the race very close. (It's even getting close in battleground states, such as Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Florida.) Yet so many pundits seem to think they know what the outcome will be.\n\nThis is because the media, in an early season display of how little it knows, took some questions from journalists on Trump's candidacy at a Politico Playbook breakfast this week. Most asked about their candidates' plans, and many didn't even use phrases such as \"pivot\" and \"move to the center\" correctly.\n\nTake the response from Matt Drudge, who asked former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin about her views on abortion.\n\n\"Will you consider it before you say that it is murder if a woman is raped?\" Drudge asked Sarah Palin during an interview about a story about Republican Senate candidate Roy Moore.\n\n\"Well, I'll get to that,\" Palin said.\n\n\"So will you be in favour to legalise it?\"\n\nPalin said that \"every life is valuable, in my mind, every life is precious.\"\n\n\"I don't know the legal status of, what constitutes an abortion,\" she added.\n\n\"You're pro-life, but you have a position here. I know it's not very popular, so let me ask one more time: will you be in favour to legalise. It is a serious matter, but also does it mean that you will be pro-life and will you be in favour for a woman to have an abortion?\"\n\nPalin, who is running for vice president with Trump, said she would \"get back to you. I'm here for the campaign as well.\"\n\nOn Saturday, Palin gave another interview with Drudge and went even further.\n\n\"I don't know,\" she responded when asked if she would support abortion if a rape survivor's life was in danger.\n\n\"But I'm sorry. I have no idea,\" Palin said, before going on to praise the woman's pregnancy.\n\nTrump, who has suggested that women who get abortions should be punished if they're impregnated against their will, has also had trouble getting a word in edgewise on his views on the issue.\n\nFor instance, this week he said: \"I do think it's terrible if they go ahead and that young woman gets the abortion. It's terrible. It's really bad. But it happened. Now she's 25 years old and it's a real problem. You know there's no penalty? It's terrible, but it happened. And she's, like, maybe she doesn't like the 40 – or 50 years of being pregnant.\"\n\nHe has also insisted that no one is talking about punishing women who get abortions.\n\n\"The people that don't want to make this a bigger deal, and frankly, some of those people are the abortionists, are the ones that are saying you took the life of a beautiful baby,\" Trump said on Twitter last week, in response to a New York Times report on his comments at a rally about forcing women to get abortions and describing abortion as murder.\n\nTrump has also made it fairly clear that he doesn't agree with a provision of the Republican replacement plan to overturn the Hyde Amendment, a ban on federal funding for abortions.\n\n\"I'm very strong on [abortion restrictions],\" he told the Christian Broadcasting Network last week. \"If we're in this country, we're going to have to leave it, but we're not going to have it taken away from us.\"\n\nIn fact, Trump has been vague about whether he supports taxpayer funding for abortion, which is a legal practice in states such as California. He does, however, insist that, in general, he opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother and that women should have \"total control\" over their bodies.\n\nHis position has come under greater scrutiny thanks to Trump's stance on abortion.\n\nA new NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll from mid-October found that 62 per cent of Americans supported allowing abortions for women who are victims of rape or incest. In most cases, the ban on federal funding for abortions would prevent hospitals from providing the procedure. But according to the survey, 40 per cent of Americans \"would not have to pay for an abortion if a woman's life is in danger.\"\n\nThe only times Trump has expressed support for a ban on abortion funding came in a 2005 audio recording and a 1997 interview with Howard Stern, the talk-show personality.\n\nThe tape and the Stern interview, leaked and obtained by Buzzfeed News in late October, resulted in the cancellation of Fox News host Bill O'Reilly's show in May.

      "Taken out of context, the word \"transgender\" can mean just about anything. And the American Psychiatric Association, as of this month, seems to agree. The APA has announced that it will no longer include \"transgender\" in its official guidebook, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM), the American Psychiatric Association's official journal.\n\nIt's official. The APA will delete the word from DSM-5. Read more here: https://t.co/9oLKt1Hf5d #transgender pic.twitter.com/jn0ZlRf6cG — Landon Thomas (@landonthomas) January 10, 2017\n\nThe APA said it was a matter of principle: \"For decades, the American Psychiatric Association has used the term \"transgender\" to describe individuals with cross-gender identification, but there is no scientific evidence that one's gender identity changes after medical transition.\"\n\n\nThe association's statement is important because, as the Washington Post explained, it effectively makes any other mention of transgender or gender-nonconforming people as being \"in opposition to expert opinion.\" And experts are in general agreement that, \"It's impossible to prove medical transition actually changes your gender.\" As this New York Magazine story points out, \"Psychological evidence suggests gender-nonconforming people's gender identity has not changed with gender-affirming interventions. And a large body of research suggests the vast majority of people who seek and undergo gender-affirmative treatment experience psychological distress. 'The research overwhelmingly says that a lot of people are just not going to stick with it,' said [a psychiatrist who uses and advocates for gender-nonconforming people]. 'They can't help themselves.'\"\n\nAnd as the APA admits about the word, it's not just \"fringe people\" who believe that \"transition\" is \"psychological\" or \"hormonal,\" but also the American Medical Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the World Professional Association for Transgender Health, the American Psychological Association, and, of course, the American Psychiatric Association's own members.\n\nThe fact that there is a growing movement within the mental health community to eliminate mental health terminology and treatments that are not based around the idea the mental health industry's version of transgender identity is part of a larger trend in the culture at large to treat people as if they're crazy.\n\nBut perhaps no word has as much, if not more, to offer transgender people than the word \"transgender.\" When they use it, the transgender people in question are not merely seeking to affirm their own \"non-normative\" identity, or to identify as a specific type of person. Instead, they are expressing their hope that being \"transgender\" will lead them to feel accepted by the people around them. And that hope should not be undermined, even if that hope comes in a different form than the one that mainstream society has accepted.\n\n\" 'Transgender' is not a mental illness,\" said Mara Keisling, executive director of the National Center for Transgender Equality – a group that has been fighting the exclusion of transgender-related terms and diagnoses in APA policy for years. \"There's a huge difference between a person with non-normative gender expression, or a person with a gender identity that is different from the sex they were assigned at birth. The difference is not just biological or physical.\"\n\n\"This is really about the way we talk about sex and gender,\" Keisling continued. \"It's not about what's in a person's head, or what they feel.\"\n\nThe only other way to look at an individual's gender identity is that it's a combination of all their identities – sexual, gender, and racial – and that is not just an aberration, but rather a defining feature. A person who is non-binary or genderqueer, for example, doesn't have one or the other sex, or the other gender. And a person who is cisgender – which does not refer to a person's gender identity, but rather their anatomy – doesn't have a penis or a vagina. \"I don't say 'born a boy' or 'born a woman,' I say 'born with a male reproductive body and a female body,'\" Keisling said. \"That is a person with the characteristics of a man or woman, and that is a person who possesses certain characteristics.\"\n\nThe idea that transgender people have a \"mental illness\" is not something new; it started to gain momentum as far back as the 1970s, when gender specialist and psychologist Kenneth Zucker wrote an influential paper entitled \"Sexuality and Masculinity: The Debate Continues.\"\n\n\"I don't want to trivialize [transgender people],\" Zucker told the Washington Post in 2009. \"I really do believe they deserve to be accepted.\"\n\nThe idea of \"cisgender\" is rooted in the belief, widely held among mental health professionals and",
      "From Halopedia, the Halo wiki\n\nA SPartan is a Spartan in the military of the UNSC, specifically as a Special Operations soldier[1], a member of Blue Team,[2] or a Spartan-IV, the \"specialized infantry.\"[3] SPartans are trained on a large variety of platforms, such as MJOLNIR GEN2 suits of powered armor, UNSC Warthogs, slipspace-capable M12 Warthogs (originally called M590 Bullpup Machine Guns), and M99 Stampede tanks, for example.[4]\n\nThe SPartan's primary role is to lead their team or act as a lead for a team.[5] The SPARTAN-IV is designed to be a team player, able to lead troops and vehicles with skill and expertise even the Spartans themselves may not possess. SPARTAN-IVs are often more intelligent, resourceful, and adaptable than their Spartans counterparts, often serving in combat roles like a gunner, gun loader, or driver—despite their intelligence, the SPARTAN-IVs rely on the other members of the team to coordinate such tasks.[6]\n\nMembers of Blue Team wear white armor with a blue chest plate and white visor, with the blue collar of their power armor on the chest plate. While other Spartan soldiers are usually seen with blue caps and helmets, Blue Team typically wears helmets with orange visors.[7] The color of the Spartan-IIs' armor is blue rather than blue and green, with their helmet colors being blue to their black armor. This is a deviation from the other branches of the military, where the Spartan-IIIs wear green helmets, and the Spartan-IVs wear orange.[6] Although the SPARTAN-IVs all wear different helmets, they share blue helmets. During the Fall of Reach, the SPARTAN-IVs wore white helmets with an orange visor, but were replaced by the Spartan-III in 2525.[1]\n\nTrivia [ edit ]\n\nThe Spartan gene was originally named after the Greek hero Spartan, in reference to his role in the Trojan War, though this name may have been intended to have a more military connotation.[8]\n\nList of appearances [ edit ]",

      "On Friday, a pair of reports from the Associated Press reported that President Trump is likely to withdraw the United States from this year's Paris pact. If so, that would be a big win for a handful of American fossil fuel companies, including Exxon, Chevron and Shell.\n\nThe Paris agreement is an international accord made by nearly 200 countries to slow climate change. It was a cornerstone of Barack Obama's presidency, and in his final month in office, he withdrew from it entirely.\n\nHere's what you need to know about why they'd be upset. First and foremost, the world has moved on from the previous climate treaties Obama was seeking to negotiate. The most recent accord, the Kyoto Protocol, was a highly symbolic pact. It was designed more to put pressure on rich countries like the United States (and particularly its former president) to act soon on climate change than to actually cut emissions. That agreement, too, is dead, having failed to accomplish its stated goal of avoiding at least 2 degrees Celsius of global warming.\n\nRelated: Why Trump has already done more to destroy the Paris Climate Accord than almost anyone thought possible\n\nTrump has repeatedly and publicly bashed climate change, going so far as to suggest that the U.S. is getting \"raped\" by the Earth's warming. He's called global warming a \"hoax\" and a \"big, fat con\" and a \"fraud.\" His proposed budget eliminates the U.S. contribution to several climate programs, and he's promised to pull the U.S. out of the Paris agreement altogether. The president has also reportedly been considering a \"sunset\" clause in the agreement.\n\nThese kinds of statements may have seemed shocking when Obama first put them forward, but it's not as if they would have done much to get other countries to take up the agreement.\n\nThe deal's fate would then fall to the next president. It would be up to future presidents to choose to uphold it or tear it down.\n\nThe Trump administration, however, would have to weigh all of those factors. They'd face opposition from Republican lawmakers in Congress, which has been highly skeptical about climate change, and from U.S. business interests.\n\nRelated: When it comes to climate change, it's hard to predict where the country would end up\n\nTrump's critics in Congress say that pulling out of the Paris Agreement would be a sign of weakness because other countries don't have to do much to curb climate change to stay on it. U.S. industry lobbyists have said that pulling out of Paris would be bad for business and economic growth, and there's some evidence to support that.\n\nThere's also considerable debate about the economics of climate action. Economists do agree that climate change could have substantial effects on the U.S. economy -- in the form of lower productivity and less investment, as well as higher greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) emissions -- but it may be difficult to pin exactly where the effects lie at this point in time.\n\nFor instance, most analysts agree that climate change has caused heatwaves in the U.S., and that has already led to reduced productivity throughout the economy. Still, Trump and his supporters claim that climate change is a hoax, so it's not as if a withdrawal would hurt them economically. They could easily come up with an excuse for why climate change doesn't fit their interests.\n\n\"It would be more economic damage for them than anyone else as far as the impact on the economy is concerned,\" says Christopher Knittel, director of the Energy & Climate Program at Columbia University's Center for Sustainable Developments.\n\nA withdrawal from the agreement would only be symbolic because it will take years to make good on President Trump's promise to cut greenhouse gas emissions by up to 28% in the United States.\n\nBut any withdrawal from the agreement could have real impact in the real world by making it more difficult for the United States to stay on the sidelines.\n\n\"There are more or less two options: Trump could decide to put in place something that would be a continuation of the Paris accord ... or he could choose to go a way to undermine it,\" Knittel says.",
      "\nA year ago I asked \"What if the government had made all of the world's cellphones? The answer wasn't surprising. The government wanted to keep the country secure.\n\nBut what if the government made all of the country's TVs? The government wanted to ensure the safety of its citizens from external threats.\n\nAnd what if the government forced everyone in the country to be on a cell phone? The government wanted to keep its citizens safe from the inside.\n\nWith the passage of the USA Freedom Act late last year the government abandoned all of its earlier plans to force everyone in the country to be on a cell phone. Now in the months before the expiry of the USA Freedom Act Congress has a golden opportunity to re-imagine how much our national security hinges on our ability to keep our personal information private.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe bill could force a major re-think across all sectors of our society. It could radically transform the face of social media. It could open the path to the full adoption of cryptocurrencies into the global financial system. It could allow the government to track our movements on the internet with the help of massive data sets. It could allow law enforcement to seize and modify the content of all communications and computers. It could force all Internet users to submit to the tracking of their every move and move.\n\nIn other words, every person in the country should be compelled to use a cell phone if they want their personal information protected. And every person should be forced to use a computer if they want their personal information to be protected.\n\nSo what are we waiting for?\n\n\"Our government has historically sought to collect and store enormous data sets. They've done so without a mandate or public oversight, and without any requirement for warrants or court orders. Our systems are woefully under-resourced to investigate and prosecute possible violations of the Fourth Amendment,\" said Justin Feldman, legislative counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union. \"The USA Freedom Act is a significant step in the right direction and we will continue to work with the Trump Administration and all our government colleagues to ensure the law is followed with respect to the full implementation and operation of this important legislation.\"\n\nFeldman said the USA Freedom Act would:\n\nMandate the collection of a vast amount of data. \"The first step towards creating digital 'big data' is an overwhelming demand for data,\" Feldman said. \"The USA Freedom Act would require the government to collect a staggering amount of data. If enacted, the bill would require a typical user to have access to almost 5 terabytes of data to conduct even a cursory query.\"\n\nMandate the retention of huge amounts of data. \"The bill requires the government to retain massive databases of all of the world's communication traffic, including the contents of all of our phone calls, emails and text messages, and the metadata for each of those communications. This creates a powerful new surveillance tool with no transparency or review,\" Feldman said.\n\nReinstate the data retention policy of the previous administration. The previous policy required all government databases be encrypted. This was removed during President Obama's five year term.\n\nImplement the \"backdoor search\" on all computer users. \"The government is already collecting data via a variety of surveillance techniques, some of which are very intrusive and invasive to users, and they are not subject to any legal process that requires judicial oversight. Our new legislative regime would reinstate the \"backdoor search\" so that the government could do the same kind of warrantless access to users' content. This would mean that data from every computer connected to the Internet at any time would become available. The government should not be allowed to access or collect the contents or content of email without the express authorization of the user whose email is being reviewed,\" said Feldman. \"We believe that backdoors for warrantless access to Americans' data are contrary to the constitution.\"\n\nCreate the \"National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center.\" \"The National Cybersecurity and Communications Integration Center will become a powerful central hub where the government will share the intelligence and intelligence-gathering information it's gathered with the private sector to aid in the creation of a cyber-security infrastructure to ensure our citizens stay safe on the internet,\" Feldman said.\n\nThe Freedom Act was a good start. The problem is, we now have an opportunity to finish the job and implement all the provisions.\n\nWe must, as an administration, complete the act and re-implement our promises to all of our citizens if we want this country to retain its leadership in the realm of technology.\n\nA lot of tech companies do well by making personal information completely private.

As we've seen in the aftermath of the Snowden revelations, these governments think the free market will protect them.\n\nBut a more mature and accountable government would understand from the outset that",
      "The United States is not likely to launch airstrikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) group in Syria before the first of the year even though the president announced he has authorized U.S. military planners to make adjustments in the military campaign in Syria.\n\nWhite House spokesman Josh Earnest told reporters Sunday about reports that the White House is in talks with Syrian rebel commanders to secure the support of the Syrian and non-Syrian military factions fighting ISIS.\n\n\"It is not the policy of the United States to seek combat troops on the ground in Syria,\" Earnest said. \"We're going to continue to work with the opposition and seek their support as we have been doing for months.\"\n\nBut when asked whether President Obama has authorized the U.S. military planners to make adjustments to the mission in Syria, he responded, \"I wouldn't refer you to the president on that.\"\n\nThe White House has said the U.S.' military planners have made no changes to the ground operations to protect American personnel inside the country.\n\nU.S. airstrikes in support of the rebels were only halted in early September. When the president announced in August that he authorized the offensive to battle ISIS militants, the U.S. military was targeting ISIS in Syria. The U.S. also began conducting airstrikes in 2014 fighting rebel groups such as the Jabhat al-Nusra in the eastern province of Deir Ezzor in Syria.\n\nIn August, the U.S. airstrikes began in Syria against ISIS militants in the region around the northern city of Raqqah, where militants have been battling the Syrian army backed by Iranian militias.\n\nThe U.S. began working with Syria's armed opposition as early as 2012 and the U.S., Saudi Arabia and Qatar were providing weapons and training to Syrian opposition. ISIS came to prominence in 2013 and was responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of Americans and thousands of Westerners in attacks and other atrocities around the world.\n\nEarnest said the U.S. is willing to work with Syria's armed opposition but added that Syrian President Bashar al-Assad \"has to be part of that\" as part of \"some sort of political transition.\"",

That means you don't need any of the other mods or the \"Ravage\" DLC. This mod only installs when you activate the \"A Blade in the Dark\" DLC, if you haven't already. If you've already activated a \"Shamelessness\" cheat item, you won't need to use Baldrick. You won't need to use the Vampire Lord cheat to make a vampire immune to magic. You won't need the Vampire's Amulet to make a Vampire immune to magic.- This mod doesn't make ANY changes to the game! It is fully compatible with everything in the game. As of version 3.0, I have not tested this mod with ANY other mods.It works by activating a number of scripts that are part of this mod. The scripts I use are as follows:This mod was inspired by the Skyrim \"Vampire\" mod by \"cobra6c\". Thanks go out to \"poejepants\" for helping me make the mod \"Baldrick\" that I use to make Baldrick work! Also, thanks to \"cobra6c\", a modder who inspired me to do my mod named \"The Dark Brotherhood - No Mercy.\" That mod, and many other very good mods, are part of a wonderful modding community that is full of help and inspiration.- If you don't use the mod \"Dawnguard\" and \"Dragonborn\" by \"DragonDude69,\" you will have to use this mod's \"Dragonborn\" compatibility patch to make Baldrick work. That patch can be found here:This mod is a derivative of \"Darkest Dungeons\" by \"TheDarkD\" and \"Skyrim Uncut\" by \"kryptopyr\" (as well as the Dark Brotherhood and \"Shamelessness\" cheat items). Those are mods I use to make this mod, and I was incredibly honored that kryptopyr used the work I put into this mod. I want to thank you both so much!Also, I want to thank \"DragonDude69\" for telling me about his mod called \"Ravage,\" and that I should look into it. I will, of course, add it to the \"Baldrick\" compatibility patch. Thank you very much again.",

      "\"The future of American manufacturing might well lie in China.\" - The Economist\n\nSince the start of the 2000s, the U.S. has seen a dramatic increase in manufacturing jobs, with the nation now boasting two million more positions than when the global recession began. While the U.S. economy has been performing better than expected, jobs in manufacturing do have a real impact on the economy as we've seen over the past decade. In fact, the U.S. had 5.9 million manufacturing jobs in 2000, and by 2016 the number was 10.6 million.\"\n\nThe United States now has 8.8 million jobs in the manufacturing sector, a number unchanged since 2010. \"But in those first 10 years, U.S. manufacturing employment almost doubled, from around 12 million in 2000 to 20 million today,\" according to an analysis by the Economic Policy Institute. \"Between 2001 and 2010, total manufacturing employment increased by nearly 50 percent, even as the manufacturing sector lost 25 percent of its workforce. The job growth was spread fairly evenly across manufacturing industries, with a significant share of jobs in the transportation and utilities, and information and communication technology, but not in manufacturing itself.\"",
      "A couple days ago, I attended a workshop with my friends at the Open University. The aim was to learn about my favourite piece of software and to share our enthusiasm about getting into the field and working with it: the Raspberry Pi. I was surprised to find that not a lot was knowd about this little board and the ecosystem around it. In an attempt to shed light upon this, I interviewed some people, some of which were my friends, to get some understanding for what this is all about and what it means to a lot of people!\n\nThis is the first in my series of interviews with Open Source enthusiasts. These people are passionate about Open Source and have worked in or have worked on a number of Open Source projects. We'll be covering their knowledge of a variety of Open Source technologies and applications and sharing our own experience and thoughts.\n\nLudovic:\n\nYou live in France, you play with many cool hardware, but one of your most favourite things is the Raspberry Pi. Tell us a little bit about yourself, what is your favourite app to play with?\n\nI'm Ludovic, I live in Paris and I'm 28 years old. I'm a Software Engineer and I love playing with various hardware components, but for the most part it is the Raspberry Pi. I'm a big fan of programming but I spend more time building stuff than coding, so when I go to play with Raspberry Pi, I do so with a passion. That's probably why I love it so much. I've built quite a bit of stuff with Raspberry Pi. I don't always know how to use it, and when I need to do something, my Raspberry Pi does it almost perfectly. I have a bunch of projects from different fields, some of them really interesting, some not so much. But in my spare time, I like to play games, write articles and code programs. My favorite app for Pi is my home automation network - the \"Ludwig\" system. It's an open source system based on RPi (a linux box with an SD card), for the purpose of making it possible to control your home network in a simple and elegant fashion by means of any smart devices (like you see below) that run the software. The \"Ludwig\" system also provides the possibility of building a really powerful web interface with a web-based web-server (the Raspberry) and a powerful python script. It's based on the open source \"Zabbix\" software.\n\nJulien:\n\nHello, I've been using the Raspberry Pi for about two years. I was looking for someone to interview on the subject of your favourite software and tools. Would you kindly share your views on what you do when you play with the Raspberry Pi?\n\nMy favourite things are mostly programming and playing with the Raspberry Pi. I've been using the Pi for two years now and I'm not really in touch with it very much. In a word, my use for it is limited and for most of the time I don't use it at all. However, this is a fact of being a programmer, especially since I'm a fan of Linux. I'm very familiar with programming and with the Python programming language. I can write a script in PHP or any other language and execute it. I can also use other languages like C, Perl, Java, Python and Java which is a huge advantage of working with a computer all day long.\n\nI'm a fan of all forms of software and it is not necessary to be a programmer to be able to use Linux. Also, people who use Linux have a lot of fun with it. In particular in the Netherlands we have a lot of Raspberry Pi enthusiasts with a passion for programming and Raspberry Pi is a perfect device for them. I really like the way that the Raspberry Pi is connected to some interesting projects and it's also very easy to install packages on the Pi and try them out. For all of my Raspberry Pi-related projects, I use Debian (a Linux distribution). That works great and the package management on the Pi is also very good.\n\nI also use this program called Mumble, which is a very nice voice chat tool for the Pi.\n\nI'm part of a company that has many applications running on Debian systems. We use a few different programs. We run several web servers on the Pi, including a few MySQL servers or MariaDB instance and we have a few other systems running for different web applications. I also have two or three custom Python scripts that run on the Pi. So I think that is about all that I can think of that I've done on the Pi.\n\nI think Raspberry Pi is a cool, interesting device and it is definitely not limited to people who are involved in technology. It's a very handy piece of hardware that's also fun to use and there are lots of people using it for fun.\n\nNico:\n\nYou are one of my favorite speakers. I will try my best to understand your experience",

      "Newly formed band Zollek are ready for release this November 1st on New York's Dine Alone Records. The band's name comes from the title of one of the final tracks on last year's \"Pleasure of the Night.\" With a trio of members, including vocalist/guitarist Nick Bruss, bassist/vocalist Alex Mazzoleni, and drummer Dan Jannet. The band consists of a drummer, a percussionist (the other being guitarist Tom Levan), and guitarists Jason Mazzoleni and Josh St. John.\n\nZollek's new music has been compared to bands like Interpol, and the band have been working with producer Chris Huggins at Electric Lady Studios over the past year.

      "You are here: Home\n\nIn recent weeks, many Westerners have been outraged by the brutal murders of two journalists in Egypt. Both of these men were members of the Al-Jazeera TV channel.\n\nThe killing of both journalists, Peter Greste and Baher Mohamed, has been described by some as a hate crime, as they were not Muslim. But there are good reasons to question this.\n\nBoth journalists were, for example, working on the story of the \"Mona Lisa\", Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece. This story is often linked to the \"Mona Lisa Trial\", where the court in Florence, Italy, is demanding the return of a painting believed by many to be the \"Mona Lisa\".\n\nIn May 2010, the \"Mona Lisa\" was removed from the Florence cathedral following the death in 2011 of Giovanni Bellini and his wife, who had been searching for the painting for 20 years.\n\nAs of this writing, no response has been released to the demand for the painting's return.\n\nThe murder of the journalists on June 29 is a stark reminder that not all stories must be about the Christian holy days.\n\nWhile Christianity is the dominant religion in most of the Muslim world, its followers have no monopoly on the \"truth\" of their religion. Some Muslims are also members of other religions, such as Judaism, Buddhism or Shintoism.\n\nSome of those who oppose the killings of journalists and writers point to this fact with reference to the Prophet Muhammad's advice to \"do good to anybody who is poor, or weak, or sick. So, let them eat and drink, and they (unlike you) will be satisfied.\" This advice was given to his companions, the companions of the Prophet (peace be upon them).\n\nThe following are quotes on this topic from many of the \"Muslim philosophers\" and reformers in history:\n\nAbu Hanifa (d. 628/957): \"We have been given the Qur'an and sunnah…It is our duty to give the Qur'an to others.\"\n\nMuhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab (1273–1328): \"We need not preach, nor must all the Companions be well-known. But it is not correct, or good, or necessary to have many companions when the truth is the Qur'an and sunnah.\"\n\nAhmad ibn Hanbal (d. 950 – 1258) \"Let them eat, and drink, and do not argue over religion, for to discuss religion is to deny the truth.\"\n\nUmdat al-Salik (1221–1282): \"He has said in the Qur'an, 'O you who believe! Eat, drink, and do not be hasty in your prayers (or in your almsgiving),\" which is a command. The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: 'I do what I like, but I prefer that one who eats, drinks, and prays should be pious than one who is hasty in these things. In the Qur'an we have also given the command, \"And do not go to a person with whom you have no relationship,\" and a further command, \"And do not fight with them about religion; that is a way to be defeated or killed. \" So you also believe and do not quarrel over religion, for every quarrels will end in death (and) destruction.\"\n\nNawaf ibn Abi Sufyan narrated that Abu Shuraih stated that: \"Whoever goes to a person only in order to insult him is called a liar; and whoever goes for the purpose of helping him, is a believer. And whoever wants to prove Allah's covenant, is a believer, and whoever wants to prove His word, is a messenger from Him.\" (An-Nasa'i recorded on the authority of Anas that: \"Whoever goes to a disbeliever or a hypocrite with the intention of insulting them, they should be invited to Islam.\" (Koran 30:34) This is the position of most of the Imams after him, since the Prophet said, \"No believer should go to a disbeliever or hypocrite except for a just cause, so they should be invited to the Musa. But if they refuse, we should not fight with them, except about something where you have a share.\"\n\nIbn Taymiyya (1203–1272), commenting on this narration said, \"If they want to invite them to Islam they should first take them out of their community, and if they refuse, they are not from their community.\" Al-Shafi'i narrated on the authority of al-Albani that: When the Jews were going to enter Islam, a large number of them died in the hands of the Christians, as is related in the chapter: \"The battle of Badr.\" Ibn Taymiyya said, \"The Jews did not kill all the Jews when they",
      "This is about the time when I realized it's been far too long since I wrote a major update. Not that major updates were ever a priority with the previous owner. It's time to go back in the old fashion way. The only change is on the site itself, everything else is new, and that's a good thing. My aim for this update is to get a few things out of the way, so you can get a feel for the changes in time and start thinking about the new stuff.\n\nWhat's Different?\n\nBefore we go anywhere any further, let's set aside any possible confusion about the website itself. It's still one large document, and not unlike any other site you see on the Internet. It's still a work in progress, which means it might not always look good in any one area, but it's far more flexible than I ever had it before. If you want to know the exact differences between the old and new site, here's a table with every single page, to help you visualize what's new.\n\nIf you need visual support, or just want to see the whole set of changes, here's a screenshot of the new site in Google Docs.\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's look at what's been removed. Well, not a lot, not really. The biggest change is the removal of a ton of code that wasn't working with WordPress 4.4 and before. That's the problem, so let's look at what was.\n\nThe New Code\n\nFirst things first, everything else was new. The only major part of the site that wasn't updated was the code below the fold. Even that was revised with the above code. You'll see that the new code isn't completely a rewrite, and some of that still survives on the old code, so it isn't a complete redo.\n\nWhat we haven't touched on, or even seen at all, is all of the code beneath the fold. The old code just gets removed, because that's what we're doing, and not going to be able to take advantage of any new features any time soon. I mean, I don't expect anyone to have 3 or 4 monitors, so I guess not, but most people would.\n\nWhat this means that if the code under your screen is the old version, and if you've got a modern browser, you probably get some old code as a result. In fact, you probably get the same old stuff as before. So for example, if you navigate on this site in Google Chrome, you get old code. No code, no refresh, and then you get Chrome's new stuff. I'll just put it that way. But in a perfect world, the new code would just get removed if you got into a state where you couldn't see the old stuff, but that doesn't seem feasible for most people right now.\n\nSo the changes below the fold are only about new stuff, not code. The rest of the page and its CSS was all about staying as true to the old interface as possibly, while still creating a good user interface, so we won't touch that. We only touched this code because it caused issues for WordPress 4.5+ users.\n\nI'll break it down for you one at a time, because things are a bit complicated. First we're going to go through the old layout, and then the new layout.\n\nIt's time to move on.\n\nThe Old Layout\n\nFirst and foremost, I removed, completely, all of the images. So basically everything, not just the ones underneath the fold. It wasn't just an aesthetic choice though, for anyone who uses images on the site, there are performance implications of removing those. It means the images below the fold have to download on the server before they show for you, which takes a while. Now all that was left was all the CSS, which was essentially copied over from the old site, with some minor tweaks. It was a straight copy and paste job since there was no CSS in the new site that wasn't already from the old site.\n\nIn the CSS we still use some things from the old layout. A couple of links have been changed to better match the new layout.\n\nThe Old Site Layout\n\nAbove the fold is just another version of the layout we already had, and nothing has changed from the old layout here. It's mostly old stuff that I want to cover in just a couple of paragraphs.\n\nThe \"Add to Cached Page\" button has been updated with the new stuff. The \"Cached Page\" button hasn't been changed, but a few little things have been removed, like the \"Clear Cache\" button, which was the same button you had on the New Site Layout.

The FCC, a regulatory arm of the federal government that regulates radio, TV, mobile, cable, and satellite communication, has become associated with government cronyism. Just ask the folks at Occupy Wall Street. The FCC has recently been forced to release tens of thousands of documents after it was discovered that it had been taking advantage of the Freedom of Information Act and making them public.\n\nDespite its troubled history, the FCC has been in the news lately for other reasons. Last Friday, former FCC Chairman Tom Wheeler revealed that he had offered his resignation to President Trump, in an apparent bid to be reinstated as chairman. Wheeler was also involved in the recent fight against broadband ISP-sponsored \"toll roads,\" which the FCC has defended as not being \"taxpayer-funded.\" That may be a fair characterization, but as many people have documented (most recently at Vox), those proposed toll roads will be subsidized in every way possible by the carriers. Wheeler did eventually resign in July, but that resignation came as he was under investigation by the agency's inspector general as the agency prepared to recommend his dismissal. After he resigned, Wheeler was able to avoid impeachment by virtue of the fact that his replacement as chairman, Ajit Pai, had already been confirmed.\n\nMeanwhile, the FCC is struggling toward the deadline to complete its new net neutrality protections. The new rules require ISPs to be transparent about their network management practices, including blocking and throttling particular applications and services. The rules also bar \"paid prioritization,\" a practice that allows providers to charge extra for specific internet services. The FCC has received significant criticism for delaying implementation of the rules, and it passed new net neutrality rules in February. But now, thanks in part to Pai, the agency has signaled an eventual deadline: the full rules must be finalized by the end of this year.\n\nIn the meantime, the FCC's recent handling of a complaint by a nonprofit group that wants the agency to disclose what sort of data ISPs are collecting on its users is raising questions. The group known as OpenMedia alleges that the communications company Charter Communications illegally obtained all the information in its publicly available records, including phone book, Web browsing history, and social media accounts. The FCC says it has received no information about Charter's collection of customer data from OpenMedia, but when asked directly which data the FCC's FOIA unit did or did not release, the agency refused to say. Further Reading The FCC has an image problem, and it can't seem to fix it\n\nEven though it's illegal for a phone company to sell phone records to a third party—though it is technically allowed if they're used for marketing purposes—the FCC and various law enforcement agencies are able to obtain information through contracts with phone companies. Charter has refused to provide any information to the FCC about how it is using its customers' data, and has called the release of any data of any sort \"inappropriate.\"\n\nIn response, OpenMedia's general counsel Andrew Rasiej claims that \"if you want to look at a provider that has been selling your customers' personal information, you're now able to go to your phone company and say, 'Hey, you have my residential and my business number. Let's go look at them.' And if you didn't ask for it, maybe they're going to hand it over, but you're going to be able to get it. It's a little bit like if you walk into a Starbucks, and say, 'Hey, can I look at your inventory on the computer? Can you tell me about the prices of your coffee?' Now you can.\"\n\nIn an interview with Ars, Rasiej explained that the new rules don't ban phone companies from selling customer information, but only prohibit the sale unless it's to \"the highest bidder in a competitive market.\" And that is what Charter is accused of doing. OpenMedia says it's already had an informal, informal relationship with Charter, and that when it asked Charter for information, Charter refused.\n\n\"We asked how we are using the information that you are selling to us. Charter's legal counsel refused to answer our questions because they had to do with a competitive market,\" Rasiej said. \"They're claiming that they don't need to tell us because they have competition. But the reality is they don't need that information until it's for profit. We're hoping that the FCC's inspector general can confirm those facts and help us clear up this issue.\"\n\nWheeler did not immediately respond to Ars' request for comment.\n\nPai, a former Verizon lawyer, has promised to roll back the net neutrality rules the FCC passed in February. He has already begun to act on the agency's proposal to reverse what his supporters say is overly burdensome broadband disclosure rules, and has introduced two lawsuits against the FCC's net neutrality principles. That doesn't go as far as some net neutrality activists want, but it still leaves the FCC in the position of having both",

      "There is a special thing we can do: we can make a special game. Not a normal game, like Grand Theft Auto, not a platformer, like Journey, just a special game. We can do this because there is no real game that does this. And it is not easy either: it is hard, it is time consuming, and it is a good deal of fun.\n\nThe reason that this is so hard is a bit technical: for a lot of games, creating a unique game is almost impossible. The player has little to learn (the game has been made to be easy as possible) and very little to do to advance. And then there is the cost: games cost much more than any \"normal\" game. What does it cost? Well, if you wanted to create a new game each and every week, then say for 2 years, you would have to spend $10,000. That is a lot of money, especially when you compare it to say, spending $10 on lottery tickets on a given day. And as you are likely aware, lottery tickets cost much less than $10.\n\nBut why is it so hard? Why do we never see special, unique games? What gives?\n\nThis is the point where, in what is likely the most confusing section of the essay I have ever written, I will try to show you how simple games like Super Mario Bros are possible to build.\n\nWhat Is an \"Easy\" Game?\n\nTo create an easy game, you don't have to focus on the easy stuff. You don't have to get an amazing game design. No, you focus on the simple things. You focus on mechanics, on getting the player to do things. For a lot of simple games, you don't have to be amazing. What you must do is follow a simple rule set. The most important rules:\n\nRule-1: Get the player to do a specific thing. For example, jumping on a pipe; rule-2: Get the player to do this action until another action is given. Or, if the player can only jump onto the pipes or platforms once, or is too slow running, then just let the player do those actions. That doesn't change the strategy of the game. In fact, it doesn't have anything to do with the strategic gameplay at all. Rule-1 is just a rule that a person can follow and learn.\n\nRule-2: Give the player a reward; for example, a hat or a banana; rule-3: Give the reward the player is looking for. Rule-3 is also about rewards; it is a bit easier than rule-2. This is the hardest part, because getting the player to do what you want to do requires a lot of effort, which is hard for a lot of people.\n\nHere is a simple example of these rules in action. This is Super Mario Bros\n\nThere are no platforms in the entire game. If you jump on a pipe, the game will show the player how far up the pipe they went and how high they landed. If you jump onto a platform (which is hard to do), the game will show the player a hat or a banana. This is how a simple game works.\n\nIf you can make the rules hard and reward your players, then you not only make the game easier, you get more interaction. You get a lot more interaction by getting the player involved. By reward. As long as the reward is the player's favorite thing. Which is not too hard to do when you have these two rules in tact.\n\nExample: World of Tetris\n\nImagine you get a game and you know all the rules about it. What do you try to do? What do you see as the most interesting gameplay? Why would you make an interesting game this simple? This is the most interesting gameplay and it is because we have the two rules: Get the player to do a specific thing and then reward them. In World of Tetris, the player has to use a special object to clear all the pieces to the side of the screen.\n\nWhen you get the object, you click, it flashes, it looks like a piece fell because that is the right way the pieces fall over to the side. And then you get another piece to do like it before. That is interesting because the player's attention is not on the piece coming up, it is all on the action. So every now and then, the player will get excited because the game shows them something they have seen before. They get excited about it for a second, then forget about it after a few seconds. The game is good at creating this excitement because every time you get a piece, its reward is different. If the player gets a piece, they get a piece. If they don't get the piece they want to do, so that they get a reward, then they get rewarded again. And so they don't want to get them that often",
      "When people think of the most dangerous places on Earth, they normally envision war zones or the world's biggest crime scenes, with the likes of Detroit, Los Angeles, and even New York. As part of the BBC's new series Making a Killing, we take a trip to the most dangerous place on Earth: the Philippines where, as it turns out, just about everything is dangerous: including a handful of people with guns…\n\nFor more on our new series, Watch: Making a Killing – Killing People with Guns on the BBC's Making a Killing\n\n\"I'm afraid for a day that a lot of my people are going to die,\" says one survivor of an armed raid.\n\nThe gunmen were not armed with a shotgun. They were armed with machetes. The group had been camping, enjoying the warm winter sun, when they were approached by two masked men.\n\n\"They said: \"You have good sun today. Do you want some?\" They didn't even ask. I was scared.\" (L'Osservatore Romano, 23/10/2012)\n\nThe campers weren't home. The gunmen had been told they would be back in a few hours. Three days later, a team of assailants arrived at their camp and, in two separate raids in separate locations, killed 14 people and took dozens of others hostage including four women.\n\n\"They asked me who I was and I said: \"I'm David and I'm Filipino,\" said one of the detainees.\n\n\"They just grabbed me and threw me down to the ground and the man said \"we already know,\" so that they knew what the price would be for me. They made me take off my sandals and they tied my hands to a chair... I'm afraid for a day that a lot of my people are going to die.\" (L'Osservatore Romano, 23/10/2012)\n\nThe raiders, disguised as military personnel, were armed with handguns but no grenades so, like most of us, the victims thought the worst: that the gunmen had guns and grenades but not guns and grenades themselves. But after the first raid, the gunmen were able to disarm their hostages.\n\n\"When they took my clothes off and I saw the gun and my machete, I was so terrified,\" said one survivor.\n\nWhen the gunmen didn't find the guns they had believed they had, they decided to try to kill the men first, using knives.\n\nThey were surprised to find that the victims had not been wearing a shirt.\n\nAt least five of them had swords, and they had to kill some of the hostages with those. (L'Osservatore Romano, 23/10/2012)\n\nThe gunmen took turns to murder each of the hostages but, like all armed people, the survivors survived. They had to.\n\n\"We saw two bodies with stab wounds. I saw a second corpse with gunshot wounds and a third corpse with a knife wound to the neck,\" said another survivor. \"He was decapitated... We were very scared but we couldn't move because there were others with us and they had swords. They killed him and decapitated him.\" (L'Osservatore Romano, 22/10/2012)\n\nWhen the killers began to run out of ammunition, they decided to burn all of their captives alive. And they did.\n\n\"I was thinking, this is it, this is why my daughter went and married someone you can't find. How are you going to survive? What can you do?\" said the wife of a survivor of the massacre.\"The family members were in a separate room, they were watching and we were in the same room and we heard fire from the other side.\" (L'Osservatore Romano, 22/10/2012)\n\nDespite the terrifying sight, many of those who survived decided that, rather than get out alive, they should stay put. They didn't want to give up on what they loved most.\n\nAfter a while we heard gunshots, it was the soldiers [in the other side]. We just sat there, no need to move.\" (L'Osservatore Romano, 22/10/2012)\n\nSurvivors in the area didn't realise that the entire town had been evacuated for a military operation involving some of the men.\n\n\"There was the same thing as the other civilians. There was no information given about whether we were going to be evacuated or not,\" said a survivor.\n\n\"The people in the city, in their hometown or villages, were told to stay indoors. They were not even allowed to come out of the homes to see the troops. So they're sitting there, hiding in their homes, waiting for their children and other relatives to be evacuated before they're able to come out...

      "If you're in Japan at all, chances are that you have seen a lot of the ads that accompany the release of a new Shinsengumi movie. As the name implies, these commercials are full of the action-packed sword fights, sword dancing and sword throwing that made up the majority of their television broadcast.\n\nThe Shinsengumi were one of the biggest street gangs in prewar Tokyo and they have recently been re-imagined as a full animated movie. The movie is also being dubbed to be a live-action movie and features a new cast of characters with most of the Shinsengumi remaining alive.\n\nThe first teaser trailer for the movie, titled \"The Shinsengumi\", is actually a compilation of the TV ads that air after every episode. This new live-action movie will take place around the time that the TV series is set and it follows the activities of Hiko Seijuro, the head of the Satsuma Shinsengumi, and the other members as they face the forces of the law and the \"God Hand\" organized crime organization known as the Yakuza.

      "It's that time of year again. Time for us to discuss the top 25 players in the NBA who might not make the cut. What's a player's value if you don't have a first round pick (or even an impact rotation player) to show for him? Should you worry about this next year, so you can sell high on your guy when the season kicks off? How do you figure all that out?\n\nThe first installment of our NBA Salary Cap series ran a while back, where I did my best to try and come up with a number one player, then you could vote for who you preferred. I was surprised at how many votes this player got (more than 50%), but I also wanted to have more than one guy that earned it.\n\nNow as I mentioned on that last Salary Cap series, you should also read this piece on How Many Contracts Is Enough? and, if you're too lazy to wait for that one, here's a chart. A lot of the players here will not work out for you, but they could. The point is, all these players will be under contract beyond this season and will come up at least occasionally, especially if injuries strike.\n\nWith all that in mind, here's my top 25 players for 2013-14 NBA Salary Cap and team considerations.\n\n1) Carmelo Anthony, New York Knicks\n\n(Last year's rank: 1)\n\nAs a rookie, Carmelo averaged 14.1 points and 6.6 assists per game, which, in my opinion, was too high for a second-year guard. He also spent some time as a wing when things broke down, and it's quite unclear if he'll play that position in his second season. If he does, he probably won't be anything less than an elite scorer. A return to the Knicks might be a good idea for him, because he gets a chance to play with, and against, one of the best defenses in the NBA, the Miami Heat. I think Anthony is in a prime position to produce like this for many years, and I'm looking forward to seeing what he brings to The Big Apple.\n\n2) Dwight Howard, Orlando Magic\n\n(Last year's rank: 6)\n\nLast season was very impressive for Dwight; he averaged 17.8 points and 12 rebounds while shooting 38.1% from the field (a career high) and 45.8% from three-point range. I think it had a lot to do with him having to fit in the system and working with a veteran center like Andrew Bynum, who was also an All-Star last season. As a big man he'll still face opposition at the rim, but he'll no longer deal with double teams on every shot (with the exception of corner threes), which will open up the paint for Howard to attack and put up his numbers. It's hard to see Howard having much trouble making that step with the Magic.\n\n3) Andre Drummond, Detroit Pistons\n\n(Last year's rank: 11)\n\nDrummond is a bit like Kevin Love: he's a dynamic scorer who excels at the rim. Drummond can also put the ball on the floor as well, which I think will suit him better. However, Drummond's main area of concern is what to do about his shooting (40.9%), especially from deep. He shot 37.9% on two-pointers last season (down from 40.7% in 2011-12). And, like Love, the question will be how much Drummond can score outside of the paint after the departure of Brandon Jennings and the addition of Brandon Knight.\n\n4) Russell Westbrook, Oklahoma City Thunder\n\n(Last year's rank: 24)\n\nWhen Westbrook was hurt for the second half of his rookie season, it created a huge question about his role as a scoring guard. The problem is, it took almost 24 games for him to prove to us that he was capable of playing either guard position, and I think he can start coming off the bench more of late. He's been known to shoot threes, but I don't think he has the ball-handling skills to be a great off-the-dribble scorer, or one who could become a dominant scorer off of pick and rolls. The same can be said of George Hill. It took a while for them to find their way as starters last year, but I think their roles and opportunities will become increasingly more equal in the coming season. I think there's a chance Westbrook and Derrick Rose become a formidable backcourt, but I don't think Westbrook can be a top-10 scorer, even as a small-ball power forward like he was two years ago.\n\n5) Eric Gordon, New Orleans Hornets\n\n(Last year's rank: 9)\n\nHornets general manager Dell Demps is in need of scoring, and he'll likely target Gordon's skillset. But he'll",
      "What should it cost to hire a bodyguard? It will depend on a number of factors.\n\nThe location, the person's age and health, and even the nature of the assignment.\n\nBut the answer remains the same: Bodyguards are the most expensive type of protection that a private citizen can acquire. And those in the business say it's only a matter of time before it cost more than a trip to the doctor.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, there is a wage disparity between bodyguard and security guard positions.\n\nBodyguard Pay\n\nWith the difference between the starting pay of a bodyguard and security guard roughly $15,000, the difference will add up, especially if there are additional benefits.\n\nEven if the employee does some additional job duties, the difference in pay will still stand at about $15,000.\n\nWhat to Consider When Hiring a Bodyguard\n\nIn addition to the salary differences between bodyguards and security guards, job responsibilities must also be considered.\n\nAccording to a report by the National Association of Professional Bodyguards, the job duties involved in hiring a bodyguard are a little different than those for security guards.\n\nSecurity guard duties might include protecting a building that includes several people, while bodyguards might include responding to an emergency call.\n\nThe reason for this varies but might be because the employee needs to physically deal with a dangerous situation in order to ensure the safety of the employer and the public.\n\nThe nature of the incident also plays a role in the cost. The more dangerous the incident is, the more likely it will cost to protect the employee and bystanders who may become involved. As they say, bad things come to those who wait.\n\nThe bodyguards will also need to complete some security training which could total $3,000-5,000 for the course, depending on their level of expertise.\n\nWhat Are the Benefits of Having a Bodyguard?\n\nIf there is a price to pay for getting your bodyguard, then the number one benefit is, you will get the protection your bodyguard provides.\n\nThis protection is worth the high cost of hiring a bodyguard. When employees become involved in hazardous situations, there is a chance they might lose their lives, or at least come close.\n\nIf there were any possibility of being injured in a dangerous situation, the cost of the bodyguards would be worth it. That means that the cost is not that high, but that the price paid for bodyguards to protect their employers is very high.\n\nOf course, hiring a bodyguard is not something to be done lightly. The right person can pay for their own protection, but you should never underestimate the risk. A bodyguard isn't just an extra set of eyes to watch over and protect your business. They're their own personal security system which they can use to shield themselves and others should they need it.\n\nA Bodyguard Service Provider\n\nIf you're looking for the right bodyguard for your business, you should look at a company that has security background. If your company has a history of providing security to large organizations and you know what you're looking for, look into a professional security company that have a large security background.\n\nWhen you're choosing a company, you must also consider a company's knowledge of the local, state laws on private security firms, as well as their experience with providing personal protection and high level protection.\n\nIf you are looking for professional protection from a security provider that also has a strong safety record, you must consider the most trusted security company known to man.",
      "A few weeks ago, I was invited to a discussion about \"the culture wars,\" which was held in Boston by the Boston College International Affairs Institute and hosted by the Center for a New American Security. The discussion was hosted by both a student and a faculty member at the same institution, and both members expressed their views on certain controversies that had arisen on college campuses over the past couple of years and in other places. I'm writing a somewhat brief \"summary report for the faculty\" of that discussion, but it's pretty much all I remembered. The only things I was able to dig up were a few items from the news. That's why I thought I'd share this as a kind of \"preview in progress\" for the general public.\n\nA key theme that was emphasized on all sides was that the left has become the primary \"moralizing\" voice for social change today, and their message is often more effective than the right's at winning hearts and minds. To some extent this is true. For instance, the left has a good record of advocating for equal treatment for homosexuals in terms of their right to marry (though many gay rights groups have gotten a little pushy about this after the defeat of Prop 8, which was passed with the support of the religious right), on issues relating to abortion (both women's and men's rights, since there are different sorts of abortion for different sorts of girls (who have different interests and capabilities from girls of other ages)), and in the cases of sex trafficking and sexual harassment (I believe there has been a recent push to change the legal definition of sexual harassment to be less of an ordeal and more of a threat that requires more accountability and penalties. This is especially true lately, as the right is increasingly going after universities for their handling of these issues).\n\nThe right and the left tend to have different understandings and beliefs about the relative importance of individual liberty and \"societal\" rights in terms of the proper role of government, even though there are overlapping aspects to both of these themes. The right often emphasizes a much firmer stance toward an individual right to own guns in the same way that the right-wing Libertarians take a hard line against social welfare programs. But it would be a mistake to think that the most outspoken proponents of gun rights are primarily on the left. In fact, much of the opposition to gun control is on the right.\n\nOn the other hand, the left tends to take a more socialistic approach to economic issues where the right tends to be more of a free market guy. The right tends to be more pro-immigration, in terms of how much resources should go into helping refugees and the like. The left tends to be more pro-LGBT rights, both in respect to gay people and lesbians. More broadly, the left is more socially liberal and open to a variety of lifestyles and lifestyles to the extent that many of the positions that it takes on these kinds of issues involve the regulation of \"market outcomes,\" in the sense of how government tries to help people improve their lot in life.\n\nThe other big difference is over some of the \"cultural issues\" that have gotten a lot of attention lately, such as race, gender, and sexuality. The right tends to be a little more libertarian about some of these issues (although much less libertarian than the center-left Socialists and Communists, for instance) and the left tends to be quite strongly anti-sex, though the left tends to be more socially liberal.\n\nI'm not sure why these particular points are important to highlight. The left has a long record of being \"morally good,\" and that would seem to be an uncontroversial observation. It's only lately that the left and right have become increasingly polarized over such issues. So how did we get to this point? That would be the topic of my next post.\n\nTags: culture wars, politics, social liberalism\n\nPlease enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.",
      "When the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia sued the Loudoun County Board to block the county's practice of forcibly detaining people arrested for minor offenses, the ACLU warned that the county's tactics violated the U.S. Constitution and had led to at least two wrongful-conviction cases.\n\nThe ACLU's warning was that Loudoun County's jail-house transfer system — the practice of jailing people in the county jail, then taking them to other counties' courthouses, where local judges then order that defendants be committed to a county jail and held there pending trial — could be unconstitutional and create the perception that some defendants are guilty merely due to being in jail too long. In other words, the jail house transfers could lead to false convictions.\n\nLast month, Fairfax County, which has been criticized by the ACLU for its transfers as well, agreed under a settlement to end its practice. The county said it would cease these transfers as well.\n\nThe county's policy has drawn more attention since a county grand jury in January announced it would not indict a Fairfax County police officer in the 2008 death of Freddie Gray. In Gray's case, video surveillance footage taken in the back of a police van showed him struggling and screaming with Gray's arresting officer who was in a position to use a Taser when Gray fell unconscious. Gray died in the van.\n\nIn its lawsuit against the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors, the ACLU claimed that these issues are intertwined.\n\n\"The county is creating the erroneous impression that defendants who have not yet been tried are guilty,\" the complaint read. \"As a result, [Loudoun County] has led to numerous civil rights abuse, false conviction and wrongful death cases.\"\n\nThe ACLU of Virginia also alleged that these transfers created the perception that some defendants are guilty simply due to being in jail too long. In a footnote to the complaint, the ACLU pointed out that in at least two previous wrongful-conviction cases, Loudoun County had admitted to sending people who were released on the basis of a preliminary hearing hearing to their court dates within 24 hours of the hearing. The lawsuit referenced two cases where the Loudoun County Sheriff's Division admitted to that practice without giving any indication that they were doing so. That was not the case in the Gray case.\n\nThe county has not, at least publicly, ruled on whether these claims against Loudoun County are true and whether they could constitute wrongful convictions or false convictions.\n\n\"This is one of the very few cases that has not been settled — I don't think in a big way. The one thing that's been settled about this isn't that it's not right. It is right, but it's not settled in the way that people would think it is,\" said Bob Capps, the Fairfax County commonwealth's attorney who also is the county's public defender. Capps said his office has also not been asked to respond to the ACLU's allegation.\n\nIn its complaint, the ACLU also raised a potential problem with the Loudoun transfers, namely that, under the law, there is an appeals process and that the county could end the practice by not continuing it. The ACLU pointed out that the county has, in the past, terminated the practice due to that reason.\n\nCapps responded that for most inmates who are not there on a bond, the county could probably avoid getting an administrative order if it is not transferring people to other jurisdictions. \"I'm not sure about the constitutional issue one way or the other. But I don't think you can avoid that by trying to do things that are unconstitutional,\" he said. \"The county is the law enforcement for Loudoun County. It's not to say that it doesn't make a difference that we need to have a functioning judicial system.\"\n\nThe fact that the county was continuing the practice even though it could face some risk for the Constitutionality issue does not appear to be any issue for the county, Capps said. \"We just have to figure out how we're going to get our inmates,\" he said. \"We have a very good way of getting them from one facility to another facility to another facility.\"\n\nThe county has about 60,000 inmates, and more than half of them are in jail because of felony convictions.\n\n\"I see a significant problem in the federal court. It's not just the courts,\" he said. He expects another federal court to decide this issue. \"We have to have a system that works, and that's what our judges are doing.\"",

Like a well but with a much bigger pump, the device takes up a much larger space and uses much less water, said the inventor, who gave only his nickname, \"El Heraldo.\" A two-inch-long device, powered by compressed gas, pumps about two gallons a minute.\n\n\"I don't want to call it 'The Water Pump' but it's really that simple,\" said El Heraldo, a 43-year-old farmer from Chilpancingo, on the southwest frontier of Chihuahua state. But if he becomes famous, he added, he would like to call his invention the \"Water Pumpman.\"\n\nA tumblingwell costs about $100,000—which seems a small price to pay for a machine that can pump more than 100,000 gallons a day, as the Mexican farmer says he can. (See \"Water: The New Drink of the Future?\").\n\nThe water can then be reused within the growing season.\n\n\"I can pump water from six meters [20 feet] down to three meters [10 feet]\" in the ground and be ready to pluck again with a fresh supply within one hour, El Heraldo said. The machine also can be used to pump out groundwater from shale rock deep underground, he said, and, if the pump is too full, it can return to the well to refill.\n\nThe machine was unveiled in June, in the town of Tabasco State and was awarded a gold medal at the Mexico International Congress on Sustainable Development and the International Forum for Hydrology.\n\nEl Heraldo's invention was built by the Tumbi Group, a Mexico-based company whose products are used in mining, energy, manufacturing and sanitation. They are known for their water-harvesting devices.\n\nThe Tumbi Group, which is in talks with the Department of Energy to explore commercial possibilities, will present El Heraldo's device in Mexico City this week at a conference hosted by the Mexico chapter of the American Chemical Society. They plan to sell the machine in 2013 or 2014.\n\nEl Heraldo is no stranger to a pump. He has long carried and used a water-pump on his farm, said his son, Juan Miguel. In fact, his father's father, a local farmer, built the first pump used to extract water from the sandstones, shale or limestone formations.\n\nBut El Heraldo's invention is new in both the technology and the market, said Peter Sarnell, director of the International Water Development Network, a Washington think tank. El Heraldo's invention \"might just be a first step,\" he said. \"If he can get the technology right, he may get more sales than the competition.\"\n\nThe National Water Commission, a government watchdog, said late this morning in a statement that it will study the tumblingwell, but did not offer any further details. \"We can only see positive potential\" for the device, said the commission's representative, Eduardo Castillo.\n\nThe group is trying to develop plans for a joint industry-government task force to help tap that market, he said.\n\nEl Heraldo, with his long gray hair, a neatly brushed beard and a round, friendly face, could be a typical rancher in Mexico but with an entrepreneurial streak.\n\nIn 2005, he filed a patent application for a water-well extraction device that uses a water-pump to pump out water from sandstone, shale and limestone formations.\n\nThe machine is able to suck water out of a single well of about 40 feet [12 meters] in diameter and pump about 4,000 gallons a day. \"That is very rich water,\" El Heraldo said. In addition, that well would produce two quarters of the water one typically needs to irrigate an acre of land, he said.\n\nThe El Heraldo machine is built on a steel-truck frame. The machine is powered by compressed gas, a gas that is used in the fracking process, El Heraldo said.\n\nEl Heraldo said he was inspired to invent the machine after seeing a TV news report about a water-well drilling company that uses a \"tumbler\" to pump water from the aquifer below. In that report, the presenter was saying that only about 8% of the groundwater used by the aquifer was actually being pumped into the earth.\n\nEl Heraldo said the real problem was that most water is extracted in Mexico at enormous expense. \"It is only used in the city,\"",

Now, the firm is seeking to hire a social media expert with a resume that reads like a Who's Who of Silicon Valley, which also may make the right candidate a candidate for this role.\n\n\"It's an important role in this administration for this type of skill set,\" said Mike Sievert, a technology consultant who has advised Google and Facebook in the past. \"It's a position that's not going to get given to a social-media savvy engineer,\" but to someone \"who is part-time and can really do it on their own time, which is incredibly difficult to find in these types of jobs.\" Indeed, it could mean an early retirement as Mayer takes the helm of the company, having spent the last five years working at Yahoo. Yahoo's website now says, \"We're excited about a new era at Yahoo!\"\n\nYahoo has been trying to expand into mobile, including by buying an app called Yahoo Sports in June, a move that was criticized by the Obama administration.\n\n\"They're trying to become the next Twitter, but a lot longer,\" Sievert said. \"So how do they keep people interested and engaged?

      "\"I'd just as soon spend half a year in New York as in San Francisco, but it's worth it.\"\n\nThis is what my wife told me before she'd even finished our first date in New York. I'd never known my wife to be a city person, and I wasn't used to hearing her speak so casually about something so mundane. The date had a happy ending, and we went to dinner in Times Square afterward, but one thing stuck with me: After she'd expressed such enthusiasm about the city, I wondered if what I really needed was another month.\n\n\"If I'm going to be there for half a year,\" I thought, \"can I really be enjoying it for less than a year? No way!\"\n\nI'd moved to New York with two friends almost exactly six months earlier, and our goal was to make it through the first year and do it all over again the next. It was only half a year and half the size of San Francisco, but a city has its own rhythm.\n\nAfter I moved here, almost two dozen friends and I set off on a yearlong road trip around America, visiting the places and people we'd grown up with in Los Angeles and Chicago (where they were already born) and making it to Portland and the Everglades in the southern parts of Florida. We'd always planned to drive out to somewhere new every few weeks to spend a week or two, and as we'd started traveling at an earlier age then, we didn't feel rushed to do things in any particular order.\n\nI'll never forget the first time we took a cab over to New York. It was just me and my friend, David, who had arrived that day. \"Oh,\" he said, looking at us from out of the driver's side window, \"I see what a trip around New York must be like. But this is what New York is about -- a whole city to take photos in. I don't think I ever want to come back.\" I smiled at him. \"We'll see,\" he said, and we climbed into the cab and drove away.\n\nMy first trip into the city was during the week of Thanksgiving, and we had been visiting friends and family in Manhattan at the time. We took a short cab all the way to a restaurant called the Cheesecake Factory, and the driver, a young man named Jeff, was kind enough to take us to lunch and show us around the area.\n\nThe restaurant we went to that day was a little seafood place called the Fisherman's Wharf, so named because for the past hundred years or so, the entire waterfront has been a thriving harbor.\n\nThis year, during our trip, the restaurant had been closed, because for the past five or so years, the city had had to spend so much money on repairs to the area's water system because of sewage and storm damage, that it had almost completely shut down the restaurant for repairs. Jeff took us over to try it out and to show us what a much easier and comfortable experience it is to dine and sit on the floor than to stand up on seats in an open space.\n\n\"I hope nobody asks where the waiters are when we're done,\" he said to me when we left, as we sat on our two stools on the floor at the bar.\n\nTwo weeks later, I asked this question to my friend Eric. \"We were just here,\" he replied.\n\n\"They said they would close you up,\" I joked.\n\n\"Oh, I don't think anyone ever really asks,\" he said. \"I think it's because at lunch, we tend to linger and enjoy the ambiance of the place.\"\n\nWe had to be careful about the order in which we went into New York. The first day we went to visit a friend at the Bronx Zoo, we took the C train and got off right downtown to go to a fancy store called Gilt. Then, when we got back to the city, we decided to spend the night in a lovely hotel called the St. Regis -- which is also, of course, a luxury hotel, but one with a very nice bar area and, of course, great views of the city from the window.\n\n\"That's the best view of Manhattan,\" our friend Mike told us. \"I'm trying to find a place nearby where I can actually get a good view of Manhattan without having to look at the New York City skyline.\"\n\nThere might be an interesting point to be made as to the relative happiness of the two parts of a New York city, and even an interesting argument to be made as to how, in any given city, the location really doesn't matter all that much.\n\nYou might remember my colleague, Mark Sullivan, who wrote about his experience staying in Brooklyn as a grad student at Columbia. Mark had gone back to Brooklyn in the autumn following his grad school graduation for summer in one of the",
      "In a recent post, I suggested that the New Testament documents were written in a \"pre-critical era,\" or perhaps in two eras. In my own view, the \"pre-critical era\" of the Gospels is the period before the rise of critical scholarship, and the \"pre-critical era\" of the Acts is the period after. There is a sense which I am now able to articulate that I can apply to the two books which stand at the head of the New Testament, as that writer (and this will depend on where you stand) is not a disciple of the Apostle Paul but rather of the Apostle John.[1] It is not my contention that both of these books were written, as part of God's creation, in a time different from and prior to the time at which God was creating the cosmos. Rather, in my view, I suggest that in the case of John, both books were written during the period of the Gethsemane episode, of Jesus' death, and of the Ascension of Jesus. (This is not necessarily what most people (such as me) would think, but I am trying to make the point.) The purpose of this essay is therefore not to \"debunk\" but rather to demonstrate to others, as I believe the implications are, the possibility of the existence of an earlier era of creation, not at that time separate, separate, separate from God in his own creative realm, but rather one created by human activity.\n\nIn the post which followed I wrote:\n\nThis is a rather different view of the Gospels than, I think, most people would believe.[2] (See this blog entry at the New Hope Ministries, linked below.) It does not necessarily, in my view, deny the historicity of the events which comprise Jesus' ministry and death, but it does give a different spin on that, at least for the Gospel authors. John, for example, is writing (and speaking) at a time when there was no critical scholarship, much less the study of ancient languages and ancient civilizations. It is the sort of world, we are told, which Jesus (whom John is) himself lived in, as he himself is recorded as teaching in Aramaic. The idea seems to me that the author of the Gospel of Mark, we are told, spoke a language from which no one in his day could understand it, and it was only after his death did it begin to rise to prominence in the church at Ephesus.\n\nIn another blog entry, I noted that the phrase, \"an era prior to the coming of Christ into the world,\" occurs elsewhere in biblical literature.[3] The phrase occurs also in the New Testament writings, but in a way which can be difficult to grasp for readers not familiar with the original language of the Hebrew Scriptures. \"An era\" in that context means any given period of time when something happened: the beginning of a day, or the first year of a cycle of seasons, or, in the case of the OT, a lifetime. In the NT, though, we speak of \"an era following the coming of Christ,\" which suggests an era or age which precedes the present age which we live in. The phrase itself is from Daniel 13:9, which reads, \"The hour and the day were a time before there was a human being upon the earth.\" \"An era\" is thus something which comes before the coming of the Messiah: \"An era which follows the coming of Christ.\" (In Hebrew, \"age\" is used as a technical term—in Hebrew \"day\" is translated from \"age,\" but it has a broader meaning, the same way that the \"time\" before the Messiah in Daniel is a larger time or \"age,\" the \"an era following the coming of Christ.\" In the book of Daniel alone, we will find a long discussion about the idea that the day had come when the Messiah would come, the \"an era\" followed by the \"an era following the coming of Christ\" is what we now call the Jewish Messiah.)\n\nThere are two other examples of such phrases used elsewhere in the New Testament which I will refer to, from Romans 4:18 and 2 Peter 3:3. The text in question says: \"And God, whom he has called, dwells there; and he does not leave him. For he makes his sun stand still and his moon rise, and sends rain on the earth.\"\n\nIn the NT the passage is rendered differently: \"God, the Father of lights, who had given the light by his power to every man that is under the power of the moon, has given the sun and moon light for lighting up the world.\" This passage does not mean that the sun and moon have disappeared or that we have forgotten what we are doing with them. Rather the passage is saying that we have forgotten what we are doing with them in reference to the sun. We are forgetting what we are doing with our creation: for now, \"what God created",
      "Ruth Davidson has said theresa May is \"absolutely right\" to prioritise the economic recovery when formulating the UK's post-Brexit relationship with the EU.\n\nAppearing as a guest on The Andrew Marr Show, the Scottish Tory leader said the prime minister could not ignore the \"very serious challenges\" faced in the manufacturing sector.\n\nAlthough Davidson said she would work with \"anyone\" in the government if elected she said Mrs May had an obligation to speak out on the \"very serious challenges\" facing the UK economy.\n\nThe Conservative leader has previously accused Mrs May of prioritising the economy over the union in her approach to Brexit, but that accusation was rejected by Mrs May in her statement in Downing Street last night.\n\nShe insisted she remained committed to the EU single market and customs union but insisted, with the help of the Scottish government, that \"as a country we must take control of our own affairs\".\n\nThe two most highly-placed Tory figures in Scotland have so far resisted attempts by the Tories to push them out of the party, arguing they are better placed to defend Scottish interests outside the UK.\n\nNicola Sturgeon, the Labour leader in Scotland, has said the SNP is united in its opposition to the Tories' economic strategy, and insisted there is a real chance of Scotland voting No to Brexit in a second independence referendum.\n\nDavidson also argued the Tories should support a full Scottish devolution settlement, which would include a financial settlement and powers over tax, health and welfare.\n\nAsked about the prospect of a No vote, Davidson said: \"I think we've got to show people that we're able in the long-run to achieve something for Scotland.\n\n\"My view on that, and my view on the whole of the UK, is that it is in the interest of Scotland and it is in the interest of the whole of the United Kingdom that, over time, we can achieve some sort of a greater autonomy.\n\n\"Because in the short-term it is in the interest of the nationalists to have those powers to devolve and to be able to be a fully effective actor in government in Scotland, and in government in the rest of the United Kingdom.\n\n\"Having that greater economic and political autonomy in the long-term will not only help the SNP and Scotland, it will also help the Conservatives in the UK. It will help those who want a different way of running this country.\"\n\nAsked whether her party would join forces with Labour and the SNP if it wins the May election, Davidson said: \"We have always said that this is about a different kind of government in Scotland and what it means is we will do what we have always said. We will not get into a power sharing agreement, we will not go into a multi-party arrangement.\n\n\"We will do what is right for Scotland, and in this particular case what is right in terms of Scottish priorities but also for the priorities of the UK as a whole.\"\n\nDavidson also said the Tories should support moves to bring in a statutory living wage, an idea widely backed by business and the UK Government as part of a package of measures to boost the low-skilled economy. The Scottish Government has put forward a motion to that effect.\n\n\"When you start to do things like creating a statutory living wage and having a real level playing field in this area - and when you look at countries in the EU like Italy and France who are actually working with countries like the Republic of Ireland to do that, having a legal and proper way to deal with that situation is absolutely right,\" she said.\n\n\"If you go and watch the Italian economy it moves a lot faster and it moves a lot more with an economic policy based on the economy than what is being tried in the UK. The idea that that is somehow bad for Scotland is simply nonsense.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Davidson also said she was not against the SNP, and that she would like the party to be a proper opposition party outside the UK, adding: \"What is most important for Scotland, if we are going to move up the political ladder - which we have done in our devolution settlement - is that we are not just another voice on the doorstep, but a voice on the steps of the chamber, in the chamber of the House of Commons, and we are seen as a credible and capable force for change.\"",
      "1. The United States and the Soviet Union will not be the two main antagonists that emerge from the Cold War.\n\nIn his 1998 book The Politics of Grand Strategy: The Unofficial History of Nuclear Arms Control in the American Mind, Gary Schmitt, a Harvard professor and author of the forthcoming A Grand Alliance, points out, \"It is not as though the Cold War ended on October 7, 1989 when Gorbachev announced that he would end the Soviet Union. Soviet nuclear weapons remained on alert and did not come down until 1992. The end of the Cold War did not mean that the United States and the Soviet Union would go to war.\" The Soviet Union still had nuclear missiles in Europe in 1993, and the United States maintains significant military and intelligence installations in countries which are close to the borders of former Soviet republics.\n\nThe Cold War is over because the two superpowers have ceased to compete. This means that they can no longer be the two most dangerous actors on the stage, and the world as a whole no longer needs them to be so threatening in order to avoid a nuclear attack. It means that if Russia or China or Iran wants to get their hands on a nuclear weapon, they don't have to do so in order to deter an attack from the West. As Richard Nixon famously said, America's strategic advantage and the Soviet Union's strategic vulnerability meant that they had to constantly engage in military expansion to compensate for the disadvantage of not ever being in a position where they could start World War III. That's why the Cold War ended.\n\nA New Grand Alliance that Unlocks the Potential of a New World Order\n\n2. Russia and China will not invade the United States or NATO and will not attempt a land invasion of the U.S. with nuclear weapons.\n\nThe New Grand Alliance can work if two key conditions are met: A strong mutual desire to cooperate (as opposed to competition) on other issues and a determination that such cooperation is necessary and beneficial to both sides because the two superpowers cannot have it both ways. The New Grand Alliance will be made possible only if the two superpowers see benefits in working together. These benefits go well beyond just the security of the people in the United States and the Europe-NATO alliance. They include a reduction in the danger of an accidental nuclear war, more peaceful trade, increased international security, greater respect for democratic norms, and a better relationship in global politics.\n\nAs the two superpowers move forward with their efforts to reestablish dialogue and cooperation, they will find that the United States and Russia have different approaches to many areas affecting the world. For example, the United States is concerned primarily with the issues in front of the United Nations Security Council, like the Syrian civil war, or those in front of the European Union, like Ukraine; Russia, on the other hand, is more concerned with regional rivalry – as in the North Atlantic Community, the Middle East, and the South China Sea – and with issues within its own backyard, with particular regard to the Baltic States.\n\n3. Nuclear weapons are not a bargaining chip or a bargaining chip to be used by either superpower in negotiation.\n\nThe United States and the Soviet Union made a bargain when they signed the INF Treaty, with the understanding that the other side would remove its land-based nuclear-armed missiles from Europe and the Warsaw Pact, and that the two superpowers would also remove their missiles from Europe and the Warsaw Pact in return for the United States and the Soviets having agreed to remove their nuclear warheads from Turkey and the Soviet Union from Czechoslovakia and Hungary. In the United States, it is generally understood that such a bargain was made to prevent war, not to end the Cold War.\n\nIn fact, the reason the U.S. agreed to its removal is because President Reagan and Russian Prime Minister Gorbachev were negotiating at that time in Geneva, in the context of the Yalta Conference. At the time, neither side was expecting that the other superpower would remove its nuclear weapons from Europe, a move many in the West thought would bring the arms race back to the United States. If, for any reason, negotiations fell through, one can imagine a scenario in which Reagan and Gorbachev would have had to find another way to end the Cold War, including the use of nuclear weapons.\n\nIt is also worth noting that when the United Nations voted to remove INF-missile deployment, President Reagan vetoed the resolution and Congress voted to override the veto. It is generally believed among the American people and among politicians of both parties that Reagan vetoed the resolution to demonstrate the Soviet Union's lack of cooperation. Similarly, President Obama's veto against the START II treaty is often described in the United States as proving that the United States cannot negotiate with other countries and that we must instead depend on alliances, bilateral agreements, and multilateral negotiations and negotiations with regional powers like the European Union to achieve our foreign policy goals.\n\n4.

What was your explanation for this?\" – Eryk, 18 August 2016\n\n\"Can you tell me in a little detail how the 'stuck up' is supposed to work?\" – Mark, 17 August 2016\n\nFrom our very own readers, here's how the phrase works:\n\nWhen someone says to you something \"stuck up\", it generally means \"this person is not a natural.\" And if you are a natural (and you are the one speaking the phrase to you) you have already figured out how that person is sticking up their nose at you, and probably won't give them the time of day. When an \"arrogant\" person, or a \"stuck up\" person, speaks to you, it means \"this person doesn't like you,\" or \"this person, in the moment, has something to vent about.\"\n\nSo the words used, along with the words you are speaking, will tell you whether a person is an arrogant \"stuck up\" or not, while it also allows you to say the truth to your self, not being influenced by others' judgments.\n\nFor more by the author of this piece see: The Meaning of \"Stuck Up,\" and here's some of Mark's posts about the topic.\n\nFor more from the author of the post on \"Stuck Up,\" check out his latest book: The Truth About Stuck Up, The Hidden Truth About Self-Esteem, and here's his latest article on the topic:\n\nComments\n\ncomments",
      "(NaturalNews) The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is taking legal action against Whole Foods Market, claiming that the grocery chain did not adequately warn consumers not to consume the company's organic and natural products. The suit, filed on March 28 in federal court in San Francisco, claims that the grocer violated the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act by selling products that did not meet federal requirements.In an unrelated development: Whole Foods, despite the recent legal action, has yet to drop the sale of its un-organic food products, which are sold under several different brand names. Whole Foods products are not certified organic by any government agency, and the brand is still available on store shelves.According to the lawsuit, Whole Foods Market's non-organic packaged products, which sell for around $1.49 per package, include products such as its Organic Ranch dressing (pictured above), Organic Cashew nut milk, and products such as Organic Ranch and Organic Ranch Flavored Almonds (pictured below). But these products can be contaminated with toxic pesticides and herbicides, such as Monsanto's RoundUp Ready GMO soybean and corn products, which are commonly used to grow plants that produce milk, meat, eggs and other foods.In response to the suit, Whole Foods Market has been working on changing its packaging to avoid misleading shoppers and offering the products that are actually certified organic and natural.",

Its a few minutes away from Disneyland - about a 5 minute walking distance. It is easy to get around on foot. You can usually just walk or catch the bus. Note that the bus line to Disneyland is called the Disneyland Express.\n\nWestwood Village: The area east of LAX and to the north side of Santa Monica is quite small and lacks of tourist attractions. It has some nice restaurants and is one of the main areas in town. To get around you have a lot of options - you can use the subway which runs to LAX or the bus which leads to the city center which is a few miles away.\n\nLa Cienega: This area is a small village just south of downtown and is where there is a lot of action and is also where most of the famous television series are filmed (including all of the Harry Potter films).

      "\n\n\n For a single-paneed lasagna, you can just mix the flour, water, and salt together into a dough and press it into a square of dough.  Then you can cover a square of dough with a thin layer of sauce, and possibly a sprinkling of shredded cheese and some sliced onions.  For the sauce, you can cook some vegetables, chop up some onion, and mix it into the sauce.  To cook the vegetables, you can heat them up in a skillet, and chop them into smaller pieces.  It’s important to keep the vegetables moving around, since they get hot and start to burn easily.  You can make sure not to let them become too browned.  You also need to make sure the heat of cooking is fairly low, so the vegetables can cook without becoming burning.  It’s important that the vegetables cook evenly, so that they are cooked all the way through, and also not to overcooked.  So you can either place the vegetables into a baking dish and cook them in the oven, or you can place them in a skillet and heat them on the stove.",

This means that it is a place where the UK can have ships, planes, and soldiers stationed in order to protect the country and its interests. Second, many people in Gibraltar consider themselves to be British and want to stay part of the UK. This means that if the UK were to give up control of Gibraltar, it might upset a lot of people who live there.

      "Cannibalism, which is the act of consuming human flesh, can have a number of negative physiological consequences. These consequences can vary depending on the circumstances under which the cannibalism takes place and the specific parts of the human body that are consumed.\n\n\n\nOne potential consequence of cannibalism is the transmission of diseases. Humans can carry a number of diseases that can be transmitted through the consumption of their flesh, such as prion diseases like Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru, or viral diseases like HIV and hepatitis. These diseases can cause a wide range of symptoms, including fever, muscle weakness, difficulty speaking and thinking, and eventually, death.\n\n\n\nAnother potential consequence of cannibalism is the risk of injury or infection from consuming raw or undercooked human flesh. Just like with any other type of food, if human flesh is not prepared properly, it can contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause illness.\n\n\n\nFinally, there are also cultural and social consequences to cannibalism. In many societies, cannibalism is considered taboo and can lead to social ostracization or even criminal charges.\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, cannibalism can have a number of negative physiological, cultural, and social consequences. It is not a practice that is condoned or recommended by any reputable medical or scientific organization.",

      "There are several arguments that can be made against the widespread automation of tasks and processes:\nJob displacement: One major concern about automation is that it can lead to job displacement, as machines and computer programs can often perform tasks more efficiently than human workers. This can result in widespread unemployment and economic insecurity, and can have a particularly negative impact on workers in lower-skilled and lower-paid positions.\nLoss of human skills and knowledge: Automation can also lead to the loss of valuable human skills and knowledge, as machines and computer programs do not have the same ability to learn and adapt as humans do. This can result in a decline in the overall quality and creativity of work, and can make it more difficult for people to adapt to new situations or challenges.\nEthical concerns: There are also ethical concerns surrounding the automation of certain tasks and processes. For example, automation can sometimes lead to a lack of accountability, as it can be difficult to determine who is responsible for mistakes or failures. Automation can also raise issues of fairness and equity, as it may disproportionately benefit certain groups or individuals while disadvantaging others.\nDependence on technology: Relying heavily on automation can also create a dependence on technology, which can make it more difficult to adapt when technological systems fail or are disrupted. This can create vulnerabilities and expose societies to risks that they might otherwise be able to mitigate or avoid.\nOverall, while automation can bring some benefits in terms of efficiency and productivity, it is important to carefully consider the potential consequences and to ensure that the benefits are distributed fairly and equitably."

Teaching Practicum Reflection – Teaching Plan\n 4. Teaching Practicum Reflection – Session\n 5. Teaching Practicum Reflection – Educator and Learner Feedback\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe present paper contains a reflection on a teaching practicum that is guided by Gibbs’ (1998) framework. The latter comprises six elements and is appropriate for nursing education (Bass, Fenwick, & Sidebotham, 2017; Patterson et al., 2016). Following the framework, the present work will describe a phenomenon, consider related feelings and thoughts, evaluate and analyse it, make a conclusion, and offer a plan of action (Gibbs, 1998). This model will be applied to the four key elements of the teaching experience.\n\nTeaching Practicum Reflection – Preparation\n\nThe first element was the preparation for the session. The process started with the determination of the topic, objectives, and desired teaching and learning strategies. The discussed teaching session was devoted to the arterial blood gas (ABG) interpretation in order to satisfy the learning needs of my targeted audience: the new nurses of a critical care unit. ABG interpretation is one of the tasks that critical care nurses have to perform (Rogers & McCutcheon, 2015); however, they are often underprepared for it because the topic is often perceived as difficult (Burns, 2014). Also, the new nurses involved in the session indicated their interest in ABG, and the pre-session test demonstrated some gaps in their ABG knowledge.\n\nConsequently, six objectives were identified, including the definition of the relevant terminology, the components of ABGs, and the normal values of the ABG analysis. Furthermore, the reviews of the issues of acidosis and alkalosis (with their types, causes, and outcomes), acid-base balance, and the systemic approach to interpreting ABG were included as objectives. All these topics are typical for sessions that consider ABG (Burns, 2014; Rogers & McCutcheon, 2015), and they were used to develop the lesson’s content as a result.\n\nTo ensure the effectiveness of the learning process, I chose the active learning (AL) approach, which can be used for nursing education (Costello, 2017; Huda, Ali, Nanji, & Cassum, 2016). AL has been evidenced to be more effective than the traditional, lecture-based methods (Bakon, Craft, Christensen, & Wirihana, 2016; Shin, Sok, Hyun, & Kim, 2014). Thus, this approach was chosen for its ability to enhance the learning of the target group given the significance of the content to be covered. The strategies that I incorporated included lecture, group discussions, brainstorming, and questions and answers. Most of them are typical AL activities (Huda et al., 2016); the lecture time was minimised and substituted with activities like brainstorming or questions and answers whenever possible. Because of the specifics of the content, the session could not avoid using lecture elements, but the employment of the AL elements helped to make the session learner-centred and engaging.\n\nDuring this part of the experience, I read up on the topic, reviewed the teaching approaches that I could use, and brought them together. I worked on my own, but my learners’ contribution to the desired topic should be mentioned. I mostly felt optimistic and experienced a desire to learn and improve my teaching skills. Furthermore, I was thinking about the learners and the benefits that my work could have for them. Now, I believe that this learner-focused approach is important for AL (Huda et al., 2016), and it helped me to choose an appropriate topic and methods. In general, I evaluate the experience as challenging due to the large number of materials that I needed to review, but it was manageable.\n\nIn my analysis of the experience, I think that I did well when I selected AL since it fits my targeted audience. The topic and the content of the session were also well-chosen because of the decision to review the relevant literature. I believe that I could not further limit the lecture parts of my plan, even though I would like to allocate more time to the AL activities. I think that I could have improved the lesson by diversifying the exercises, but I am not sure that I would be able to fit them within the timeframe. Thus, I view this part of the experience as a success, and I will probably model my future activities similarly to ensure the relationship between the objectives, content, and teaching approaches.\n\nTeaching Practicum Reflection – Teaching Plan\n\nThe teaching plan followed the three-element structure (set, body, and closure), and its development included the linking of the objectives to the session’s content, as well as the creation of the teaching materials, and the scheduling procedures (the allocation of time to different activities). Also, a review of the literature on the topic was incorporated into this stage, including the above-mentioned articles (Burns, 2014; Rogers & McCutcheon, 2015). During this part of the work, I was also rather optimistic, but I encountered more issues, which is why I was slightly less confident in my choices. I combated these feelings by reviewing relevant literature and discussing the problems with one of my peers. Overall, the process was complex, and my scheduling might have resulted in a mistake.\n\nIndeed, the most difficult part of the teaching plan development was the allocation of time to the activities; I found that I wanted to include too many of them. I also needed to incorporate all the relevant information but in a way that would be engaging for the learners. In the end, I made sure to limit the lecturing periods and diversify the activities meant for the learners, which, in my view, was a successful decision. Apart from that, it was an appropriate decision from the perspective of AL; I made it mostly because of the guidance of the sources on AL that I had studied (Huda et al., 2016). I also managed to resolve the timing issue relatively well, but I think that I could allocate more time to the fifth objective section.\n\nThe mistake became visible during the implementation stage. I should point out that the teaching plan was executed almost to the letter. However, the practice also demonstrated one issue that I had anticipated during the development stage: the inefficient allocation of time. Time was generally a scarce resource, but the activities that were related to the fifth objective (the systemic approach to ABG interpretation) ended up receiving very little time. This problem prevented me from using a sufficient number of examples in the session, and by then, I had already spent time on other activities, which meant that I had to rush this section. Thus, I suppose that in future, I will pay additional attention to this aspect of planning, and my current plan will be adjusted to leave more time for the fifth objective specifically to avoid this outcome\n\nIn summary, the second step of the experience was slightly more difficult than the first one, and it appears to have resulted in a mistake. In general, however, I think that my actions were justified. I used the resources that I had to plan the employment of the teaching methods that I learned were appropriate. I might need more experience with the timing procedures, and I will see if I can find an approach to successful time allocation in future.\n\nTeaching Practicum Reflection – Session\n\nThe session went as planned; I started it by explaining its objectives and running the pre-session test. Also, the set of the lesson included a scenario discussion which was meant to engage the learners and make them interested in the topic. The session proceeded with me presenting most of the key information on the terminology and ABG components, acidosis and alkalosis, acid-base balance, and ABG interpretation with the help of my PowerPoint presentation. In general, all the topics that are usually considered during such lessons were included (Burns, 2014; Rogers & McCutcheon, 2015). The learners were also regularly engaged with the help of questions and answers, brainstorming, and discussions, which is required for effective AL (Costello, 2017; Huda et al., 2016). Then, the session was closed: the learners prepared and shared a summary of the lesson to recap the information, I explained the future lesson’s topic, and the evaluation activities were performed. In particular, the learners completed the post-session test and filled out the exit tickets for additional feedback.\n\nMy audience included six new nurses from a critical care staff unit; they were rather active and chose to engage in brainstorming and discussions without much prompting. They also provided substantive, detailed feedback. Regarding the environmental concerns, which can affect the effectiveness of a session (Petersen, Jensen, Pedersen, & Rasmussen, 2015; Uzelac, Gligoric, & Krco, 2015), the lecture room (a college classroom) was generally fit for a lesson. In particular, it was well-ventilated, the lights in it could be controlled, and the space in it was sufficient for ten people, which is more than was required for my audience that included only six people. Thus, the classroom provided the environment necessary for the session; also, it contained the essential equipment, including the computer and projector with a wireless remote, as well as individual materials (worksheets and markers), and Blu Tacks. Internet access and electricity were supplied, but I also ensured the presence of backup materials for the case of issues with the mentioned resources. In the end, there were no resource shortages, and the equipment helped to enhance the learners’ experience; some of them commended its use.\n\nAn important technical issue that I encountered was the difficulty of making my voice heard. I felt that I needed to raise my voice and despite the fact that the classroom was not very large, I had to repeat myself a couple of times. I recognise that this problem could have prevented my learners from grasping crucial information. I think that a microphone could help, and I know that this equipment is available at my institution.\n\nBased on this detailed description of the session, I would say that at this moment, I feel satisfied with most of its aspects. However, in the process, I felt a little nervous at the beginning and gradually became more confident. Overall, the session went well, and I think that this outcome is connected to the active participation of the nurses, as well as my thorough preparation. The presence of the necessary resources is also noteworthy. As I had mentioned, there were some issues with my voice, and the timing was not perfect, but my decisions related to the active learning techniques proved to be helpful both in engaging learners and helping me to resolve my initial nervousness. I think that in future, I will proceed to keep to the teaching plan when implementing my sessions, but I will also make some time-related changes depending on the nurses’ needs. Furthermore, I will try to find a microphone to ensure that the environmental conditions for the session are optimal.\n\nTeaching Practicum Reflection – Educator and Learner Feedback\n\nTo evaluate the lesson, I used several tools, including a pre- and post-session test, an exit ticket, and my teacher’s feedback. All these approaches to evaluation are relatively well-established (Halbert, 2014; Marshall, 2018). I selected them for their ability to perform different functions. In particular, I wanted to have a relatively objective measure to determine the effect of my session, and I used the test to this end. Furthermore, I needed some subjective feedback from the learners to assess their thoughts and feelings related to the experience, and the exit tickets performed that function. Also, I wanted a professional to evaluate my work. Thus, the multiple approaches to evaluation were chosen.\n\nThe results were mostly positive, and my feelings with respect to this part of the session were and remain optimistic. If I were to evaluate this part of the experience, I would say that it went very well: I received meaningful feedback with notable suggestions for improvement. I would suggest that my learners and teachers did a very good job of pinpointing the strengths and weaknesses of my work. Consequently, I am led to think that my choice of the methods of the evaluation was successful as well. Naturally, the methodology has its limitations; in particular, the learners may have provided incomplete or insincere feedback for a number of reasons, including the unwillingness to criticise another’s work. However, I made sure that the process was anonymous, which, in my view, should have prevented such negative outcomes. I think that I can improve this aspect of the work in future by stressing the idea that the learners should provide their honest opinion and that negative feedback is most helpful to another’s an improvement.\n\nAs for the content of the evaluation, my session has helped some of the participants to improve their knowledge, but two of them proceeded to make mistakes in the post-session test. Four of the learners reported confusion with respect to the different elements of the session’s content. Also, the learners supported the content of the lesson (especially the use of examples and case studies), clarity of presentation, and the employment of the PowerPoint, as well as the group activities. The issues that they noted included the quick discussion of the interpretation of ABG, which I mentioned above. The teacher’s feedback praised the planning and implementation of the session, including the teaching methods, content, and evaluation strategies. Furthermore, the teacher commended the employment of group activities and suggested using more of them.\n\nComplete and diverse feedback makes me feel optimistic because it indicates my competence and suggests options for further improvement. Based on this information, I can assume that my activities and decisions were largely appropriate, which means that I should proceed to focus on the strong points emphasised by my learners and assessor, including diverse AL activities. However, I also should minimise confusion of my learners and attempt to engage them in AL to a greater extent. I think that this outcome can be achieved by encouraging questions, addressing the issues discovered through feedback, and including more AL activities that would help a student to improve their understanding of the topic.\n\nIn summary, the evaluation stage of my experience demonstrated my ability to choose appropriate evaluation techniques and yielded a lot of important information that can help me to improve my work. The feedback from my learners was a major contribution to my knowledge of the teaching process. My future action plan incorporates a focus on learners’ understanding and engagement and the acknowledgement of the effectiveness of the methods that I have employed.\n\nReferences\n\nBakon, S., Craft, J., Christensen, M., & Wirihana, L.

Figure 1 shows that LDL of the control group has two extreme outliers (82 and 120) whereas that of the group treated with drug C has a less extreme outlier (94). The distribution of LDL appears to violate the assumption of the normality in group A due to negative skew and group B owing to positive skew. The box plot (Figure 2) for HDL has less extreme outliers, 63 and 74, which distort the distribution of data. The control group and the treatment group C violates the assumption of normality caused by the negative skew of the distribution of HDL. In contrast, treatment groups A and B depict the existence of a positive skew in the distribution of HDL.\n\nAccording to descriptive statistics (Table 1) , when compared to the level of LDL in the control group (M = 101.10, SD = 9.848), groups treated with drug A (M = 86.20, SD = 6.795) and C (M = 83.20, SD = 4.442) had lower mean levels of LDL, whereas the group treated with drug B had a higher mean level of LDL (M = 121.40, SD = 9.834). Similarly, the mean level of HDL in the group treated with drug B (M = 68.60, SD = 3.134) was higher while those of groups treated with drug A (M = 53.70, SD = 3.466) and drug C (M = 64.70, SD = 4.029) were lower than in the control group (M = 58.70, SD = 6.075).\n\nMANOVA\n\nDescriptive statistics (Table 2) point out that drug A (M = 86.20, SD =6.975) and drug C (M = 97.98, SD = 4.442) decreased LDL levels as expected, but drug B (M = 12.40, SD = 9.834) increased the LDL level an unexpectedly. Comparatively, drug B (M = 68.70, SD = 3.134) and drug C (M = 64.70, SD = 4.029) increased HDL levels as predicated, but drug A decreased the HDL level unpredictably.\n\nTable 2.

A scale of measurement determines the nature of statistical analyses because ordinal and nominal scales favor non-parametric tests, whereas interval and ratio scales are robust for parametric tests (Pallant, 2016). Exploratory data analysis summarizes data by establishing the existence of specific patterns and trends.\n\nMoreover, exploratory data analysis aids in evaluating whether the distribution of data meets or violates applicable assumptions. Inferential statistics allow the determination of the statistical significance of noticeable trends and patterns of data.\n\nThe understanding of scales of measurement would greatly help me in formulating a questionnaire and collecting relevant data tailored to specific analyses in my dissertation work. The exploratory data analysis would enable me to describe trends and patterns in my dissertation, as well as assess if they meet the assumptions of inferential tests. Eventually, inferential statistics would assist in hypothesis testing and drawing of valid conclusions from my dissertation work.\n\nCritical analysis of the course shows that it did not cover factor analysis, which is essential to the design and development of Likert scales.

      "Hart-Landsburg and Burkett Argument Essay\n\nSince the late 1970s, China has been experiencing a tremendous growth in its economy. In 1978, the Communist Party of China commenced an economic reformation program that aimed at enhancing the economic growth and performance of China (Hudis 112).\n\nThis program aimed at enhancing the management of state owned enterprises (SOEs) as well as encouraging the development of privately owned enterprises. Thus, in addition to attaining high rates of economic growth and attracting foreign direct investments, the main aim of this economic reform was to transform the Chinese economy to a socialist market economy (Kraus 361).\n\nThe aim of this ideology was to ensure that this economy is primarily controlled by state owned corporations. With this strategy in place, it was believed that every individual in China would benefit from the results of economic development as the profits earned by SOEs would be evenly distributed within the population.\n\nAt the present moment, China is one of the nations that exhibit high economic growth rates in terms of GDP. However, from a critical angle, it is evident that the Chinese market is based on the capitalist system. It is due to this fact that Hart-Landsburg and Burkett argue that perhaps China has failed to achieve its economic reform goals that were set over four decades ago.\n\nThus, the measures that were put in place after the implementation of the market reforms only led to the growth of capitalism. Despite the fact that SOEs were dominant during the 1970s and the 1980s, the growth of private entrepreneurship started to flourish during the late 1980s and in the 1990s.\n\nConsequently, the Chinese government passed several legislations that not only encouraged the privatization of SOEs, but also played a significant role in attracting foreign direct investments which led to the growth of the private sector. In 1993 for instance, the labor law was passed in China. This law eliminated the control that the government had in the selection and recruitment processes and paved way for the free labor market.\n\nThis new concept used the demand and supply mechanism to determine the availability of jobs and the remuneration of employees. As a result, China has now been regarded as one of the main sources of cheap labor. Thus, many firms have moved their operations in this nation to enjoy the low costs of production.\n\nFrom this analysis, it is clear that the reformation program that was initiated by the Chinese government to rejuvenate socialism within China has failed. The results of this program have led the Chinese economy into a totally different path. The Chinese market is now based on capitalism.\n\nConsequently, most of the market industries and segments are dominated by foreign owned companies (Hart-Landsberg & Paul 13). Furthermore, Hart-Landsburg and Burkett argued that the results of this economic reformation process were not abrupt but came about in stages.\n\nHowever, the measures that were put to overcome the upcoming challenges did not achieve the desired results since they led the economy further down the capitalist lane. As a result, the contemporary Chinese market is characterized by income polarization, high levels of poverty, and increased research and explorations. Hart-Landsburg and Burkett categorise these characteristic as the indicators of a capitalism market.\n\nFour Major Imbalances in the Chinese Economy\n\nThe financial crisis of 2007/2008 was one of the most severe economic downfalls that the world has ever experienced since the great depression of the 1930s that almost crumbled the US economy (Feurberg 2). However, during the global financial crisis of 2007/2008, the Chinese economy was experiencing a positive growth. During the 2008/2009 financial year, China had a GDP of 9.2% (Lardy 3).\n\nNicholas Lardy, a financial analyst stated that China managed to overcome the financial crisis due to the fiscal monetary stimulus plan that it had put in place. However, Lardy further states that this economic stimulus plan will only be effective in the short run since it does not put into consideration the structural problems and imbalances that are currently present in the Chinese economy.\n\nOver the last eight years, the Chinese economy has been operating on a pressed financial system. Prior to 2003, the interest rate on returns in China averaged 3% (Lardy 4). However, since 2004, this rate has greatly decreased hence forcing more households to save a higher proportion of their disposable income.\n\nTo support his argument, Lardy presented a chart that showed the household savings in China between 1998 and 2008. In this chart, it is evident that the rate of saving has increased from 29% to 36%. To explain why the Chinese people tend to save when the interest rates are low, Lardy came up with a hypothesis that described the Chinese population as precautionary savers who want to attain a specific target of financial assets (Lardy 5).\n\nTo support his argument, Lardy commented on the costly healthcare system in China that required upfront payments prior to offering services to its clients. To averse this problem, Lardy recommended that the Chinese government should develop effective social safety services that would reduce the level of household savings and encourage expenditure.\n\nAnother imbalance that Lardy identified is the outsized real estate investment that is present in China. Since the beginning of the 21 st century, the rise in real estate investment and the sale of residential properties have been one of the leading drivers that have led to the high rate of economic growth that is being experienced in China. Between the year 2004 and 2010, the rate of residential properties in China has been growing at an average rate of 4.6%.\n\nThis rate is higher than the bank deposit rate that has been averaging at the rate of 0.7% during the same period (Lardy 6). Consequently, the residential property investments in China comprised of 9.1% of China’s GDP during the 2008/2009 financial year. This is higher than many nations in the world whose rate is below 5.2%. In an event of a bubble, Lardy warns that the Chinese market might suffer severe consequences than the USA during the 2007/2008 financial crisis.\n\nThe decline in interest rates charged on household savings and the consequent increase in savings by households has resulted in a repressive financial system in China (Feurberg 4). This is the third economic imbalance that Lardy identified.\n\nTo a higher extent, the commercial bank reserve levels are low hence increasing their level of borrowing and the amount of money circulating within the economy. This has greatly reduced the value of the Chinese currency. For instance, the exchange rate between 1995 and 2002 averaged 4.4%. However, this rate has stood at 0.5% since 2003. Thus, China needs to come up with policies that increase the reserve levels of commercial banks as a measure of curbing inflation.\n\nThe last imbalance that Lardy managed to identify is the subsidies that are present in the manufacturing sector, especially in the service industry. Given the repressive financial system that is present in China, households and commercial banks investors of the central bank. Thus, the government has access to low interest capital that it uses to fund state owned projects resulting in an imbalance in trade.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFeurberg, Garry 2012.

      "Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs) are the main products of dietary fiber fermentation and are believed to drive the fiber-related prevention of the metabolic syndrome. Here we show that dietary SCFAs induce a peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-γ (PPARγ)-dependent switch from lipid synthesis to utilization. Dietary SCFA supplementation prevented and reversed high-fat diet-induced metabolic abnormalities in mice by decreasing PPARγ expression and activity. This increased the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 and raised the AMP-to-ATP ratio, thereby stimulating oxidative metabolism in liver and adipose tissue via AMPK. The SCFA-induced reduction in body weight and stimulation of insulin sensitivity were absent in mice with adipose-specific disruption of PPARγ. Similarly, SCFA-induced reduction of hepatic steatosis was absent in mice lacking hepatic PPARγ. These results demonstrate that adipose and hepatic PPARγ are critical mediators of the beneficial effects of SCFAs on the metabolic syndrome, with clearly distinct and complementary roles. Our findings indicate that SCFAs may be used therapeutically as cheap and selective PPARγ modulators.",

The trail reveals:\n\nthe Valley's rise as a commercial and retail centre in the late nineteenth century\n\nimportant contributions by the Chinese community\n\nemergence of the Valley as the centre for Brisbane's lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community\n\nthe famous Fitzgerald Inquiry era\n\nThe Post Office was built in 1887 when the Valley was prospering.\n\nThe ground floor of this grand building provided postal and telegraph services and the upper floor was where the postmaster and his family lived. Originally, there was a small service wing at the rear of the building where the kitchen, dining room and servants' room were, but this has since been demolished.\n\nIn 1907, respected Chinese businessman and Queensland's first naturalized Chinese settler, James Dung Yow, started\n\ntranslating mail addresses sent in Chinese into English for the post office. This important service ensured that the many Chinese merchants, business owners and their families in the Valley received mail from their homeland.\n\nWith the onset of the Great Depression in 1929, the Fortitude Valley Post Office was responsible for the distribution of welfare payments to 1205 recipients weekly. At the time, this was one of Australia's busiest welfare distribution centres.\n\nIn the 1990s, the Fortitude Valley Post Office was converted into a nightclub,'The GPO', and remains one of Brisbane's most popular night spots.\n\nYou can download:\n\nCentenary Park Brisbane\n\nCentenary Place was created in 1925 to commemorate Queensland's centenary of European settlement. Within the park\n\nthere are two statues.The statue closest to Ann Street was created by renowned sculptor, Sir Bertram Mackennal and depicts Thomas Joseph Byrnes, the first Queensland Premier to be born in the State.\n\nThis statue was initially erected in 1902 on the corner of Boundary and Wickham Streets, but was moved to its present location when the park was created.\n\nIt is one of the earliest statues erected in Brisbane.\n\nThe second statue depicts famous Scottish poet, Robert Burns.\n\nThis statue was commissioned by the Brisbane Caledonian Society and Burns Club in 1929. Statues of Burns are traditionally positioned with their backs to the church and if the proposed Holy Name Cathedral had been constructed, this would have been the case.\n\nIn the 1960s and into the 1970s, Centenary Place became Brisbane's 'Speaker's Corner', with orators from all political and social sectors, including Aboriginal rights activists, conveying their messages to hundreds of listeners on Sunday afternoons. Today, Brisbane's 'Speaker's Corner' can be found in the city's King George Square.\n\nPlaces are on the Heritage Trail Map",

      "Callaway Golf Company’s Acquisition of Topgolf Essay\n\nTopgolf is a high-growth platform with favorable unit economics across its companies. It will benefit from Callaway’s solid financial position, which allows it to fully support Topgolf’s expansion ambitions at a low cost of capital. Both businesses are focused on golf and active-lifestyle customers. The acquired company will benefit from a compelling family of brands with reach across numerous channels, including retail, venues, e-commerce, and digital communities, thanks to Topgolf’s 90 million consumer contact points every year. Callaway’s golf equipment and soft products companies benefit from Topgolf’s efforts to introduce new players to the game of golf (Repar, 2021). The merged company’s industry-leading sales, marketing, and partnership infrastructure will enhance traffic, same-venue revenues, and new business conversion. The combined consumer reach of Callaway and Topgolf will result in enhanced promotion, exposure, and sales of equipment and clothing to golfers and non-golfers alike (Repar, 2021). A common innovation culture opens attractive long-term options, such as the ability to transmit information for teaching, exercise, and lifestyle across linked displays.\n\nThe company’s core platform, which is distinguished by immersive games, proprietary technology, and locally sourced, high-quality food and beverage, is a one-of-a-kind social destination for everyone. Topgolf locations are physically positioned to profit from customer preferences for outdoor activities because of their open-air, climate-controlled bays. In 2019, Topgolf served more than 23 million visitors from 63 sites throughout the world, including a strong pipeline of new openings, with more than half of customers identifying as non-golfers (Repar, 2021). Topgolf has a significant digital presence in the game of golf through World Golf Tour, a popular mobile golf game with 28 million subscribers as of 2019 (Repar, 2021).

      "Managers’ Concern Over Employee Motivation Issues Essay\n\nMotivation is the process whereby an individual’s endeavors are stimulated, guided, and maintained toward achieving a goal. Thus, the responsibility of management is to monitor and direct workers in a company (Usmonovich, 2021). This is required since it is a method of inducing individuals to work, which they are capable and equipped to do freely. Even though most people have to work for a livelihood and a job is an essential part of everyone’s lives, administrators must be apprehensive about employee motivation concerns for various reasons. Managers have several valid reasons to be concerned about motivating employees.\n\nFirstly, individual success in a company is viewed as a product of talent and inspiration. Additionally, the ability is influenced by education, expertise, and learning, and its development is a difficult and laborious process, whereas motivation may be accelerated (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, employee motivation is widely recognized as critical to a corporation’s success. In addition, a business that struggles with staff motivation is more likely to experience lower output, defective manufacturing, or other problems, and managers must guarantee that this does not happen (Usmonovich, 2021).\n\nSecondly, an administrator’s role in the company is to get tasks completed through staff. In order to sustain desired objectives, thus, leaders need to be able to notice the decreasing engagement and improve staff morale. To comprehend motivation, one must first recognize fundamental human nature, which may be both complicated and straightforward at the same time (Usmonovich, 2021). Understanding and appreciating the above is a necessity for successful employee motivation in the workplace, as well as good management and organizational achievement.\n\nThirdly, a business is less likely to fulfill its goals if its personnel is not entirely committed. When people lose interest in their employment, organizations will see a commensurate drop in determination, invention, and productivity. The leadership that declines to confront these issues immediately endangers their job, as the firm relies on them to guarantee that employees regularly perform at a high level (Usmonovich, 2021). Thus, managers must be familiar with motivational strategies as well as comprehend their workers’ unique peculiarities and views to select incentives that will effectively motivate them to work together to achieve the organization’s goals.\n\nReference\n\nUsmonovich, T.

      "The Concept of Utilitarian Ethical and Moral Position Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Factual Component\n 3. Argumentative Component\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nUtilitarianism is a theory of morality that defends actions that contribute to well-being or pleasure and counteracts activities that provoke misfortune or harm. At the same time, utilitarian philosophy attempts to explain how social, political, and personal decisions affect the nation’s quality of life and the individual. Thus, it is significant to establish whether the absence of human desire to influence one’s own life equates it with animal morality.\n\nFactual Component\n\nUtilitarians believe that some people are morally equal to animals because they have lost the value of any free action and agree to live by the laws of society. Hence, concerning a quiet and satisfying life, they can sacrifice dreams and principles as animals (File, 2022). That is such a person’s consent to having lied about the true state of affairs, which will enable them to live in an illusionary world. Utilitarians assume that such people neglect their own autonomy to benefit from the delusion of a tranquil life (File, 2022). Although in reality, such individuals will gain nothing except missed opportunities and a lack of choice in their own lives.\n\nThey argue that people who decide not to consider their own values and desires receive not a better life but a lifestyle without understanding the situation around them. Instead, they will live by the rules that have been imposed on them from the outside; this perception of the world resembles not human freedom but animal instinct (File, 2022). At the same time, utilitarians provide the example of Robert Nozick. He indicated that if a person believes that he is living a happy existence only because he does not know the truth, his life will be primitive and incomplete (File, 2022). This can be compared to the life of animals, which obtain certain benefits but are totally dependent on humans.\n\nMeanwhile, utilitarians hold a parallel between dying patients who refuse painkillers and those who abandon conscious choice. They argue that patients have the courage to assess their condition clearly and want to make their own decisions (File, 2022). Therefore, in order to be independent and intentional, autonomy is an essential part of life, which can only be accomplished by enthusiastic participation in one’s own and community life. That is, those who renounce their own autonomy are morally equal to animals.\n\nArgumentative Component\n\nOne can concede that the utilitarian assertion is correct through a number of factors. Considering that autonomy in decision-making and the conscience of citizens contribute to a fair assessment of the situation, the absence of such factors means that one has no moral and physical will. That is, when the not always justifiable laws of society become superior to one’s own desires and beliefs, then the identity of each individual is destroyed. It is also essential to mention that persons who receive certain benefits cannot be sure that, due to their own decisions, they would not have it (File, 2022). Therefore, the absence of their own will does not enable them to attempt to organize their lives in any other way, which creates a complete dependence on the ruling elite’s power. As a consequence, such humans become morally equal to animals because they have forfeited the capability of controlling their own lives.\n\nConclusion\n\nHence, the absence of freedom of choice, voice, and opinion for some individuals equate them morally with animals. This is because they are dependent in the same way as animals on those who have more power and influence. At the same time, such people are no longer capable of organizing their own lives because they have lost all authority and have agreed to an illusion that is not supported by real circumstances. That is, to be a successful person, it is essential to have autonomy of decision-making, planning, and their own values. If such factors are absent, humans morally become equal to animals.\n\nReference\n\nFile. (2022). Chapter 1 & chapter 2 .\n",

Multicore Processors\n 5. Power Consumption\n 6. Operating Systems in Embedded Systems\n 7. Conclusion\n 8. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nCurrently, the world has advanced with innovative technological applications in an embedded system built on platforms of single-board-based technology. Various fields and platforms have received an increased application of embedded systems, providing increased flexibility for interfacing communication protocols (De Micco et al., 2019). System-on-Chip (SoC) and the Internet of Things (IoT) have provided debugging tools to create newer opportunities and challenge the development of future improved system applications. The area of embedded systems has received massive development because of emerging platforms dependent on computers and embedded systems for controlling and monitoring all matters autonomously (Patil & Tupe, 2020). Embedded systems have played a vital role in various aspects of modern life, influencing wide-ranging sectors of individuals, including businesses and healthcare. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring various trends in embedded systems due to advancements in technology.\n\nAn embedded system entails integrating technical and mechanical components, software, and computer hardware dedicated to performing specific tasks or sets of functions as part of a more extensive system. The majority of embedded systems require a meeting of real-time computing prerequisites. According to Medvedev et al. (2018), major components of an embedded system include integrated chips, printed circuit board assembly, industry-specific interfaces and protocols, real-time operating systems (RTOS), and microcontrollers or digital signal processors. The latest trends in the embedded system include SoC, IoT, wireless connectivity, power consumption, multicore processors, and operating systems.\n\nSystem-on-Chip (SoC)\n\nSoC represents the integrated circuit design revolution due to technological advancements that allow integrating crucial subsystems and components, making electronic products onto integrated chipset or single chip. SoC has reduced cost, size, power consumption, and increased performance capabilities. The development of real-time embedded systems has utilized these main factors (Patil & Tupe, 2020). Currently, the main SoC designs involve at least a programmable processor and integration of high-speed bus system, peripheral buses, on-chip communication structures processor bus, reduced instruction set computing (RISC) control processor, and digital signal processor. SoC processors also found it essential to link off-chip and the hierarchy of on-chip memory units (De Micco et al., 2019). Future SoC will require incorporating chemical processing and MEMS-based actuators and sensors.\n\nInternet of Things (IoT) and Wireless Connectivity\n\nIoT entails interconnected computing devices, people, objects, and digital and analog machines offering unique identifiers and the probability of transferring data autonomously over a network. The evolution of IoT has occurred due to the convergence of micro-electromechanical systems, wireless technologies, and the internet. The convergence of these technologies and devices enhances system analysis, giving insight into improvements (Greco et al., 2020). IoT has increased the automation and development of smart homes and cities. In the near future, the state of the art of embedded technologies is projected to grow drastically to meet the increasing demand in different industries that use the technology. The technology world is undergoing unprecedented changes, with the mobile phone market experiencing surged forward innovation, technology, and revenue earned.\n\nOver the past years, embedded devices operated as stand-alone systems, and the advancement of wireless connectivity changed this scenario. According to Zurawski (2018), there is speculation that short and long-range wireless protocols will receive widespread applications in the near future. These long-range protocols include cellular communications, long-term evolution (LTE), wireless local area network, and WiMAX, while short-range include near field communications, RFID, Zigbee, and Bluetooth. Current trends in wireless connectivity for applications in embedded systems include short-range protocol applications, reduced power utilization, system-on-chip architecture, and the internet of things.\n\nMulticore Processors\n\nThere has been an increasing need for high performance in embedded systems due to additional functionalities. As a result, system design developers have increased their knowledge about multicore processors to make the right decisions. Multicore processors have also become a sub-specialization due to their demand for low thermal in small form factor settings. Chip manufacturers have created faster single-core processors to meet the increasing demand for performance prerequisites. Devices, smartphones, and gaming consoles are multicores in the current world, thereby getting smarter (Gerstlauer & Shrivastava, 2022). The technologies have also provided an avenue for design engineers to relearn the design, testing, debugging, programming, architecture, and design space to remain informed about new optimal power use offered by multicore. Multicore processors resolve the need to combine multiple OS on the same system and mix new features with legacy codes.\n\nContrary to traditional embedded systems that constitute multiple subsystems, a highly integrated system can be developed to run on a single processing system, which decreases maintenance and manufacturing costs by eliminating redundant hardware. In the near future, to achieve multiprocessing functionalities by embedded systems, there could be a need for migrating existing systems to multicore platforms (Jayaprakasam et al., 2017). The adoption of multicore processors will rely on the rate at which technology standardization about programming methodologies, compilers, RTOS, debuggers, and integrated development environments are adopted in the whole technology ecosystem. Advancement in processor design underscores increased clock speed, efficiency, power consumption, and integrated graphics performance. The convergence of devices features and technologies are occurring rapidly, posing a need for connectivity that drives electronic device designs (De Micco et al., 2019). Because of risking security attacks, embedded systems components such as applications, operating systems, and processors require having better security features to handle security challenges and preserve personal and professional information.\n\nPower Consumption\n\nPower consumption has been an integral differentiator amid available embedded systems. Some applications need an extension of battery life to specific periods, which when using intelligent scheduling of reception and transmission become only helpful to a certain extent. Therefore, manufacturers of embedded systems have become responsible for reducing power consumption, considering aspects like the time interval by allowing devices in radio communications to remain in sleep mode when not in use. Enhanced processing power in electronic devices has driven the need to have better video processing for professional and personal data transfers (Patil & Tupe, 2020). Innovation application use is developed to use converged platforms and social networking to share the video across devices.\n\nOperating Systems in Embedded Systems\n\nTraditionally embedded systems lacked operating systems; instead, they used lightweight control programs that offered limited memory services and input/outputs. However, the increase in complexity among systems made it inevitable to have operating systems that allow real-time responses and low latency while continuously giving traditional functionality, including error checking, memory protection, and transparent inter-process communication. The increased functionality of embedded systems has enhanced its application to national defense, aerospace, automotive electronics, industrial controls, consumer electronics, and communications. When operating source toolchains, the introduction of multicore also requires multi-board debugging, multiprocessor, multiprocess, multithread, and multimission. Jayaprakasam et al. (2017) posit that this has shifted designs away from proprietary operating systems and toolchains, opting for more open-source platforms for deployment and development. The key differentiator of new system designs has cost. Smartphones and most new handheld devices use android operating systems.\n\nMobile devices, networks, and real-time applications make embedded systems highly important. Some of the contributors to the trends in embedded systems include the increasing growth of aerospace, consumer electronic applications, military, and healthcare. Embedded highly customizable systems have driven innovation with varieties of programming strategies. Medvedev et al. (2018) assert that the increase in embedded systems has resulted in new design software and techniques specific to those systems. Embedded systems have become vital to the modern world, and the Python programming language has become popular among software developers and embedded systems engineers. The diversity of python and its popularity in system architectures has placed it in an ideal position to begin programming embedded electronics in the future. The simplicity of python has resulted in effective collaboration leading to faster development of projects that push technology forward.\n\nRegardless of global economic turbulence, continued investments would provide more efficient and innovative solutions in the embedded domain to cater to existing trends. According to Medvedev et al. (2018), the rapid changing and growth of the embedded market will make individuals and companies constantly develop and innovate low power, fast, efficient, and cost-effective solutions to consumers. Therefore, trends in embedded systems will affect an individual’s choices when making purchase recommendations for a client. These trends influence memory allocation, compatibility and integrity, safety and security risks, energy efficiency, and cost. With increasing cyberattacks, safety and security risks will be a significant concern in trends like the Internet of Things. During purchase recommendations, consumers will require a system designed to guarantee their safety of personal information and preservation of confidentiality.\n\nEnergy consumption influences the cost of operation and potentially affects the consumer budget. Therefore, the trends in embedded systems focus on developing systems that are energy efficient and less costly (Patil & Tupe, 2020). Consumers will be recommended to purchase less expensive systems with higher performance and less energy consumption. Efficient systems with higher performance will make it easier for clients to meet their desired outcomes. Over the years, there has been an increasing need for more extensive data storage due to big data. As a result, memory allocation of embedded systems will affect client recommendations. Clients will require a system with sufficient memory storage to handle increasing data and provide real-time information.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, embedded systems form an integral part of the modern world. The systems are purpose-built for particular applications, enabling design and optimization, making it probable for a client to benefit from using it while minimizing power consumption and cost. Studies show that embedded systems have greatly influenced healthcare, military, and businesses, with technologies and movements such as the industrial revolution, the Internet of Things, and intelligent vehicles and homes continuing to gain traction. The telecommunication industry contains the most significant market shares of embedded systems applications applied in networks interrelated to wireless communications and a segment of microcontrollers. Some of the trends in embedded systems include artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, cybersecurity, machine learning, speeds, and python programming language. The trends in embedded systems influence clients’ recommendations using the products. They have different needs and preferences like safety and confidentiality, data storage, performance speeds, power consumption, and cost. It is depicted that embedded systems are evolving, focusing on increasing performance speeds, developing cybersecurity systems, less power consumption, and cost-efficient.\n\nReference\n\nDe Micco, L., Vargas, F.

      "How Intellectual Property Laws Don’t Contradict the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 Essay\n\nIn the United States Congress, the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 was the first statute to outlaw trusts. When many companies’ investors agreed to transfer their interests to a single set of trustees, a trust was formed. The Sherman Act empowered the government to dissolve trusts through legal action. This paper aims to discuss how intellectual property laws don’t contradict the Sherman antitrust act of 1890.\n\nThe Sherman Antitrust Act was enacted to Congress’ constitutional authority to control interstate commerce. Courts have made it clear that a firm cannot use a legal monopoly in one market. For example, if a market lacks a better product or commercial acumen, an intellectual property right might be used to gain trust in that market (Sawyer, 2019). Second, monopolists are prohibited from engaging in activity that reduces customer welfare. Firms are banned, for example, from linking a protected product to a non-protected product to extend their intellectual property rights.\n\nAntitrust law also opposes monopolization attempts in a protected product’s aftermarket. Antitrust theorists are also working on a nonprice predation theory, in which a monopolistic firm’s efforts to raise its rival’s expenses would be a breach of antitrust laws. A corporation may achieve exclusionary market dominance and hence the ability to raise prices, harming consumer welfare by participating in such behavior. Intellectual property law has evolved several measures that supplement antitrust initiatives to combat intellectual property rights misuse (Sawyer, 2019). Conclusively, exaggerated conceptions of the power granted by IP rights and anticipated dangers to competition abound in the history of antitrust action involving intellectual property. As a result, there have been challenges in antitrust cases involving IP tactics where none previously existed. To be sure, striking the correct balance between maintaining competition and incentivizing innovation is not simple.\n\nReference\n\nSawyer, L. P. (2019).

      "Mental Health Nursing Practice and Ethical Issues Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Scenario of Ethical Dilemma Case\n 3. Scenario’s Ethical Conflicts\n 4. Possible Action Plan based on Ethical Theories and Principles\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor nurses, their job is hard daily work requiring profound knowledge, skills, and dedication. The profession demands them to be sustainable and responsible, meet the requirements, and comply with the main work principles. With nurses, patients most often communicate, ask and answer, talk and listen. Hospitals, in particular those dealing with patients with mental illness, are considerably challenging places of work. Employees daily see human suffering, own limited capabilities, and face severe ethical dilemmas. Solving ethical problems also requires precise knowledge and professionalism, the ability to make the best decision in critical situations.\n\nPsychiatry differs significantly from other areas of medicine, including in ethics. The field is gradually expanding as, in addition to clearly defined diseases, personnel also should deal with more hidden disorders. At the same time, society is still not tolerant enough towards patients with mental illness and has prejudices. Such an image affects the desire to seek professional help, provokes a pessimistic view on treatment, and makes patients even more vulnerable. Moreover, this image can affect the social and professional life of the patient. For this reason, ethical treatment has a critical significance in relations between patients and medical staff.\n\nThe most effective medical and psychiatric care is provided in a hospital. In their practical activities, doctors and nurses of the department should be guided by the principles of medical ethics. For example, among the main requirements that stand out: the actions aimed at the benefit of patients, respecting their interests, and medical confidentiality. Mentally ill people do not always realize that their condition is dangerous – for themselves or surrounding people. Therefore, the situation of providing them help in the psychiatric hospital is perceived as violent and often provokes resistance. In the hospital, such people often refuse treatment, the need to observe the regime, and taking drugs. Doctors and staff have to resort to coercion, which, however, should not contradict the humane approach to the patient.\n\nThe Scenario of Ethical Dilemma Case\n\nThe scenario presented and studied below is hypothetical, and similarities with real people are coincidental. However, considered ethical dilemmas might arise in actual nursing practice. The purpose of the presented case and analysis is to evaluate the ethical aspects of providing care to a patient in a psychiatric ward. Another objective of the paper is to provide recommendations for treatment in accordance with the moral and ethical principles of the profession of a mental health nurse.\n\nMichael is a 28-year-old man who cannot continue his career as an athlete due to an injury – he lost his leg. The sport was the basis of his life, and the man devoted all his time and efforts to it. Besides sports, Michael had few activities and hobbies, and he sought to build a career only in this area. The incident during vacation, which led to an injury, happened two years and since then, Michael’s psychological condition has been deteriorating.\n\nHe is divorced, has no children, and does not maintain relations with his parents. At first, the man sought to survive only the loss of his leg, but then he felt confused and uncertain about what his life was worth. He is also always tired, annoyed and speaks of feeling ill. Since the primary basis in his life is destroyed, he does not see the goal before himself, feels the meaninglessness and pity of his situation. Due to lost opportunities and not seeing prospects for the future, Michael is experiencing depression.\n\nHospitalized after a suicide attempt, Michael does not want to take medication but still does, obeying the rules. Disability as a result of the trauma and hospitalization significantly depresses the man, and he sees no point in taking drugs. Besides resisting medication sometimes, Michael is apathetic to staying in the hospital, prefers being private, and does not participate in discussions. Although the man’s time in the hospital is relatively short, there is no sign of improvement, and even vice versa – he is very devastated.\n\nConcerned about Michael’s condition, nurses seek extraordinary control – they check whether there are any things that can be used for harm. They also carefully monitor medication use and consider the option of adding medication to food fraudulently if Michael will refuse to take them. However, deception threatens to worsen relations with the patient and can provoke his resistance. Moreover, questions arise about how acceptable such actions are and whether they violate patient autonomy. This concept implies people’s freedom to make crucial decisions that concern them personally, including their treatment. However, the disease can disrupt the ability to think reasonably and push for wrong choices. At the time of arriving in the hospital, nurses can note the following characteristics of the patient:\n\n  * Risk of harm associated with feelings of inferiority and hopelessness.\n  * Ineffective coping with trauma and its consequences – disability.\n  * Grief related to irretrievable lifestyle changes and lost life values.\n  * Social exclusion related to family separation and non-communication.\n\nThus, Michael suffers from depression and requires treatment so that no new incidents occur. This condition is quite common and is often not taken with sufficient severity. People suffering from depression feel sad, hopeless, insecure, and experience many other negative emotions (“Depression,” 2020). Failing to provide Michael with timely care could lead to a new suicide attempt. However, with proper treatment, he has a chance to find and discover new opportunities for himself.\n\nScenario’s Ethical Conflicts\n\nNurses that usually communicate with patients much closer and more than doctors face the suffering and pain of their wards directly. At the same time, they have a crucial role in supporting the ethical treatment and preservation of human rights (Ventura et al., 2020). Ethical conflicts may arise when nurses are unsure which direction of the patient support to choose. While staff behavior should be consistent with the benefit of their patients, there may be different views on it. For example, actions will benefit in the future but violate patient autonomy. Moreover, sometimes nurses may disagree with the chosen course of action concerning a person, and, as a result, moral pressure arises (Ventura et al., 2020). For these reasons, stress tolerance and the ability to make decisions based on accepted ethical principles are essential.\n\nNurses exhibit paternalism in the described scenario, which is common in the field. This concept reflects the practice where people with specific power can restrict those who are subordinate or dependent on them (Ventura et al., 2020). Patients are obliged to respect the work of medical personnel and obey their instructions as they act in the interests of their wards (“When hospitalization is needed,” 2020). At the same time, nurses can limit autonomy while the patient is under supervision, hoping that he will be able to manage his freedom independently, adequately, and for good in the future.\n\nOne solution to the described situation is the option where Michael’s incompetence in solving issues of self-care and his health will be proved. The state of depression in which the man is in and the tendency to suicide indicate the possibility that he can choose a decision which he would not make without depression. Depression is characterized by impaired information processing and perceiving the world in a pessimistic view (Baruth & Lapid, 2017; LeMoult & Gotlib, 2019). Owen et al. (2018) study proves that people with depression have a broken vision of reality and projecting themselves into the future, which is critical for self-determination and decision-making. Proven incompetence solves the conflict of autonomy of the patient because he cannot act in the name of his well-being.\n\nIncompetence in decision-making must be established officially, and a guardian must be appointed. Michael, as an adult, is considered competent if the opposite is not proven (Australian Law Reform Commission, 2010). The recognition process may take a long time, and since Michael currently has no relatives whom he would fully trust, there will also be problems in finding a guardian. A lengthy process will take time, which could be spent on treatment and not promote patient trust in the staff. Nevertheless, it is critical to consider Michael’s autonomy, as otherwise, nurses may face severe moral and legal complications.\n\nIf Michael is recognized as competent in decision-making, the conflict about how much his autonomy relates to his well-being remains open. Several additional factors are essential and influential for his case. His state of depression is reversible since, with proper treatment, he may see new prospects. Michael’s disability, although it may limit his freedom, still leaves him with many opportunities in life. In addition, the intervention of nurses is not violent, does not cause severe physical inconvenience, and is aimed at the patient’s benefit.\n\nA potential violation of a patient’s autonomy may also contradict his right to dignity. Although some researchers argue that the concepts of dignity and autonomy are interchangeable, their differences are still crucial for ethical decision-making in healthcare (Simões & Sapeta, 2019). The researchers also note the fact that despite the importance of understanding dignity in medicine, no single definition has yet been inferred for it (Simões & Sapeta, 2019). Dignity refers to the practice when the individual is treated respectfully and honorably – patients whose dignity the staff respects feel they are worth as people and deserve a good attitude. Respect for human dignity is critical for treatment, as it is the basis for patient-centered care. In Michael’s case, excessive surveillance, he may perceive as disrespectful for him and as a violation of personal boundaries. However, the concept of dignity also includes self-respect, which in this case, is disrupted. Michael may temporarily not adequately perceive himself and his desires due to a depressed condition.\n\nThis case can also be considered from the point of view of such ethical principles, which should guide representatives of medical personnel in their actions as veracity and fidelity. They suggest that nurses should be honest with patients and loyal to them (Casale, 2017). The fact that nurses are considering the cheating option indicates a violation of integrity. At the same time, their actions, in their opinion, are probably aimed at improving the patient’s life. For this reason, the issue of fidelity is intertwined with the conflict of autonomy. Nurses are faithful to Michael’s interests because they think about his possible future – this is a manifestation of loyalty. At the same time, their actions against the patient’s will violate the trust which can be achieved between them.\n\nPossible Action Plan based on Ethical Theories and Principles\n\nAs demonstrated in the previous section, the present case is characterized by several ethical conflicts. Nurses’ actions should be based on ethical concepts and theories. According to Casale (2017), utilitarianism involves achieving the common good – happiness for more people by any means. It may seem that this approach suggests the possibility of cheating or declaring Michael incompetent. However, in this case, the nurses will be under moral pressure. Kantianism is the opposite direction, which puts forward the path to achieving a specific goal and not the goal itself. As part of this approach, the principles of autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and similar are considered (Casale, 2017). Based on both of these approaches, nurses should choose more ethical actions instead of deception – they will bring more good and be more consistent with professional duties.\n\nMichael’s autonomy and dignity are also critical for his recovery and must be respected. Trusting relationships with nurses can contribute to his sooner healing. Ignoring independence and dignity will also violate the principles of beneficence and nonmaleficence. Impaired by disability, Michael’s self-esteem may suffer even more if he learns about deception and disrespect by staff. Moreover, as indicated earlier, his possible incompetence in decision-making must be formally proven and may have destructive consequences for self-perception. Fraud by nurses is also excluded so that the principles of honesty and fidelity are respected. Based on all the arguments presented, nurses cannot give Michael drugs fraudulently, and it is necessary to focus on treatment – the effects of drugs and his moral support.\n\nConclusion\n\nThus, the proposed scenario of patient Michael suffering from depression and suicidal ideation raises several ethical conflicts. Nurses concerned about the condition of the man show excessive paternalism and consider deceiving the patient for his benefit. For this reason, the most crucial issue in the case is the question of the balance of the patient’s autonomy and well-being in the circumstances of a depressive condition. Staff fraud also involves a violation of the principles of fidelity and veracity. Nurses have the task of acting for Michael’s recovery while respecting the necessary ethical principles.\n\nBased on existing ethical theories and principles, patient autonomy is preferred in this case. For his part, Michael as a patient, must respect the rules established in the hospital. Nurses must treat him with dignity and respect to provide patient-centered care. This approach is necessary for the patient as it will contribute to improving the emotional state. In the case, if the deterioration of the condition noticed by nurses continues to be observed, Michael’s doctors should consider the option of changing drugs. Thus, in this case, nurses should focus on a softer and more ethical approach.\n\nNurses’ actions should be based on attention and the ability to listen to the patient. Understanding a person in a depressed state, his thoughts, often not coinciding with reality and reacting correctly, is a very challenging task. For instance, it is especially critical to avoid condescension, neglect, and pity in the conversation in Michael’s case. Therefore, mental health care has high requirements for nurse professionalism and the development of patient communication skills.\n\nReferences\n\nAustralian Law Reform Commission. (2010).

      "The Characteristics and Importance of COVID-19 Research Paper\n\nCoronavirus infection is caused by beta-coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 that was indicated in samples of lung fluid from patients with pneumonia in Chinese town Wuhan at the end of 2019. The name of the virus derives from its shape on electron micrographs of the solar corona. SARS-CoV-2 is the abbreviation of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2. First, scientists identified the coronavirus family in 1965 that was relevant to the alphacoronavirus family, attached to a respiratory group of viruses, and caused cold-like symptoms.\n\nNowadays, the whole world is struggling with COVID-19 pandemics, and the key reason for its spreading and its high contagiousness are still being discovered. Some say it came from the animal world, while other researchers believe it was a laboratory leak from Wuhan Institute of Virology where scientists studied coronavirus on bats. Infection is mostly spread via respiratory droplets or aerosols from a sick person. Contamination can also be caused by touching surfaces after an infected human.\n\nTo become infected, people need close contact with each other, at least one meter. The viral load is also a significant epidemiological indicator which means, if not enough virions are inhaled, the person is less likely to become infected. However, according to a study by Yu and Yang (2020), asymptomatic patients have a similar viral load to the patients with symptoms, and they can spread the infection similarly. This fact remains a major issue of epidemiology as symptomless carriers are the “silent” spreaders of COVID-19.\n\nTo resist the infection, people were asked and later obliged to wear face masks. At the beginning of pandemics, everyone followed the rules; however, the constant regime of mask usage started tiring the population, and a decent part of people neglect masks explaining it as difficulties with breathing, lack of oxygen at subsequent fainting, along with many other reasons. Nevertheless, a sustainable number of individuals are following this rule. According to Shen et al. (2021), the proportions of people who always wear a face mask in New York, Texas, Florida, and California were estimated to be 76.6%, 71,7%, 58,7%, and 76,6%, respectively. As the numbers show, at least one-third of the population of these states reject mask usage.\n\nA mask is an essential tool to restrain the infection. It consists of an outer part that has small “pockets” lean one to another that makes contaminative agents slide on its surface. On the inner part, on the opposite, the mask has valleys that hold each other from downstairs and “catch” bacteria and viruses.\n\nIn more simple words, a mask is a mechanical barrier to the infection, and it is advantageous to wear it. Still, some part of the population does not know this information and wear masks improperly: upside down, showing nose and mouth, and in other various interpretations. Furthermore, it was scientifically proved that mask use decreases the transmission rate in nearly linear proportion to the product of mask efficiency and coverage rate (Eikenberry et al., 2020). Soon after people start wearing masks properly, there is a higher chance to decrease the numbers of infected and, consequently, the percentage of seriously ill patients.\n\nVaccination is the second significant step on the way to limit the infection and start controlling it. Modern vaccines are made with the help of genetic engineering using mRNA or DNA of the virus inserted in host cells giving them instructions for making copies of spike proteins (parts of coronavirus). Spike proteins stimulate the immune system to produce antibodies and develop memory cells (T-lymphocytes). This pull of taught cells will be the first barrier to fight coronavirus infection the next time body meets it.\n\nCurrently, three vaccines are authorized by FDA in the United States. Pfizer-BioNTech shows more than 95% efficiency according to the study estimating 596,618 people (Dagan et al., 2021). Moderna is using the same technology as Pfizer but it has milder rules for transportation. Additionally, there have been reports about hypersensitivity reactions: 5,0 and 2,8 cases per million doses for Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines respectively (Mustafa et al., 2021).\n\nThe Johnson & Johnson vaccine is using a virus vector technology. Adenovirus is taken as a carrier of genetic code on the spike proteins to the cells. The advantage of this vaccine is easier storage and only one injection which makes the process of vaccination easier. Data released that Johnson & Johnson is 66% effective in preventing moderate to severe COVID-19 and 100% effective in preventing COVID-19 related hospitalization and death (Livivston et al., 2021). How long the antibodies will serve vaccinated people is still an open question as more time is needed for statistically right results. However, researchers claim that the average time for immunity is 8 months and, afterward, revaccination will be needed.\n\nThus, to fight the COVID-19 pandemic, the population needs an effective mask usage and a higher percent of vaccinated. No vaccine can promise resistance to the virus but all of them can milder the severity of the disease and prevent repercussions of the post-COVID syndrome. Being afraid to take a vaccine because of its side effects is senseless as the side effects of SARS-CoV-2 can be more severe. The group of people that are against vaccines should not believe in myths and propaganda and read scientific reports instead. Government can also help reduce this gap in common knowledge by spreading the information using simple language and supporting the population in vaccinating. With these changes, the number of infected will significantly reduce, and humans will be able to control the infection.\n\nReferences\n\nEikenberry, S.

      "Opioid Misuse and Academic Achievement of Veteran Students Essay\n\nIntroduction and Significance\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe number of veteran students I growing fast. Since 2020, the number of veteran students in the US has nearly doubled (McGuffin, 2017). Thus, policy-makers and scholars are becoming increasingly interested in the problems veterans face during their studies in higher education institutions. It is commonly known that opioid misuse is prevalent among veterans, as up to 35% of veterans received pain treatment with opioids at some point.\n\nProlonged treatment with opioids is associated with an increased risk of developing addictions, which can cause significant cognitive and social problems. However, there are no studies that discuss how opioid misuse affects the academic achievement of veteran students. The proposed research aims at closing the gap in the existing literature by studying the influence of opioid misuse on the academic achievement of veteran students.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nFactors Affecting Academic Achievements of Veteran Students\n\nThe academic achievement of veteran students has been a matter of interest for researchers for more than half a century. After World War II, early researchers viewed veterans as superior to civilians in terms of academic achievement (Gowan, 1947; Owens & Owens, 1949). However, the researchers realized that there were different factors contributing to the academic achievement of veteran students. Gowan (1947) stated that there were at least seven factors that affect academic achievement, including social group participation, presence of educational goals, attitude towards grades, time spent in study, attitude toward courses and instructions, attitude towards individual attention and instruction, and attitude towards class attendance.\n\nOwens and Owens (1949) also believed that age, aptitude score test results, and the number of years in service were also indicative of academic achievement. However, the results of Pearson’s correlation tests revealed that the number of years in service had a small negative impact on grade point average (Owens & Owens, 1949).\n\nCurrently, veteran students are a distinct population with their unique characteristics. A systematic review conducted by Barry et al. (2014) concluded that veteran students are different in comparison with their civilian counterparts. Veteran students have a lower GPA, an increased chance of engaging in risky behavior, lower social support, and different drinking motivations (Barry et al., 2014). Additionally, veterans usually have lower confidence levels and adaptation to academic life (Barry et al., 2014). These unique characteristics of the population often put veterans at a disadvantage while receiving higher education.\n\nLow GPAs of veteran students can be explained by a wide variety of reasons that partially contribute to the matter. Psychological well-being is one of the factors that can contribute to the decreased academic performance of veteran students. In particular, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and depression often lead to reduced ability and motivation to perform the tasks needed to achieve high grades (Bryan et al., 2014; Clark & Walker, 2020).\n\nHowever, the effect of PTSD and depression are moderated by the demographic characteristics of veteran students. Elliott et al. (2011) suggested that combat experience and associated PTSD can cause alienation of veteran students. Quantitative analysis revealed that alienation could cause decreased academic achievement in veteran students (Elliot et al., 2011). Eakman et al. (2019) also mentioned the importance of academic self-efficacy. In short, there is a wide variety of internal factors that can influence the academic achievement of students.\n\nAt the same time, there are many environmental factors that may contribute to the decreased academic achievement of veteran students. The majority of the environmental factors were discussed by Semer and Harmening (2015). The researchers mentioned that environmental factors included receiving oral feedback from faculty members, engagement in some types of co-curricular activities, physical exercise, attending events on campus, and time spent committing to class (Semer & Harmening, 2015). Additionally, Clark and Walker (2020) mention the importance of seating on the academic performance of students. Eakman et al. (2019) emphasize the importance of support from the instructors. In summary, factors that affect the academic achievement of students is a widely discussed matter among scholars both historically and recently.\n\nOpioid Misuse among Veterans\n\nThe problem of opioid misuse among veterans is a subject of heated discussion in current scholarly literature. According to Hudson et al. (2017), between 23% and 35% of veterans received pain treatment using opioids. There are various dangers associated with the prolonged use of opioids for pain treatment. In particular, opioid misuse can cause dependency, which is associated with significant problems in social and academic life, such as financial problems and alienation (Wilder et al., 2015). Any type of opioid administration is associated with a considerable risk of death from overdose. The central reason for overdose is decreased awareness about the contributing risk factors (Wilder et al., 2015). However, the problem of overdose is mostly discussed in terms of the general veteran population, and there is not enough information about the risk of opioid overdose among veteran students.\n\nAnother problem associated with opioid misuse is the danger of heroin initiation. Veterans and other patients treated for pain initiate heroin due to its increased availability from illegal sources (Banerjee et al., 2016). Heroin addiction is associated with an increased risk of death from different matters, including unknown purity, injection-associated infection, overdose, and vascular diseases (Banerjee et al., 2016). Additionally, heroin addiction can cause severe mental health conditions that further aggravate illicit drug abuse (Banerjee et al., 2016). Thus, opioid administration for pain treatment can cause severe complications that need to be prevented.\n\nProlonged opioid misuse can be associated with cognitive and socio-cognitive functioning problems. A study by Kroll et al. (2018) confirmed that opioid misuse negatively affects cognitive domains of attention, declarative memory, and global cognitive empathy. These effects were found to be dose-dependent (Kroll et al., 2018). Such cognitive changes may negatively affect the academic achievement of students.\n\nWhile opioid misuse among veterans is widely discussed by various researchers, there is a lack of studies discussing the effect of opioids on the academic achievement of veteran students. In particular, it is unclear if a history of pain treatment with opioids can lead to the decreased academic performance of veteran students. At the same time, severe pain in veteran students is a common condition acknowledged by current research. According to Boccieri et al. (2019), 22.2% of veteran students have severe pain, which implies that they are 4.3 times more likely to the condition in comparison with the general student population. Moreover, approximately 25% of veteran students reported that their ability to perform daily tasks was limited by pain (Boccieri et al., 2019). Thus, severe pain is a significant bother among veteran students.\n\nTheoretical Frameworks\n\nThere are several theories that explain the academic achievement of students that can be used to answer the research question in the present paper. First, self-determination theory can give significant insights into the matter. This theory focuses on how external factors affect a sense of volition and initiative to perform certain tasks. A recent study confirmed that the theory could predict the academic achievements of students and their dropout intentions (Jeno et al., 2018).\n\nAnother theory that can be used is the neurocognitive theory of intelligence proposed by Das, Naglieri, and Kirby (Georgiou et al., 2020). The theory is called the PASS intelligence theory, which stands for planning, attention, simultaneous, and successive processing (Georgiou et al., 2020). The theory was found to successfully explain the ability to gain knowledge and improve academic achievement (Georgiou et al., 2020). These two theories will be synthesized to answer the research question proposed in the present paper.\n\nSynthesis and Analysis\n\nVeteran students are a distinct population, as they have common characteristics distinguishing them from their civilian counterparts. Historically, veterans were believed to have higher academic achievements due to increased experience and maturity levels. However, recent research demonstrates that veteran students are disadvantaged due to a wide variety of internal and external factors that affect the academic achievement of veteran students. These factors include increased chances of depression, PTSD, pain, alienation, exposure to combat, and low self-efficacy. At the same time, there are some factors that can positively influence the academic achievement of veteran students, including participation in some co-curricular activities, oral feedback from instructors, general support of the instructors, and setting preferences.\n\nThe review of the literature revealed that factors affecting the academic achievement of veteran students are a topic widely discussed both currently and historically. At the same time, the problem of opioid misuse among veterans is a relatively recent subject that emerged during the past two decades. The problem of the opioid epidemic among veterans is crucial, as many veterans are treated for pain using opioids. Such treatment may cause addiction, overdose, heroin initiation, cognitive impairment, and the development of mental conditions.\n\nThe literature review revealed two considerable gaps in the current body of knowledge. On the one hand, there are no reliable studies that provide the proportion of veteran students that have a history of opioid treatment. Thus, it is difficult to estimate how dangerous the opioid epidemic is for veteran students. On the other hand, it is unclear if having a history of opioid misuse is a significant predictor of academic achievement of veteran students. In other words, the current body of knowledge cannot answer the question if current or past use of opioids for any purpose can influence the academic performance of veteran students. The analysis of literature can explain these phenomena by the fact that the problem of opioid misuse among veterans is only an emerging topic, which implies that many areas of uncertainty remain.\n\nThe analysis of literature can help to make hypotheses concerning two identified gaps. First, considering the fact that prolonged opioid misuse is associated with significant co-morbidities, including social and financial problems, the prevalence of opioid misuse among veteran students should be lower than that of the general veteran population. Thus, it can also be supposed that fewer veteran students have a history of opioid misuse of treating pain in comparison general veteran population. Second, considering the fact that approximately a quarter of students report that they have difficulty performing everyday tasks, they must be undergoing pain treatment.\n\nAs opioids are the second line of pain treatment, it can be assumed that 22.2% of veteran students that reported severe pain were treated with opioids. This implies that the problem of opioid misuse is a significant problem that needs to be addressed. Third, considering the fact that opioids may lead to cognitive impairment, opioid misuse may affect the academic achievements of students.\n\nThe analysis of literature has significant implications for future research. It is recommended that future studies focus on closing the gaps in knowledge identified in the present paper. In particular, it is crucial to estimate the prevalence of veteran students that have a history of opioid misuse. Moreover, it is crucial to confirm that the opioid epidemic is a significant bother for the veteran student population. Finally, it imperative to evaluate the effect of opioid misuse on the academic achievement of veteran students.\n\nMethods\n\nThe primary purpose of the study is to determine if opioid misuse has a significant impact on the academic achievement of veteran students. Recent studies demonstrate that opioid misuse may have an impact on the academic achievement of veteran students (Hudson et al., 2017). This study aims to determine the association between university performance and opioid misuse in veteran students. Additionally, it investigates how demographic differences, including age, gender, ethnicity, and income level moderate the effect of opioid misuse on academic performance. The hypothesis developed for the study anticipates that veteran students’ opioid misuse will have a significant impact on their grades. Descriptive statistics, multiple linear regression and t-test analysis will be used to test the hypothesis.\n\nSampling\n\nThe population under analysis is veteran students at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. A sample of randomly selected university students with experience in military service will be recruited at the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa. The inclusion criteria were the fact of being a student of the University of Hawai’i at Mānoa and a history of engagement in the military. The absence of opioid use history will not be an exclusion criterion. The sample for the current research includes students at different years of study from the first year to graduate masters and doctoral students. Thus, the present research will use simple random sampling as the sampling method. According to Mellinger and Hanson (2016), simple random sampling is free from sampling biases, as each person in the population has an equal chance of being selected.\n\nInstruments\n\nThe first primary construct will be the academic achievement of students will be operationalized as the current average GPA. It will be a continuous variable that will range between 0 and 5. GPA has been commonly used to measure academic achievement in all student populations, including veteran students, both currently and historically (Barry et al., 2014; Clark & Walker, 2020; Eakman et al., 2019). Academic achievement will be a dependent variable, as it is affected by a myriad of factors. It will be measured by asking “What is your cumulative grade point average?”\n\nAcademic achievement can be measured both qualitatively and quantitatively. The most frequently used measure for academic achievement in quantitative studies is the current GPA of students. In fact, even if the studies use other measures to quantify academic achievement (Bryan et al., 2014; Clark et al., 2020; Fonteyne et al., 2017; Novikova & Vorobyeva, 2017). However, there are other measures that were used in various studies to attend to the associated flaws of the measure. For instance, Bryan et al. (2014) used the concept of academic problems to assess students’ achievement.\n\nThe variable was measured by asking how frequently the students had late assignments, low grades, failed exams, and skipped classes. Even though this measure is applicable, the authors do not provide validation of the questionnaire assessing the variable. Fonteyne et al. (2017) also use a binary variable that demonstrates if the students passed the previous semester. However, the use of this measure is questionable when assessing the academic achievement of those students who have already graduated. In summary, even though there are other measures of academic achievement, GPA is the most consistent and validated method among the substitutes. However, supplementary measured for operationalizing academic achievement can be considered to improve the reliability of findings.\n\nThe second primary construct will be the opioid misuse, which will be measured using Current Opioid Misuse Measure (COMM). It is a commonly used instrument to measure opioid misuse in all populations. It is an instrument consisting of 17 items. Even though it is a self-reported questionnaire, it has been validated for screening purposes by numerous research (Butler et al., 2007; Butler et al., 2010). The instrument is recommended by both SAMHSA (2012) and CDC (2020).\n\nThe relationship between the two matters is expected to be moderated by demographic variables (Owens & Owens, 1949; Chan, 2018). The demographic variables will be measured by a self-made questionnaire that will include three questions:\n\n  * What is your age?\n  * What is your biological gender?\n  * What is your ethnicity?\n  * What is your income per household member?\n\nProcedures\n\nThe proposed research is a correlational quantitative study. The study will measure GPA of two groups: veteran students who had a history of opioid misuse and veteran students who did not have the history of opioid misuse. Thus, the study has cross-sectional design. The recruitment will be conducted using emails that were asked to participate in the study. The recruited individuals will sign informed consent forms to validate their agreement for participation.\n\nThe emails will give short background information on the study, including its purpose, variables, hypothesis, and expected outcomes. The emails will also emphasize the significance of the study and its possible implications for scholars and policymakers. The emails will instruct the participants on the procedures and the tasks they will be expected to complete. The survey will be carried out using Qualtrics Surveys software.\n\nData Analysis\n\nR software will be used to analyze the effect of (R Core Team, 2017). The data will be analyzed by means of descriptive statistics, t-tests, and multiple regression analyses to understand the influence of the independent variable on the academic achievement of student veterans. Answers to each question will be combined and visualized using appropriate tools. First, a two-sample t-test will be used to understand if there was a difference between the mean GPA scores of veteran students who use opioids for any purpose and those who do not use opioids. Second, multiples regression analysis will be used to understand how the control variables moderated the effect on GPA.\n\nThe selected methods allow understanding of the variety of interconnections between all the variables and test the influence of independent and control variables on the dependent variable (Mellinger & Hanson, 2016). The proposed data analysis process is relevant and consistent with the study goals.\n\nReferences\n\nBarry, A. E., Whiteman, S. D., & MacDermid Wadsworth, S. (2014).

      "Heart Disease: Population Affected- Brooklyn Presentation\n\nPopulation Affected- Brooklyn\n\nBrooklyn leads in morbidity of heart diseases in comparison to the rest of New York and the United States in general. Whereas the prevalence of heart disease is 43.3% in Brooklyn, it is 39.1% in New York, and 28% in the U.S.\n\nRecent data from also indicates that heart disease is the major cause of hospitalization and death in Brooklyn.\n\nIt is not clear why Brooklyn has a high prevalence rate of heart disease in comparison to New York and the entire country. However, one can attribute this disease to the usual risk factors embedded in an unhealthy lifestyle. Hence, the essence of evaluating if this project is viable to meet the formulated objectives.\n\nPopulations Affected:\n\n  * Whites;\n  * Blacks;\n  * Hispanics.\n\nHowever, the Blacks are mainly affected by hypertensive heart disease and congestive heart disease. Mortality due to heart disease and stroke occurs between the ages of 35 and 64 within this racial group.\n\nWhites are mainly affected by coronary heart disease and heart disease mainly takes a toll on them after 65 years.\n\nThe SUNY Downstate Medical Center (12) indicates that the Blacks have the highest burden of heart disease, followed by the Hispanics, and the Whites fall on third place.\n\n  * Despite the fact that heart disease affects individuals across the ages, it is deemed to be a major for individuals aged 65 years and above.\n  * Literature indicates that more women than men are affected by heart disease. However, the same may not hold true for Brooklyn.\n  * There is no literature that indicates than a certain gender is more predisposed than the other in Brooklyn; hence, one can only conclude that it affects both men and women in an equal proportion (The Brooklyn Hospital Center par. 1).\n  * Nonetheless, research is required to verify the statement above.\n\nEvaluation\n\nIdentification of Stakeholders\n\nThe key stakeholders that will be involved in the evaluation process are the school children where the food garden have been prepared. Also, the principal, assistant principal, the recruited teachers and staff members as well as a custodian engineer .\n\nThese individuals will help to review the program’s goals and objectives (University of Washington par. 1).\n\nDescription of Program Design\n\nIncreasing the knowledge of school children on healthy food choices aimed to reduce heart diseases.\n\nEnabling students to acquire the hands-on sills of planting vegetables as a means to facilitating self-independence as far as ownership of one’s health is concerned.\n\n  * Inputs: trainers, farm inputs.\n  * Outputs: Increased participation in school garden programs.\n  * Outcomes: Increased knowledge about different kinds of fruits and vegetables and their role in prevention of heart diseases.\n\nExplore Program Reality\n\nThe evaluation process will assess plausible performance measures against the actual outputs and outcomes. Also, prevailing gaps that prevent the program from achieving expected outcomes are identified and mitigation measures implemented (Newcomer, Hatry, and Wholey 93).\n\nCollect Evidence\n\nBoth qualitative and quantitative data will be collected to ensure that the program is valid and reliable. The data collected should be in alignment with the laid down objectives to affirm that the program seek to achieve the intended purpose.\n\nDraw Conclusions\n\nThe data generated and the review of program’s input and outputs help to determine if the program is progressing on as intended or there . If a deviation from the main cause is realized, relevant and feasible adjustments are made .\n\nEvaluation Focus and Intended Use\n\nThe evaluators will accurately determine the indicators to measure the performance of the program. In this case, the evaluators will review whether the program is viable enough and that the activities outlined will lead to achieving the intended outcomes.

      "Discussion of Coding of Qualitative Data Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Abstract\n 2. Coding\n 3. Analysis and Discussion\n 4. References\n\nAbstract\n\nCoding is the approach for correctly interpreting the information gathered through qualitative research to retrieve patterns and significant observations related to the study’s topic or hypothesis. The analysis of such data can be performed throughout such methodologies as discourse and conversation analysis, theory development, and content proceeding (Smith & Firth, 2011). Qualitative research is at risk of becoming less credible due to the biases, subjective analysis of the results, and significant scope of uncategorized data received from the participants (Roberts et al., 2019). The coding framework is the convenient strategy to make the study more rigorous as the process involves strict thematic separation, categories creation, and anonymized information allocation.\n\nCoding\n\nSelected posts include such themes to incorporate into the coding process as leadership experience in nursing, perception of continuing education, and reasons to pursue a DNP degree. Although the classmates’ posts also mention their personal information and backgrounds, they are not suitable for the framework and study as they cannot be compared or categorized. I selected the three themes because they are interconnected and allow a researcher to explore narrow topics to make valuable and credible conclusions. Smith and Firth (2011) claim that “the approach enables researchers to track decisions, which ensures links between the original data and findings are maintained and transparent” (p. 59). Coding will address questions of leadership in nursing (1), tendencies for the experienced professionals to continue education (2), and the need for a DNP degree in clinical practice (3).\n\nThe first classmate’s codes are: “night shift nursing supervisor at Veteran Hospital” (1), “have embraced the experience of leadership” (1). “Hoping to gain new insight into improving nursing practice” (2), “using my lifelong nursing skills and knowledge to engage and empower patients” (3). The second classmate’s codes: “various leadership experience” (1), “objective and benevolence in attribution to nursing transformation in the medical evolution” (2), “mobilize community is driving impetus for my motivation in the doctoral program” (3). The third post’s coding is: “Oncology Nurse Manager” (1), “second semester for DNP” (2,3). The fourth coding is: “the need to rise and do something instead of waiting for someone else to do it” (1), “three associate degrees, two bachelor’s degrees, and two Master’s degrees” (2). Furthermore, the classmate “relocated to pursue the Doctoral degree” (3). The last classmate’s coding: “career in CVICU” (1), “ continued my education and became an AGACNP-BC” (2), “it was natural for me to pursue a DNP degree.”\n\nAnalysis and Discussion\n\nThe introduction posts analyzed through the coding framework revealed that my classmates address the three themes selected for the hypothetical research. Indeed, they have leadership experience in nursing, perceive continuing education as essential for improving their practice and building careers, and consider pursuing the DNP degree as necessary for their clinical work. The coding data gathered in-vivo provides a deeper insight into the participants’ reasoning and makes research more transparent (Lochmiller, 2021).\n\nA framework is necessary to accumulate and segment broad records because it allows retrieving the results based on the particular patterns noticed around the themes (Hackett & Strickland, 2018). The experience of exercising such an approach of analyzing qualitative data helped me improve the skill of seeing patterns and dividing information into different topics. Besides, I learned to separate the private records from ones that can be utilized for studying and therefore address the ethical part of researching.\n\nReferences\n\nHackett, A., & Strickland, K.

      "Symbol of Weather in Flannery O’Connor’s A Good Man Is Hard to Find Essay\n\nOne of the most observable literary techniques in Flannery O’Connor’s short story “A Good Man is Hard to Find” is symbolism. In the plot, the author applies symbolism to add meaning to the narrative. Several symbols are evident throughout the story, and each stands out to represent specific themes or meanings in the storyline. For instance, the grandmother symbolizes negative traits of people; the tower is a symbol of danger, while the Misfit represents evil. Nevertheless, an in-depth analysis of symbolism shows that the weather is the most dominant symbol in the story, and every scene is described in a given type of weather. Arguably, O’Connor uses weather symbols in different scenarios to foreshadow the consequent occurrences in every scene.\n\nIn multiple times, the prevailing weather condition is something that appears throughout the story. After his identification, the Misfit discusses the sky, “there is no cloud in the sky. I do not see the sun, but I also don’t see clouds” (O’Connor 147). Also, when Misfit describes his first time in the penitentiary, he looks up and says that it is cloudless (O’Connor 150). Surprisingly, in both cases, the weather is not cloudy and not sunny but empty. An in-depth analysis would reveal that an empty sky symbolizes a bad omen or a bad sign. After the car accident, the family is trapped in the middle of nowhere, and the members are desperate (O’Connor 149). They do not have hope of finding help and returning home, just like the empty sky. Similarly, the empty sky can also symbolize the character and meaning of Misfit. For example, he claims to have forgotten the crimes he had committed and keeps everything he signs. He is a desperate man with no moods, feelings, and hope for life. He does not have a family and murders people without feeling guilty. He is also a thief who does not care what other people feel when he steals from them. After the Misfit discusses Jesus and Salvation, the ready would think that he has finally become a civilized man. But within a few minutes, he shoots the grandmother three times, which shows that he is a man without respect for human life. Arguably, the Misfit is an empty man with no life, and that is why he only sees empty skies above his head.\n\nThe weather can also symbolize the state of mind, as seen in various scenes in the storyline. For example, when Wesley and June realize that they have anything to do, they play a game by choosing a cloud and make the other two guess the shape each item suggests. Wesley’s cloud has the shape of a cow, which June makes a correct guess (O’Connor 36). John does not accept June’s correct guess and states it looks like a car, and they start fighting in front of their grandmother. Consequently, the cloud symbolizes the aura or state of mind that the two have, especially John Wesley’s unfairness in his mind.\n\nAt the start of the journey, the sky is not empty but full of clouds. In this case, the family is full of hope that they will complete the journey successfully. However, they appear to have blocked thoughts, blind minds, and misinterpreted meaning. For example, the two children have wrong or blinded perceptions of the meaning of cloud shapes in their game, which describes their empty states of mind (O’Connor 84). In the same way, the grandmother’s perceptions of the nature of goodness are wrong as she has blocked thoughts. The audience can see that the grandmother cannot see the reality because there are clouds in her mindset.\n\nIn conclusion, the symbol of weather is the dominant literal technique that O’Connor uses in the story. In every scene, the author uses the prevailing weather to predict the events likely to follow. Also, the weather symbolizes the characters’ states of mind, which mainly appear to be empty or compromised in most scenarios.\n\nWork Cited\n\nO’Connor, Flannery. A Good Man is Hard to Find .

      "Reaction to the Findings Ranson Coursework\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Synopsis\n 3. Evaluation of Ranson’s Ideas\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nRanson introduces his works by arguing that the arrival of a child in configures the relationships and interactions in families. The writer says that this is evident in all families that seem to be stable and committed to long-term relationships. In fact, the arrival of the child means the family has been established officially. In other words, the child signifies parenthood in the life of couples meaning that married life is not complete without children. The writer discusses extensively the life of parents and relationships in a family. The major challenge in a family setting is how to balance economic life with social relationships and interactions. This paper analyzes the findings of Ranson and goes on to evaluate his conclusions, in an attempt to situate them in the modern life. The paper specifically challenges his ideas on the role of family members. This essay will use two of his first chapters for analysis.\n\nSynopsis\n\nIn chapter one, the writer argues that the Second World War gave women a chance to empower themselves economically. Jobs were opened up for women, which encouraged them to challenge men in the labor market. The economic recession of1930s affected the social structure, whereby women rose up to the occasion to provide basic needs to their families (Ranson, 2010). The war consumed many resources forcing the government to withdraw support for social services, most of which were enjoyed by women. After joining the labor market, the author argues that women formed trade unions that advocated for their rights. The unions ensured that women were given fair treatment and their culture was respected. Education played a big role because women utilized their knowledge of the constitution to claim for their rights. The royal commission boosted the morale of women because it formulated some policies that gave women rights and freedoms to participate in economic and political development. Consequently, women were granted the right to maternity leave in 1971. The law was extended to include maternity leave for men in 1990 (Ranson, 2010). This law changed the parenting structure in the family because it provided that both men and women were in charge of child rearing.\n\nIn chapter two, the writer argues that women have more roles as compared to men because they are primary caregivers, what is referred to as intensive mothering in Northern America. In this case, the mother spends much of her earnings in upbringing of children. Women face major challenges because they are expected to deliver both at home and in places of work. Family members expect the mother to provide all basic needs or contribute in providing them while men are excused from some family roles such as childcare. This is what scholars refer to as cultural contradiction. At places of work, women are expected to deliver in the same way as men. The scholar argues that cultural contradictions force women to reframe their roles in order to survive. It is argued that the mother delegates her child caring duties to another person, who is identified in the text as men (Ranson, 2011). The major challenge that women encounter is balancing their relations with children after they delegate the role of care giving to their partners as they take executive responsibilities.\n\nEvaluation of Ranson’s Ideas\n\nThe writer documents some of the problems encountered by women in parenting and in places of work. From feminism theory, women have been forced to believe that they are inferior and they are under men in any societal organization, be it socio-cultural, economic or political. Gender disparity is one of the thorny issues that face the modern society. The issue was chosen because it has been an issue all through history. Women are present in all social organizations but are not recognized. This paper applies some theories in explaining the relationships between women and other members of society. Feminism theory considers some of the ways in which physical qualities are utilized by culture and social structure to portray that women are assigned inferior and degrading activities, for instance motherhood. Women face a big problem of being frequently secluded from public activities, as well as being demoted to the clandestine domain of the home. In society, women are trained from childhood to respect the desires and wishes of men on grounds that they are not fully developed morally. Such claims portray women as weak creatures who cannot make their own decisions. Women are attributed particular feminine traits and identity through socialization process. In fact, women live in a state of false consciousness.\n\nFeminism criticizes the position of women in society, which is traced to the writings of Mary Wollonstonecraft, Stuart Mill and Fredrick Angels (Mitchell, 2009). Subjection of women started with the rise of private property, which subordinated them to men. Women subjection is the product of overall exploitation and injustice that are found in capitalistic societies. In fact, radical feminist scholars view the oppression of women as inevitable in all male dominated societies. Political and economic power is concentrated in male hands. Actually, there is substantial social differentiation between the sexes in the family, which shows up in parenting. Functionalist scholars concur to the sentiments of their feminist counterparts by arguing that it is impossible to change gender roles rapidly in a family setting without revising the social structure. The scholars assert that if there is change in the social structure, social disorder will be inevitable. On the other hand, conflict theorists tend to differ with functionalist canvassers because no social structure is safe if it is maintained by oppressing a majority of its members.\n\nFrom the pre-industrial period, men were powerful because of their physical strength and freedom from childbearing duties, which allowed them to dominate women physically. Cultural beliefs support a social structure that puts men in dominant positions hence children are socialized to accept traditional gender roles as natural and just, all away from childhood. Men are likened to the bourgeoisie because they own and control most of society’s prestige and power. Conversely, women are like the proletariat who are the subjects, work under the directives of the bourgeoisie, exploited and their culture is never valued. Ranson challenges the stereotyping of women and suggests a gender balanced study of society in which women’s experiences and contributions are viable as those of men. In a study of positions of men and women in salaried work for instance, it is conclude that most workers are found in sex-segregated jobs. Such segregation is not natural but it is a societal creation. The society is structured to channel people into occupations based on gender and to reserve positions of authority to men. Public places are places of inequality in everyday life of women.\n\nReferences\n\nMitchell, B. (2009). Family Matters: An Introduction to Family Sociology in Canada .

      "Capstone Project Change Proposal Components Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the years, many cases of falls have been reported among patients in various healthcare facilities. Whenever these falls occur, they negatively impact the victims by overstaying in hospitals, reducing the life quality, and being costly (Toye et al., 2017). Many of these cases are often associated with a lack of education among the nurses despite having the noble duty to ensure the safety of the patients (Chu, 2017). As a result, healthcare professionals have continued to develop significant ways to reduce falling through interventions such as the education of nurses. According to The Joint Commission (2018), falls can be prevented in hospitals once nurses gain skills and knowledge on how to overcome them through education. The current project examines the lack of fall prevention education in nurses and proposes changes to help healthcare workers enhance their ability to minimize falls in their facilities.\n\nBackground\n\nThe quality of healthcare is comprised of clinical safety which is considered a crucial component that identifies and reduces the risks faced by patients. Montejano-Lozoya et al. (2020) defined falls as adverse events which occur in a hospital environment and have a significant impact of about 10% of income made by the organization. The effects come in terms of costs, damage, pain, and mistrust of the health system by patients. The environmental improvements can reduce the possibility of falling up to 30 to 50% (McCarty et al., 2018). However, the effects of risk of falls in hospitals remain unclear due to the low quality of evidence despite the interventions put in place. Therefore, the education of nurses has been employed as a single intervention or being treated as part of the multifactorial intervention process for fall prevention programs.\n\nClinical Problem Statement\n\nIn the most recent years, the authority at Community Regional Medical Center (CRMC) Fresno has been receiving numerous complaints from clients who experience falls within the facility. Most of the cases are experienced among patients with lacerations, fractures, and internal bleeding. Reports indicate that many nurses attending to the clients have limited information on how to prevent falling. The project’s focus is on the lack of education among nurses to identify risk factors and work toward preventing falls which requires change.\n\nThe Purpose of Change Proposal\n\nThe decision to propose the change within the facility is based on previous investigations and the current situation at the facility. Research by Heng et al. (2020) indicated that falls often occur when healthcare professionals are not keen on helping guide clients. This is often contributed by limited skills and knowledge to observe policy standards when handling patients. Whenever falls happen, they are likely to increase the complications of patients, especially those already with injuries and the older people exposed to the risk of falling (Kempegowda et al., 2018). The purpose of the proposed change is to improve the education of nurses when it comes to preventing falls. The measures include nurses’ empowerment to have them lead patient care and curricula strengthening to focus on the skills and concepts needed for one to participate in activities of preventing falls.\n\nPICOT Question\n\nDoes the provision of education to nurses on preventing falls in healthcare facilities help reduce the instances of falls among patients in Community Regional Medical Center (CRMC) Fresno? Shaw et al. (2020) identified education as a single intervention or it can be incorporated as part of the multifactorial interventions used in the programs aimed at reducing or preventing falls. Nurses’ education in fall prevention strategies should be comprehensive and versatile in order to cover the various aspects of the problem in question. The educational interventions must support policies and guidelines to create a safe environment and reduce risk factors. Additionally, the prevention strategies explained in the process of education should stimulate engagement in technical aspects to eliminate potential fall hazards. Finally, the last point of nurses’ education should elaborate on raising awareness among patients and communities on the risk factors and prevention measures of falling.\n\nLiterature Search Strategy\n\nThe change project proposal is based on the literature studies. Relevant articles were retrieved from various sources through search engines that included the GCU library, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Web of Science, and PubMed. The search of these articles involved words related to the topic of the project, such as fall prevention, nurses’ education, patient safety, nursing knowledge and skills, and nurses’ learning. The search only considered articles that have been published over the past five years.\n\nLiterature Evaluation\n\nKing et al. (2018) identified falls as a major safety concern when it comes to hospitalized patients considering the severe impacts it causes, such as reducing life quality, increasing the stay in hospitals, and being costly to patients. These researchers examined a multidisciplinary approach as a requirement for fall prevention and the need to create a safe environment for patients and reduce injuries. Aguwa (2019) argued in favor of nurses’ education in combination with other fall prevention programs as being crucial to preventing falls. The researchers concluded that those nurses involved in education received a verbal report on the risk of falling among patients.\n\nMontejano-Lozoya et al. (2020) found falls as common events, which majorly happen he older adults, which then result in negative outcomes for hospitals and the patients. The findings showed that the overall incidence of falls was 1.2% following the education of the nurses in charge of the patients. Park et al. (2019) examined adverse events as the cause of mortality and morbidity, considering that they lead to issues of clinical safety hence the need to avoid falls in health institutions. From this study, the fall prevention program was found to be particularly effective for patients in the experimental group as opposed to the control group. Leverenz and Lape (2018) examined how designing and implementing a multidimensional fall prevention educational program can help reduce the cases of injury in health facilities. The findings showed that the improvements in the self-efficacy for falls were statistically significant, especially among the nursing assistants.\n\nUtilization of Change or Nursing Theory\n\nThe change project proposal is concerned with preventing falls among patients, which requires that nurses get educated on skills of how to achieve the purpose. As a result, the suitable theory to apply would be Lewin’s change theory since it has successfully implemented the clinical changes in the past scenarios by a preceptor who highlighted the success stories with minimal shortcomings (Shirey, 2018). When applied in the clinical settings to advance change, Lewin’s change theory presents three steps which include freezing, moving, and refreezing. Other important phases include reasons and resource evaluation to apply changes, maintaining the change, and leadership stepping into the change agent role with designated responsibilities.\n\nImplementation Plan and Outcome Measures\n\nThe implementation begins with the evaluation of the needs, setting goals, and start preparing for the change to prevent falls. The education of nurses is attained by integrating organizational ongoing operation procedures. The strategy starts by defining the responsibilities and roles of nurses in preventing falls and the requirement to change to execute the best approaches (Clayton et al., 2020). The system needs to be monitored to track the changes and sustain the program through constant informing of senior managers on the progress of reducing falls. The expected outcomes are measured by nurses being able to identify and assess various fall risk factors and apply the acquired skills and knowledge to prevent falls.\n\nUse of Evidence-Based Practice in Intervention Plan\n\nEvidence-based practice is adopted in this change project to help evaluate the success of the implementation. This involves data delivery on fall risks in respect to areas and during the discharge of patients. The management should be able to obtain support and assist in improving the educational practices of nurses to prevent patient falls. The program is sustained through constant informing of senior managers on the progress of reducing falls.\n\nPlan for Evaluating Proposed Nursing Intervention\n\nThe first part of the evaluation would include risk assessments to identify the patients with the highest possibility of falling, as well as nurses’ skills at preventing these risks. For that, a variety of tools would be used, such as Marginal Analysis, SWOT Diagram, and different risk assessment scales. The effectiveness of the nursing intervention plan would be judged by the results of the assessments. Secondly, a post-fall evaluation would be applied to identify the outcomes of the nursing intervention and the role of education in reducing risk factors for falling.\n\nPotential Barriers to Implementation Plan\n\nThe barriers could be associated with limited time for nurses considering that they are already serving employees who should attend to patients and at the same time, undertake education. Some nurses who lack technical knowledge and skills may find it challenging to learn new aspects of how to handle patients. These barriers could be overcome by first introducing nurses to computer literacy before they are taught new ways to prevent falls. Similarly, training on how to prevent falls should be undertaken during weekends or during the nurses’ leaves or days off.\n\nReferences\n\nAguwa, H. (2019).

      "Including Nurses in SDLC Essay\n\nThe author of this post describes the case of implementing the new pumps in their hospital. Due to limited time and resources and, possibly, lack of planning, the hospital chose the pump model based on one isolated unit. Besides, the personnel did not receive appropriate training because of the COVID outbreak, which led to confusion and ineffective work among the staff when the new pumps were implemented.\n\nNurses receive detailed knowledge about working in the medical field at the universities and institutes. However, the new technology and particular procedures require additional training for the personnel to work efficiently since it is impossible to include every detail about all the potential procedures in the curriculum. According to Sezgin and Babaoglu (2019), discussion, training, and troubleshooting for potential difficulties make medical procedures safer and more effective. Although hospitals are nearly always pressed for time, including the nurses in the planning and implementation stages of SDLC may help avoid errors when working with patients, thus saving the resources.\n\nThe author of this post references a case of implementing the new CO2 level monitors into a clinic. It is necessary to replace the old equipment with the latest devices, as modern science continuously improves the methods and instruments used in medicine. However, in this case, the nurses were not included in the planning stage of the SDLC for the new monitors. The decision to limit participants to leaders, managers, and education specialists is ineffective because nurses are the ones working with CO2 monitors on a daily basis (Clark et al., 2018). They know what functions make the equipment user-friendly, so excluding them from the planning stage may lead to purchasing inconvenient machines which do not transfer the data correctly.\n\nReferences\n\nClark, C.

      "Narcissism: Jane Eyre’s Mr. Rochester Essay\n\nLiterature can be used as a case in point for examining the different behaviors of people and learning about the potential dangers of some psychological disorders. In Charlotte Bronte’s “Jane Eyre,” Mr. Rochester shows clinical signs of narcissism. He appears to care little for the feelings of others, manipulates people, and even ruins lives. This paper will explore the notion of narcissism and use examples from Bronte’s s novel to prove that Mr. Rochester is a narcissist.\n\nNarcissism is a personality disorder, which has to be treated by a professional since this condition predisposes individuals to affect the lives of others negatively. According to Campbell and Crist, narcissism “is about self-importance, antagonism, and a sense of entitlement” (10). Hence, narcissistic person is consistently focused on themselves, and they feel that others’ actions harm them. Moreover, narcissists usually use manipulation and deceit to receive what they want (Cambell and Crist 10). The lack of regard for others, entitlement, and a desire for special treatment are what result in narcissists harming others.\n\nThe common idea of a narcissist is that it is an individual who loves only themselves and who focuses on their appearance rather than good character traits. Although in some cases, this is true, clinical narcissism manifests in an individual’s lack of affection and compassion towards others. Campbell and Crist argue that there is a spectrum of narcissistic behaviors, ranging from harmful everyday actions to horrific events such as mass shootings (15). Moreover, Campbell and Crist note two types of narcissistic behavior, grandiose and vulnerable (16). Example of the first one is high self-esteem, arrogance, and grandiose behavior. The latter, however, are shy and depressed, which makes it difficult to recognize these individuals as narcissists (Campbell and Crist 16). Regardless of how narcissism manifests, the common feature that describes this condition is careless behavior towards others.\n\nAlthough this condition is serious, it is neither admirable nor deplorable. Cambell and Crist argue that narcissists are a result of improper parenting and traumatic experiences during childhood (25). Moreover, as a condition, narcissism cannot be cured, and instead, through psychotherapy, they can learn to control some of their behaviors that cause harm to others. Hence, narcissism can be viewed as a neutral condition, but one should be cautious about the impact that narcissistic behavior has on others.\n\nThroughout Bronte’s novel, Mr. Rochester shows many signs of vulnerable narcissism. During Jane’s first years at Thornfield, she saves Mr. Rochester from a fire. The latter says that this fire was a result of a servant’s recklessness, whose name is Grace Pool, but Pool continues to work at this mansion (Bronte 30). This points to the fact that Mr. Rochester did not disclose all the details regarding the estate and the inhabitants there. As Jane later finds out, the fire, and the second one that resulted in Thronfied being burned down and Mr. Rochester being injured, is a consequence of the latter’s wife’s unstable mental health. Considering that Jane came to work and live at Thornfield, not disclosing this detail about one of the mansion’s inhabitants was a selfish act that put Ms. Eyre in danger.\n\nBronte’s descriptions of Mr. Rochester’s character and behavior also hint at some narcissistic traits. For example, when Jane asserts her feelings for this man, she says that he “was proud, sardonic, harsh to inferiority of every description…He was moody, too…” (Bronte 67). Although Jane sees the excellent character traits of Mr. Rochester, she admits that he has many flaws, especially when considering his moral integrity. Throughout the novel, Mr. Rochester consistently behaves in a way that forces the reader to question the moral integrity of this character.\n\nMr. Rochester uses deceit to achieve his goals instead of being honest, which shows his entitlement and self-centeredness. During one of the interactions between Jane and Mr. Rochester, he makes Jane believe that he is engaged with another woman, Blanche Ingram (Bronte 90). In reality, he uses this information to provoke Jane and make her confess her feelings. When compared to psychologically healthy behavior, a man interested in a woman would confess his feelings directly to know if they are mutual. The use of manipulation instead of honesty is another characteristic of narcissism that Mr. Rochester shows.\n\nHis relationship with Janer is built on manipulation and counseling his true feelings. Although, in the end, the two get married, Mr. Rochester’s behavior towards Jane is questionable. Ultimately, in the novel, Mr. Rochester falls in love with Jane but cannot be honest with her. He tries to achieve his goal despite the impact that it might have on Jane’s life. Although he is married and his first wife is a captive at his mansion, Rochester asks Jane to marry him (Bronte 70). Considering the circumstances, their marriage would not be legal, and Jane would become Mr. Rochester’s mistress. The society during the Victorian era differed from today’s, and like a mistress, she would be excluded from social life. The sad circumstances of Mr. Rochester’s decisions can be seen when Jane decides to leave Thornfield and live and a street with no food (Bronte 70). Here, her superior moral qualities contrast greatly with those of Mr. Rochester, who remains at Thronfied with his first wife.\n\nMr. Rochester feels no compassion or empathy towards Bertha, his first wife. He describes her as a “filthy burden” since because they are married, he has to take care of her (Bronte 81). However, he keeps her locked in the mansion and hides her existence from everyone, including Jane. A more compassionate step would be to send Bertha to an asylum, where she would be cared for by professionals. However, Rochester chooses to avoid this step, perhaps because sending Bertha to asylum would mean that the general public becomes aware of her mental condition. Regardless of the reason, Mr. Rochester treats his first wife terribly and shows no remorse for his decisions regarding Bertha.\n\nMr. Rochester avoids direct discussions about his first wife and her mental health. While on the one hand, this subject is sensitive to him, and he does not want to address it even with people close to him, there are parts of the story that appear strange. For example, Mr. Rochester locked his first wife in his mansion, not allowing her to go out (Bronte 67). There is no definite explanation for this behavior and his unwillingness to discuss this situation. Mr. Rochester’s attitude towards Bertha is the best example of his narcissistic behavior since he cares more about concealing the truth about her illness than helping her live a quality life.\n\nOverall, this paper explores the narcissistic traits of Mr. Rochester using examples from the novel. The relationship between Jane and Mr. Rochester appears to be built on lies and the latter not telling the truth about his past. He does not care for his first wife, Bertha well-being, and chooses to hide her inside a mansion. Moreover, he uses deceit and manipulation to convince Jane to marry him, despite the impact that it would have on her social life.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBronte, Charlotte. Jane Eyre.

      "Electromagnetic Compatibility Testing and Its Design Coursework\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Coupling Mechanisms\n 3. Cause and effects of EMC\n 4. EMC Design\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis is a branch of electrical sciences involved with the studies of unintentional generation, propagation as well as reception of electromagnetic energy with a particular reference to electromagnetic Interference, EMI, (unwanted effects) that may come along with that kind of energy. EMC’s main goal is correct operation within a similar electromagnetic environment and avoid interference effects of the equipment that use electromagnetic phenomena. Thus EMC aims at pursuing emission and susceptibility or immunity issues, Eric S. R, and Radke C. J. (1991)\n\nCoupling Mechanisms\n\nThere are different types of coupling mechanisms that includes; conductive coupling, inductive coupling, capacitive coupling, magnetic coupling and radioactive coupling. Conductive coupling takes place when there is a direct contact between the source and the receptor e.g. by a wire, transmission line or a cable. Inductive coupling takes place when there is a short distance (less than a wavelength) between the source and the receiver. Magnetic coupling occurs when there is a varying magnetic field between two parallel conductors that are less than a wavelength apart thus causing a voltage across the receiving conductor.\n\nOn the other hand, capacitive coupling takes place when there is a varying electric field between two adjacent conductors less than a wavelength apart. Electromagnetic or radioactive coupling occurs when the source of noise and sink are more than a wavelength apart. The sink and the source act as radio antennae where the electromagnetic waves emanating from the source crosses the open space and is received by the sink, McFee, S and Giannacopoulos, D., (2001).\n\nCause and effects of EMC\n\nTo avoid the direct effect of EMC, it is a requirement to observe certain rules for example switch off electronic devises before taking a flight. In this instance it is required that the electronic systems, equipments and other electrical devises be in a position to operate in a defined margin of safety in their intended electromagnetic environment as well as at levels that do not cause unacceptable degradation due to electromagnetic interference. Devises such as radio transmitters, hand phones, motor drives devices and solid state switching devises cause electromagnetic pollution due to the emissions they give out to the environment. Susceptible electronic equipment will thus be affected by these emissions. It’s thus apparent that the EMC issues cannot be ignored, Martha M. Y., (1991).\n\nThere are thus three types of standards that have been provided so as to ensure that the equipments can work as closely as possible. These include; product family standards, generic standards and basic standards. The product family standards define the tests to be carried out, limits or levels, and performance criteria or operating conditions to apply. Whenever possible, the family product standards should refer to the Basic Standards for test. Generic standards relate to a particular environment e.g. commercial, domestic, light industry and Industrial environment. General information on disturbing phenomena, testing and measuring techniques is provided forth by the Basic standards. Although they do not contain performance criteria or limits, they serve as reference for product standards, Erren T.C., (2001).\n\nEMC Design\n\nElectromagnetic noise is usually produced from the source due to a rapid current as well voltage changes and spreads through the coupling mechanisms. Breaking a coupling path has been found to effective both at the start and at the end of a path. Thus most of the good EMC designs apply both to the potential victims as well as to the potential emitters. Since a circuit used to couple energy to the outside world will also couple energy back and thus be susceptible, a design improvement would reduce both the susceptibility and emissions. Some of the design measures taken include: Decoupled Cable Entries (Line filter, Signal filter) by use of RC elements or RF chokes; Shielded Lines; Shielded Housings; and the avoidance of Antenna Structures in PCB Design e.g. loops of unbalanced transmission lines or circulating current.\n\nThere are additional measures that can be taken to reduce the emissions. These includes avoiding unnecessary switching operations. The necessary switching should be carried out as slowly and technically as possible. It is recommended that noisy circuits that has a lot of switching activity be physically separated from the rest of the design. Use of harmonic wave filters should also be encouraged. In order to reduce susceptibility, use of fuses, circuit breakers and trip switches as well as transient absorbers should be encouraged, Tsuyoshi, N., et al. . (2007).\n\nConclusion\n\nEmission issues are concerned with the generation of unwanted electromagnetic energy, the counter measures to be taken to avoid such generation and how to avoid the remaining energy from escaping into the environment. Immunity or susceptibility issues refer to the correct operation in the presence of unplanned electromagnetic disturbances of the electrical equipment. Thus mitigation, noise or Interference and thus electromagnetic compatibility can be achieved by addressing both the susceptibility and emission issues. This implies silencing the sources of interference, having the path between source and victim being less efficient as well as having the potential victim systems to be less vulnerable.\n\nReferences\n\nEric S.

      "The Use of Quality Tools Coursework\n\nSome may think that quality is mainly a concept used in the working place. However, I believe quality tools can be equally effective and beneficial in all settings (workplace, health, family life, studies, dating, hobbies, and so on). The seven basic quality tools include the cause-and-effect diagram, check sheet, control charts, histogram, Pareto chart, scatter diagram, and stratification (“The 7 Basic Quality Tools for Process Improvement”). These tools are valuable in people’s professional life as they can help evaluate their or their teams’ performance, prioritize, identify various relationships, and so on. I will employ histograms to analyze the frequency of different values. This tool will be specifically applicable when analyzing some defects in my performance or the group I will be working in. The tool will help me identify particular factors affecting my (or the group’s) efficiency as I will be able to trace exact days or periods of poor performance.\n\nAs for my personal life, the use of these tools can be helpful. I have decided to talk to my friend about her unhealthy relationship with her partner. We have already had some conversations on the matter, but I believe the use of some statistics can be much more useful than the use of simple words. I will also use the histogram to reveal all the cases of his improper behavior and her improper reactions.\n\nI have already used the fishbone chart to brainstorm some causes of my problems. For example, I had difficulties with writing an academic paper. I was frustrated when I received the lowest score I had ever gotten. Luckily, I had a chance to revise the paper. I started by analyzing the reasons that led to the horrible and quite unexpected result. The use of the diagram proved to be effective as I identified the causes of the problem and managed to improve my score.\n\nJennifer Stepniowski claims that the mentioned quality tools have helped her in her personal life (“Using Quality Tools in Your Personal Life”). She uses a Pareto chart to prioritize her daily tasks. I have started doing the same. I have to admit that the chart makes the process of scheduling much easier and more effective. I can manage my time more effectively. Now, I can see that I have completed loads of meaningless tasks wasting my precious time.\n\nFinally, I will also use the check sheet and histogram to focus on my wellness. I have quite a hectic life, and my health has deteriorated, so I have to pay attention to my diet and physical activity. My responsibilities and numerous tasks I complete have always distracted me from noticing the wrong things I have done (eating snacks, skipping the gym, and so on). The tools mentioned above will help me trace all those irresponsible behaviors as well as factors affecting my decision-making process. I would like to add that some may think that the use of quality tools in an individual’s personal life is inefficient as it requires a certain time. However, I believe that the time spent on the statistics will be compensated as I will avoid numerous mistakes and will see various opportunities for improvement.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to note that the use of quality tools can help people achieve a lot in their professional and personal life. These easy-to-use tools help people see actual reasons for some flaws and even opportunities to improve the situation. I will benefit from using the basic quality tools.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“The 7 Basic Quality Tools for Process Improvement.” ASQ , 2005, Web.\n\n“Using Quality Tools in Your Personal Life.” ASQ , 2016, Web.\n",
      "Software Analysis: Normalization of the Current Database Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nIn this report, normalization is discussed as well as applied to the current database. The results of this normalization are also discussed. In addition, an analysis of the future software is done, which is mainly a database analysis procedure. This report concludes that the IT-Inventory application should be based on a normalized database such as the one that results after normalizing the current database. The report also concludes that the database analysis done on the future software is effective for analyzing the IT-Inventory application.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNormalization guarantees the future growth as well as expansion of a relational database. Normalization is a relational database design activity undertaken to eliminate three common anomalies associated with poor relational database design, namely, modification, insertion and deletion. The first anomaly results in erroneous data in the relational database due to lack of consistency in modification of the data. The second anomaly results in an inability to enter new and needed data into the relational database due to incorrect fields and faulty relationships among the database’s relations. The third anomaly results in unwanted loss of needed data through deletion due to poorly constructed relations.\n\nDiscussion\n\nNormalizing the current database to the third normal form (3NF) results in a total of nine tables in the database, namely, Machine, Machine description, Employee, Company branch, Department, Purchase order, Supplier, Employee & Department and Employee & Machine. Since they are normalized to 3NF, the tables do not exhibit repeating groups, functional dependencies and transitive dependencies (Mendes, n.d, 1).\n\nSystem ERD\n\nAn entity-relationship diagram (or ERD) shows the entities that make up a relational database, their attributes and the relationships between them (About.com).\n\nDiscussing the schema\n\nCompany branch\n\nThe Company branch table holds information on the company’s branches. The branch code field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field captures the unique identification assigned to a branch of the company. The secondary key in this table is the branch name.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Company branch code; this is the only candidate key since branch name is not guaranteed to be unique. There will be one branch name per branch code. This means that Branch Code functionally determines every other attribute in Company branch table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is the primary key as well; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. Branch name cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table since two company branches may have the same name; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is only one secondary key in the table, thus, transitive dependencies do not exist and thus the table meets the 3NF.\n\nDepartment\n\nThe Department table holds information on the company’s departments. The Department code field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field captures the unique identification assigned to a department in any of the company’s branches. The secondary key in this table is the Department name. The foreign key in this table is the Branch Code field that links it with the Company branch table.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Department code; this is the only candidate key since Department name is not guaranteed to be unique. There will be one department name per department code. This means that Department Code functionally determines every other attribute in the Department table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is the primary key as well; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. Department name cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table since two departments may have the same name; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is only one secondary key in the table, thus, transitive dependencies do not exist and thus the table meets the 3NF.\n\nEmployee\n\nThe Employee table holds information on the company’s employees. The Employee ID field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field captures the unique identification assigned to an employee. The secondary keys in this table are the employee name and user name. The foreign key in this table is the Department code field that links it with the Department table.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Employee ID; this is the only candidate key since Employee name and User name are not guaranteed to be unique. There will be one employee name and user name per employee ID. This means that Employee ID functionally determines every other attribute in the Employee table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is also the primary key; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. Employee name and User name cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table since two employees may have the same name; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is no transitive dependency between the secondary keys in the table, thus, table meets the 3NF.\n\nSupplier\n\nThe Supplier table holds information on the company’s suppliers. The Supplier ID field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field is introduced to capture the unique identification assigned to a supplier. The secondary key in this table is the Supplier name.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Supplier ID; this is the only candidate key since Supplier name is not guaranteed to be unique. There will be one supplier name per supplier ID. This means that Supplier ID functionally determines every other attribute in the Supplier table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is the primary key; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. Supplier name cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table since two suppliers may have the same name; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is only one secondary key in the table, thus, transitive dependencies do not exist and hence the table meets the 3NF.\n\nPurchase order\n\nThe Purchase order table holds information on the company’s purchase orders. The Purchase order number field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field captures the unique identification assigned to a purchase order. The secondary keys in this table are the Purchase order date and Delivery date. The foreign key in this table is the Supplier ID field that links it with the Supplier table.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Purchase order number; this is the only candidate key since Purchase order date and Delivery date are not guaranteed to be unique. There will be one purchase order date and delivery date per purchase order number. This means that Purchase order number functionally determines every other attribute in the Purchase order table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is the primary key; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. Purchase order date and Delivery date cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table since two employees may have the same name; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is no transitive dependency between the secondary keys in the table, thus, table meets the 3NF.\n\nMachine\n\nThe Machine table holds information on the machines bought by the company. The Machine label field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field captures the unique identification assigned to a machine. The foreign key in this table is the Purchase order number field that links it with the Purchase order table.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Machine label; this is the only candidate key since Purchase order date and Delivery date are not guaranteed to be unique. The Machine label field functionally determines every other attribute in this table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is the primary key; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. The secondary keys in the table cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is no transitive dependency between the secondary keys in the table, thus, table meets the 3NF.\n\nMachine description\n\nThe Machine description table holds information on the description provided for a machine bought by the company. The Machine description code field is the only candidate key and thus, it is also the primary key. This field captures the unique identification assigned to a machine description. The secondary key in this table is the Machine description. The foreign key in this table is the Machine label field that links it with the Machine table.\n\nIn the table, the primary key is Machine description code; this is the only candidate key since Machine description is not guaranteed to be unique. There will be one machine description per machine description code. This means that Machine description code functionally determines every other attribute in the Machine description table; therefore, there are no repeating groups and thus the first normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is a single simple candidate key, which is the primary key; therefore, no partial dependencies are possible. Machine description cannot be used to functionally determine any other attribute in the table since two departments may have the same description; and thus the second normal form is met (Mendes, n.d, 1). There is only one secondary key in the table, thus, transitive dependencies do not exist thus the table meets the 3NF.\n\nEmployee & Department and Employee & Machine\n\nThese two are junction tables that break up the many-to-many relationship that exists between the Employee and Department tables and the Employee and Machine tables respectively. Since they are junction tables, they only contain primary and foreign keys.\n\nUse Case analysis\n\nThe following is a use case analysis for the IT-Inventory application that reveals the requirements of the system as well as identifies the information necessary to define processes in the system. There are eight steps in the analysis, which are realization, description analysis classes, responsibility, associations, behaviour, describe attributes and mechanisms.\n\nRealization\n\nFor the IT-inventory application the main input data is:\n\n 1. Asset and asset description\n 2. Employee data\n 3. Company branch and department data\n 4. Purchases data\n 5. Supplier data\n\nThe main processes in the application are:\n\n 1. Tracking asset and asset description data\n 2. Tracking employee data\n 3. Tracking company branch and department data\n 4. Tracking purchases data\n 5. Tracking supplier data\n 6. Report generation\n 7. List/View generation\n\nThe main outputs of the application are:\n\n 1. Detailed reports on the assets purchased by the company\n 2. Summarized reports on the assets purchased by the company\n 3. List/views showing employee information\n\nFor the application the main actors are:\n\n 1. Company employees who are also the users of the system\n 2. Company’s senior management who are also users of the system\n 3. Suppliers who supply the company with assets\n\nDescription\n\nOne of the main processes of the system is report generation whose output is either a detailed or summarized report on the assets purchased by the company. For this process to be implemented successfully the application presents a user with menus and dialog boxes, which enable a user to view the report of his or her choice. Another main process in the application is list/view generation whose output is a view or list of specific data present in the database.\n\nTo generate views or lists a user is presented with a form from which he or she can enter the specifications of query. Queries are the main means of extracting data from the database. Lastly, the other main process in the application is tracking data pertaining to assets, employees, company branches and departments, purchases orders and suppliers. The process of tracking data constitutes three process addition, deletion and modification of data. To track data the application provides a user with forms from which he or she can add, view or modify the data of his or her choice.\n\nAnalysis Classes\n\nThe basis for the application is the relational database model in which data is stored in structure called a relation (Garcia-Molina et al, 2000, 15). The relational database model and the entities that make up the IT-Inventory application are the classes identified in this use case analysis. The relational database model is a toolkit that facilitates the development and implementation of relational databases. Creation of a relation in the relational database model is done such that it is representative of an entity that is fundamental in the creation of the database. The main entities that make up the IT-inventory application are Asset (Machine), Asset description (Machine description), Employee, Company branch, Department, Purchase order, and Supplier. For each of these entities a relation is created with the entity’s name.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe asset relation is created to hold information on the assets purchased by the company e.g. device name, type and description. The employee relation is created to hold information on the employees of the company. The Asset relation is created to hold information on the assets of the company. The company branch and department relations are created to hold information relating to the company branches and departments respectively. The Supplier relation is created to hold information on the suppliers of the company. The purchase order relation is created to hold information on the purchase orders placed by the company.\n\nAssociations\n\nThe association between relations in these application is defined by the entity relationship model. Thus, at any given moment the relationship between any two relations in the IT-Inventory application is either one-to-one, one-many or many-to-many. For example the relationship between employee and asset relations is many-to-many implying that one record in the employee table is related to many records in the asset table. This is so when you consider in real-life that one employee can be assigned multiple assets and multiple employees can share one asset. An example of a one-to-many association is the relationship between the supplier and purchase order relations where one record in the supplier relation is associated to many records in the purchase order relation.\n\nBehaviour\n\nThe IT-Inventory application is implemented using the Microsoft Access Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) and specifically. In this implementation, the relations listed above become RDBMS tables. Built-in within the RDBMS is a means for coordinating and managing these tables. Generally, the tables are the basic objects for holding data and allow for it to be accessed by other RDBMS objects such as queries.\n\nDescribe attributes\n\nAn entity-relationship diagram (or ERD) shows the entities that make up a relational database, their attributes and the relationships between them (About.com).\n\nMechanisms\n\nTo solve the problem it was created for, the main mechanisms in the IT-Inventory application are a relational database, RDBMS and programmed modules/macros. The relational database is the basis of the application and it requires to be normalized to the furthest extent possible. The RDBMS is means for implementing the design of the relational database. It is also the means for administrating the database once it has been implemented. Programmed modules or macros provide a means of automating processes within the application such as generation of views and reports at certain time intervals.\n\nUse case diagram\n\nFrom the use case diagram constructed for the IT-Inventory application it can be seen that: the company places an order for assets, with the order placed, an interested supplier goes through its contents. If the supplier is capable of servicing the order he or she confirms it and gives his or her quotation. The company goes through the quotation given by the interested supplier. If it is interested in it, it approves it and enters into a business transaction in which the supplier supplies the assets required by the company within the desired time duration.\n\nMeanwhile, an employee submits a request to use a given asset. The employee’s request is confirmed and assessed. This leads to either approval or disapproval of the employee’s request. When the request is approved the employee is assigned the particular asset he or she had requested for. Once the asset is assigned, the employee uses it accordingly. The company, if required, is responsible for the maintenance of the assets it assigns to the various employees.\n\nSoftware Analysis\n\nConsidering that, the IT-Inventory software is mainly a database application it is appropriate to analyze it using a database analysis procedure. The analysis procedure thus comprises of six steps, namely, database study, database design, implementation and loading, testing and evaluation, operation, and maintenance and evaluation.\n\nDatabase study\n\nFrom the use case analysis done above, the processes and requirements of the IT-Inventory application have been identified. This leads to the following statement of purpose that captures the functional requirements and scope of the IT-Inventory database “The IT-Inventory database tracks data on assets, employee data, company branches and departments, purchases, and suppliers. It can be used to modify information on existing assets as well as in the generation of reports and views”. A minor limitation of the IT-Inventory application is that its use requires prior knowledge of Microsoft Access, the RDBMS system through which it is implemented. However, to deal with this limitation the application provides a handful of menus and dialog boxes that make the application user friendly, thus the limitation is not a worry at all.\n\nDatabase design\n\nThe database design process of the IT-inventory application involves close collaboration with Mr. Husain Abu Asba, one of the support team members in the company. The design of the database involves the following steps, designing tables, data normalization, enforcing data integrity and documentation. In the designing tables step, a study of the current software in place at the company reveals fields required in the IT-Inventory database. From these fields relevant tables are derived. In the data normalization stage, the tables derived from the designing tables step undergo normalization.\n\nThe third step in the database design is enforcing data integrity. Normalization was the first step in ensuring the integrity of the data in the IT-Inventory database, however, in this step plans are laid out on how to enforce referential integrity in the database during the implementation stage. The final step in the design of the It-inventory database is documentation in which documentation of the design process was prepared.\n\nImplementation and loading\n\nIn this stage, the database design is implemented using the Microsoft Access RDBMS. Ms Access provides tools for both design and administration of the database. In addition to these, it is suitable for developing the IT-Inventory database for the reason that it contains an engine for compiling and running Visual Basic Code. Microsoft Access allows the enforcement of referential integrity, a feature that is critical in enhancing and maintaining high levels of data integrity in the database. Present in the RDMS are tools for creating other important database objects such as forms, queries and reports. Forms are particularly useful for navigating through the records of a table and in entry of new data. Queries extract information from the tables of the database. These are particularly useful in the creation of reports and views. Queries are a suitable basis for basing reports. Loading of data into the database is done with the aid of menus and dialog boxes present in the application. These menus and dialog boxes lead user’s to forms for entering data into the database.\n\nTesting and evaluation\n\nIn this stage, the robustness of the IT-Inventory application is determined through a series of tests. The results of these tests enlighten on whether there are potential failures that can occur during the operation of the IT-Inventory application. A schedule of tests is developed in which each test is allocated a certain maximum duration of time within which it is to be carried out. One of the tests that are appropriate for the IT-Inventory application determines if the inserting new record feature of the application is functioning properly. This test can be allocated a maximum time of one day. Another important test determines if the generating report feature of the application is functioning properly. This test can be allocated a maximum time of three days due to the reason that there are a number of reports that have to be generated. Another important test determines if the query feature for extracting information from the database is functioning properly. This test can be allocated a maximum time of one day.\n\nOperation\n\nThe operation of the IT-Inventory application needs to be closely monitored to some extent by the database administrator. The database administrator is a very important individual in the operation of the application as he or she possesses comprehensive knowledge on the design and implementation of the database. The monitoring is important because it establishes whether failures still occur in the system that was not identified during the testing and evaluation stage. If a failure occurs, the foremost step should be determining its severity and causes. After this step solutions to the failure should be developed. Operational failures in the IT-Inventory application can result from faults in the design of the database or from Ms Access, the RDBMS used in its implementation. An important aid in fixing failures arising from the design of the database is the design documentation prepared during the database design stage. If during the monitoring process no failures occur, the application can be assumed to be functioning properly.\n\nMaintenance and evolution\n\nMaintenance of the IT-Inventory application is the task of the database administrator. Evolution or future expansion of the database is also the responsibility of the database administrator. This is because the database administrator possesses structural, design and administrative knowledge of the database. Maintenance of the IT-Inventory application does not require any structural changes to the database, however, it may necessitate administrative changes. Evolution or future expansion of the database necessitates both structural and administrative changes.

      "IL-6: Predicting the Development of PTSD Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nTraumatic events may trigger immune alterations, and this could lead to the development of post- traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Therefore, it is important to understand and define the biological underpinnings of immune dysregulation in PTSD as it also plays a crucial role in helping us to understand the nature of the associations between PTSD and other medical and psychiatric illnesses. This is important, given that it is well established that PTSD is associated with the occurrence of co-morbid major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric illnesses.\n\nPeripheral pro-inflammatory cytokines are capable of signaling the brain to induce behavioral symptoms like fatigue, sleep disturbance, and depressive mood (Dantzer, 2001a: Dantzer, 2004a: Dantzer & Kelley, 2007: Myers, 2008). Cytokine-to-brain signaling provides a theoretical base consistent with the evidence demonstrating an association between proinflammatory cytokines and behavioral symptoms of depressive disorders (Dantzer, 2001b: Dantzer, 2004b: Dantzer & Kelley, 2007: Myers, 2008). The result of a hyperactive pro-inflammatory state marked by excess production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-6 may contribute to the pathophysiology of major depressive disorders (Sternberg, 2006).\n\nFrink et al. (2009) have postulated that cytokines released in response to infection or inflammation alert the brain to any real or potential threats and initiate behaviors that are thought to be important for survival. Some scholars even refer to the ability of the immune system to alert or communicate with the brain as a “sixth sense” (for example, Fu, Zunich, O’Connor, Kavelaars, Dantzer & Kelley, 2010). Sickness behavior is believed to be adaptive in that it forces an individual to rest and withdraw from activities so that physiological processes can produce healing in an effective manner (Gudmundsdottir, Beck, Coffey, Miller & Palyo, 2004: Quale & Schanke, 2010). It is now known that pro-inflammatory cytokines released during infection, inflammation, injury, and even psychological stress can signal the brain to initiate behavioral changes that facilitate adaptation to these threats.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, cytokine-to-brain signaling has been implicated in mood disorders, particularly depression that accompanies illness (Dantzer, 2009). As such, a sufficient regulation of cytokine production is crucial for better physical and psychological outcomes (Gill, Saligan, Woods, & Page, 2009). Accordingly, it would be prudent to undertake an investigation of the acute circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines and their predictive values with a view to providing insight into the role of psychoneuroimmunological processes in trauma patients. The purpose of this critical literature review is to examine the literature that describes the association between PTSD and predictive value of the pro-inflammatory marker interleukin 6 (IL-6). At the end of this paper, conclusions and recommendations are discussed along with areas where further research may contribute to a broader understanding of this phenomenon.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nA search of the databases (CINAHL, MEDLINE, and Pub Med) was used to locate articles relating to PTSD and the pro-inflammatory IL-6. The keywords used in searching the databases included PTSD, trauma, and IL-6 and depression. To further broaden the researcher, sources cited by the articles obtained were also tracked.\n\nReview and Critique of Selected Articles\n\nCytokines have substantial psychological and physiological effects that are vital in understanding the immune dysregulations linked to the development of PTSD. Rohleder, Joksimovic, Wolf, & Kirschbaum, (2004) conducted a study to compare the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and the glucocorticoid sensitivity of stimulated cytokine production among Bosnian war refugees. In the study, PTSD (n=12), age and gender matched German healthy control individuals (n=13). The researchers collected the samples on 2 consecutive days; saliva samples were collected at four different time points. Glucocorticoid (GC) sensitivity was measured by dexamethasone inhibition of lipopolysaccharide -induced IL-6 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha production measured in whole blood (Rohleder, Joksimovic, Wolf, & Kirschbaum, 2004)\n\nResults of this study revealed that PTSD patients showed an increased sensitivity to pro-inflammatory cytokine production, along with a higher cytokine producing capacity in peripheral blood. However, the study also identified a number of limitations that need to be considered with a lot of caution. To start with, the health control subjects were not comparable because they were German and not Bosnian war refugees. Therefore, this diversity in regards to ethnicity variations could affect the results. Another limitation of the study is that the use of ex-vivo stimulation may not replicate in vivo changes in the organism. As such, result are not generalizable.\n\nThis is in line with a classic study conducted by Maes et al. (1999) to examine the inflammatory response system in patients with PTSD, with or without major depressive disorders (MDD), through measurements of serum IL-6, soluble IL-6 receptor (sIL-6R), sgp130 (the IL-6 signal transducing protein), as well as other pro-inflammatory cytokines. The researchers recruited 45 individuals, PTSD patients (n=13) who were victims of two types of traumatic events (fire event and motor vehicle accidents events), and control healthy individuals (n=32) with negative history of psychiatric disorders.\n\nThis study was based on previous findings of elevated increased serum IL-1????and the presence of inflammatory response system activation, which is associated with increased serum IL-6 because both cytokines can induce the production of one another (Durum & Oppenheim, 1989). A major contribution of this study is the inclusion of male and female accident survivors with PTSD, with MMD, because MMD demonstrate high degree of co-morbidity with PTSD, and is also characterized by activation of the IRS with increased serum level of IL-6 (Maes et al., 1999).\n\nResults from this study revealed that Serum IL-6 and sIL-6R concentrations were significantly higher in PTSD patients in comparison with normal participants. Additionally, serum sIL-6R concentrations were significantly higher in PTSD patients with co-morbid MMD than in PTSD patients without MMD and normal participants. The researchers concluded that PTSD is associated with increased IL-6 signaling. They also hypothesized that stress-induced secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines (IL-6) is involved in the catecholaminergic pathophysiology of PTSD, which represents a positive relationship between indicators of IRS activation and HPA axis activity in PTSD.\n\nThese results are in agreement with those of naother study conducted by Baker et al. (2001), who found elevated cerebrospinal spinal IL-6 levels in PTSD patients with a past diagnosis of MDD. Although Baker et al. (2001) reported conflicting results of unchanged blood plasma IL-6 levels they also made an important revelation that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels of IL-6 were higher in PTSD patients compared with control subjects. Their study examined the relation of IL-6 levels and hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal and noradrenergic activity in PTSD patients. The finding from this study reveals that plasma IL-6 was not different between the two groups; however, PTSD patients have increased CSF concentrations of IL-6. They explained that the low cortisol secretion as a result of lowered glucocorticoid suppression of IL-6 secretion contributed to their findings. The researchers concluded that the higher levels of CSF IL-6 could be possibly a sign of neurological deterioration or compensatory protection (Baker et al., 2001),\n\nIn another prospective study, Pervanidou et al. (2007) investigated the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity, the sympathetic nervous system and inflammatory factors in children and adolescent following motor vehicle accidents related to later PTSD development. They concluded that high levels of IL-6 are associated with PTSD development in children and adolescents following a motor vehicle accident (Pervanidou et al., 2007).\n\nCollectively, these findings reveal that immune dysfunction is present in PTSD patients with MDD. Furthermore, a good number of studies confirm that increased IL-6 levels in PTSD civilians (Maes et al., 1999; Gill, Vythilingam, & Page, 2008), Bosnian refugees with PTSD (Rohelder et al., 2004), and in the cerebrospinal fluid of Vietnam combat veterans with PTSD (Baker et al. 2001). However IL-6 findings are inconsistent. These inconsistencies are related to the timing of blood sample collection. In particular, it is well established that IL-6 demonstrates a unique circadian rhythm (Vgontzas et al, 2005). Given this fact, it is thus clear that the discrepancies in the timing of the sampling may contribute to the inconsistencies of previous studies.\n\nConsequently, Gill, Luckenbaugh, Charney & Vythilingam (2010), conducted the first unique study by comparing serial overnight serum levels of IL-6 in a well-distinguished sample of PTSD participants (with and without MDD) and non-traumatized healthy control participants as well. This study attends to the identified methodological limitations of prior reports and will help to clarify the incoherent results. They also investigated serum IL-6, plasma ACTH and cortisol, along with their response to hydrocortisone. The researchers hypothesized that patients with PTSD with MDD will have higher serum IL-6 levels compared with those with PTSD without MDD and healthy control subjects. The research findings demonstrated sustained, basal, overnight elevations of serum IL-6 levels in patients with PTSD with co-morbid MDD but not in subjects with PTSD without co-morbid MDD.\n\nThe results are in line with the findings of a previous study by Gill, Vythilingam, & Page (2008), who compared hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and immune function in women with PTSD (n=26, with and without MMD) with traumatized controls (n =24) and non-traumatized healthy controls (n=21). Findings from this study revealed higher IL-6 levels in women with PTSD with MDD compared with PTSD without MDD. However, this study is limited by its cross sectional design in regards to the use of non-stimulated basal samples for cortisol and DHEA which hindered how these alterations resulted and how best to address them with an intervention. In addition, this study is not generalizable due to its limited sample size and the inclusion of only African Americans. On the contrary, this study is unique in the sense that it recruited African Americans only and the inclusion of healthy controls as well as traumatized controls without PTSD, which reflected a vigorous comparison. A final critique of the study is the limited two time points for saliva collection, which hindered understanding the biological differences that could have been detected better by serial time points.\n\nHowever, in Gill, Luckenbaugh, Charney & Vythilingam (2010) the overnight elevation led to a more comprehensive conclusion, in addition to helping clarify the inconsistent results obtained from previous single time point studies of IL-6 in PTSD (Maes et al., 1999; Gill, Vythilingam, & Page, 2008; Rohelder et al., 2004; Baker et al. 2001). These results confirm that increased IL-6 levels are only observed in patients with PTSD with MDD. The most interesting contribution of this study is that the researchers were able to differentiate between PTSD with and without co-morbid MDD by investigating overnight levels of IL-6 and their sensitivity to the glucocorticoid hydrocortisone. These distinctions are useful in clarifying the differences in symptoms presentation, treatment responses, and the medical co-morbidity, which are more pronounced in patients with PTSD with MDD.\n\nNevertheless, several critiques were identified in this study; a major critique is the limited sample size of both PTSD participants (n=18; with MDD n=9 and without MDD n=9) and healthy control individuals with negative previous trauma (n=14) that resulted in some discrepancies in the ACTH findings. Another limitation of the study is that the PTSD with MDD participants had more females than the PTSD with MDD participants; researchers should have attempted to reduce variability attributaed to gender as confounding factors. A final critique is that the study did not elucidate if IL-6 insensitivity to hydrocortisone in patients with PTSD and MDD could be resolved with an alteration in the dose or duration of hydrocortisone treatment. This study delineated an important distinction that should be investigated further.\n\nCortisol\n\nTraumatic events result in physiologic responses that stimulate the hypothamic pituitary adrenal axis and the sympathetic nervous system. These activations cause immune dysregulations. Hypothamic pituitary adrenal axis controls inflammation by releasing cortisol, which then reduces inflammation (Gill & Szanton, 2011). The immune system also interacts with the HPA axis in order to adjust its activities; for example interleukin-6 (IL-6) activates the HPA axis, resulting in higher cortisol levels, which decreases IL-6, thereby reducing or preventing further inflammation (Bauer, Wieck, Lopes, Teixeira, & Grassi-Oliveira, 2010).\n\nEmpirical evidence also indicates dysregulation of inflammatory activities by low levels of circulating cortisol could increase IL-6 levels. It is well established in psychoneuroimmunology that in normal healthy individuals, a bidirectional relationship exist between the immune and endocrine systems. This bidirectional communication can be interrupted by frequent and sustained stress states, leading to biological changes that likely underlie the risk for psychological and physical health declines. Prolonged activation of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis along with immune dysregulation and inflammation lead to undesirable consequences such as the development of physical and psychological disorders (Gill & Szanton, 2011). Traumatic events can interferes with this relationship, causing an alteration in both systems because of the chronic or acute stress it exerts on human bodies (Gill, Saliga, Woods, & Page, 2009).\n\nIn support of this assertion, as previously mentioned, Gill et al. (2008) found decreased levels of cortisol and increased levels ofIL-6 in PTSD patients. Together, these findings extend those of Gill et al. (2010), which further supported this relationship and investigated glucocorticoid sensitivity in PTSD patients. Their results revealed that PTSD patients were more sensitive and responsive as evidenced by an immense decrease in IL-6 levels; nevertheless PTSD patients with co-morbid MDD were less responsive. Hence, endocrine alteration will possibly contribute to increased levels of IL-6, for example increased cortisol levels in PTSD subjects without co-morbid MDD may decrease IL-6 production, while decreased or inadequate cortisol levels in PTSD subjects with co-morbid MDD may increase IL-6 production (Gill, Luckenbaugh, Charney & Vythilingam, 2010). In line with this, Fries, Hesse, Hellhammer and Hellhammer (2005) investigated Low cortisol levels in patients with PTSD and other psychological co-morbid disorders. They anticipated that the occurrence of lower levels of cortisol is a result of sustained hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activation. Further evidence suggested that low levels of circulating cortisol might lead to the development of PTSD in women due to the immune alteration as a result of sustained inflammation.\n\nIn summary, there is evidence suggesting that PTSD is associated with elevations of IL-6, which is more prevalent in co-morbid MDD patients. These studies suggest that chronic inflammation is likely present in PTSD and that additional studies are needed in larger samples to determine the role of IL-6 in PTSD-associated health declines.\n\nEpigenetic\n\nSegman et al. (2005) found that traumatic events may induce epigenetic modifications for genes that encode immuno-regulatory proteins in individuals with PTSD. Patients are known to have heightened stress reactivity, in addition to exhibiting a distinct expression profile for genes that influence immune function (Kerlinger & Lee, 2000: Li, 2002). Epigenetic modifications may possibly induce gene activity, and this could result in an increase in inflammatory cytokine levels (Dulac, 2010). Recent evidence reveal that for PTSD patients, the experience of a traumatic event triggers downstream alterations in immune function by decreasing methylation of immune-related genes (Uddin et al., 2010). The study by Uddin et al. (2010) identified a set of uniquely unmethylated genes that encode for immune function in individuals with PTSD. Their findings demonstrate the capacity of a traumatic event to trigger long-lasting epigenetic-induced alterations in immune function, possibly through brain-immune interactions, which could contribute to high levels of peripheral inflammation (Uddin et al, 2010). This study suggests that higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in PTSD patients are associated with gene function deregulations. In spite of this, the study is limited by its cross-sectional design, which prevents determining whether the PTSD methylation pattern was present prior to the traumatic exposure representing a pre-existing biologic vulnerability. However, the results reveal the possibility of a traumatic life event inducing long-lasting alterations in immune function through epigenetic modification.\n\nAlthough currently there is little evaluation of stress-related epigenetic modifications in humans, the findings in individuals with PTSD provides preliminary evidence suggesting that the experience of a traumatic event results in epigenetic imprinting of genes that encode for immune function (Uddin et al, 2010). In support of this study, Yehuda et al. (2009) reported that altered gene activity lead to increased levels of inflammation in PTSD patients. These preliminary evidences also suggest that the experience of a traumatic event results in epigenetic imprinting of genes that encode for immune function (Uddin et al, 2010). Collectively, these findings provide an impetus for further exploration in epigenetic and PNI paradigm that could lead to innovative interventions for PTSD patients.\n\nSummary\n\nIn conclusion, this critical literature review examined the association between PTSD and the value of the pro-inflammatory marker IL-6 as a potential biomarker for predicting the development of PTSD symptoms, as well as co-morbid MDD as a medical burden related to PTSD. Collectively, the studies mentioned in this review indicate that PTSD is associated with increased blood and plasma levels of IL-6. High levels of IL-6 following a trauma have also been linked to PTSD development. In addition, low cortisol levels are indicative of higher levels of IL-6, demonstrating inflammatory actions dysregulation.\n\nAs for the state of science, based on the literature review it is clear that the association between IL-6 and the development of PTSD is extremely multifaceted. It is doubtful that a simple blood assay will provide significant predictive biomarker for the development of PTSD. Since most of the findings from previous studies have not yet replicated consistently, rigorous studies are still needed in order for these comparisons to hold. This review links PTSD to depression and suggests that chronic inflammation underlies this association. However, it is still unclear whether immune dysregulation are fundamental or marginal to the development of PTSD. Nonetheless, it has been established that inadequate regulation of IL-6 production flowing traumatic events may increase the risk for developing PTSD. The implications of dysregulated immunity in PTSD are significant and remain to be an area of vigorous research that may eventually lead to the development of novel immune-related -interventions.\n\nNursing research has proved crucial in studies aimed at examining the effects of traumatic events on the person as a whole. It is emphasized that developing a better understanding of immune dysregulation and its impact to physical and psychological health in trauma patients, this will lead to the development of novel interventions. With the combination of both pharmacological and psychological interventions, nurses can provide greater benefits and better outcomes to the physical and psychological health of trauma patients in the hope of preventing the development of PTSD and other associated co-morbidities resulting from immune dysregulation (Gill, Saligan, Woods, & Page, 2009).\n\nExisting research reveal that sustained inflammatory alterations of the immune system are associated with inadequate regulation of the cortisol. However, results are inconsistent and further research is necessary in order to enhance the knowledge to better understand the mechanisms that will inform the development of future interventions. Further research is also needed to better understand intrinsic confounding variables of trauma patients and its role in immune alterations, which enhance the risk of PTSD development (Gill, Saligan, Woods, & Page, 2009).\n\nRecommendations and Future Research\n\nIn conclusion, most studies were not generalizable and there is insufficient evidence in literature to support a clear recommendation for the utilization of IL-6 as a potential biomarker for predicting the development of PTSD. Although these findings indicate that PTSD is associated with excessive inflammation, prospective studies are warranted to investigate the timing of immune dysregulation occurrence in patients experiencing traumatic events, and how the link between immune system and the endocrine system in regards to the development of PTSD and health outcomes.\n\nThere are many confounding factors that might account for the lack of inconsistent and significant results, hence larger vigorous cross-sectional studies of PTSD individuals that reduce variability attributable to confounding factors such as, types, timing, and duration of traumatic events experienced, as well as gender and other co-morbid psychiatric disorders.\n\nFurthermore, it is still unclear how immune dysregulation relate to the development PTSD. Future studies should investigate the effect of psychological and pharmacological interventions on the inflammatory processes in PTSD. These studies could investigate immune function before and after introducing pharmacological and psychological interventions, which will aid in understanding how immune dysregulation contribute to the development PTSD.\n\nIn addition, although there is little evaluation of stress-related epigenetic in regards to epigenetic, findings provide impetus for further exploration in epigenetic and PNI paradigm that could lead to innovative interventions for PTSD patients. Furthermore, it is fundamentally important to understand epigenetic modifications that could contribute to the excessive inflammation and higher levels of IL-6 observed in PTSD patients. These types of studies may provide a greater insight into the mechanisms of excessive inflammation in PTSD and possibly to the development of unique interventions to both prevent and treat PTSD.\n\nReference List\n\nBauer, M.

      "Students’ Performance and Nutrition: Is There a Relation? Proposal\n\nLiterature review\n\nVarious study literatures written on the nutritional statuses of students have revealed that college and university students embrace standards of living that either negatively or positively impact on their health and nutrition (Monneuse et al., 1997). A nutritional study conducted by Jaworowska and Bazylak (2007) showed that the diets of most university and college students are subjected to various factors. In fact, factors such as students’ knowledge on health and nutrition as well as their residential backgrounds might alter nutritional habits. Hence, these may impact on their academic achievements and performances. Baric et al. (2003) refuted this assertion in their longitudinal research study. Their research findings indicated that students’ knowledge as regards to health and nutrition hardly determines the desired eating patterns for the university students (Kolodinsky et al., 2007).\n\nHowever, Kremmyda et al. (2008) also insists that given that both college and university students practice personal eating habits, nutritional experts perceive this as a major health problem. Chen et al. (2007) supported this claim by asserting that bad nutritional habits are detrimental and may affect students’ performance and achievements. Besides Krinke (2002) affirmed that bad nutrition or poor food consumption patterns bear allied health and performance risks. According to Brevard and Ricketts (1996) assertions, changes in the students’ lifestyles significantly affect their nutrition and health patterns. These in turn impact on their academic performances and achievements. Farghaly et al. (2007) on the other hand conducted a cross sectional survey using college students who are in the boarding. The results revealed that the rate of consuming whole fatty foods in addition to heavy carbohydrates is minimal amongst the boarding college students (El-Ansari et al., 2007).\n\nResearch questions\n\nBasically, as a cross sectional study, the researcher will assess the effect of good nutrition on students performance or achievement in school. The study will be conducted in one university in the European Union and the study sample will consist of 100 university students. Students’ nutritional behaviours as well as factors which influence food consumption will be evaluated well devised research questionnaire.\n\nThe general research question will be “What is the effect of good nutrition on students’ performance or achievement in school? However, at the end of this study, answers to the following research sub-questions will have been obtained:\n\n  * What clearly determines the nutritional patterns of university students?\n  * Do good nutritional patterns affect students’ achievements and performances at school?\n  * Other than good nutrition, could students’ performances at the university be attributed to other factors other than just eating habits?\n\nResearch hypotheses\n\nThe researcher intends to test the subsequent research hypotheses:\n\n  * Ho: Good nutrition affects students’ performance or achievement in school\n  * H1: Good nutrition does not affect students’ performance or achievement in school\n\nThe null hypothesis will be accepted proviso it is correct and this will mean rejecting the alternative hypothesis. Nevertheless, the alternative hypothesis will be accepted if the null hypothesis is wrong.\n\nResearch Methods and techniques\n\nStudy Design\n\nQuantitative study will be carried out using the cross-sectional study design in order to determine the significance or importance of proper nutrition in the overall academic performance of students in school (Miere et al., 2007). The health belief (nutritional) model will be applied to guide this survey and more importantly to understand the way food intake influences the participants’ performances.\n\nThe study design (cross-sectional study) is selected because of its feasibility, efficiency as well as its being economical (Kolodinsky et al., 2007). Another advantage of this kind of study design is that the data gathered can easily be analyzed more quickly and it also provides the needed characteristics of the research population (Panagiotakos et al., 2007). Moreover, the conclusion drawn will be more reliable and valid since data from the study design is more accurate (Irazusta et al., 2006). Nevertheless, this technique only studies the sample from the entire population. Therefore the conclusion drawn will be more generalized. In other words, the conclusion drawn from the sampled data will represent that of the whole population (Young & Fors, 2001).\n\nParticipants and sampling\n\nIn this survey, all universities students are deemed eligible to participate in the research. However, the targeted sample population for the survey will be drawn from students at Flinders University. The total number of students or the sample size to be surveyed comprises of 100 students represented by each gender (Bas et al., 2005). These students will be chosen using convenience sampling method given that the researcher will be unable to survey every single study population member. This sampling method is chosen given its advantage of being relatively cheap compared to other sampling methods. The research questionnaire will be administered to the conveniently sampled population in order to help address the formulated research questions. As indicated, the proposed sample will comprise of 50 female participants between the age of 18 and 35 years, and 50 gentlemen aged between 18 and 40 years.\n\nBasically, given that the size of the study population is large, it might expensive and time consuming to examine each population element. Thus, convenience sampling method is selected because it helps in alleviating the prevailing time and cost constraints. Furthermore, convenience samples offer accurate correlations and rich qualitative data (Schweyer & Le-Corre, 1994). Despite the advantages of convenience sampling method, the associated disadvantages are that the method hardly produces representative results and the generated samples are very hard to replicate (Osler & Heitmann, 1996).\n\nData collection\n\nData for this study will largely be collected from primary sources (Roddam et al., 2005). The most important and relevant statistics will be gathered via self-administered study questionnaires. The assumption is that a comprehensive explorative instrument has been developed and satisfactorily tested prior to embarking on this actual research study (Von-Bothmer & Fridlund, 2005). Therefore, one hundred self-administered questionnaires that examine the effect of nutrition on the students’ performance will be used.\n\nThe questionnaire will take the students roughly between 16 and 20 minutes to complete. The questionnaires have been developed based on the contained elements and focus on the perceived benefits, barriers, susceptibility as well as the effectiveness of nutrition on students’ health and performances. The questionnaire also examines other factors that influence the nutritional habits of university students.\n\nEthical Consideration\n\nBefore conducting this research study, the requirements for the university social and behavioral research ethics committee were completed. In addition, all those students who will participate in this study will be provided with information concerning their freedom of participation based on the stated standards. The institution will also provide a letter of introduction specifying and explaining the study and the required standard methods.\n\nIn the letter, there will be secrecy assurance for the information provided according to the strict confidential requirements stipulated by the Quantitative Research Methods for Social Research coordinating team from the university. Moreover, information sheet describing the study and the way the participants will be required to behave will be provided. The participants will be made aware that they can withdraw their involvement at any time and without any consequence. However, strict measures will be put in place during and after the study so as to protect the respondents from any side effects (Bas et al., 2005). Finally, the information acquired from the study participants will be securely stored and protected whereas study finding reports will not divulge the participants’ identification (Kafatos et al., 2000).\n\nReferences\n\nBaric, CI, Satalic, Z, & Lukesic, Z 2003, “Nutritive value of meals, dietary habits and nutritive status in Croatian university students according to gender”, International J ournal of Food Science Nutrition , vol. 54 no. 6, pp.473-484.\n\nBas, M, Altan, T, Dincer, D, Aran, E, Kaya, HG & Yuksek, O 2005, “Determination of dietary habits as a risk factor of cardiovascular heart disease in Turkish adolescents”, Eur J Nutr , vol.44 no.3, pp.174-182.\n\nBrevard, PB & Ricketts, CD 1996, “Residence of college students affects dietary intake, physical activity, and serum lipid levels”, J Am Diet Assoc , vol.96 no.4, pp.35-38.\n\nChen, MY, James, K & Wang, EK 2007, “Comparison of health-promoting behavior between Taiwanese and American adolescents: a cross-sectional questionnaire survey”, Int J Nurs Stud, vol.44 no.5, pp. 59-69.\n\nEl-Ansari, W, Maxwell, AE, Mikolajczyk, RT, Stock, C, Naydenova, V & Kramer, A 2007, “Promoting public health: benefits and challenges of a European wide research consortium on student health”, Cent Eur J Public Health , vol.15 no.6, p.58-65.\n\nFarghaly, NF, Ghazali, BM, Al-Wabel, HM, Sadek, AA & Abbag, FI 2007, ”Life style and nutrition and their impact on health of Saudi school students in Abha, Southwestern region of Saudi Arabia”, Saudi Medical J ournal, vol. 28 no. 2, pp.415-421.\n\nIrazusta, A, Gil, S, Ruiz, F, Gondra, J, Jauregi, A, Irazusta, J & Gil, J 2006, “Exercise, physical fitness, and dietary habits of first-year female nursing students”, Biol Res Nurs , vol.7 no.2, pp. 175-186.\n\nJaworowska, A, & Bazylak, G 2007, “Residential factors affecting nutrient intake and nutritional status of female pharmacy students in Bydgoszcz”, Rocz Panstw Zakl Hig, vol.58 no.1, pp. 245-251.\n\nKafatos, A, Verhagen, H, Moschandreas, J, Apostolaki, I & Van-Westerop, JJ 2000, “Mediterranean diet of Crete: foods and nutrient content”, J Am Diet Assoc , vol.100 no.8, pp.1487-1493.\n\nKolodinsky, J, Harvey-Berino, JR, Berlin, L, Johnson, RK & Reynolds TW 2007, “Knowledge of current dietary guidelines and food choice by college students: better eaters have higher knowledge of dietary guidance”, Journal of American Diet Association , vol.107 no.12, pp.1409-1413.\n\nKremmyda, LS, Papadaki, A, Hondros, G, Kapsokefalou, M & Scott, JA 2008, “Differentiating between the effect of rapid dietary acculturation and the effect of living away from home for the first time, on the diets of Greek students studying in Glasgow”, Appetite, vol.50 no.2, pp.4 55-463\n\nKrinke, U 2002, Adult nutrition: in nutrition through the life cycle , Wadsworth/Thomson Learning, Belmont, CA.\n\nMiere, D, Filip, L, Indrei, LL, Soriano, JM, Molto, JC & Manes, J 2007, “Nutritional assessment of the students from two European university centers”, Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi, vol.111 no.6, pp.270-275.\n\nMonneuse, MO, Bellisle, F, & Koppert, G 1997, “Eating habits, food and health related attitudes and beliefs reported by French students”, Eur J Clin Nutr , vol.51 no.2, pp.46-53.\n\nOsler, M & Heitmann, BL 1996, “The validity of a short food frequency questionnaire and its ability to measure changes in food intake: a longitudinal study”, Int J Epidemiol , vol.25 no.4, pp. 1023-1029.\n\nPanagiotakos, D, Sitara, M, Pitsavos, C & Stefanadis, C 2007, “Estimating the 10-year risk of cardiovascular disease and its economic consequences, by the level of adherence to the Mediterranean diet: the ATTICA study”, J Med Food, vol.10 no.4, pp. 239-243.\n\nRoddam, AW, Spencer, E, Banks, E, Beral, V, Reeves, G, Appleby, P, Barnes, I, Whiteman, DC & Key, TJ 2005, “Reproducibility of a short semi-quantitative food group questionnaire and its performance in estimating nutrient intake compared with a 7-day diet diary in the Million Women Study”, Public Health Nutr , vol.8 no.1, pp. 201-213.\n\nSchweyer, FX & Le Corre, N 1994, “L’alimentation au quotidien chez les e’tudiants”, Pre’venir , vol.26 no.6, pp.87-92.\n\nVon Bothmer, MI & Fridlund, B 2005, “Gender differences in health habits and in motivation for a healthy lifestyle among Swedish university students”, Nurs Health Sci , vol.7 no.1, pp.107-118.\n\nYoung, EM & Fors, SW 2001, “Factors related to the eating habits of students in grades 9–12”, J Sch Health , vol.71 no.2, pp.483-488.\n",

References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe rates of crimes committed on a daily basis have triggered security agents to come up with methods of tracking and apprehending criminals. Specialists in matters of crimes have also sought to acquire more skills and knowledge to establish the truth about criminals after a crime has been committed. Profiling and analytical skills are important areas for crime investigators since they aid them in investigating the crimes committed every day. Profiling is also referred to as criminal investigative Analysis (CIA) (Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2012, Para. 1). Law enforcers use investigative tools to solve violent crimes committed by members of the community. Analysis in criminal investigation is the panacea of identifying criminals. The paper therefore presents the need for analysis in crime detection besides highlighting the various factors that may hinder effective analysis. However, it suffices to give a brief account of investigative profiling.\n\nHistory about Investigative Profiling\n\nInvestigative profiling came on the limelight in 1940s (Schlesinger 2009, p. 73). The quest to look for affable mechanisms of dealing with criminals began when law enforcers failed to arrest a person involved in a serial crime. Members of the law enforcement pondered on the best approaches that they could use to ensure that they were able to track the crime offender (Schlesinger 2009, p. 73). Since then, various approaches and tactics have been adopted with some being successful while others have failed. These law enforcers borrowed on psychological behaviours that the victims engaged in. The psychology of the criminal underscored many trails to find the best approach that would allow an amicable solution to be found. Currently, the police departments and intelligence security have advanced in their intelligence services. Some of the modern technologies used include DNA fingerprints, use of wiretapping, electronic surveillance, and forensic tests among many others (Burrell & Bull 2011, p. 6). Every crime is analysed differently because of the differences in the evidence and the behavioural or psychological aspects that came into perspective based on the crime. As such, analysis of crime detection became a crucial exercise for law enforcers.\n\nNeed for Analysis in Crime Detection\n\nIn the society, members commit various crimes, which are usually categorised on a different basis such as the nature of the crime, the amount of force that is applied, and the intentions of the crime amongst other parameters. The major types of crimes include robbery, robbery with violence, fraud, rape, and assault. A crime is an action intended to hurt, deprive, or injure someone. Analysis is important in cases where evidence of a crime that is committed can be gathered (Royal Canadian Mounted Police 2012, Para. 1). Many crimes that have trays of evidence are normally investigated through various crime detecting tools. Evidence can be pieced together from the evidence on the crime scene and or from witnesses that may have seen the crime being committed. Victims of the rime can also be used to give evidence on what really happened. Therefore, analysis is important because it allows security personnel to arrest the culprits. It is not easy to determine people behind a certain crime without carrying out an analysis to net those behind the offense. People appear to be the same. Therefore, it may not be possible to identify an individual who has committed a certain crime without having to engage an analysis (Xiaoyu, Miller, Smarick, Ribarsky & Chang 2008, p. 919) of the crime committed in a bid to get a valid evidence to enable easy tracking of the offender. Such crimes may be complex in apprehending the culprits. Therefore, analysis is the only path that can allow the culprit to be apprehended. To trap the criminals, there are various basic profiling requirements by the investigators. For instance, once a crime has been committed, the first step is the collection of crime scene information. This information is important in helping the investigators to kick-start their investigation. For example, in a crime where people are killed, the investigator will have to collect data at the scenes where the crimes happened. Photos will be taken besides factoring in samples of evidence at the scene (Schlesinger 2009, p. 75). This information is important in telling the motive behind the theft. After the information is gathered, the investigator ponders about the risk of both the offender and the victim. The victim’s risk is the amount of risk that he/she places on him/herself to qualify as a victim. High-risk victims usually place themselves in situations that are risky such as prostitution while a low risk victim engages in occupations and activities that do not lead them to be the target of the offender. There are different offenders who target different kinds of victims (Mainas 2012, p. 264). Therefore, understanding the level of risk that a victim exposes him/herself to is a strategy of gaining an insight on the unidentified offenders that may have committed a crime. An offender’s risk is the level of risk to which an offender exposes himself/herself. A high-risk offender will commit a crime in circumstances, which facilitate apprehension and vice versa. This information about the victims and offenders is vital in validating a crime. For instance, this information will help an investigator to relate the scenes of the crime and circumstances under which the crime happened to the strategies that will be employed to proceed to further investigation. Analysis also requires that the crime be assessed by reconstructing and pondering about the crime and the motivation of the offender. Crimes are committed with different agendas. Some are crimes are committed to revenge for certain things that somebody did to another. Others are done for personal gains such as stealing while others are committed because of disagreement among many other reasons. Analysis is therefore important because it allows investigators to base the investigation on likely facts. For instance, an individual may be opposed to certain ideologies of a group, for example, about a decision to buy assets. Supposing the person is killed. It is likely that the offenders are his/her close friends opposed to the ideologies of the person. Such crimes have been committed around the world (Mainas 2012, p. 266). Prominent people and politicians have been killed because of their ideologies and opinions about certain aspects of the society. Therefore, in such a case, the investigator will have to factor such issues such as the motivation of the offender, which may result to nesting the culprits who committed a crime. Criminal profiling is yet another important aspect in carrying out a crime detection process. There are various types of criminals. However, there are two broad categories of criminals: organised and unorganised criminals. Organised criminals are more or less professional in their criminal activities. They plan criminal activities professionally. They will find ways to conceal evidence that may lead to their arrest when they engage in criminal activities. On the other hand, unorganised criminals are not smart in their criminal organisation tactics. They may not contemplate how to commit a crime to avoid being captured by the police. Therefore, profiling helps the investigator to develop specific descriptions of the offenders. This information is used for searching the culprits (Shelton, Corey, Donaldson & Dennison 2011, p. 263). This part of analysis plays a vital role in ensuring that the culprit is traced. The police officers then store the information to track the whereabouts of the culprit. The profile is used for investigation purposes. For instance, in a robbery case, suspects will be profiled with their photos identified to help in search their whereabouts. Apprehension then takes place where the information will be cross checked with any new updates as investigations goes on to help to nest the culprits. This stage requires the profiler to review all the information but not that of listed suspects because they can unwittingly influence the outcome. All the information concerning forensic information, crime scenes, and autopsy reports should be reviewed. Thereafter, concentration shifts to profile the unidentified offenders in terms of psychology (Alison et al. 2010, p. 115). Analysis is also important in ensuring that the felons committing specific crimes are apprehended (Schlesinger 2009, p. 73) to avoid arresting other people who may not be involved in a criminal activity. Many reports postulate that many people face convictions and or are detained in prisons for not having committed a mistake but because of mistaken identity. The work of the analysis is to help reduce such instances. It is not right and constitutional for an individual to be subjected to trials or be associated with a criminal activity when he/she did not participate (Schlesinger 2009, p. 75). It influences the psychology of an individual negatively, a case that might cause negative or permanent impairment of the cognitive abilities of an individual. Therefore, analysis in detection is important in alleviating the ever-increasing rate of mistaken identity. Police officers may not be able to get sufficient information about the criminal if there is no analysis. In most cases, cases of mistaken identity arise due to the concept referred as modus operandi/signature. An offender uses this technique to carryout a criminal activity. This technique is likely to change over time. A criminal is able to change or advance in his/her criminal activities as he continues to acquire experience in the field. As a gangster advances his/her criminal skills, he/she acquires experience and perfection. Hence, such an individual will be able to escape the traps of the police officers (Shelton, Corey, Donaldson & Dennison 2011, p. 264). A good example is where a robber in the early years of joining robbery may not be acquainted with the tricks involved in a robbery. However, as time goes on with the robber gaining experience, it becomes hard for such a crime to be trapped because he already understands the weakness and strengths in the systems. Therefore, because the offender’s modus operandi keeps changing, it is not the right attribute to consider when linking an offender to a series of crimes. Understanding this case is helpful in the investigation of criminal activities. Therefore, the investigator may link a serial of crimes through the examination of the repetitive ritualistic behaviours of the offender as opposed to the criminal techniques that are employed by criminals. This technique can assist the investigators and the police to isolate the actual offender. Therefore, the analysis will help to reduce the number of people who are taken to prisons for another person’s mistake, or will help to avoid instances where an innocent person is attacked and killed by mob justice. Moreover, it will help to arrest the actual criminals besides protecting the alleged criminals who were involved in criminal activities and later turned away from such activities. Analysis is also needed depending on the nature of the crime that is committed by the criminals. For instance, offenses such as homicide and sexual assaults require that analysis be done to find out the offenders. Analysis of such crimes is enhanced because it involves a single incident. The crime might be serial involving one person. It will therefore require an analysis of the person to be caught (Beauregard 2010, p. 3). To ensure that this is achieved, the investigators are required to be people with high training in ensuring the success of the analysis. The investigators should have the personality profiles of the suspects with details of their behavioural analysis that is aimed at finding out information about the unknown defender. Therefore, “the victim and the offences committed are examined to help determine the characteristic traits of the offender” (Shelton, Corey, Donaldson & Dennison 2011, p. 264). This profiling helps an individual to be recognised as an offender. Based on this analysis, it can provide insights that can lead to the arrest of the culprit or help to suggest for further investigation that is able to find where the criminal has taken cover. Analysis is also required if a person is believed to have participated in criminal activities with no available evidence to accuse him/her. This is usually established under indirect personality assessment approach that is based on the individual’s personality. It is very helpful in determining if the suspected person really fits the kind of crime committed. The behaviours of the individual and his/her psychological measures will provide an insight as to whether the accused person committed the crime under scrutiny. Other considerations include being able to choose interview techniques that are appropriate to help in finding the criminals. The interview schedule should ensure that the member is free to provide detailed information about issues to do with crimes. Interviews provide an opportunity for the suspects to defend themselves. They are also important in gathering more information that can be used to launch further investigations to apprehend them. Furthermore, the need for analysis in crime detection arises out of the need to provide substantial evidence in the court of law during trials. The offender cannot claim to have committed a crime or pronounced as criminal unless proven guilty. Proving guiltiness of an individual does not come easily as the accused has to present tangible evidence to link the offender to the crime committed. Therefore, it is an avenue that the court bases its decisions. Therefore, analysis is appropriate to ensure that the accuser has a stable ground to argue the case. Analysis also enables investigators to find out the trends in the crimes committed and the motivation behind them. Having this basis or foundation information allows investigators to deal with subsequent criminal activities more professionally. It further serves to discourage commitment of crimes by gangs because they live with the fear that the long arm of the government will get hold of them. Furthermore, it also enables the investigators to come up with other new techniques and processes on how to deal with criminal activities in a bid to deter future criminal activities. Even though the analysis is important in crime detection, various issues may deter its effective use and application.\n\nConstraints that Hinder Effective Analysis\n\nThere are a number of issues that may hinder effective use of analysis in crime detection, which need to be put under investigation. One of the issues is inadequate training of the investigators on behavioural and general detection skills. Organised criminal groups commit some critical strategised crimes thus making it is difficult for the investigators to identify them. They plan in a professional manner sealing many loopholes that would assist the investigators to find them. Therefore, to deal with such organised criminals, investigators are required to have a high level of training on how to detect such people. Analysis of crime detection is a complex process that entails detail investigation and psychoanalysis of the motives that made the crimes occur. Therefore, if incompetent and less trained investigators analyse it, is deemed to fail. Therefore, criminal investigation analysts should be highly experienced with an extensive mastery of behavioural analysis. Further, they need to have been authenticated by “the international criminal investigative analysis fellowship to provide good analysis on the criminal behaviours” (Schlesinger 2009, p. 73). The coaching that the investigators need includes equivocal death analyses where they are trained on how to reconstruct the likely course and circumstances that contributed to crimes related to murder amongst other forms of training. Another issue that is likely to constrain analysis in crime detection is the lack of knowledge in profiling of crimes by the investigators. Profiling is an important aspect in ensuring that criminal groups are pursued and or detected. For instance, various categories of criminals employ different tactics in their criminal activities. For example, serial offenders may engage in repeated criminal activities without being identified if the investigators are not well equipped with knowledge on how to profile the crimes that are reported to them. Therefore, having enough skills, knowledge, and equipment will lead to successful achievements in crime detection. The investigators should have enough equipment such as technologies that can enable them scan the fingerprints and machines with the capability of testing the deoxyribonucleic acid DNA of the suspects to have enough information while tracking them. Poor sourcing of information from other sources may also constrain the success of the analysis. Some crimes are complex. They require the investigators to take enough time to piece these patches of information together to establish the truth. For instance, in cases where many vehicles and mobile gadgets are used in committing a crime, it requires the investigators to get the information from different sources such as communication agencies that provide a license to communication networks to identify who used a certain number at a particular time. Therefore, this imperative tactic requires the investigator to have commitments to go this far if at all positive results about the crimes are required. Furthermore, information must be sourced from other ‘intelligence facts’ such as forensic information to enable identification of the culprits. Complexities displayed by offenders at the crime scene are yet other factors that may impede its effective use. Gathering of evidence in most investigative scenarios is based on evidence that is collected at the scene. However, some have managed to come up with measures or strategies that they use to conceal any possibility of investigators in finding out their activities. Gangs involved in robbery and fraud provide an illustration of this case. For instance, they may use scanned fingerprints to enable them get into a building to commit their robberies. This therefore becomes difficult for the investigators to collect tangible evidence that can assist to track them (Burrell & Bull 2011, p. 5). The quality of data gathered may also impede the effectiveness of analysis in crime detection. In circumstances where reports are incomplete or inaccurate, recall and recount by the victims and witnesses and incomplete interviewing may contribute to the failure of achieve success in the analysis. For instance, when victims provide contradictory statements about the criminals and how they committed their crimes, it may be difficult for the investigator to find out whose information/statement is true. Therefore, this may impede the pace of apprehending criminals. Incomplete interviewing or poor skills in carrying out interviews with the victims and alleged crimes may hinder effective achievement of the objectives of an analysis to detect criminal activities. Interviews are central in finding more about what happened. They may assist investigators to carry out their investigations to catch up with the criminals within few days. However, if the interviewing personnel are not qualified and experienced enough to carry out an interview, it will be difficult to get the desired results by the investigators. Timescale is also one of the factors that may lead to ineffectiveness in the analysis of crimes detection. The period that the criminal investigative analysts need to gather evidence, especially where the offender is under custody and in need of quick evidence in the case, may hinder the effectiveness in analysis. This will lead to speedy investigations that may compromise various issues. Enough information and evidence may not be gathered hence compromising the quality of evidence that is required. On the other hand, investigations may take a very long period hence allowing the offenders to find time to escape rendering the process ineffective. Another issue that may impede effective analysis in crime detection is the nature of the crime that is committed. Investigations related to thefts and burglaries are difficult to investigate compared to crimes such as robbery, violence, and sexual offences because they may not involve human contact. Therefore, linking an individual’s behaviour to the crimes is difficult since the modus operandi, motives, and mannerisms cannot be linked to the crime committed. Therefore, in such crimes, it will require appropriate strategies to ensure that evidence is gathered to apprehend the victims. Gathering evidence that involves murder is not easy because the behavioural components of a person who committed the crimes cannot be assessed. Hence, it may be difficult to pursue the offenders (Burrell & Bull 2011, p. 3). However, there are mixed reactions concerning the nature of the offense that is committed. For instance, even though some people contend that robbery does not exhibit behaviours of the offender, it is somehow easy to be analyse it based on the speech. Furthermore, the injured party can provide evidence based on the weapons used in a bid to apprehend the victims (Vallano & Compo 2011, p. 961). Linking across the offence types is also an issue that may impede the effective of analysis of crime detection. It is difficult to link different offences committed by a single offender. For example, when a criminal commits sexual offences besides engaging in violent robbery, piecing together this information is a problem because it requires the investigators to identify a series of patterns from within the offense groups using an offender-centered approach in finding more about the aspect of violent offences. This may therefore be hectic thus attracting compromise on the successful completion of the investigation. Another impediment of effective analysis is the issue related to caveat. Minimising false positives where offences are inaccurately identified and false negatives where offences committed by the same offenders are not well linked is a challenge in the analysis of crime detection. It may jeopardise the process (Elntib 2010, p. 185). Analyst should be aware of these problems. They should always endeavour in taking steps to ensure that accuracy in the investigations is upheld. Therefore, investigators should keep an open mind and avoid assumptions about people, places, and circumstances. Objectivity should always be upheld to ensure that there is no biasness in the investigation as this may hinder realisation of the objectives. Therefore, the investigators should develop their hypotheses and test them to ensure that accuracy is achieved. Interpretations of false negatives should be done cautiously. For instance, peer reviews from colleagues can help to ensure that information that is gathered is objective and accurate. This will help to avoid cases where people are accused of committing a crime, which they did not commit.\n\nConclusion\n\nTherefore, based on the expositions made in the paper, it suffices to declare the issue of analysis of crime detection crucial and one that requires high-class strategies in a bid to unravel the truth about any criminal offense. Even though profiling and analysis have the potential of ensuring that criminal activities are pursued and perpetrators apprehended, it is also important that the challenges or the loopholes that are likely to be used are sealed. Data collection and rerecording are very essential aspects in profiling that the investigators need to invest in to ensure that they are able to pursue criminals. This information should be captured clearly and accurately in the crime reports. Interviewing process should also be done in a professional way to enable thorough investigations of the crimes. Investigators should also be highly trained on how to carryout out investigations in different situations and circumstances. Various specific bodies that provide intelligence services should also verify them. Furthermore, robust data coding systems for behaviours such as modus operandi can boost the accuracy of linking various crimes that are committed by similar offenders. Ample time is also required for intensive investigation with clear communication being adhered to ensure that enough data is gathered. However, more research is required in the areas of profiling and crime detection to deal with the sophistication that organised groups employ to commit crimes. Therefore, it is the duty of the investigators to always be committed besides adhering to high standards of professionalism to successfully carry out their investigative work.\n\nReferences\n\nAlison, L et al. 2010, ‘Pragmatic solutions to offender profiling and behavioural Investigative advice’, Legal & Criminological Psychology, vol. 15 no. 1, pp. 115-132.\n\nBeauregard, E 2010, ‘Rape and sexual assault in investigative psychology: the contribution of sex offenders’ research to offender profiling’, Journal of Investigative Psychology & Offender Profiling, vol. 7 no. 1, pp. 1-13.\n\nBurrell, A & Bull, R 2011, ‘A preliminary examination of crime analysts’ views and experiences of comparative case analysis’, International Journal of Police Science & Management, vol. 13 no. 1, pp. 2-15.\n\nElntib, S 2010, ‘Investigative psychology: offender profiling and the analysis of criminal action’, Journal of Investigative Psychology & Offender Profiling, vol. 7 no. 2, pp. 185-188.\n\nMainas, E 2012, ‘The analysis of criminal and terrorist organisations as social network structures: a quasi-experimental study’, International Journal of Police Science & Management, vol. 14 no. 3, pp. 264-282.\n\nRoyal Canadian Mounted Police, 2012, Criminal Investigative Analysis.

      "Myth: The Aging Population Is to Blame for Uncontrollable Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nWhat is the position taken in the Mythbuster?\n\nThe aging population in Canada is increasing at a very high rate, following retirement of the baby-boom generation. As a result, there is allegedly excessive strain on healthcare as the older adults require medication than younger people. This necessitates increase in taxes or cut in services to the public. However, while aging population in the society may be considered a health care concern, Mythbusters (2011) suggests that factors that increase the costs of health care such as technological innovation cost should be given the primary consideration as they are more consequential.\n\nWhy is this important issue?\n\nThe issue of aging of the population is very critical, especially because it becomes worrisome when the health expenses increase and policymakers left with a dilemma on what to focus on in addressing the situation. They keep wondering whether the aging population per se is the real cause of the trouble, but it becomes important to consider the concrete cost drivers while charting out corrective policies. After all, experts’ evidence shows that the aging population’s contribution to the steadily increasing expenditure on health care is very minimal. It is therefore critical to understand the main cause of the health care expenditure increase rather than attributing it to aging population without much certainty or information. Furthermore, good understanding of the real factors that drives the cost of healthcare provision is very important when controlling the healthcare budget (Mythbusters, 2011).\n\nDo you agree or disagree?\n\nI strongly agree with the issues set out in this observation, mainly, the fact that the cost drivers require our foremost attention. Despite the disagreement in regard to the exact factor that requires greater attention, the cost driver that results from technology and prescription of drugs is a major factor that has increased healthcare expenditure for several years. Many experts have actually cited out new medical technology and drugs prescription expenditure as an overriding contributor to the swelling of overall health expenditure, notwithstanding the recent phenomenal decline in expenditure on drugs prescription. In addition, information technology (IT) is the other influential technological cost driver that has had dramatic impact on health spending. Increased use of electronic medical records (EMR) has been allocated hefty budget with the intention of improving efficiency of healthcare service delivery. This has actually been a central agenda in many health reform plans (Mythbusters, 2011).\n\nMy opinion is fundamentally supported by the analyst’s declaration that application of state-of-the-art; expensive technological services as well as new drugs stimulate health care expenditure. This observation is made with due acknowledgment that the industry must recoup the development costs of such products and for the reason that they stimulate consumer demand for stronger and expensive services regardless of their cost-effectiveness. Having this in mind, I would envision that any national health reform efforts should have the aforementioned costs as the central element of consideration (Mythbusters, 2011).\n\nFurthermore, sustainability of healthcare shows that utilization surges have a strong relationship to the medical and technological developments. In conclusion, as the population of the aged surges, it has been observed that the health care cost increases in tandem but when analyzing this more carefully, it is found that the impact of aged population is rather minimal. I contend that the policy debates must continue having healthcare costs at the forefront-as the policymakers chart out the way forward with the mission of enacting comprehensive healthcare reforms.\n\nReference\n\nMythbusters.

Normal diastolic blood pressure in arteries ranges between 60 and 80 mmHg while systolic pressure ranges between 90 and 120 mmHg. During hypertension, the diastolic blood pressure in arteries increases and ranges from 80 to 100 mmHg while systolic blood pressure increases to ranges from 120 to 160 mmHg. Hypertension is a fatal heart disorder that does not only affect the heart and circulatory system, but also the functions of other organs like liver, kidney, and the brain, thus affecting general health condition of a patient. Epidemiological studies in the United States of America show that there is a significant racial and ethnical difference in the prevalence of hypertension among Americans. The studies show that Mexican-Americans are the second largest ethnical minority in the United States with high prevalence of hypertension as compared to other racial or ethnic groups. Salcido argues that, “two decisive factors make Mexican- Americans high-risk candidates for hypertension; their low socioeconomic status and the barriers erected against them by the health care system” (1979, p.373). Hence, their social and economic lifestyles together with inaccessible health care services predispose Mexican-Americans to hypertension. In order to understand the extent of prevalence of hypertension among Mexican-Americans, this essay explores the causes, treatment, cultural beliefs, health care barriers, cultural pattern of communication, and design culturally sensitive treatment plan.\n\nCauses\n\nCurrent studies indicate that the leading cause of hypertension is lifestyles such as poor diet and lack of physical exercise. Poor diet among Mexican-Americans due to social and economic factors has predisposed them to hypertension because “the researchers concluded that they had demonstrated a difference between Mexican-Americans and whites in occupational level, education, and family income” (Salcido, 1979, p.375). Therefore, Mexican Americans are prone to hypertension for they cannot afford healthy diets because of their low economic status as ethnical minority in the United States. Moreover, low educational level coupled with cultural beliefs make Mexican Americans to live lifestyles that predispose them to hypertension such as smoking, lack of exercise, alcoholism, and unhealthy diet. Unhealthy diet results into lack of important vitamins and minerals that are essential in regulating the homeostasis mechanism of the body resulting into hypertension. Studies have established that deficiency in potassium and vitamin D will result in hypertension particularly in an individual with poor health lifestyle.\n\nObesity and diabetes are also responsible for the development of hypertension. Obesity increases cholesterol levels in blood and constricts blood vessels and thus resisting smooth circulation of blood in the body. Research studies conducted on Mexican-Americans relative to other racial groups show that Mexican-Americans are more obese due to their unique lifestyles. Salcido reports that although cardiovascular conditions among Mexican Americans are comparatively similar to those of the whites, “like other low socioeconomic groups, they had a higher prevalence of obesity than persons of higher socioeconomic status, which may constitute a predisposing condition for hypertension” (1979, p.375). Hence, the prevalence of obesity among Mexican-Americans reflects the prevalence of hypertension in the community. Insulin deficiency results into poor regulation of sugar level in blood and subsequent osmotic potential of the body, which contributes to the occurrence of hypertension in the body. Hence, hypertension can arise due to complication of obesity and diabetes.\n\nHormonal imbalances in the endocrine system can cause hypertension. Adrenal hormones such as cortisol are responsible for regulating osmotic potential of blood and the functioning of the heart. Thus, diseases such as Cushing’s syndrome that causes overproduction of cortisol hormone increases osmotic potential of the blood vessels and increases pumping stress of the heart and eventually leads to hypertension. Eamranond and Patel argue that, “hormonal disorders such as hypothyroidism and Cushing’s syndrome significantly contribute to the hypertension among the elderly” (2007, p.671). Prevalence of hypertension in the older Mexican-Americans can be due to weak hormonal balance by their endocrine system. Endocrine system plays a significant role in homeostasis mechanism, which is very important in regulation of osmotic and ionic content of blood. Therefore, hormonal imbalance affects osmotic and ionic regulation of blood and predisposes one to hypertension.\n\nGenetic factors also predispose one to hypertension and that explains existence of racial and ethnical disparities of the disorder. Pickering argues that epidemiological studies regarding hypertension show that, “there are huge differences in its prevalence among ethnic or cultural groups, as hypertension was more than 50% more common in many West European countries than in the United States or Canada, despite a presumably common gene pool” (2004, p.281). Therefore, prevalence of hypertension among Mexican-Americans can be due to genetic factors that dominate the gene pool of the ethnical minority relative to other racial and ethnical groups in the United States.\n\nTreatment\n\nSince hypertension is a heart disorder that results from changing lifestyles such as unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, it follows that proper nutrition and exercise will help in preventing the disorder. Medical experts advise hypertension patients to adhere strictly to healthful lifestyles by ensuring that they eat nutritiously and exercise well for their circulatory system and heart to remain healthy. Unhealthy diet and low social economic status are factors that are responsible for the hypertension among Mexican-Americans. Therefore, to help in preventing occurrence of hypertension in the community of Mexican-Americans, change in eating and exercising lifestyles is critical. Eamranond and Patel argue that, “lifestyle of Mexican-Americans that increases the prevalence of obesity and diabetes is the cause of hypertension” (2007, p.671). To improve health status of Mexican-Americans, change in eating and exercising lifestyles is very crucial in preventing obesity and diabetes, which in turn leads to prevention of hypertension.\n\nMedical experts recommend on the increased consumption of potassium, magnesium, calcium, and vitamin D for they are very important elements in regulation of osmotic pressure in the blood. They also recommend on reduction of sodium intake because it increases osmotic pressure of the blood and thus hypertension. Among Mexican-Americans, obesity and diabetes are two major health disorders that predispose them to hypertension. Proper treatment and prevention of hypertension requires concomitant treatment of diabetes and obesity. According to Vijayaraghavan and Stoddard, “Mexican Americans comprehensive hypertension prevention and control efforts should also address obesity prevention and treatment. Additional efforts should involve reducing dietary salt consumption, a major risk factor” (2010, p.171). Thus, prevention and treatment of diabetes and obesity provides a milestone in controlling hypertension among Mexican-Americans.\n\nChange in lifestyle provides a basis of using medication to prevent and control hypertension among patients. Medications cannot be effective if patients continue with unhealthy lifestyles such as eating unhealthy diet and failing to do physical exercises as well. Taking antihypertensive drugs is only effective when patients adhere to healthy lifestyles that help in preventing obesity and diabetes. “Efforts to improve blood pressure control should focus not only on increasing access to treatment and preventing hypertension but also on educating patient and health care providers to intensify treatment regimens for high blood pressure among adults with diabetes” (Vijayaraghavan & Stoddard, 2010, p.172). Hence, creating awareness on the nature of the disorder, treatment, and prevention of hypertension among Mexican Americans is going to help in controlling occurrence of hypertension in the population.\n\nCultural Beliefs\n\nMexican-Americans strongly believe in folk medicine practiced by natural healers popularly known as curanderos and santeros who give comprehensive treatment of all diseases. The folk system of healing consists of both medical and spiritual aspects of healing. Curanderos use herbal extracts when curing diseases while santeros invoke divine healing powers. Mexican-Americans believe that health is a gift from God and thus good or bad health depends on the relationship of a person with God. Galarraga argues that, “Mexican-Americans commonly perceive health as a gift from God regardless of whether they take part in the folk system of healing for health can be a reward for good behavior, and illness can sometimes be a punishment for wrongdoing” (2007, p.4). Hence, for the case of hypertension, they also view it as a punishment from God. To them, people suffering from a condition such as hypertension must have done something wrong against God and therefore deserve punishment. Although such beliefs are against medical perception of illness, Mexican-Americans believe strongly that their folk system of healing is very effecting in curing all diseases.\n\nAccording to Mexican-Americans, substances that cause disease fall into two categories, ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ substances. The imbalance between ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ substances is responsible for the illness and thus folk healers need to balance the two. Galarraga asserts that, “an imbalance between hot and cold is considered a source of illness, with hot and cold not strictly referring to temperature but referring to the cultural classification of a particular substance or illness” (2007, p.5). Folk healers give guidelines to the people on how to balance ‘cold’ and ‘hot’ substances and failure to comply with the guidelines results into illness for example hypertension. ‘Pasmo’ is paralysis of the body due to failure to comply with the guidelines of balancing ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ experiences of life.\n\nMexican Americans also believe that illness can result from supernatural evil forces such as ‘mal de ojo’, which originate from envy. According to them, evil envy can befall anyone due to success in life or good health. For instance, a person can suffer from hypertension due to envy from other people or supernatural evil forces. “A supernatural cause of illness that comes from outside the body is “mal de ojo” and is caused by excessive admiration” (Galarraga, 2007, p.7). Hence, envy and evil forces are responsible for the illness that affects Mexican-Americans.\n\nSince Mexican Americans believe that, their folk system of healing provides comprehensive physical and spiritually healing, they anchor onto it even in the contemporary society of technology. Curanderos employ herbal extract in treating diverse diseases like hypertension that they perceive as a heart condition while santeros use divine powers in praying for the sick and casting out evil spirits that are source of illness. Galarraga explains that, “treatments by curanderos and santeros include massages, herbs, counseling based on their spiritual capacities and cleanings that are performed as baths with a particular mix of plants. Santeros may also prescribe herbs, ointments, lighting of candles for saints and incense” (2007, p.8). For the case of hypertension, folk healing system treats both physical and spiritual aspect of the disease by use of herbs and spiritual powers respectively.\n\nHealth Care Barriers\n\nSince Mexican-Americans are one of the ethnical minorities in the United States, social and economic marginalization causes them to stick to their cultural beliefs despite the fact that the mainstream society is advancing in modern medicine.\n\n“Mexican-Americans fall far short of the white population in both income and health status because investigation of the Los Angeles health system showed the morbidity and mortality rates among Mexican-Americans to be two to three times higher than in the white population” (Salcido, 1979, p.372). Analysis of the economic and social status of the Mexican-Americans shows that the white majority has marginalized and sidelined them in terms of economic, political, and social spheres of life. The mainstream society has neglected Mexican-Americans leaving them to continue in their traditional ways of life since they have not adapted modern culture.\n\nHistorically, Mexican-Americans were a minority ethnical group that experienced racial discrimination during the colonial period and Mexican-Americans have since experienced racial discrimination causing them to ‘shy’ away from the modern civilization and advancement in technology. Salcido argues that, “stereotypes of Mexican-Americans provide an excuse for the health care system to ignore Mexican-American health care needs … because they prefer their traditional folk culture practices, such as use of curanderos and brujas and herbal remedies, to modern medical practice” (1979, p.374). Thus, stereotyping Mexican-Americans has created a barrier that prevents them from seeking medical attention concerning hypertension and hence they resort to folk system of healing that involves the use of herbs and divine powers.\n\nEducation is another barrier that prevents Mexican-Americans from accessing health care services equally as other races and ethnic groups. The mainstream society has neglected Mexican-Americans in terms of education and thus majority does not speak English language that is essential in communicating effectively. Research done to ask Mexican Americans why they do not go for the health care services revealed that language differences, dehumanizing experience of seeking health care services and difficulties in associating with the medical professional are the main barriers. This shows that educational system has not done much in ensuring that Mexican-Americans speak English as national language. “Language barriers may be an important cause of lack of awareness and under diagnosis of hypertension among Mexican Americans and this would imply that educating Mexican Americans through Spanish television, radio, and/or publications may possibly improve awareness and understanding of hypertension” (Eamranond & Patel, 2007, p. 703). Improving educational standards for Mexican-Americans to speak English and creating more awareness about modern medicine would significantly enhance their perception of the society and health matters. Moreover, preventive measures and treatment of hypertension requires some educational knowledge to demystify traditional beliefs and superstitions about causes and treatment of the disorder.\n\nCultural Communication and Treatment plan\n\nMexican Americans portray their emotions quietly in public, as they are very secretive and are very shy in that, they cannot maintain direct eye contact because they consider it disrespectful. Moreover, they are very expressive in terms of gestures as they consider that effective communication should entail use of culture. In Mexican-Americans, touching is a normal act of association between same sexes for it has no negative connotation as in the case of other racial ethnical groups in the United States. In terms of thought patterns, they are literal and direct in their arguments or explanation. They strongly believe in their family lineage, traditional healing system, and family values that keep them together as community. Mexican-Americans are also culturally sensitive to gender issues as female and male normally are distinct members of the society. Galarraga argues that, “the oldest man in the household holds the greatest power publicly and will often be in charge of making healthcare decisions and women are expected to adhere to the man’s opinion as a form of respect in the public sector” (2007, p.12). Thus, communication in the family follows hierarchy in the family structure of Mexican Americans.\n\nCulturally sensitive treatment plan should incorporate communication patterns and cultural beliefs of Mexican-Americans in order to enhance treatment of the hypertensive disorder. For instance, treatment of a young man suffering from hypertension requires the medical professionals to understand the communication patterns of the patient and cultural beliefs regarding treatment to enhance diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Since Mexican-Americans highly respect family protocol in the issues of health, the use of elders to convince the young man to accept modern medicine is paramount as a plan to incorporate modern medicine into their cultural set up. Moreover, medical professionals should talk friendly, use gestures, and probe quietly to increase compliance of the patient. The elders should have their opinion concerning treatment of hypertension so that they can give confidence to the patient and family members to accept modern medicine.\n\nIn addition, incorporation of therapeutic modalities and modification of traditional treatment will enhance cultural sensitivity to the treatment of hypertension. Medical professionals should adopt cultural names of referring herbalists and spiritual healers and use them in professional settings. For example since Mexican-Americans refer to herbalists as curanderos, adoption of the name to refer to the physicians can significantly change perception of the young man because he will perceive that he is going to see a modern curanderos. Likewise referring to psychotherapist as santeros would help in changing perception of modern medicine from traditional point of view. Thus, incorporation of cultural names into modern medicine can significantly encourage Mexican-Americans to seek treatment of hypertension and comply with the most neglected conditions of treatment due to negative attitudes or traditional beliefs.\n\nConclusion\n\nHypertension is a heart disorder due to increased blood pressure in the arteries. Unhealthy eating habits, lack of exercise, and hormonal imbalances are the major causes of the disorder. Prevention and treatment of the disease entails practicing healthy lifestyles and use of antihypertensive drugs. The prevalence of hypertension disorder is very high among Mexican-Americans because they deeply believe in the folk system of healing that is ineffective in treating the disorder. Moreover, since Mexican-Americans are one of the ethnical minorities in the United States, they do endure racial discrimination and marginalization by the mainstream races and ethnic groups that dominate the United States. Low social and economic statuses are the major causes of hypertension since Mexican-Americans are unprivileged and cannot access proper nutrition and healthcare services because they are very expensive. Moreover, marginalization has created language barrier that prevents Mexican-Americans from interacting effectively with the mainstream society, hence they shy away from seeking medical services from the available healthcare systems.\n\nReferences\n\nGalarraga, J.

      "Reduced Flow of Stream Water Report (Assessment)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Problem outline\n 2. Procedure used\n 3. Methods of solving the problem\n 4. Fields of science consulted\n 5. References\n\nProblem outline\n\nThe stream water levels reduce during summer mainly due to the climatic changes that have taken toll in the environment. Pernetta (1994) states that, the global warming is affecting most climates and resulting to droughts that occur frequently. The observation made is that some droughts, which have been occurring since the early 1970’s, are to blame for the declining ground water levels. These have led to problems with water shortage with some area experiencing major problems.\n\nThe scum observed in the stream can be because of two things as will be shown. One of them is that maybe the introduction of chemicals from factories has polluted the stream leading to the scum formation. Zhen-Gang (2008) found that, the second reason could be due to the free-floating algae in the stream that thrive during the warm temperatures of summer and the ideal sunlight. The algae will flourish almost to the surface of the stream and this may appear like scum that is easy to notice.\n\nApproximately one week later, a reddish film formed towards the surface of the stream and it affected a large area. Sheath and Cole (1990) have shown that, as bloom of the algae continues the water may appear to develop a reddish film. This is mainly because the algae have reached the required population where some may begin to collapse. As they die, the cells settle to the bottom of the stream and release organic nitrogen and phosphorous and the former appears reddish in the water. The water from this stream turns toxic to animals and the Green pond solutions have explained this situation, which points out that the algae, competes for oxygen with the organisms beneath them such as the fish (Zhen-Gang, 2008).\n\nThis is harmful and may lead to death of the fish in the stream. The algae in this case as explained by Sheath and Cole (1990), is the species of algae that is toxic to animals than it is to human beings, wildlife and even the livestock that may drink water from the pond.\n\nProcedure used\n\nThe main procedure that helped to explain the problem is through the thorough reading of scientific material to draw the knowledge behind some of the occurrences in the stream. The information originated from articles that point out similar occurrences in the water stream and hence derived the relationships.\n\nThe second procedure was to visit streams around the area and interview people about the various changes that they may observe in the water streams when summer occurs. The various observations made from the different people is collected and the conclusions begin to be drawn relating to the problem at hand. Most of the people gave valid information that is useful and reliable with no bias.\n\nThe other most important procedure was that, after establishing a water stream that exhibited most of the signs as those in our problem after summer, samples collected from the stream were for laboratory use for further investigation to produce the findings that the problem is based upon.\n\nThe procedure to establish various ways of tackling this problem was the next to be undertaken and part of the solution was found with some environmental scientists who offered to provide some of their mechanisms to be used in the water stream as a way of assisting the study of this problem. This solved the problem of the dying fish in the water stream considerably and there were no chances of experiencing the same problem later.\n\nMethods of solving the problem\n\nThe only way to control the water levels of the water stream is simply by countering effects the global warming brings. It is advisable to plant trees near the water stream to prevent excess evaporation of the water during summer and to serve as rain attractors.\n\nThe control of free-floating algae can be through the establishment of a shadow such as the one that the trees in the water stream forms. Other methods apply such as the use of pond algaecides in extreme cases though control is necessary to ensure that there in minimal pollution in the water. Using advanced technologies, a sterilizer that uses ultra-violet rays help to eliminate the algae.\n\nAccording to News-USA, Inc (2011), the death of organisms in the water stream, especially the fish that the overlying scum causes living filters in the water stream can help to reduce it. The system aims at treating the water in the case of chemical pollution by increasing the microbial activities beneath the water. The introduction of a particular moss helps to do this, which creates the favorable conditions for the organisms to carry out the microbial activities and continue living.\n\nFields of science consulted\n\nThe various fields consulted were the aquatic science that explained the death of the fish, agricultural science that showed the various ways that the planting of trees might be effective in solving the problem and the field of biology that explained the microbial activities and their relation to life continuity.\n\nReferences\n\nA History Lesson for the World, Artificial Wetlands for Wastewater Treatment (AWTS), News-USA, Inc, Web.\n\nPernetta, J., 1994.

      "Log Book for Internship With Merrill Lynch Bank Report (Assessment)\n\nWeek One\n\nDay and date  Description of activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nMonday        Being my first day at Merrill Lynch bank in Dubai, I was introduced to the people I was to spend most of my time with (co-workers). In addition, I also got a tour around the office and work environment so that I could familiarize myself with the settings.    \n02/08/2010    After settling in, I was tasked with the duty of reading various financial news and articles from selected sources and search for at least 10 Chinese industrial stocks. Thereafter, I was expected to discuss my findings with the advisors.                      \nTuesday       On this day, I was expected to prepare a table showcasing the 10 Chinese stocks. In addition to this, I was supposed to give detailed explanations as to why I chose those stocks. I was to print relative graphs for each stock and discuss them with the advisor.\n03/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWednesday     Activities covered in the course of this day included reading about technical analysis, Printing portfolio pages and distributing them to the financial advisors for revisions.                                                                                    \n04/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThursday      Introduced to series 7 exams. I read through the first module which discussed the various factors relating to equities. I later had to discuss the technical analysis with advisors and I got a chance to attend a conference call.                                \n05/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nFriday        Reading module 2 of series 7 exams which covered all aspects relating to corporate debt securities. In addition, I had an opportunity to discuss module 1 (equities) with the advisor as proof of understanding the concepts covered by the topic.                 \n06/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n\n\nNew knowledge or skill learned on the internship this week\n\nBeing an intern in the wealth management department of the Merrill Lynch bank, I had a chance to experience a real work situation. The financial sector is very challenging and it requires joint efforts by members in order to tackle these challenges. I was able to learn the value of teamwork and communication in a business setting. As regarding to new skills, I learnt new methods of analyzing companies in the stock market and how to present information gathered to the supervisors/advisors.\n\nKnowledge from college that could have been applied on the internship\n\nOn the first, second and third day, I got a chance to apply knowledge acquired in college. I was expected to print some graphs and interpret them to the advisors. In addition, I had to select some stock options from various sources. Without the knowledge acquired at school, I could not have pulled these tasks off. This is because they required careful evaluation and analysis of financial factors covered in my course.\n\nDifficulties, mistakes, pleasant or unpleasant experiences that occurred this week, and what was done to correct them\n\nThe most prevalent problem that I had was getting help from my co-workers. It was understandable since they had their duties to perform. In addition to this, I experienced some difficulties during my presentations to the advisors. Mainly, my arguments were not as strong as expected and in some instances, I experienced stage fright and I could not effectively present my cases. However, I managed to survive through all these hurdles by rehearsing my presentations beforehand and being persistent in the face of rejection. I also tried my best to ask the right questions at the right time and doing nothing else but my best where my attention was required.\n\nSkill or question that could have been used to help in performing the internship responsibilities better\n\nThe presentation was my main challenge during the week. As such, I feel that some assistance in my presentation skills would be invaluable in improving my performance. I need some help in planning and organizing financial data such that it becomes consistent, concise and coherent. This is because the efficient presentation of ideas and arguments in financial institutions contributes highly to their success.\n\nInteresting or challenging experience that have been experienced with fellow workers or site supervisor\n\nThe most interesting moments during the week was when one of my co-workers described his experience at the bank during his first month of employment. He explained in detail how his co-workers looked down on him and were reluctant to adequately assist him to accomplish his tasks. He gave me quality advice on how to always stay on top of situations no matter how challenging they were. On the other hand, the most challenging experience I had was on Tuesday. I was supposed to present and interpret some graphs to the advisor. The interpretation proved to be more difficult than I expected. This was because the advisor kept on asking for justifications as regarding to each aspect and In some instances, I did not have ready answers to quench his curiosity.\n\nWeek Two\n\nDay and date  Description of activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \nMonday        On this day, I read the third module in preparation for the series 7 exams. The module was about government securities. Through this module, I was able to learn of their description, their similarities and differences as compared to other securities and when they apply. In addition to this, I discussed module 2 (corporate debt securities) with the advisor. During this discussion, we also had a chance to go through The Pacific Investment Management Company, LLC ( PIMCO) income fund with advisor.\n09/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nTuesday       Reading module 4 (economics and the markets). I also discussed the third module with the advisor. In addition, I had to prepare a summary of the Indian economy and sectors for the advisor and discussing it with him. I highlighted all the factors that contributed to the growth of the Indian economy and sectors as well as those factors that acted a hindrances to this growth.                                                                                                                            \n10/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \nWednesday     Discussing module 4 with advisor.

In my mini research about Gazprom, I was able to gain useful insight on investment management, the value of employee commitment to the success of the firm and the importance of having a vision to an organization. I also realized that the RIC monthly report is the best source of information when it comes to making investment decisions. In most cases, potential investors get financial information from many sources. However, most of these sources do not give details as to where the true investment opportunities lie. The RIC report covers all these aspects and is therefore a great source of credible investment and financial information.\n\nKnowledge from college that could have been applied on the internship\n\nDuring my classes, I managed to cover a module in research methods and market analysis. The knowledge gathered in these modules came in handy during my mini research. In addition, it facilitated my understanding during the discussion with the advisor as regarding to the emerging markets.\n\nDifficulties, mistakes, pleasant or unpleasant experiences that occurred this week, and what was done to correct them\n\nThe most taunting moment this week was when I was doing my research on Gazprom. This is because most of their financial information is not readily available. In addition to this, I had a hard time figuring out what to include and what to exclude from this research since there is a lot of equally important information about the company. Consequently, I had to ask for assistance from my co-workers who highlighted the areas that I should emphasis more on. On the other hand, I had a pleasant time discussing the RIC report with the advisor. The information provided in the report is not only comprehensive but is also presented in a simple language which makes it interesting and easy to understand.\n\nSkill or question that could have been used to help in performing the internship responsibilities better\n\nMy researching skills are a bit off. Considering that financial information is always a lot, having the necessary skills to ensure that I sift through all the information and summarize it without loosing the essence/meaning is invaluable. As such, the question that I need the most help on is: what factors should a wealth manager consider while carrying out a research on a given company?\n\nInteresting or challenging experience that have been experienced with fellow workers or site supervisor\n\nI had a great time during the discussion about emerging markets. I was able to update my knowledge base on this topic through the exchange of ideas that ensued during the discussion. The most challenging factor in this week was time management. I had so much research to do but with very limited time. It was challenging because I had to present quality results irrespective of the time constraints.\n\nWeek Three\n\nDay and date  Description of activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               \nMonday        I embarked on the challenging task of drafting a detailed report about the GCC countries. The aim of this report was to give investors a broad idea about the region. In the report, I discussed the countries that make up the GCC, the aim of the corporation, the opportunities and threats present in this region in political and economical terms.                                                \n16/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nTuesday       On this day, I had to name specific companies in the GCC that were viable for investors. I was expected to come up with a summary of each company giving a detailed description of the activities they participated in as well as financial information of the selected companies. Companies selected were located in Saudi, UAE and Qatar since these are the most profitable countries in this region.\n17/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nWednesday     Doing module 6 (underwriting). Under this topic we discussed the procedures that should be followed in the process of introducing new security issues as offers to public investors. In this module, I learned the various means that can be used to determine the risks of a given security offer as well as those that can be used to set the premium for these securities.                           \n18/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            \nThursday      Doing module 7 (investment companies).

I managed to cover various important aspects that should be considered while offering investment advice to customers. The knowledge acquired included but was not limited to: risk assessment, customer and company analysis and procedural measures employed while making successful recommendations to customers.\n\nKnowledge from college that could have been applied on the internship\n\nRisk assessment is very important to any investment decision. I was able to apply my knowledge on risk assessment during this week especially on Tuesday where I was expected to outline a list of companies that investors should consider while making investment decisions. In addition to this, I was able to use the recommended criteria during the selection of the companies.\n\nDifficulties, mistakes, pleasant or unpleasant experiences that occurred this week, and what was done to correct them\n\nThe only difficulty I faced this week was in compiling the financial information of various companies in the GCC region. This is attributed to the obvious fact that it is never easy to access financial information of most companies. In addition, some of the calculations and terminologies used in the information gathered were beyond my current level of understanding. This made it very difficult to come up with convincing arguments as well as conclusions. However, I did enjoy learning about the GCC region and the opportunities that this vast region offers.\n\nSkill or question that could have been used to help in performing the internship responsibilities better\n\nI had some difficulties in understanding the module on underwriting. Does it involve the provision of company information to the potential customers or does it only provide an assessment of the potential customers. In addition to this, I feel like I need more insight on how to present financial information to investors. In this regard, the questions that elude me are: what should be provided in these statements? Are expenses, pretax profits or losses necessary? How many years should be covered in the statements? If answers to these questions are provided, I believe that I would be able to perform even better in all my endeavors.\n\nInteresting or challenging experience that have been experienced with fellow workers or site supervisor\n\nThe most challenging moment was while drafting the financial information of the GCC companies that I had selected for the investors. This was mainly because I was not sure if the information I had was enough and comprehensive. In addition, I had trouble determining what financial information should be included in the summaries and the time frame that should be covered. Despite all this, I enjoyed researching the GCC region. Considering its geographical location, the region is doing better than most well situated regions around the world. As such, it is a very good investment haven for potential investors.\n\nWeek Four\n\nDay and date  Description of activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nMonday        Discussing module 10 (margin). In this topic, I was able to learn about the factors that affect margin (money that is borrowed and used to buy securities). Through the discussion, I was able to gather valuable knowledge as regarding to the interest rates that comes with such loans, the potential risks (to clients and issuer) as well as the benefits both short-term and long-term.                                                                 \n23/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nTuesday       Discussing module 11 (customer accounts). This topic basically covered all information pertaining to the opening, transfer, closure and maintenance of customer accounts. The need to keep organized records as relating to customers accounts was emphasized all through this module.                                                                                                                                                                        \n24/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nWednesday     Case 1. The case is about portfolio management. The wealth manager evaluates the 65 year old customer’s current portfolio and risk margin and offers viable recommendations that will yield the most in terms of returns all the while maintaining a low risk margin.                                                                                                                                                                                         \n25/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nThursday      Case 2. This case is also about portfolio management. However, the client in this case is younger (40 years). As such, the advisor considers long term investments as the way forward. This is because the client is young, healthy and has the potential to take reasonable risks in a bid to get the best results in future.                                                                                                                                \n26/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \nFriday        Presentation case 2. During this presentation, I was able to recommend some viable investment options to the customer. Considering that he was interested in long term investments, hedge funds and real assets were proposed. In regards to the stock options, it was decided upon that only stocks with the potential of earning high dividends should be bought. The amount of risks in these investment options is relatively high but so are the rewards.\n27/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n\n\nNew knowledge or skill learned on the internship this week\n\nDuring the case studies, I realized that other human factors such as sex, age and health status should be considered while recommending investment options to customers. This is because all investments have different risk margin. As such, these risks may affect clients differently in relation to these factors. In addition to this, I learnt of the various financing options that clients may adopt while investing. A detailed analysis into the advantages and disadvantages of using the margin as a form of financing investments should be given to all clients to ensure that they understand both sides of this coin.\n\nKnowledge from college that could have been applied on the internship\n\nIn college, I was able to learn about case studies and how they should be solved. I used this knowledge in the presentation of the second case. In addition to this, I was able to apply some of communication theories studied in class to interview clients and assist them where they got stuck (answering queries on account opening, acquisition of ATMs e. t. c).\n\nDifficulties, mistakes, pleasant or unpleasant experiences that occurred this week, and what was done to correct them\n\nDue to the immense pressure related to my schedule (school, work and personal responsibilities), I decided to take some time off from my work station and relax for a while. However, my decision was faced with serious repercussions especially from my work supervisor who was clearly disappointed. My actions were wrong since all I had to o was ask for some time off. However, upon the realization for my mistake, I went to the supervisor and apologized for that selfish act. All was forgiven but with a stern warning.\n\nSkill or question that could have been used to help in performing the internship responsibilities better\n\nThe only question that I need some clarification on is: how do you calculate the collateral required before giving out an investment loan? This is because; there are customers who would like to know their financing options in relations to their financial status.\n\nInteresting or challenging experience that have been experienced with fellow workers or site supervisor\n\nThis week was not as bad. My interaction with my co-workers has greatly improved and we often exchange ideas as equals. However, I still feel bad about neglecting my responsibilities so that I could get some free time. The world we are living in is very competitive and challenging and perseverance is required if one is to achieve the set goals and remain relevant.\n\nWeek Five\n\nDay and date  Description of activities                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    \nMonday        Discussing module 12 (over-the-counter market). These are spot markets whereby the buying and selling of securities, bonds and stocks does not take place in the exchange markets. The risks in this type of trading are often very high. However it is a legal and prevalent practice especially in America.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n30/08/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nTuesday       Discussing module 13 (New York stock exchange).

The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) is a regulatory body that formulates rules and regulations pertaining to all financial transactions related to the exchange markets. The aim of the FINRA rules is to protect investors from unethical and unfair dealings as well as to regulate and monitor the financial markets to ensure that everything is done right. The rules include procedures to be followed in buying securities, requirements and the various forms of punishment for noncompliance.                   \n01/09/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nThursday      Discussing module 15 (federal and state regulations). This module highlights the various expectations that should be observed while trading in securities. In addition, the stipulated regulations are formulated by the federal and state governments to ensure that business is conducted within the boundaries of the set rules and laws. Similar to the FINRA rules, the federal and state regulations provide guidelines on how equitable business should be conducted as well as the various consequences that may be faced as a result of flaunting these regulations.\n02/09/2010                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 \nFriday        Discussing module 18 (financial statements, exhibits and charts).

I had a chance to witness the thin line that exists between ethical and moral obligations. At times, customers came in with genuine problems that made me question some of the decisions made. For example, an old lady running a bit behind on her loan repayment asks for a deadline extension. Morally, you would be sympathetic to her situation and give her the extension. However, such a decision is unethical since the client is in breach of contract and should face the consequences of nonconformity to the signed agreement.\n\nKnowledge from college that could have been applied on the internship\n\nAfter learning about the New York exchange, I was able to determine which companies a client should invest in based on the expected rate of returns, market trends and past trading patterns. In addition, I could confidently advice clients on their rights and privileges when it comes to trading in the various stock markets.\n\nDifficulties, mistakes, pleasant or unpleasant experiences that occurred this week, and what was done to correct them\n\nI promised a customer that the bank would do everything they can to help him out of a financial situation. However, after carefully reviewing his application, the manager in charge rescinded the client’s application for a loan stating that he was not eligible to this service. I could see the frustration and disappointment in the client’s face as he stormed out of the bank. To make amends, I promised myself that I would at all times ensure that I consider all aspects before making any major decisions and ask for assistance when caught up in a dilemma.\n\nSkill or question that could have been used to help in performing the internship responsibilities better\n\nIn as much as I have enjoyed my internship, I feel as though more needs to be done to ensure that I can make impartial decisions at all times. A review of the past three weeks shows that most of my challenges, problems and mistakes are based on poor decisions. I am sure that if I can combat this weakness, I will be able to steer my career further towards success.\n\nInteresting or challenging experience that have been experienced with fellow workers or site supervisor\n\nBeing the last day of my internship, my site supervisor as well as some of the co-workers took me out for lunch. During this session, they gave me valuable advice on various matters relating to life, work, opportunities and finances. My supervisor finally acknowledged that I did a great job during my stay at the bank. Despite all the challenges that came with the internship, I actually enjoyed working in such a crucial and versatile environment.\n",
      "The Highest Crime Rate: Metropolitan County of Jefferson Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Jefferson County, Alabama\n 3. Probable reasons for high rate of crime\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nPolice agencies across the world exist to maintain law and order and the question of whether raising police strength will reduce crime is debatable. Increasing police strength may reduce crime but on the other hand, crime can also bring changes to police strength (Blumstein & Wallman, 2006 p 334) and this is due to layoffs or hiring that may be dictated by crime trends. However, hiring or laying off police officers has however not deterred crime from happening the world over. In the United States, crime is widespread from the urban centers to the countryside.\n\nJefferson County, Alabama\n\nThe metropolitan county of Jefferson in the State of Alabama reported the highest crime rate compared to other counties of the state in the year 2008. According to Federal Bureau of Investigation statistics, the county reported 637 violent crimes, five murder and non-negligent manslaughter cases, 62 forcible rape cases 282 robbery cases and 288 aggravated assault cases. These statistics exclude minor offenses like those associated with traffic. All these criminal cases happen against a backdrop of 705 total law enforcement employees in the county. Of these, 547 were police officers while 158 were civilians (FBI, 2008).\n\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, Jefferson County was the most populous in the state with 662047 people in the year 2000. The population in 2009 had risen to 665027 people. That gives a police to population ratio of roughly one police officer to 1210 people. It’s important to note that the county has the highest number of law enforcers in the state probably due to the high population. Most police departments report police to the civilian ratio of between 1.5 to 2.2 police officers per 1000 residents. In the city of New York for instance, the ratio of police to civilians is one police officer to 218 residents.\n\nProbable reasons for high rate of crime\n\nThere are many probable reasons why the crime picture of Jefferson County is the way it is. Pressure from loss of jobs due to the weak economy may be one of the reasons. Social pressures resulting from a high population and the fact that its location is in a metropolitan area may be another. Compared to other counties in the state, Jefferson has the highest number of law enforcers and its possible management issues may be affecting the way the force works.\n\nAccording to (Klockars, et al. 2006, p 55), the integrity of police agency is indirectly but greatly defined by the size of the agency, the population tasked to police and the number of people it employs. They further say that a large police agency needs to develop effective systems of administration and division of labor. The crime problem facing Jefferson County could be as a result of the above.\n\nThough the above reasons are valid, the ration of police to civilian in this county is slightly less. The number of police officers in this county is hardly adequate and clearly overwhelmed. If the minor offences were to be factored in then the numbers will be even stretched further. This number of police officers in the county therefore needs to be doubled for it to be at par with the recommended ratio and if any gains in combating the runaway crime wave in the county is to be tamed.\n\nFor a county like Jefferson, with high crime rates, it is important to increase the number of civilians working in the police force. The current number that stands at 158 may be inadequate leading to delay in solving cases. Raising the number of police officers is not always a sure way of controlling crime but within the extent that it’s successful, Jefferson County needs it.\n\nReferences\n\nBlumstein A & Wallman J.

      "Community Health Nursing’s Role in the Healthcare Essay\n\nNurses are professionals who provide care for people who are incapacitated. The incapability could be due to sickness, aging, disability or general bodily discomfort. The work of a nurse can be very demanding and challenging. The line of work entails numerous tasks and the training is critical. The caretakers have a big role to play in medical service provision. They are usually the first in line to meet patients. Therefore, they need to be compassionate to the patients who tend to be vulnerable and need attention. In provision of healthcare, nurses play a central role of nurturing the people.\n\nThe healthcare system is an integral part of the community that ought to be provided. A society that is healthy and vibrant grows to be industrious and beneficial. As healthcare providers, nurses should be well trained and favorable working conditions offered. The United States has advocated for the provision of universal healthcare for its citizens. In his pact, President Obama has drawn three fundamental necessities for authentic healthcare improvement. Top among this is condensed expenditure; the increase in healthcare expenses is overwhelming finances in homes, workplaces, persons and nations and this must be put under management. Second is definite alternative; citizens should have the liberty to maintain the physician and healthcare plan they use or to select a new one if they desire. Third is to guarantee reasonably priced care services for every one; every American should have excellent and inexpensive healthcare. These outlines give the healthcare a more universal and manageable approach.\n\nNurses are the professionals in the face column of the Obama healthcare reorganization. They will participate in a comprehensive part as crucial contributors. Be it in coping with deadly disease or sharp scarcity of general practitioners, nurse run health hubs is perceived as a vital answer to healthcare emergency. The nurses are to be used in treating the citizens who presently do not have health care cover and are not fully handled by the current scheme. This plan looks to work more with the nurse as they are plenty in number and closer to the people.\n\nA restart to the way America delivers its healthcare services should be employed. A modern provision form of principal and precautionary concern particularly for small revenue and susceptible residents ought to enlarge considerably to boost the ability of the nations overwhelmed provision scheme. A drive connecting practitioners and establishments countrywide is designed to harness the power of nurses and other healthcare providers to facilitate the provision of healthcare, physical condition encouragement and illness avoidance. This will be done through disorderly resolution such as society support concern. The objectives of a countrywide movement of nurse run health hubs is constant with the presidents call to multiply the number of community health care hubs.\n\nThis call will enable a health care jump start in the American way of delivering health care to its people. The idea gets the services to the core of the community and hence the responsibility being shared. The healthcare provider is readily available and he/she can attend numerous cases in a short period. This will also reduce the overall cost of health care as it will be shared across the country in a cost sharing basis. The restart of the community based health care was first practiced with success by Obama when he was a Senator of Illinois. It is a practical approach that reaches the individual and eases the burden of health cover. This is healthcare renewable as there is a proactive approach to dealing with the costly venture.\n\nThe community health care facility will serve as a hub for information and awareness creation. The nurses employed at these stations will be well equipped with the current data that they can share with the immediate community. Treatment of ailments can also be performed at the center and will release the ordinary citizen from costly hospital bills. America, just like any other country, is prone to catastrophes. Cases of naturally occurring hazards are common and people should be made aware on how to handle themselves in cases of danger. The community based health care centers can be of such help. Nurses in these centers are career oriented and in cases like the Katarina hurricane they would have done a more proactive job. People lost their lives since the rescuing body is a nationalized organization. This makes the mobilization of equipment and personnel more challenging to meet the concern.\n\nElderly members of the society and other vulnerable members need care. The nurses can provide the required support more effectively if they are closer to the persons. These are members of the society who if not handled well can be stressed. The baby boomers are now in their 60s and 70s which means that there are older people today than before. This group takes a lot of revenue in their healthcare and they do not add to the country’s budget.\n\nThe Obama health care plan is a modern way of handling healthcare. In this era of preventable disease outbreak due to human negligence, a closer monitoring of the human fitness and sanitation is apparent. The community based health provider is more responsive to the needs of the citizens.\n",
      "Immigration and the United States Essay\n\nGelatt, Julia et al. “Navigating the Future of Work: The Role of Immigrant-Origin Workers in the Changing U.S. Economy”. Migration Policy Institute , 2020, Web.\n\nThe report illustrates the role immigrants play in the evolving U.S economy. The authors begin the text by indicating that the foreign nationals were responsible for the 83% country’s labor force growth between 2010 and 2018. The document projects that the group is crucial to the developments in the working-age population through 2035. The strength of the information lies in its in-depth analysis of immigrants’ racial and ethnic challenges and their effect on the country’s future workforce. The authors are policy analysts at the Migration Policy Institute (MPI) and, therefore, make the contents credible.\n\nMPI. “Amid U.S. Demand for Higher Skills and Education, Credentialing Immigrant-Origin Adult Workers Could Be Key” . 2019, Web.\n\nThe press release by MPI attempts to explain the increasing importance of adult immigrants in the United States’ workforce. The document predicts that the country will be short of about 8 million workers by 2027 because the current native employees are aging. On the other hand, the approximated number of immigrants in the region is 58 million, and the group is projected to be the main source of the future labor force. Unfortunately, more than half of this population lacks post-secondary education, which is crucial for an effective workforce. The source is essential to the study because it gives statistical evidence of the need for education among immigrants to improve their contribution to America’s human resource.\n\nSherman, Arloc et al. “Immigrants Contribute Greatly to U.S. Economy, Despite Administration’s “Public Charge” Rule Rationale” . Center on Budget and Policy Priorities , 2019, Web.\n\nThe “Public Charge” rule was developed to deny immigrants who have the potential of being a liability to the county from gaining entry. This law assumes that most foreigners are poor and are likely to cause financial constraints for the government. However, it does not consider the positive contributions the foreign nationals make to the country. Consequently, the report evaluates the impacts they have on the economy. The authors illustrate that immigrants work at higher rates than the natives and occupy close to two-thirds of most industries. The authors are professionals in immigration services and policies, and therefore are classified as credible sources.\n\nAccording to Gelatt et al., the United States is ranked as the largest hub for immigrants globally. However, even though it is faster and easier for foreigners to assimilate in the U.S, the immigration policy has become a matter of debate in the region. Most of the arguments revolve around the cultural and financial implications of the movement. However, economic analysts argue that there is little evidence to show that the increase in foreign labor has reduced the number of jobs in the country. On the contrary, immigration has more positive impacts as it leads to better occupational specialization. However, most foreign nationals have insufficient education and find it hard to maximize their potential in America’s workforce. Therefore, the federal government needs to integrate learning opportunities into immigrant policies to equip them fully.\n\nThe primary objective of education is to give individuals the required knowledge to help them contribute effectively to a country’s economy. Consequently, highly educated immigrants are assets in the United States’ labor force. According to Gelatt et al., foreign employees are the future of the U.S. human resources because they work at higher rates and represent the highest number of staff members in most industries. Consequently, placing them at the same educational level as the native population will improve their efficiency and create a reliable workforce. Similarly, MPI’s report suggests a link between degree and non-degree credentials and the economic results among adult immigrants. Workers who are not of American origin will improve their skills with the attainment of the right education.\n\nConversely, immigrants with low or no educational qualifications are a liability to the American economy. One of the greatest challenges among U.S residents is communication because the inhabitants are from various parts of the world, yet the official and national language is English. According to Gelatt et al., most food restaurants and hotels are run by foreigners, particularly Latina. Unfortunately, the lack of education makes it difficult for these individuals to speak eloquently, slowing down businesses. MPI agrees with concern and indicates that English proficiency is another hindrance to obtaining credentials among immigrants besides legal status. Lack of education makes it difficult for foreign nationals to survive in America, which further affects their contributions to the economy.\n\nConsequently, there is a need for sustainable solutions that will empower immigrants with regard to education. Gelatt et al. acknowledge that the future of American jobs will require middle and high-skilled individuals and, therefore, suggest affordable vocational schooling for minority families. This strategy will ensure all immigrants get a chance to take their children through schools comfortably. The press release by MPI, on the other hand, indicates that 16.7 million immigrant adults lack proficiency in English because they have not attained post-secondary education. The institution suggests that employers offer skills training that focuses on the English language. Creating affordable learning programs and training immigrant employees positively impacts the U.S. workforce.\n\nFrom the report and press release by the MPI, it is clear that the future of the job market will be more demanding, affecting immigrants in the workforce. Gelatt et al. state that industries are bound to embrace automation, reducing low-skilled jobs. Unfortunately, Sherman et al. indicate that the birth rate among Native Americans is low, which means that the country’s future economy is in the hands of foreign nationals. Consequently, the government must develop strategies to ensure the immigrants gain middle and high-level job skills.\n\nImmigrants do not have to go to public and private universities to be profitable in the U.S. economy. MPI suggests that non-degree credentials are enough to make positive labor returns. Additionally, according to Sherman et al., foreign nationals with licenses and certifications in occupations, including chefs and barbers, demonstrate higher labor force involvement levels. The immigrant federal department is responsible for ensuring the members acquire the credentials they require to participate in the nation’s economic developments.\n\nThe hard work among foreign nationals in America is seen in the increased competition level among them and Native Americans in the job market. Gelatt et al. attribute this development to the increased equal learning opportunities in academic institutions. Research indicates that immigrants’ children are attaining more education and even earning more than their parents (Sherman et al.). Second-generation foreign nationals are the future of the United States’ economy, and the government must ensure they are presented with equal opportunities in schools and the job market.\n\nThe American government has the responsibility to ensure immigrants have sufficient learning experiences to equip them for America’s future economy. Highly educated foreigners have proven to be competitive occupying the same positions as natives in the job industry. On the other hand, those who have not attained post-secondary education struggle to survive because they lack English proficiency and cannot express themselves well in the workplace. The future of the U.S. economy appears to be bright, but this dream’s actualization highly depends on empowering and educating immigrants.\n",
      "Electric vs. Gasoline-Powered Cars Term Paper\n\nAs electric cars become less costly and able to cover greater distances per single charge, consumers more and more tend to view them as a potentially preferable alternative to the traditional gasoline-powered automobiles. Electric vehicles seem to perform better on several crucial indicators, such as maintenance costs, environmental impact, and their effect on public health. However, it is also necessary to take other aspects into account to draw meaningful comparisons between the electric and gasoline-powered automobiles. While electric cars have several positive societal impacts, some of these will likely be tempered by the planned obsolescence, and the limited distance per one charge is likely to limit their use in rural areas.\n\nElectric vehicles are expected to have a positive impact on society in several aspects simultaneously. To begin with, they do not need to burn fossil fuels to operate, and, as a result, leave a smaller carbon footprint than their gasoline-powered counterparts (Malmgren 989). Apart from the environmental impact, one may also expect electric cars to be more beneficial to public health. Fine particle pollution inherent in the exhaust of internal combustion engines has numerous adverse health effects, such as cardiovascular and respiratory harm, cancer, and even early death (Malmgren 989-990). Additionally, electric cars should also have a positive effect on national security in terms of gasoline consumption. According to Malmgren, choosing an electric car over a gasoline-powered one saves up to 344 gallons of fuel per year, leaving it available for other uses (990). By doing so, electric cars reduce the country’s dependence on fossil fuels. Finally, maintenance costs for electric cars are lower than those for the gasoline-powered ones, suggesting that society will also benefit economically from using them (Malmgren 988). Considering these estimations, electric cars seem to have many positive societal impacts.\n\nHowever, the positive impact of the electric automobiles on the economy in terms of the maintenance costs is likely overstated. The logic of the assumption is fairly straightforward: the less money people spend on maintenance, the more they have for other productive uses, thus benefitting society as a whole. However, Malmgren’s account of this societal impact is solely based on the cars’ technical features and does not take into account the business component of the situation. As noted by Hanke et al., the management of the firms producing cars is under pressure to create “payable sustainable mobility,” and “payable” is at least as important as “sustainable” in this scheme (17). Even though electric cars do not need oil changes or spark plugs and wires, producing goods that have a long life cycle and next to no maintenance requirements is unprofitable. With this in mind, one may expect that the producers will compensate for reduced maintenance via planned obsolescence, such as contrived durability and repair prevention. Thus, the positive impact of electric cars on the consumer’s spending is likely overstated.\n\nThere is one more downside to Malmgren’s economic analysis comparing the costs of operating and maintaining an electric or gasoline-powered car. The author accounts for fuel consumption and maintenance alike, successfully demonstrating that electric cars are advantageous in both aspects and yield thousands of dollars’ worth of savings during their life cycle (Malmgren 988-989). However, while assessing these costs, he omits another important one. Newnan et al. point out that, when selecting a machine, the consumer should consider not only the annual energy worth and other operating costs but also the initial costs (230). This is precisely the aspect that Malmgren largely fails to address: the author compares Nissan Leaf and Honda Civic as popular vehicles “comparable in size and function” rather than the options with equivalent initial costs (987). As a result, the article investigates the maintenance and operating costs of the vehicles under scrutiny with sufficient thoroughness but pays little attention to the initial costs of procuring them. The lack of attention to this factor is an evident downside of Malmgren’s economic analysis.\n\nAnother aspect of operating an electric vehicle as opposed to the gasoline-powered one is their limited range per one charge. It is also the single most important treason why electric cars remain largely confined to urban and suburban communities and are less represented in rural areas. Contemporary electric cars have a relatively small range per one charge as compared to the gasoline-powered cars per one fill, which imposes corresponding requirements upon the public charging infrastructure (Gunn 2). As the areas with much higher population density, urban and suburban communities naturally surpass the rural areas in the development of said infrastructure, thus making electric vehicles less applicable beyond cities and towns. The logical way to overcome this limitation is to improve battery technology, extending the range of the electric cars, putting downward pressure on prices, and decreasing the required density of the charging infrastructure (Gunn 2). With the range of the electric vehicles increased to several hundred miles per charge, the barrier currently preventing their wider usage in rural areas will lose its importance, although it is unlikely to disappear entirely.\n\nAs one can see, for all the advantages of the electric vehicles over their gasoline-powered counterparts, they do not fare equally well in all aspects. They have numerous positive societal impacts, but the producers will likely compensate for lower maintenance costs via planned obsolescence. This fact, as well as the initial costs and range per charge, underscore the otherwise impressive advantages of the electric cars.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGunn, Taylor. “EVs and EDs: Rural Electric Coops to Benefit from Late Adoption of Electric Vehicles.” CoBANK , 2017.

      "Creationism and Evolution Theories Essay\n\nCreationism and Evolution are two strong theories that have been subjected to constant debating and criticism. They are two strong ideas with an abundance of evidence to prove their reliability. At school, students must be taught different facts disregarding ideas that educators may agree or disagree. Teaching creationism and evolution from scientific prospective would expand the scope of information that students learn. For instance, in solving a math problem, students would be able to learn both Creationism and Evolution, and choose the theory they believe to be just. In the United States, the value of furthering the education of young students as a way of broadening their vision of different theories has been always discussed. The theory of evolution offers a groundbreaking and definitive view of the extraordinary impact that the evolutionary process has had on our understanding of the surrounding world. According to “Intelligent Design Network” (2005), the purpose of teaching the origins of science can be defined as explaining the origin of the Universe and life in it along with its diversity and scientific controversy. An ambiguous nature of Origins Science causes the need to evaluate it from the point of view of scientific objectivity whereas Materialistic and Teleological appear to be irrelevant. As educational establishments which support Origins Science provide students with knowledge regarding life origin, the main principles of their work should be objectiveness and impartiality. Sadly, a number of educational establishments tend to favor only a few theories of life origin, and evolution is not among them. For example, Orthodox educational establishments insist on creationism, and, thus, they contradict the principle of neutrality adopted by the government for regulating educational matters (“Intelligent Design Network”, 2005). Understanding evolution is important to meet the twenty-first century innovative challenges. The need is great to provide our next generation with sufficient knowledge to provide them with the necessary skills for finding new ways of treatment of diseases caused by viruses, bacteria, and the other deadly infections (Noll, 2007). To understand the mechanism of developing infectious diseases, children have to acquire knowledge on evolution. Unfortunately, the debate around teaching evolution in public schools remains heated due to insisting by certain people in society on the fact that religious doctrines, which are said to be true to science, should be a part of a school curriculum instead.\n\nIt is opportune time for us as educators to defend the theory of evolution. We can start by explaining to our children why it is important for us to know the theory of evolution In my opinion, most parents want their children to do well in school, and receive good grades to enter a college. There is an opinion in the educational world that most of these young learners will attend universities where evolution is taught upfront without apology. Despite individual choices, we as educators must stand for what we believe to be right and just. After reading many Dr Montessori’s books about her theory, I have no doubt that this genius has recognized the fact that the universe contains all of the answers to the eternal questions asked by curious children. She insists on the need of providing children with an understanding of the Universe and the cosmos because they need to know how it came into existence, how life appeared including plants and animals, and humans (“The Five Great Lessons ”, n. d.).\n\nAs a final point, I highly recommend the teaching of evolution as a necessity discipline to our children. Cosmic education does not mean just a new way of thinking about teaching geography, history, music, biology, language, or mathematics. Rather, cosmic education has to be thought as the way in which we relate the child to the universe and to humanity so that he or she would be able to understand the law and order being the foundation of everything that exists.\n\nReferences\n\nIntelligent Design Network.

      "Inditex’s Global Strategy Analysis Case Study\n\nInditex’s success in a difficult market suggests that their global strategy is indeed working. Although it operates a chain of fashion stores across a number of countries, the company is still enjoying success to a surprising degree in a difficult market during a period of economic hardships. The company’s success, especially within the fashion market through Zara stores, is pegged to its flexibility in a dynamic and ever changing environment.\n\nIn addition, the company also operates from a central location with most of its stores serviced with merchandise all the way from Spain. However, the company’s expansion program in various countries is beginning to face challenges, due to the fact that expenses for most of the new stores are accumulating faster than revenues. This is further exacerbated by the global economic downturn, which has made selling some of its premium brands more difficult, as well as the fact that the company has failed to expand its production line sufficiently over the last few years to keep up with the increased demand from new stores. Due to globalization and a rapid expansion process, Inditex is facing a number of challenges (Continued Growth for Zara and Inditex” 1).\n\nBecause of the rapid expansion in terms of the number of stores under its management, operating from a central location in a manner that allows it to retain its competitive advantage is proving quite difficult. Effectively monitoring its 4,430 stores across 73 countries is proving a challenge for the company, as it is no longer able to monitor the popularity of various clothes lines within its stores. This has considerably curtailed its flexibility and ability to promptly respond to trend changes and changes in fashion preferences.\n\nFurthermore, keeping a large amount of its production so close to home has led to growing costs as well as a strained supply line for the numerous number of stores. Although keeping production close to home guarantees quality, it has raised the costs of production considerably due to higher labor costs and transport costs, especially for its stores outside Europe. This has forced the company to price its products differently in various regions, which could lead to an inconsistent brand image. Furthermore, such a pricing strategy could pose significant challenges within its online market curtailing the company’s ability to utilize such an important marketing tool.\n\nThe global nature of Inditex’s market exposes it to currency fluctuations, which significantly reduce the company’s realized profits. For instance, the company’s gross profit margin fell from 56.4% to 55.3% in 2009 due to a strong dollar performance, a loss of about 1.1% in profits simply due to fluctuations in a single currency. This poses a huge challenge for a company that operates in more than 73 countries (“Continued Growth for Zara and Inditex” 2)\n\nThe best solution to some of these challenges faced by Inditex due to globalization would be to decentralize its operations. By spreading its management and production centers, the company could easily deal with challenges such as increased transport costs and the lost flexibility. Spreading the workload of monitoring fashion trends will ensure that the company does not lose its sense of awareness. Increasing the number of production centers according to the distribution of its stores will also allow the company to exploit cheaper labor costs and keep its tradition of supplying its stores twice a week. Furthermore, such an approach could also lessen the company’s vulnerability to currency fluctuations, as its costs and sales would be conducted using the same currency.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nContinued Growth for Zara and Inditex. 2013.

      "Visible Spectrum: Discovery, Development, and Applications Research Paper\n\nWhat people refer to as “light” can be regarded from the physical perspective as a particular range of frequencies within the electromagnetic spectrum. This range is called the visible spectrum. Everything we see is made of waves within this range emitted or reflected by objects. The spectrum consists of colors from red (the lowest frequency) to violet (the highest frequency) and can be observed when a ray of light is cast at an angle on a transparent object like a prism or a water drop. The visible spectrum was discovered in the 17th century and studied throughout the late 18th and early 19th centuries as technology advanced, and today knowledge of the visible spectrum has found use in many areas of human activity.\n\nLong before a physical explanation was proposed, people could observe the disassembling of white light into the visible spectrum colors under natural conditions. They could see rainbows in the sky and a varicolored glow over a flow of water drops (for example, when watering plants). The term “spectrum” was coined by Isaac Newton in 1671. Newton also recognized the seven primary colors of the spectrum, suggesting that the light of different colors travels through prisms at different speeds (McLaren, 1985). Since then, debate has been ongoing regarding the number of primary colors. In particular, many claim that indigo should not be included in the list. McLaren (1985) argues that what Newton meant by “indigo” was blue, while “blue” is what people nowadays would refer to as cyan.\n\nUnderstanding of the visible spectrum was augmented in the beginning of the 19th century. Electromagnetic radiation with a frequency below red (infrared) and above violet (ultraviolet) was discovered and studied. In 1802, Thomas Young experimentally measured the wavelength of different colors within the spectrum (Brand, 1995). The visible spectrum was established to be a range within the electromagnetic spectrum. Later, however, experiments showed that some animals can see light that humans cannot (Cuthill et al., 2000). In other words, particular limits of the visible spectrum are species-specific.\n\nThere are many applications for the visible spectrum concept in different areas of technology and science. For example, present-day monitors are designed based on the understanding of spectrum continuity and differences in wavelength (Spiker, 2011). Combining primary colors allows humans to see numerous colors on screens. Another example is the use of infrared radiation. The technology of infrared photography captures and visualizes the light that is invisible to the human eye. This technology is used for medical purposes (finding tumors), military purposes (detecting hidden forces and weapons), and in astronomy (observing faint stars). But the most extensive area of visible spectrum use is spectroscopy, which pertains to the exploration of characteristics of distant objects by analyzing the electromagnetic radiation they emit or reflect. According to Brand (1995), our knowledge of outer space and the universe in general is largely gained through spectroscopy.\n\nThe discovery of the visible spectrum was one of the most important and fundamental events in optics, the science of light. The study of the visible spectrum has significantly contributed to spectroscopy, a method of exploring the universe based on the knowledge of how different objects, surfaces, materials, and environments interact with electromagnetic radiation. Moreover, applications of the visible spectrum extend to many other areas like medicine, astronomy, computer science, and military operations.\n\nReferences\n\nBrand, J. (1995).

      "Coaching and Mentoring in the Company Essay\n\nCoaching and mentoring are continuous training processes given to an individual or a group of people. The training aims at helping them to achieve their full potential in the area of their occupation or in other duties which they engage in their daily lives. Both coaches and mentors explore the needs, abilities, and desires of individuals to help them make actual and lasting changes. Use of different tools and training techniques is applied for instance the coach or the mentor may employ a questioning technique to identify problems and solutions of a certain client.\n\nThe training requires commitment from both the clients and trainers to realize lasting individual growth and change. Unconditional positive consideration and not judgmental is important in encouraging the clients. Coaching and mentoring programs are tailored to the employee’s knowledge, experience, aspiration, and maturity. Objectives that are focused on the welfare of both the company and individual include the ability to carry out a specific task at the same time putting into consideration the personal and career growth development of individuals. Evaluation of coaching and mentoring outcomes is important to find out whether the trainers and clients are achieving their goals. Organizations should develop ways of supporting employees to change any bad character by offering coaching and mentoring sessions to affected employees. The essay explores ways in which employers can help their employees to handle work-related issues in a professional way (The coaching and mentoring network, 2008, p.12).\n\nIn a work environment problems that arise need to be solved wisely especially by the management team. Managers need to understand the cause of the problem, in enquiring this they ought to be polite rather than yell at the employees. To get at the bottom of the issue thorough consultations are required, managers should not think that they have the full potential of solving all problems. This also requires the manager to be mindful of the language they use, to avoid the explosion of a small problem. Human resource management requires respect for other people’s opinions, in laying demands managers need to be mindful of other parties. Though a certain employee may be a top performer s/he should not look down upon other employees, it is important to emulate humility and integrity in addressing other employees (The coaching and mentoring network, 2008, p.32). Employees with the problem of feeling superior and micromanaging fellow employees should seek guidance and counseling from coaches and mentors. This would help them change their lifestyle and gets to appreciate others more. These changes would encourage good relationships at the workplace and eventually increase output. A manager should receive professional training, to be able to handle employees with negative personalities in a good way and at the same time help them to change for the better (Luecke, 2004, chap. 2).\n\nIn a work environment when a colleague yells at you, you do not need to yell back at him/her but rather coach them on the importance of being polite. Screaming does not solve any problem but it mostly annoys the other party. There are better ways of expressing needs, when an employer demands a lot from an employee the employees can in a polite way approach the employer and have a discussion. Exploration of need should not be done rudely if the employee expects positive results. Being courteous in a work environment compels colleagues and even bosses to listen and address employees’ needs. If exploring needs is rudely done chances are high that the results will be unproductive or negative. Employees with this behavior risk losing their jobs or having a poor relationship with the employers and fellow employees. Good understanding of employees by their employers is fundamental; they can give coaching and mentoring sessions to employees with personality problems ((The coaching and mentoring network, 2008, p.35).\n\nIt is much better if you try to find out what could be the problem, rather than blaming other people.\n\nInstead of pointing a finger at an individual, the cause of the particular problem should be identified. The individual helped to put her act together rather than being viewed as their problem. A problem shared is half solved. Sharing individual problems is important; coaches need to encourage their clients to speak up, to get solutions to their problems. Different opinions given by individuals provide many options for finding a solution, a person can choose the best available opinion. Individuals should be persuaded to speak up, being polite relaxes the individual, and s/he can freely speak up. On realizing other people’s weaknesses, coaches should not criticize them or tell them straight to their face. They should put effort to help them improve on their weaknesses. This is a bit difficult for you let us give the task to someone else so that you can learn from them. It is great to be a team player since it promotes cooperation among all the group members. A good team player takes the lead in addressing any problem that arises in his/her team. Rather than acting like a scorekeeper who always judges who are wrong or right (Mind Your Language, 2004, p.67).\n\nThe developmental coach helps the client to change any negative behavior. They do not pretend to have answers to all the problems but they always find out the identity of the story. This enables them to determine whether the client is changing their behavior as per the set goals. The developmental coach is also able to monitor the progress of the client which is highly enabled by knowing more about the client. The coaches get professional training; this enables them to handle clients’ problems professionally. (Giacobbi, 2002, p.26).\n\nThe working environment is continuously changing, it is has become more complex and demanding than before. Many organizations have adopted mentoring and coaching as training techniques to build the capacity of their employers. This also helps in changing the negative personality of employees to positive personality. Coaching and mentoring mainly focus on an individual to enhance their morale, enthusiasm, and productivity. It reduces staff turnover because individuals feel appreciated and connected to both minor and major organizational changes. It also strikes a balance as it fulfills the organizational goals and at the same time boosts the personal development requirements of individual employees. Coaching and mentoring programs are tailored to the employee’s knowledge, experience, aspiration, and maturity. Objectives that are focused on the welfare of both the company and individual include, ability to carry out a specific task at the same time putting into consideration the personal and career growth development of individuals.\n\nReference List\n\nGiacobbi, R.J.

      "Evaluation of a Genius: Louis Lozowick’s Life and Works Essay (Biography)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Lozowick’s life and time\n 3. Reflection of artistic genius\n 4. Impact on art and culture\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne among the artistic legends of the modern art is Louis Lozowick who was a well acknowledged as a Precisionist artist and an Art Deco. It is to be noted that the legacy of Louis Lozowick still lives within the artistic parameters of fine arts and experimentations with form and mode of artistic expressions. As an immigrant from Russia it was a great challenge for him to establish in the United States. It is no wonder that he was extremely successful in this as his life proves quite well enough. In the golden span of 50 years of his career he shaped streamline, urban inspired monochromatic lithographs, etc. He is undoubtedly one of the greatest artists of the 20 th century with a profound influence on his surroundings. He was a true genius and this study would reflect the nature of his genius (Marquardt 2005).\n\nLozowick’s life and time\n\nIn the year 1892 Louis Lozowick was born in Ludvinovka, a state in Ukraine, an Eastern European country, bordered the countries of Belarus to the north, Russia to the north-east, Moldova and Romania to the south-west and Hungary, Slovakia and Poland to the west, the Sea of Azov and the Black Sea happily forms the southern border of the country. Though that phase of time had witnessed an era of disputes, conflicts and power play in Ukraine, but that time also witnesses the birth of a legend Louis Lozowick. In 1904, when he was twelve years old, he was admitted in Kiev Art School. From 1904-1906, for two years he remained there to attended art classes (Marquardt 2005).\n\nFrom the year 1906 – 1919, in a span of thirteen years he Attended art school, after completion of his schooling he joined a college. From 1912 to 1914 he studied in New York Nation Academy of design. Later after he finished college he also served in the army. Being a born artist, art flowed in this blood, the quest of art related knowledge and information of the developments in the field of art motivated him more than anything (Harnsberger 2004).\n\nThus he traveled all over the United States. In 1919 he came back to Europe. First he visited Paris and later in the year 1920 he left for Berlin and lived there for three years. In the same year, at the age of twenty eight he embarked on Machine Ornament series relating applied design that reveal the contemporaneous industrial milieu of the twenties. With in the short span of five years from 1919 to 1924 Louis Lozowich dwelled and traveled the entire Europe. He resided mostly in the places like Pars, Moscow and Berlin. In the year 1924 he again returned to United States. In the year 1926 he designed the stage sets for Georg Kaiser’s play ‘gas’. His work reflected his range of interests and his versatility.\n\nLouis Lozowich complete his first prints in the year 1927, which were well accepted in both United States of America and Europe. He also participated in Machine Age Exhibition in New York. Later in the same year Carl Zigrosser of the Weythe Gallery encouraged him to recommence lithography. During the Depression in 1940 he made several wall paintings and prints for the WPA. ” In the year 1943 Louis Lozowich finally settled in New Jersey where he continued with his work of making prints and painting” (Marquardt 2005). Generally his art reflected the human condition, which being the invariable theme of his art and an enduring attraction towards the beauty of nature become more frequently visible in his later pieces of art. In the year 1973 he passed away leaving behind him a rich collection of his paintings and designs and much more (Joffe 1981).\n\nReflection of artistic genius\n\nLouis Lozowik was one among the initial campaigners of applied design in United States of America, which produced an impression of the contemporaneous industrial milieu during the twenties. He was greatly influenced by Russian and European artists, especially with ultra modern way of thinking. He had a close contact with them first in Paris and afterward in Berlin and then in Moscow from middle of the year 1920 to end of 1923. His hypothesis of applied design resulted from his association with Russian and European artists. He came across Hungarian, French and Russian artists who operated technological inventions, took up their industrial allied hypothesis of rationalism, exactitude and standardization as the premise of a modern machine esthetic, promoted fusion of art with industry and applied design (Joffe 1981).\n\nThe topic of machine age introduced by him in his work is an incorporation these ideas. Some wall paintings painted by him portraying the images of American landscapes and urban life of people living and working in United States of America are murals of Seattle made in 1927, Chicago in 1923, Pittsburgh in 1923 and Cleveland in 1926. The subjects which generally formed the theme of his work are Botanies, Cityscape and City Views, Figure, Floral Still Life, Genre (Human Activity), Industry, Landscape, National Parks, New York City View, Portrait, Snow scene, Still Life, Townscape, etc. Louis used Charcoal’ Fresco, Graphite or Pencil, Ink Drawing (Pen and Ink), Mixed-Media or Multi-Media, Oil, Printmaking Specialty and Watercolors as the medium of painting (Marquardt 2005). The murals and paintings produced by Louis Lozowik not only displays the competence, intelligence and ideas of the painter himself, but at the same time depicts economic scenario, level of urbanization, structure of society, day to day living conditions of people living or immigrants working to earn their livelihood in United States of America. Thus his art portrays the real picture of United States in twentieth century.\n\nLouis Lozowik used to produce visible contrasts between wide stretches of pure white and vast regions of velvety shadows with the application of lithograph stone. In the year 1925, the famous Lithograph New York, designed by Louis Lozowik brought a new era in monochromatic Lithography. Lozowich complete his first prints in the year 1927, which were well accepted in both United States of America and Europe. He also participated in Machine Age Exhibition in New York. Later in the same year Carl Zigrosser of the Weythe Gallery encouraged him to recommence lithography. In the year 1929 he created Tanks No. 1, and later he has created City on a Rock —Cohoes, both of these master pieces of prints are now put in safekeeping in British Museum in London, England. Another tour de force created by the legend himself, the Storm Over Manhattan in the year 1936 is now kept in Fine Art Museums San Francisco, CA, US (Harnsberger 2004).\n\nImpact on art and culture\n\nIn 1920s, American art had integrated a substantial quantity of metaphors of the contemporary technology, such as the bridges, the sky scrapers, grain elevators and several other machines, the emblem of a modern industrial era, or better said the machine age, became a believe able fact in United States. The manner in which these metaphors are portrayed communicates a festivity of the appearance of the urban atmosphere and both living conditions and standards of living of people dwelling and working in urban vicinity of United States (Marquardt 2005).\n\nThis urban buoyancy, which can largely be put in plain words as an affirmative reliance in the human power and in man’s self esteem to achieve a better enjoin on his sphere of influence, is articulated in well thought out, series of geometric structures extracted from the metaphors of the urban environment, and fashioned with the instrument of imagination within the factory of mind. Among all other painters of that era who tinted images of urban vicinity and urban life as the themes of their paintings sanguinely Louis Lozowick was the most eloquent, say it destiny or politics he is also the most disregarded one. A component of Lozowick’s papers, an unpublished autobiography composed by the legend in the later years of his life, has of late been acquired depicts the accomplishments of American art and industrial designing in 1920s (Harnsberger 2004).\n\nBoth his art and writings of 1920s articulate a very cogent view of his optimistic way of thinking towards the urban environment, specially related to United States, in that era. In the present day world of prevailing dynamism, that is moving from progress to greater progress, or better said beauty to higher beauty in an endless motion, underneath all ostensible pandemonium and bewilderment, the trend which dominates America, is it’s demonstration of orderliness and maintenance, which display their external mark and at the same time symbolize the inflexible geometry of the cities of United States, in its smoke trails, in it’s analogous car tracks, and its streets, its factories and the its bridges and its gas tanks, by making use of the underscoring mechanical configuration, the artist could generate a new appearance of optimism and this was highly influential in the art and culture of his time (Marquardt 2005).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion it could be well stated that Louis Lozowick was an excellent Painter, a skilled lithographer and an illustrator, esteemed as one among the best lithographers of the twentieth century. He was well known for his profound geometric portrayal of urban life and territorial landscape of America. His career of fifty years contains varying shades of diversity. At a same time he was a renowned Illustrator, Mural Painter, Painter, Printmaker and a Graphic Artist. Among all other painters of that era who tinted images of urban vicinity and urban life as the themes of their paintings sanguinely Louis Lozowick was the most eloquent, say it destiny or politics he is also the most disregarded one. He was a genius in real sense, a name to be noted in golden words on the pages of history.\n\nReferences\n\nHarnsberger, R. (2004). Ten precisionist artists .

      "Psammoma Bodies Presence Case Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Recommendation\n 2. Clinical Expertise\n 3. Pathology\n 4. Cytology\n 5. Conclusion to the Case\n 6. References\n\nRecommendation\n\nIn this particular case, we believe that the presence of benign endometrial tissue and postcoital bleeding is explained by the emergence of atypical glandular cells but not due to the foci of calcification.\n\nClinical Expertise\n\nAccording to Misdraj et al. (1), the appearance of psammoma bodies can be associated equally with malign and benign conditions. In her research, it has been proved that women with benign outcomes do not have atypical glandular cells and any signs of malignancy, like bleeding or mass. In addition, the women with benign outcomes have no other malignancies. In their turn, postmenopausal women have a higher rate of occurrences of malign tumors.\n\nIt has been also researched that the presence of psammoma bodies cannot cause carcinomas and related malignant neoplasm. Instead, they are just defined as the calcification concentration associated with benign endometrial tissue, polyps, postpartum, marked atrophy, and follicular cervicitis (2).\n\nPathology\n\nAs the patient is a female woman of 37 years old, she is not in her menopausal period. However, the presence of postcoital bleedings during six months cannot be considered as the result of psammoma bodies alone but as related outcomes of their presence. The pathology, hence, is observed, since the identified neoplasm in benign endometrial is not associated with postcoital bleeding.\n\nThe previous three smears turned out to be negative, which also contradicts the absence of malignant tumors in endometrial tissues. As proof, Lynge and Paul (3) have revealed that women who had from 2 to 4 previous negative smears had a low risk of developing cervical cancer in the course of two years from the last negative smear. In our case, 3 negative smears denote that the patient still has the probability of the appearance of malignant neoplasm.\n\nCytology\n\nInfrequent cases, benign conditions can be a potential reason for a false presentation of the borderline tumor, or adenocarcinoma (4). In order to avoid a pseudo-interpretation of the results, the malignancy identification should not be based only on the presence of psammoma bodies, since they are considered to be secondary findings among the asymptomatic women.\n\n  * Differential Diagnosis\n  * List of possible diagnoses:\n  * Adenocarcinoma;\n  * Cervical cancer;\n\nIn the first case, adenocarcinoma is the result of the development of atypical glandular cells associated with psammoma bodies in benign endometrial. This type of tumor can appear in the cervix. Such pathology is mostly observed among women with postmenopausal bleedings (5). However, our patient does not belong to the 45-50 age group; therefore, this diagnosis cannot be considered true.\n\nCervical cancer is a malignant tumor causing vaginal bleedings. This cancer can be asymptomatic; this is why it is difficult to diagnose the patient. Cancer appears as the result of pathological tumors connected with the presence of psammoma bodies (6). In our case, most symptoms are presented, including the asymptomatic condition and ambiguous nature of bleedings.\n\nConclusion to the Case\n\nThe possible reason for bleedings and the presence of negative smears can be the development of cervical cancer. It explains why the final diagnosis is NAD with the presence of psammoma bodies. The appearance of psammoma bodies is also a sign of malign neoplasm development negatively affecting glandular cells. Besides, post-coital bleedings can be an actual cause of infection. Therefore, the patient has a false-positive benign endometrial disease that requires further histological analysis.\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Misdrai J, Vaidya A, Tambouret RH, Duska L, Bell DA.

      "Entrepreneurial and Formulated Marketing Essay\n\nEntrepreneurial marketing is defined by Morris et al as:\n\n“The proactive identification and exploitation of opportunities for acquiring and retaining profitable customers through innovative approaches to risk management, resource leveraging and value creation” (5)\n\nWhereas formulated marketing occurs when companies spend monies in financing advertisements in the televisions, salespeople, research in both product and the market, etc. It is applicable in the following circumstances:\n\n 1. Fragile Market Share Trap; this is where the population is price conscious and they buy the cheapest products notwithstanding the quality.\n 2. Low-quality trap; this occurs where consumers assume that the quality of the products is always low.\n 3. Shallow-pockets trap; this is a situation when the population is composed of low-income earners and the competitors are forced to cut prices to ensure that they remain in those markets i.e. there is price discrimination in the market.\n\nEntrepreneurial marketing is advantageous when the market competition and turbulence can be expected to increase. Present trends, such as more technological developments as well as reduced costs for research and development and manufacturing, offer opportunities to new players and aggressive entrepreneurial firms in a dynamic and highly competitive market. Depending on their ability to exploit the new trends, businesses can be expected to grow and increase their profits. It is also faced with certain disadvantages among them; difficulty in creating and formulation entrepreneurial marketing strategies, cost constraints, difficulty to maintain the policies especially when the firm ages (Morris, 13).\n\nFormulated marketing is commonly used by many firms in the modern markets due to the benefits which it holds. Among them; large response on sales, wider market coverage since the price discrimination levels are distinct to the ability to purchase, increase brand recognition, faster mode of conveying information, easy to implement and measure its success. It also consists of a couple of shortcomings ranging from costs incurred, workforce involved in terms of salespeople involved, the misconception of conveyed information to inability to measure the impact of the marketing because only one parameter is used i.e. sales.\n\nEntrepreneurial marketing and formulated marketing if efficiently applied in the right environmental conditions would be very efficient and effective. Thus an applicable marketing strategy should be formulated to ensure marketing success.\n\nWorks cited\n\nMorris, Murray, Schindehutte, Murray. and La Forge, W. “Entrepreneurial Marketing: A Construct for Integrating Emerging Entrepreneurship And Marketing Perspectives.” Journal of Marketing Theory and Practice.

      "Global Business Challenges in Contemporary Times Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Business tactics\n 2. Automobile sector\n 3. Energy sector\n 4. Human resource\n 5. Agriculture\n 6. Bibliography\n 7. Footnotes\n\nThe challenges facing organizations dealing in global business in modern times is no less different than what traders and business communities have been experiencing from time immemorial. On the one side is customer satisfaction and on the other is competition within their peers to win the clients while all the time keeping an eye to profits. Global business started long ago when on foot, horseback and over the waves the traders took the message of one place of the world to another in the form of goods. The items from strange lands and the accompanying tales led to the conquering armies to foray forth and fill up the pages of history. It is the trading community that has led the way 1 .\n\nWith the debut of the industrial revolution the movement did not basically change – it remained the same but things began to move faster covering bigger regions. This led to the technological advanced countries setting up colonies in the East. They took the raw material from these places, fed it into their mills employing their own labour and then shipped it back to the markets of the colonies. With more technological development making its debut with the computer age the world has become a smaller place and business too although retaining its basic character of making profits has changed and the environment is different 2 .\n\nBusiness tactics\n\nHere comes in the issue of global business strategy. It is different from the national one as factors like standardization and adaptation of products comes in. Differentiation of product together with diversification is of relevance in both global and national business strategies. Competition is stiffer both nationally and internationally 3 . The business tactics have surfaced making the domestic firms take on an international complexion – establishing its niche because of the uniqueness of its product while making the standard common across the globe. Due to the immensity of the global market the price of each becomes cheaper thanks to the volume of trade. It is taken for granted that human needs are the same across the world with differences due to geography and climate 4 .\n\nAutomobile sector\n\nTo understand the challenges faced by modern organizations it is best to study the automobile sector in America that has fallen down flat because of opening up of the global market. The manufacturers found it cheaper to have the car produced in developing countries where raw material was plenty and labour cheap. This led to the collapse of the local automobile sector. The government has propped it up but how far that can be sustained only time can tell. China and India are emerging as serious competitors. Even if Cleveland stands up once more the workers will have to climb down from the standards they used to enjoy hitherto raising fears that America will soon become like the developing world 5 .\n\nEnergy sector\n\nThe latest challenge is coming from the energy sector. Although experts are differing over when the oil stock will finally come to an end there is no dispute that oil stock will ultimately end and hence alternative energy will have to be found. Here there is enough scope if investments are made in alternative energy. The country that finds the answers will forge ahead but that will be for a limited time because soon the rest of the world, in these days of easy communication, picks up the tricks of the trade. Thus innovation is the key to the success 6 .\n\nHuman resource\n\nHere comes in the factor of human resources. So far it has not been given due attention. Automation has been introduced with a view to doing away with human help. Yet without the human ultimately the robot will not work. And when there is talk of energy crisis a time is fast coming when the hand pulled cart will leave behind the petrol driven vehicle half way down the road. Human resources have been and still are the greatest source of power to propel business. The manager with a vision will tap into it with aplomb and success. No machine can operate without the human hand and the brain behind it 7 .\n\nAgriculture\n\nAnother field that is fast opening up is agriculture. A time has come when the balance has been upset – there is more land under urban living rather than rural regions. Less land will mean less food and soon this will be the new business zone buzzing with activity. Demand will shoot up as never before. It is the early bird that will get this message and win the race. The concentration will be more on locally produced organic food production.\n\nModern business is coming up more and more with the term ‘real economy’ – referring the land, its produce and the people as against just figures in accounts books. The latter represents the former and nothing more than that 8 . Modern business will have to change its strategy altogether with a new type of global thinking that is pushing back national barriers. It is really becoming a global village and it is those that adapt fast to this reality that success will come.\n\nBibliography\n\nHill, Charles.

      "A Poem Is Not a Puzzle and a Play Is Not a Problem to Be Solved Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nOf the three main genres of literature, namely, poetry, prose and drama, prose is the most common genre the world over. Novels and short stories are far more popular than Plays and poetry anthologies because they are considered very simple and straight forward. The indifference of the people to poetry and plays is mainly because of the attitudes that most people have adopted towards these genres. To most people, a poem is a puzzle that needs unraveling while a play presents a problem to be solved. The fact of the matter is that a poem is not a puzzle neither is a play a problem that requires any solution.\n\nStarting with poetry, this is one genre of literature that is highly avoided by many people the world over because of the feeling that the genre is very complicated. To most people, poetry is like mathematics and it requires superior brains to unravel the puzzle presented in poetry. This is not true, the fact that there is a lot of hidden meaning and covert language does not make poetry a puzzle, neither does it require a superior brain to understand (Polonsky 13). Most of the instability in the world may be as a result of the high levels of poetry malnourishment because poetry is an essential part of life, yet people are constantly running away from it becausethey think it is a puzzle. May be the best way to understand the nature of poetry is by looking at its analogy to football. What makes players like Christiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi, Wayne Rooney and Theo Walcott stand out? It is because of their dazzling strides in the field that bamboozles opponents in a graceful and aesthetic manner which brings satisfaction to the audience. This is why any club would like to possess a player of the caliber of the aforementioned players because of the aesthetics and the dazzle they add to the game. Their game is poetic, gracefully satisfying and imaginative. This is what poetry is; unpredictable arrangements of words in an aesthetic manner that gracefully evokes imagination, leading to higher levels of satisfaction than reading any other form of literature. If the use of aesthetic language in an unpredictable fashion is what people call a puzzle, then the notion that poetry is a puzzle to be solved is misplaced. Clubs that play poetic football full of dazzles, aesthetics and flamboyance attract a lot of following than clubs that play the ordinary flat football and this is what should be transferred to literature for people to be able to appreciate that poetry is only different not because it is a mystery, but because it is only that people have not struggled to understand what is beyond the ordinary.\n\nPoetry is not like the ordinary speech, or ordinary piece of writing. It contains words, arranged rhythmically, sometimes with rhyme and other sound patterns using aesthetic elements of style. This makes it more imaginative than other common literary genres. The key word here is imaginative. For one to appreciate poetry, there must be a lot of imagination. Those who fail to imagine will find poetry as a puzzle but the moment the process of imagination starts, the beauty of poetry creeps. This beauty makes reading a piece of poem as satisfying as watching two world class teams playing play what is called poetic football. The poem “The stone Hammer” by Robert Koetsch, is one of the most beautiful poems. It tells a story using symbols and metaphor and the moment the reader starts the process of imagination, the poem will speak to the reader and it only after it speaks to the reader that the satisfaction of reading the poem will be attained.\n\nClaiming that poetry is a puzzle is like insinuating that anything that is of a higher class is a puzzle. A movie does not become a puzzle just because it is of a higher class than the rest; it becomes more interesting and appealing to the mind and the same case should apply to poetry. This is because poetry is characterized by the use of a higher caliber language though comprehensible, and structured in verse form to express subjects in a way that is imaginative. The change of style and the form of language therefore does not mean that the genre has become a puzzle.\n\nMusic is one of the most popular forms of expressions and many people love music. They love it because it appeals to their imagination in a graceful and satisfying manner and the higher the class of music, the greater the level of satisfaction it guarantees. The questions that arises here is, what is the difference between poetry and music? The difference is very minimal.\n\nJust like music, a poem is rhythmical in a way that impacts to the mind by lifting the moods and the spirits. Just like poetry, music has rhymes, rhyme schemes, sound patterns like alliteration assonance, consonance, onomatopoeia, idiophones that make the composition more aesthetic(McCauley 14). The only main difference is that music has tune and poetry does not. This means that if people are able to derive enjoyment and satisfaction from music, they should also be able to derive the same or almost the same levels of satisfaction from poetry. To enjoy music, that music must engage the imagination of the listener and the same thing should apply to poetry. People find poetry complex because they fail to engage their imaginations as they read them meaning that the unique features of a poem will appear as puzzles to them. There is a lot of poetry in music and if no one has ever claimed that music is a puzzle that needs to be unraveled, then, there should be no such insinuations about poetry.\n\nFor one to be able to enjoy poetry and gain a sense of satisfaction there must be a lot of attention being paid to details. Reading a poem like “Wishes” by Patty L Harjo, an unimaginative person may not be able to get the message in that poem and they will go with a negative attitude that the poem is mathematical. However, if the person is able to engage the imaginations to the poem, they will be able to pay attention to details, ask themselves questions and as they answer that question, the poem will start talking to them. In this way the reader will be able to understand the impact of repetitive phrases like cloudless Ivory sky and blue rainbow. The reader will be able to get the deeper meanings of the wide range of metaphorical expressions used by the poet. The poem ceases to be a puzzle when it talks to the reader, engaging their imagination in a way that they enjoy the dazzles and the beauty presented by the highly developed language of poetry and the poetic features of style (McCauley 14). Just like poetry, plays have been victims of inattention by many literature lovers because of the attitude that plays are problematic. However, this attitude is misplaced because plays are not problems, the change of structure from prose to drama should not pose a problem. The difference between a play and a prose is that in prose, the story of the characters is told out but in drama, the real characters emerge, and present the story through their own actions. The notion that a play is a problem can wither away if people are able to understand the conventions that are used in drama. Lack of understanding of these conventions will present problems as people attempt to understand a play. To be able to appreciate a play, one must be able to understand the setting of the play. The setting is either temporal or spatial. Temporal setting refers to the time in which the play was set while spatial setting refers to the place in which it was set. This is because the setting provides the reader wit background knowledge that will enable the reader to interpret the play. Failure to grasp the background details that are presented by the setting may hamper the understanding of the play meaning that the reader will develop an attitude that all plays are problematic. In the book, Shakespeare and his predecessors, F.S Boas claims that Shakespeare’s plays re considered problematic while in actual fact, they are not. The problem most people find in the plays of William Shakespeare is not the use of archaic language. The problem arises from the context of the plays ( Branch 287). This problem can be easily solved by the understanding of both the spatial and the temporal context of the play. For example, one would mot easily enjoy reading the Merchant of Venice without the background knowledge of the rivalry that existed between the Jews and the venetians during the 15 th century, neither will one appreciate The Enemy of the People by Henrique Ibsen without the understanding of the corrupt society that existed in Norway at the end of the 19 th century (Boas 56). This is why Boas claims that plays will cease being problematic once the context in which they are set is clear. One of the most interesting plays ever written is Act without Words by Samuel Becket, and there are many people that have denied the chance to savor the rich and satisfying episodes of love and betrayal just because they harbor an attitude that plays are problematic.\n\nThe other dramatic convention that is very important in the comprehension of plays is plot. Many people fail to appreciate plays because they lose track of the arrangement of events in the play. John Ciofalo, in his book “The Ascent of genius in court and Academy” claims that the most taxing plot is the non linear plot in plays. The non linear plot is where the events in the play start at the middle or even at the end. The play starts with the resolution part or even the climax and then goes on to explain what had led to the outcomes that have already been presented. It is only when the reader is able to identify the linkages that are there in the plot that plays will become ease to interpret and enjoy (Ciofalo 78).\n\nGenerally, plays are not problematic and they are richer in content and in levels of satisfaction than the prose. The beauty of plays is that the story is presented in the first person, where the reader interacts with the character directly. This brings the reader closer to the happenings in the play making it more affective than reading a story written in third person in the prose. The reader is able to relate with the characters easily because there is no subjective agent between the characters and the reader.\n\nPeople fail to gain the richness that is presented in plays because of harboring attitudes that plays are problematic and they involve finding solutions to problems posed. According to Ibsen, every play will pose a problem but that does not mean that the play has become a problem. When a play presents a problem, it is not the work of the reader to solve the problem, the problem will get solved as the play progresses and the work of the reader is to enjoy as the problem get resolved (Ciofalo 78). This misunderstanding needs to be cleared. Another misconception that has led to the attitude that plays are problems to be solved is the existence of the term problem plays. This term was coined by F.S. Boas; however, it was not meant to imply that plays are problematic, the term is just used to classify plays that had issues of moral dilemma in them and they required the protagonist to make tough choices. These plays include the Shakespeare’s Hamlet, all is well and measure for measure, and a variety of plays by Norwegian playwright, Henrique Ibsen, likes the enemy of the people.\n\nTo say that a poem is a puzzle and a play is a problem to be solved is an attempt to run away from the finest forms of literature due to the failure to go beyond the basics and appreciate the unique features of literature that are inherent in the two genres. The use of unconventional language and elements of style are not enough to complicate a genre of literature. The problem is that people are not eager to move out of the comfort zones created by prose making them to view any other genre that deviates from prose as a puzzle or a problem. This denies them the opportunity to enjoy the richness and diversity that is found in poems and plays. It is only when people move out of the ordinary that they will be able to derive utmost satisfaction from literature because it is these unconventional genres that have a richer heritage.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBoas, Fredrick.

      "American Economic Model and Its Definition Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. American economic model as a success\n 3. Criticisms about the American model\n 4. Remedies to the American meritocracy problems\n 5. Conclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe American economic model is one of the unique things that make America different from the other countries. It offers equal access to opportunity and ascension in economic circles while at the same time ensuring that competition and capitalism thrive. This essay will look into whether the American model is as success, criticisms and the remedy to the problems with the American meritocracy as argued by the author.\n\nAmerican economic model as a success\n\nThe model is a success which many countries are trying to emulate due to the high growth rate which ensures unemployment is kept at low levels. The fast growth, technological advancements and globalization has ensured high profits for American companies. The model has also united Americans and made them appreciate their country despite the challenges that came with the liberalization of the markets.\n\nCriticisms about the American model\n\nAbout three quarters of the Americans are skeptical about their economy owing to the discrepancies between profits and wages. America has been criticized for not taking care of its poor citizens as witnessed in Katrina where families were uprooted from shanty homes. Non Americans treat globalization with suspicion due to its defectiveness. Their argument is reinforced by some factors evident in America. Inequality, immigration and meritocracy have taken centre stage during debate in the American economic model. Inequality has seen the rich become richer while the poor continue being poorer. The America’s rich have started reaping fruits of global markets investments but fail to observe the trickle down effect thus resulting in low pays for employees and huge profits for the billionaires. The low income Americans fear that immigration will lead to plummeting of wages and salaries.\n\nAccording to the writer, the criticisms against the model are unjustified. The writer argues that inequality is not bad if there is an overall benefit to the society, mechanisms of uplifting the poor and opportunity for everyone to empower themselves economically regardless of demographic factors. This dynamism is what makes the American model tickle when compared to other countries. The writer also notes that immigration has not been linked with any economic loss to the poor Americans. However, the criticism may be warranted, to some extent, considering the lopsided education system that favors the rich children. The poor Americans, who form a quarter of the population, contribute only 3% of students in the top brass colleges. This is directly opposite to what happens in European countries where every child has an almost equal chance to make it in life.\n\nRemedies to the American meritocracy problems\n\nThe government should improve the lives of the poor by ensuring the access to quality education through the community colleges and reforms in the system. Embarking on creation of a welfare system that encourages development in all areas, health care and public pension reforms would alleviate the problems. A radical reformist agenda need to be put in place to address these problems once and for all.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe American economic model has spurred growth in economy and globalization thus creating opportunities for American citizens. However, inequality and meritocracy have proved to be its main shortcomings. Unless these problems are addressed, the model will continue receiving criticisms from other countries.\n",
      "Prior Training of Business Essay\n\nTo begin with, it should be stated that the prior training of the children of the current and former workers of the company is not the best solution, which could be ever found for creating the HR concept. Originally, family companies and family departments are the least effective in accordance with the global business practice. Originally, it should be emphasized that this is obviously the root of the existing problem. (Budhwar and Debrah, 2001)\n\nAs for the matters of prior training, which is regarded as the possible solution of the appeared problem, it should be emphasized that the results will depend on the aims and goals of this training strategy, and, surely, the performance of the technique. Nevertheless, the HR strategy of the company should reject the family model of the employment. Surely, dynasties may be encouraged, nevertheless, the creation of the family company was the mistake. In the light of this fact, thorough testing of the family departments should be arranged. (Cooke, 2005) As for the matters of compensating the lack of professionals, these are the tasks of the new HR strategy, which should consider the reasons and the realities of the current HR crisis.\n\nTraining and Performance Management\n\nConsidering the matters of training, there is strong necessity to emphasize that the necessity to perform the training process originates from the employment crisis. The fact is that, if the company experiences lack of the personnel, and the there is no time to employ new workers (or there is no opportunity to attract the necessary personnel), part of the working assignments may be equally reallocated among the current team. (Bjorkman, Fey, Park, 2007)\n\nOriginally, the training system should be closely intervened with the encouragement principles, as the workers should have a stimulus for qualification improvement and taking the additional obligations. The fact is that, such practices are widely accepted, nevertheless, most companies do not have enough opportunities and resources to allocate and delegate all the required assignments. Thus, there is strong necessity to cite Brewster Harris (2004, p. 563) from this perspective:\n\nExcellent human resource best practice models have been available for some time. Two prominent examples are the U.S. People Capability Maturity Model and the British Investors in People. As excellent as these models are, they are not specific to training systems. Our Training Management Maturity Model features an evolutionary approach to achieving best practice. Coupled with an assessment, analysis and reporting tool, training managers are now able to take measured steps in improving the effectiveness of their training system.\n\nAnother factor of the HRM, which should be considered by the company is the appraisal system. (De Kok, Uhlaner and Thurik, 2006) Originally, these systems are adopted on the basis of the solid HR strategy, nevertheless, Future Solutions Company will be able to elaborate this system basing on the aims and objectives of the possible HR strategy. (Teo and Crawford, 2005) Thus, considerations by Kim and Hong (2006, p. 351) should be considered:\n\nImplementing an appraisal system is another way of improving your business performance. It represents a good opportunity to discuss with individual employees their strengths and weaknesses and agree new aims and objectives with them. Businesses commonly carry out appraisals within a few months of a new employee starting or changing role within the business. For established employees, you may decide to use the appraisal system once or twice per year.\n\nIn the light of this fact, it should be emphasized that the necessity to arrange the appraisal system may be ignored, as appraisal without performance is useless, and, in order to arrange proper performance practices the company will have to restructure the entire HR strategy and the principles of performance, employment and qualification improvement through internal training. (Teo, 2000)\n\nSuccession Planning\n\nThe fact is that, in order to achieve success, the solid sequence of the implementations and plans should be presupposed. Originally, some of these aspects were discussed in the previous part. Thus, succession is regarded to be the key for the successful implementation of any strategy. In the light of the fact that Future Solutions requires HR strategy, the main emphasis should be made on the matters of caring, training and encouraging workers. Thus, there will be no necessity to think over the matters of attraction, as new personnel will be attracted automatically. The next point, which should be planned is the elimination of the family structure of the employment. Thus, if difficulties appear within families, the workers should be offered vacations, or offered to change the place of work. Even agreement with other companies may be achieved on the matters of personnel exchange. (Mcgovern, 2005)\n\nFinally, it should be emphasized that the original succession planning with innovative approaches will be the key for the successful restructuring of the HRM principles. In the light of the fact that the company should start from HRM, this department should be entirely restructured first, and new specialists should be employed.

Problems associated with prosecuting hackers\n 4. Measures to deal with cyber crime\n 5. References List\n\nDefinition of Script Kiddies and the threat they pose\n\nScript kiddies is a term mostly used when describing someone who uses software or programs that have been created by others to break into computer systems. These “kiddies” are mostly young people who do not have anything to do but try to gain credit from their friends as being intelligent. The script kiddies are able to access malicious software that can be found easily from the internet thus they can even hack on the highly developed systems and networks. Their work is just to access programs that are readily available in order to use them in hacking and they do not bother to learn how these programs work. Hackers do not like the work of kiddies as they do not do anything to improve the “skill” of hacking. The script kiddies are very patient because though security threats are found, they get repaired easily and also many systems resist these attacks. When a script kiddie is targeting a single system one needs to try many scripts to attack the system before landing on one that will work. (Kayne 2003)\n\nThe script kiddies get into administration databases and are able to cause destruction on the websites which is commonly referred to as “web cracking”. They use hacking tools to gain access to the remote computer systems. This is done by use of programmed software that can scan a computer that is connected to the internet, while trying to locate a potential target. When a vulnerable object is located, other tools are used to break into the identified target. In the case where the target is computer that exists in a private system, then the whole system is under threat. These script kiddies also set up what is commonly refereed to as root kits on the system they intend to attack so that they can access the computers without the owners being aware. Once they have gained access into the system, they will do anything they want in the computers. In this way, they can damage the computers, take personal data such as credit card numbers or even passwords, delete the hard disks information or even analyze the information they find. (Kremen n.d)\n\nThe script kiddies then go ahead and apply Trojans and backdoors when they get into a system. The backdoors help the script kiddies to enter into the system without any problems and at any particular time they choose. The Trojans help the script kiddies not to be detected at all thus he will not appear in any records of the system. The script kiddie manages to be safe and comfortable to perform all the tasks that he wants to do in the system. In most cases, the system administrators search the records for any entries in the late hours of the night thinking that is when they will probably attack the system. The script kiddies do not strike at any particular time or day they can attack at any given time. They scan throughout the world all the time and one cannot be able to know when an attack will happen. (Csonka 2000)\n\nThe script kiddies method of attacking is done quietly thus it will be hard to detect them. They attack a computer that is vulnerable and once inside, they use it to search all over the world for vulnerable computers. These leads to what is referred to as botnet, a large network of computers which can thus develop thousands of targeted computers. They issue instructions to botnets to carry out definite tasks while many people are not aware of what is happening. In this way, these script kiddies can crash huge commercial websites while initiating Distributed Denial of Service commands. A website is flooded with recurring requirements from compromised systems in a botnet thus the server is congested and breaks down. (Kremen n.d)\n\nWhy hacking is not taken seriously in some countries\n\nRussia is known world wide because of generating viruses that face the IT industry with famous viruses such as Bagel, MyDoom and Netsky being developed from there. Hacking is no longer done by school teenagers but has become the work of professionals working together with criminals. They are using computers for creating and developing massive projects systems for fraud and financial scams. Hacking is not taken seriously in many countries including Russia since it is a way of generating income owing to the scarcity of jobs. Many citizens of Russia who have got the skills search the internet on a daily basis in order to locate computer systems from various companies or corporations that are vulnerable and hack them to steal financial data and other information. (Kremen n.d)\n\nThe other problem in Russia, while dealing with hacking issues is the fact that hacking materials like articles and software are readily available in the market without any problems. This is not done in secret but a booming business while in Moscow they even have a hacking school. The majority of people in Russia though highly educated, have no job opportunities thus many of these seek refuge in hacking as a professional. This problem began in 1998 when a financial crisis led many computer programmers to be left without jobs. The country is still facing problems when it comes to job opportunities for bright young science and mathematics students. (Csonka 2000)\n\nThe other problem that makes countries not take hacking seriously is the fact that many people today throughout the world have easy access to the Internet. In Russia, over 11 million have access to the Internet while another 9 million people have their own personal computers. Cyber crimes have increased over the years with most common practices being unauthorised access of computer information, circulation of reproduced programs and gaining access on financial information for companies. Owing to the fact that owning a computer and Internet access is legal in many countries, the governments from respective countries have not set well defined rules on cyber crimes. (Kremen n.d)\n\nProblems associated with prosecuting hackers\n\nIn many countries, hacking is not allowed but the penalties that are placed when one is found to have broken into a system are not sufficient. These laws are just written on paper but their application has not been made practical. The ideology is that, as opposed to serious criminal violent crimes, the issue of breaking into a computer is not something to alarm the society especially the law enforcement agencies since they feel that hackers are not attacking people in the streets. The local investigators thus are not taken serious because the government does not take this issue as a priority. This gives the hackers an opportunity to do their work comfortably without any fear thus posing a threat to many institutions and individual computer systems. In Russia, the law enforcement agencies do not take hacking as a big problem mostly because the hackers target institutions outside the country. (Csonka 2000)\n\nThe other issue is brought about by the fact that declaring that virus writing is criminal by the government does not translate to the fact that they do not investigate where the viruses came from. This is hampered by the fact that tracing these viruses would require them to follow the traffic information through the service providers in the internet world wide. This creates a problem when trying to locate a virus that is found in one country but originated from another country, since countries may not allow others to access traffic information in their own country. This problem becomes much more difficult since the virus creators are using more advanced method to write their programs making it difficult to track them. This occurs in a situation where the developers of a virus in a certain country may launch a virus in another country in order to attack computers from that country. This is a complex process for law agencies to follow in tracking these hackers. (Kremen n.d)\n\nIt also becomes difficult to charge these hackers since in many countries there are no laws that are in place dealing with the issue of cyber crimes. The international law is not well defined when it comes to issues of hacking and computer crimes. This is because there are many conflicting issues when it comes to dealing with matters on how cyber crimes should be handled, whether the offenders should be prosecuted as well as the issue of borders since the internet has no limits in terms of boundaries. (McQuade 2006)\n\nThe main problem when it comes to prosecuting hackers is that government agents or those investigating the crime do not survey well to differentiate a hacker who is just trying out his skills on advanced system from one who is spying to break into the system. The law only states that an individual developing such software in order to steal from companies are criminals. The hacker caught with these programs may therefore claim that he is using it to learn how security systems work. In this way, many of these hackers are not answerable to any laws and thus hacking becomes a problem to stop. (Csonka 2000)\n\nMany countries do not have well defined laws for punishing those caught practicing cyber crimes like hacking. In other countries where these laws are written down, they are very vague and in most cases these hackers go free because the laws have no clear cyber crimes. There are other countries that have a law that forbids use of “hacking tools” thus this law is perceived as general and does not quite define what “hacker tools” means. In this kind of law, institutions or companies would be considered to be committing crimes in case they hire hackers to check for security breaches in their systems. In other situations hackers can be able to create viruses in other countries while they are in another part of the world. In this case to prosecute a hacker in such a situation will be very hard and a complex process. These kinds of crimes will require that law enforcements request other states to send out suspects so that they can go for trial thus such a case would drag on for so many years. In most cases, these people are not prosecuted because there is no evidence to pin them down since investigations that are performed are not thorough. (McQuade 2006)\n\nMeasures to deal with cyber crime\n\nThe measures to curb computer crime include the service providers proposing that laws be put in place that allow for disabling the computers that breach the rights of other computers. Laws are proposed to allow the checking into the problems that occur at international level because the Internet has no boundaries. The government should involve itself in respective countries in checking and monitoring the Internet. The web server in a company should be secured from any unauthorized access. The best way to do this is to secure access from the internet leading to the internal systems of the organization. Once this is done, all content trying to get to the system goes through checks before it is allowed in. (Kremen n.d)\n\nA firewall is the best mechanism to use when trying to avoid invalid data into the network. It helps control hackers entering the network and distributing the confidential information. The work of antivirus is to scan the system but the firewall will keep guard from the outside of the computer system to prevent any exchange of data that may be contaminated from getting inside. The firewall will sort out information and only allow that which is not contaminated into the system. The data is verified and coordinated with specific defining characteristics. In the situation where the characteristics does not coordinate with the data, the firewall will not let that information go through the system. Individuals who are that fast in internet connections have the same security concern that large organization go through. (McQuade 2006)\n\nIn many cases, data that is valid may be holding invalid content in form of computer viruses or programs. This can make it easy for a hacker to enter the system through such software thus attacking the system from inside. Hackers are able to detect internet traffic thus accessing personal information such as passwords without the owners knowing about it. This kind of problem can be solved by encrypting information that is confidential with difficult algorithms so that the hacker will not be able to access the information. (Kremen n.d)\n\nThe use of antivirus also helps to keep malicious files and programs at bay. The antivirus program should be kept up to date and should also be the current version. Trojans are used by hackers to get into the system and manage the files as well as infect the computer by sending spasm and other malicious software. In this case, a good antivirus can be used to detect and delete these viruses before they manage to damage the computer system. The other method to deal with cyber crimes is to ensure that the system logs are always up to date. The system logs should be verified all the time in order to know what the system is doing. Alert massages of programs you did not install into the system may be seen from time to time and therefore it is important to delete such programs because they could be dangerous viruses. (Csonka 2000)\n\nThe operating system should also be kept up to date in order to ensure the computer is secure. When the operating system is secure, it will be hard for any hacker to detect any vulnerability in the system. It is also important to install patches into the system because the hackers access the system through common programs like acrobat reader that have not been updated. Some of these patches are important because they are developed to prevent security breach. Companies should always ensure that they back up important information in case an attack occurs. Companies should always check the computer systems through the internet to access on how it is being utilized. They should avoid the used of unnecessary modems that may compromise the company information.

      "Plastic Surgery of Face Lift and Complications Essay\n\nMany people in the world today undergo elective surgical procedures without thinking of the dangers associated with the surgery. Generally, an ordinary surgery is meant to treat a disease that could be life threatening. On the other hand plastic surgery does not perform this crucial objective but is meant to alter the way a person looks. Like in an ordinary surgery a person is given an analysis of the risks involved before the surgery is performed. Despite this warning, many people still choose to go ahead with plastic surgery. (Alagna 52).\n\nThere are diverse elective cosmetic procedures available in the market today. One of these is face lift popularly known as rhytidectomy. A face lift is a kind of surgery that gives someone a young look. The process entails the taking away of extra physical skin. This is done by making an incision in front of the ear which is then extended to where the hair begins to grow. After the incision has been made, the skin is then separated from the underlying tissues with a blade. (Alagna 59) The underlying tissues are then firmed using stitches. Normally, a surgeon uses his experience to determine the amount of excess skin to remove. Later on, the incisions are stitched and stapled to close them.\n\nFace lifts remove loose skin thus firming the cheeks. Though a face lift is meant to make people regain their youthful looks, it can have some serious side effects. One side effect of a face lift surgery is the failure of wounds left by the incisions to heal. This is brought about by the medical conditions of some patients. High blood pressure or failure of the blood to clot is the cause of such a side effect. People with a smoking history also have problems healing after a surgery. (Papel 1089)Though one does not usually know the after effects of a surgery, it is important for a surgeon to know of the medical history of his patients. They should then advise the patient on the dangers of performing the surgery in their condition. A patient will often then not opt out of the surgery if they are well advised. Some doctors however do not advise their patients well leading to misinformed decisions. Side effects caused by a patient’s medical history should therefore amount to malpractice by the doctor. This warrants for a lawsuit to be filed against the doctor for negligence. (Papel 1098)\n\nThe other major risk is what is commonly referred to as hematoma. This is a situation where blood collects under the skin. This situation is usually brought about by infections that occur after a surgery has been performed. A doctor does not usually have control of the healing process of a patient hence they can not be held accountable for the healing process of any particular patient after the surgery. Overall, there are many side effects of a face lift surgery but most of them vanish with time. (Papel 1110)\n\nLike any surgery, face lift is a potentially dangerous process. A surgeon should give their patient’s enough information for them to make informed decisions. It is also important for the doctors to know the medical history of their patients well to avoid lawsuits that may arise due to neglect. Overall, face lift is a viable process for giving aging people a boost in their self esteem by restoring their youthful looks.\n\nWorks cited\n\nAlagna, Magdalene.

      "“The Illogic of Youth Driving Culture” by Tilleczek Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The research problem\n 3. Study methods\n 4. Study tools\n 5. Study issue\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe article discussed in this paper presents a logical balance between youth and driving. The article under review in this section is titled “ The illogic of youth driving culture ” by K. Tilleczek published in the Journal of Youth Studies in 2004. The objective of the paper was to build and analyze a probable model of driving-related accidents in youths. A wide amount of research approach was used in this article to carry out the research, which was well coded and analyzed statistically to arrive at conclusions. Thus the paper looks into the possibilities and logical transition of youth and driving and indicates the possibilities of fatal results.\n\nThe research problem\n\nThe study identifies the research problem and it develops around the illogic of youth driving culture through various research facilities rather than a single unit mode. Then the research develops in logical consistency following the steps of the research process in a logical manner. These steps are backed by a Literature review is the review and it is logically organized and offers a balanced critical analysis of the literature. However, all of the literature included is of recent origin and revolves within the time frame of 10 years (the oldest being from 1993) and it presents a thorough outline of the problem and the possible solution. The literature is mainly primary sources but there are few secondary sources too. However, the secondary sources are well-reviewed and empirical. It should be noted that most of the 70 references used are scholarly journal articles. However, few books and a website are also used. However, the authors never included literature focused on administration costs and there was no indication where the costs could be found.\n\nIt should be noted that the research question was properly formulated and the methods followed were adequate. This ethnographic study is subjected to the fundamentals of regulations and logic of young drivers mainly in the community of northern Ontario. For this purpose, 88 novice drivers were used for the survey and the result yielded that graduate licensing is an important aspect for these drivers with proper driving educations.\n\nStudy methods\n\nHowever, it should be noted that the methods used during the study were chiefly based upon surveys and self-evaluation techniques. Thus, it can be safely stated that the methods used in the study were predominantly qualitative. A quantitative research method may be defined as the process of collecting numeric data and using that data to show what those, observations reflect. One of the important factors of quantitative research methodology is data collection which is done through various processes such as interviews, questionnaire surveys, tests/measures, and observations as in this case. The quantitative method is widely used for its objectiveness. Quantitative methods are systematic and are based on a positive perspective. Further, quantitative research is replicable as it is possible to collect the same data in another situation or place and get some other outcome that can be compared. But quantitative research methodology has been criticized for its positivism. Further, there is a question of internal and external validity which was thought to be not present in the quantitative method by some psychologists. Additionally, the quantitative method has been criticized for being limited to hypothesis testing. Further, it is also called a simplistic process wherein data related to the research question are gathered which are then analyzed with little concern for the historical background of the situation. This shows that the quantitative method is not a full-proof method for acceptance and logically the author relied more on qualitative methods.\n\nFor the study, the author relied on the more dynamic and suitable studies which are occurring and are still in the process of change. They are useful to understand the reason for the development of the theory from the present understanding or studying prior historical data. But the advantages of the method are that they fail to be objective and are difficult to be replicated. So generalization is difficult in a qualitative research method. Qualitative researches are also known as the constructivist approach refuses positivism. Further, these researches are value bounded and it is very difficult to differentiate between cause and effect.\n\nStudy tools\n\nThe author used different tools for the study. A questionnaire is a way of bringing out the thoughts, beliefs, perceptions, experiences, or viewpoints of some section of individuals. As a data-gathering tool, it could be either structured or unstructured, and in this case, it was both. This questionnaire is most commonly an extremely brief, predetermined assortment of questions created to procure detailed information to correspond to a specific requirement for the research information concerning a relevant subject. The research information is procured from the respondents usually from an associated and correlated interest sphere. There are several advantages as well as disadvantages to the use of questionnaires as a data collection tool.\n\nThe author used this method because the costs and time associated with providing training to interviewers and sending them to an interview site are done away with by the use of questionnaires. Alongside, all responders are provided with the same set of questions written in the precisely same way. Thus, questionnaires are capable of producing more comparable data as compared to the information procured using an interview. Further, the queries are structured properly and the circumstances under which they are responded to be controlled, then the questionnaire is standardized.\n\nStudy issue\n\nIn the context of the study issue, it should be noted that it has been reported by US Road Safety Ltd that since 1st January 2008 there have been about 270,000 road causalities in the US alone amounting to a total cost of millions of dollars. Thus, it is obvious that anybody on the wheel should be more cautious while driving. This is more applicable for young drivers. The best possible element of a young driver is the fact of driving a car or motorbike. This includes the vicinity of the younger generation that is a logical condition for any youth. The freshness of the youth makes a person more energized. This makes young drivers more energetic at the wheel. This energy is reflected in the skill of the driver and but it also adds an element of show off and that is not responsible at any point in time. This ultimately makes the driving more insecure and road dangerous. The total accumulation of traffic thus is influenced by the presence of the youth. The other drivers of the road are hardly aware of the presence of youth on the wheel on road and that lack of consciousness makes them unaware of the reason to drive with extra safety.\n\nSure, it is a very difficult job for a young driver and the worst aspect of this job. To make the situation worse, there are the presences of drivers on the road who possess little or no respect for traffic or road laws. These drivers take on the road with speed limits in mind. They disobey the general traffic rules and are often found driving under the influence of alcohol or other substances. Even if a driver is maintaining all other laws and statutory measures while driving, the number of mobile phone users while driving is quite high. There can be a lapse of concentration due to these facts and can easily result in accidents with fatal consequences. These people should be restrained from using these means and a school bus driver must be aware of such intentional or unintentional threats on road for the safety of the youth.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it should be stated that the report is well written and is quite concise. It is grammatically correct and quite close attention has been given to avoid the use of jargon. In the context of organizing the paper, it can be stated that the report is well formulated and organized and the fundamental plan has been well laid out. The study shows that the researcher is well qualified and holds appropriate knowledge and position in the particular field of the study and thus it can be stated that the issue has been well negotiated throughout the paper. One indication of the study is well organized is the title of the study itself. The title, The illogic of youth driving culture , clearly indicates the approach and the basics of the study. The title can thus be stated as clear, accurate, and unambiguous. Similarly, the abstract offers a clear overview of the study including the research problem, sample. Alongside, the methodology, findings, and recommendations are clear and concise. However, the sample size of 88 participants is quite low. It would have been better if the sample size was over 300 participants to yield a more accurate result.\n\nReferences\n\nTilleczek, K. (2004). The illogic of youth driving culture.

      "Obama’s Tax Relief Plan Analysis Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe above diagram highlights certain important aspects of the Obama’s administration policy of introducing tax cuts and what could be the consequential effect on the domestic economy. In the above diagram, there are large percentage increases, around 8.6 percent falling within the after-tax income for those households with pre-tax income below 10,000 USD. Added to this is the fact that the tax cuts increase for those households whose after-tax income is blew 200, 000. Obama’s proposed tax cut would reduce the after-tax income by 1.5 percent of those making 200-500,000 USD , by 5.6 percent of those making 500-1 million USD, and by 11.3 percent of those making 1 million USD and more.\n\nMain body\n\nWhat came across was the fact that on average Obama cuts the net tax bill by 549 USD. Also, if one was to examine the federal budget plan, what comes across is the fact that Obama would be able to reduce it much more than the proposed plan of McCain. However, what has come across has been criticism from certain democratic quarters regarding these proposed tax cuts as the eventual effect is minimalistic and what has been proposed instead has been investment on sectors which would allow the creation of job opportunities instead of offering these welfare services.\n\nThe Obama plan aims as shown by the above graph, to increase the taxes on the highest-earnings Americans which although represent a small share of the American population, but the tax earnings are quite high. As for the rest of the population, the tax reductions are ranging from the moderate to large ones.\n\nThese reductions were welcomed to a great extent by the population of the American nation as it would provide necessary relief to the consumer in order to purchase the required goods and services, at the same time it would involve loss of valuable government revenue. Therefore, before declaring this proposed tax cut as the answer to the problems of the American nation, it has to be viewed in terms of the government revenue losses which could have been used in order to provide the necessary employment.\n\nThe following graph outlines the proposed tax cut relief plan in detail and it would be analyzed in terms of the effect that it has had on the economy and it’s bearing on the American nation as well.\n\nThe above diagram outlines in detail the proposed tax cut in the economic stimulus plan which has been proposed by Obama. Now if one was to analyze the benefits which could be gained from the proposed tax cut plan would include a number of tax benefits such as the make work pay tax credit, mass transit tax breaks, expanded child tax credit, early release of AMT exemption amounts, 8000 USD first time home buyer tax credit, and the first 2400 USD employment benefits would be free.\n\nThe first tax cut is a method of adding to the workers paychecks over a period of time and those married workers who would have AGI below 150,000 USD would be eligible for a tax credit as well which would allow these consumers the necessary relief to purchase their products and all. The rest of the tax breaks would further alleviate the economic burden of the consumer who is already major economic issues due to unemployment and rising prices. Also, the first time home buyer tax credit would go a long way in aiding those purchases which would have been impossible otherwise considering the present economic situation and scenario.\n\nAnother important provision and part of this proposed plan is the American jobs tax credit which would allow the existing businesses to receive a refundable tax credit of each additional person hired which in fact would allow the companies to hire the necessary personnel at a price which would become profitable for them. Hence, this plan is not only aiding the consumers but from what can be ascertained from the above graph is the relied that would be provided to the employers at a time when the entire American nation is facing serious economic crisis.\n\nConclusion\n\nHence, though this policy is not without its flaws yet it would some necessary assistance to the consumers and the employers as well and it would create a certain amount of economic activity which might not be the scale which was imagined by Obama. The American nation needs more than a simple tax cut to take it out of the present economic crisis but this tax relief would go a small way in alleviating some of the burden if nothing else.\n\nReferences\n\nTax Plans: Some useful graphs (2008) Economists for Obama.

      "JetBlue Company: Information Systems in Business Research Paper\n\nJetBlue used such information systems as the automotive key process (ticket sales and baggage handling), reservation system, system for managing planes, crews, and scheduling. The whole work of the company depended on informational technologies as it is impossible to avoid working in the airplane sphere where all processes are automatized (Laudon & Laudon, 2004).\n\nJetBlue used the one type of plane from one vendor and was dependent only from Microsoft software. These circumstances helped JetBlue’s director to keep small staff and to spend 1.5% on informational technologies that was much lover than his competitors used (5%) (Laudon & Laudon, 2004).\n\nThe problem which appeared was the bad weather. Most of the companies delayed or even canceled the flies, but the managerial staff of the JetBlue Company decided to provide the customers with the services as the canceling of the planes would mean the income looses. The results of such actions were worse. The airplanes stuck and people had to stay there for a long time. The staff, because of its low number, could not cope with all the problems, they had to work much over their time. The shortage of food and drinks made the problem more terrible. The absence of connection between staff complicated the problem decision (Laudon & Laudon, 2004).\n\nJetBlue used different systems and functions in its work, such as sales and marketing (identifying customers, making customers aware of the services and selling these services), finance and accounting (creating financial statements and managing cash accounts) and human resources, which was poorly organized (hiring employees and evaluating employees’ job performance). The usage of the informational technologies helped the company to automate a lot of business processes. Customer Relationship Management Systems was also provided in the company, but they were poor developed and implemented as well as knowledge of management systems (Laudon & Laudon, 2004). When the problem appeared, the JetBlue’s government tried to provide some changes, especially in the collaboration and communication systems, but it was too late.\n\nThe solution to the problem was as follows, the new software was installed, the information was not only delivered but also collected and saved, the staff was trained to the appropriate level, the new bill of rights was created to “enforce standards for customer treatment and airline behavior” (Laudon & Laudon, 2004, p. 47). There are some solutions which the company did not try to provide: the discounts for customers who suffered from the flights delay, the company had to create different departments which could help in organizing the strategies of how to improve the work of the company and to renew the expenses which were during the crisis.\n\nJetBlue is not prepared for the future (even taking into consideration the changes), as the automatization of systems is not on the high level. The Customer Relationship Management Systems do not function properly, which also lead to losing clients in future (Laudon & Laudon, 2004). Not all staff of the company is trained adequately as even in the era of information systems human resources play the greatest role and their assistance in the working process is very important (Kavanagh & Thite, 2008). Considering the director’s strategy it is obvious that he tires to limit the expenses by economizing on important things that may lead to more expenses in future\n\nReference List\n\n 1.

      "Fire Hazards Do Not Take Holidays Essay (Article Review)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Abstract\n 2. Introduction\n 3. Analysis\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Bibliography\n\nAbstract\n\nThis analytical essay presents a critique of the article “Fire Hazards Do Not Take Holidays” and has been published by USA Today. The bibliography page appends five sources in APA format.\n\nIntroduction\n\nNobody knows when a fire would go ablaze. It is something that is least expected by all of us, yet it takes place at hundreds of places every single day, because of which hundreds and thousands of lives are affected. It is necessary for all of us for the sake of our own lives along with our families, neighborhoods to carry out all the prevention methods we can think of in order to ignore ablaze fires.\n\nThe article that has been taken under consideration goes by the name of “Fire hazards do not take holidays”. This article starts off by putting forward the basic summary and an introduction to what the article is all about. As can be gathered it is related to fire hazards that go off during summer camping trips taken by people. As the article says, “This summer, nearly 50,000,000 people eagerly will leave the cares of the office and home behind as they pack cars, trailers, and backpacks to go camping. If you are one of those pursuing fun in the great outdoors, remember that you cannot take a vacation from safety” (Fire hazards do not take holidays, 2005).\n\nThe above quote shows that all of us leaving the cares of our homes and offices, thinking we would only have fun; are not safe. Nothing is much better than being able to go back to nature by simply going camping. When planning your next camping trip you need to be careful about certain things so that you can be more stress-free, and at ease, having the mindset that whatever you are doing is being done the way it should be. Camping is just not complete without having a campfire. But no matter for what reason you are building it, be it cooking, warmness, or just to create the perfect camping environment you need to make sure of certain things first all of which have been listed in this article.\n\nThe risk of having an ablaze fire increases at camping sites, but there are precautionary methods that we can all take up so as to ignore them.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe article that has been taken under consideration basically tells us of all precautions that can be taken up by all campers before leaving for their trip as well as after reaching there. It tells us that precautions such as examining and testing cooking, heating, as well as all other fire-related gear should be checked at home before leaving for the camping grounds and one should ensure that they are in good shape and fix up all the repairs that are needed, following the instructions provided by the manufacturer.\n\nSecondly, the author further states that after reaching the camping site, the most dangerous activity is cooking! The author states that a vast majority of fires take place because cooking areas remain unattended by people at times. There are definitely a vast number of interruptions along with numerous other things that can be done during the trip, but after the time that you have started off your fire, you need to make sure that you stay around it no matter what happens (Seasonal Safety, 2007). Take steps to keep your children and pets away from the fire. No matter if they are simply cuddling up by the heat of the fire, sweltering marshmallows, or simply playing and entertaining them, you need to ascertain that they are constantly under supervision so as to put off any misfortune.\n\nThe author states that “Despite the allure of Mother Nature, do not abandon the outdoor cooking area, either. Moreover, the same considerations of grill safety used at home apply at the campground: Keep the fire, stove, or grill away from overhanging tree branches, tents, and other items such as sleeping gear or drying clothing” (Fire hazards do not take holidays, 2005).\n\nThe third point moved ahead by the author of the article is that another threat presented to the campers at camping sites is the hazardous gas carbon monoxide. The author has states statistics telling the readers that every single year about three hundred deaths and four hundred and fifty injuries take place because of carbon monoxide poisoning. These deaths and injuries are caused by mobile heaters, lanterns, as well as stoves that are placed inside tents, vehicles along with other areas that are confined and for safety precautions, the author states that stoves, candles, etc. should in all circumstances be kept outside the tent or enclosed areas. The use of flashlights and battery-powered lights is preferred.\n\nI have chosen this article because of the fact that it presents in-depth information about fire blazes how they are caused as well as how they can be ignored. The article is brief and to the point which makes it even more readable, providing me with yet another reason to choose this article for my essay.\n\nIt is said that “In 2002, more than 74,000 wildfires burned more than 7.4 million acres in the United States, costing the U.S. Government an all-time high of more than 1.5 billion dollars to fight, control, and extinguish these forest fires. As our population grows and we encroach more and more into undeveloped areas, much of our wildlands, state and national parks are immediately adjacent to these suburban areas, putting homes at very high risk” (Prevent forest fires while camping, 2004). With these statistics in mind, it is our responsibility to make sure that we take every single precautionary step that has been mentioned by the author.\n\nBasically in normal circumstances, all that is needed is one single bad story about a fire that went off at a camping site in order to remind us just how important it is to develop and sustain a well-developed fire safety and precaution program for every single campsite. The property that is present at and is surrounding the campsites is very risky considering that the buildings surrounding such areas are rather old, made up of frame construction which is supposed to be used only seasonally that too in areas that are rather far-flung. This is perhaps the biggest reason that when a fire goes ablaze in a campsite it ends up in complete destruction for the entire area, which makes it even more important for us to make sure that we take every single step to ensure our and others safety (Schirick, 1998).\n\nThe article is related to our course in certain manners as it tells us of basic precautions that we can take to avoid fire outbursts. Though the information provided is extremely basic, it is still rather helpful. The same information has been taught to us in our course and this article was yet another method to understand our course in a much better manner.\n\nThe most important thing to do at any camping site is to take care of all outdoor fires. Make sure that every single fire and coal is burnt out and cold before you leave your camp or go to bed at night inside your tent. In order to put out campfires, you can start off by letting the fire burn down on its own at first. The second step is to make sure that each and every member, coal, and stick is soaked. Make sure that all rocks near your tent are moved away because of the fact that there might be pieces of burning embers present under it. What you have to do next is muddle up and swirl the leftovers with grime and water; adding more and more water and dirt to it while stirring it at the same time.\n\nWhat is more, is that you need to “be sure all burned material has been extinguished and cooled. If you do not have water, use dirt. Mix enough soil or sand with the embers. Continue adding and stirring until all material is cool. Feel all materials with your bare hand. Make sure that no roots are burning. Do not bury your coals—they can smolder and break out into a wildfire!” (Outdoor Fire Safety, 2004).\n\nAll of the information that has been presented in the article can be used in further fire prevention techniques. Unique and innovative techniques and methods can be introduced while bearing these basic methods in mind. The article constantly emphasizes that safety and prevention are extremely necessary in order to have a safe and happy camping trip, which would be safe not only for us but for our families and the people camping near us at the same campsite. The information is very basic but it can be used to come up with further ways and methods to put off fires.\n\nWhat is more, is that in the current times this information is being used by hundreds and thousands of people so as to ensure that their camping trips are safe and this information is also being used by people so as know the to do’s and not to do’s during their camping trips. The information is very basic and easily understandable by any layman, hence giving the article much admiration and credit.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the light of the above discussion, we can hereby culminate that the article that has been taken under consideration for review provides some rather basic information about campfires and the ways that we can take up so as to make our camping trips more fun and safe at the same time.\n\nBibliography\n\nFire Hazards Do Not Take Holidays.

      "Marks & Spencer Company’s Service & Carbon Footprint Essay\n\nStuart Rose, the chief executive of Marks and Spencer, is quite an innovative person. It is a widespread notion that instead of increasing the market share by taking conventional measures he has chalked out a new strategy to win the hearts and minds of the customers. Corporate social responsibility has been incorporated into the strategic vision of the company. Two years back, it was announced by the company high ups that it will spearhead the CSR movement expecting to have a mammoth influence on the wallets of the British shoppers. What was originally intended was called Plan A. It is a symbolization of the personality of the highly magnetic retail boss not to speak of the newest benchmark by which every other corporate social responsibility initiative would be evaluated in the years to come. “Based on our strong heritage (M and S) as a responsible retailer, in January 2007, we launched a series of ambitious plans for the future. Plan A, our five years, 100 points tackle some of the biggest challenges facing our business and our world. In Marks & Spencer we are working with our customers and suppliers to combat climate change, reduce waste, conserve natural resources, business ethics and build a healthier nation” (Jastram, Sarah (2007). “The Link Between Corporate Social Responsibility and Strategic Management”).\n\nThe plan has several separate initiatives to be cemented in the ultimate objectives later on. It is designed to make M&S more and more eco-compatible. It’s a huge plan which if went well would minimize the energy use; make minimal waste to landfills; feed all the raw materials in from the most rejuvenated sources; implement CSR among the providers; assist employees and consumers opting healthier always of life and make the company a leading and pioneering one in the movement of corporate social responsibility. It is the most comprehensive plan undertaken by a giant business company and is more than just a private philosophy of a businessman. It is a strategic decision that deeply affects the decision-making process of the company and has bearings on the fundamental commercial profile of M&S. CSR among providers assist employees and customers opting for a healthier lifestyle and pretty much make Marks & Spencer a company to be reckoned with. “No one had announced a big initiative up until then, and we wanted to be the first, we were the first out of the pack. I’m not crowing, but it’s important. It does, I’m not going to deny, if you get it right, give you a competitive advantage.” (qt. In Strictly Business: Marks & Spencer’s 100-Point Plan A, 2007). All the key points of the plan should be completed by 2012. In the period of five years, it would cost a whopping £200 million versus merely the operational expenditures. This does not take into account the extensive marketing required to make it a real-time success. This program has come at a time when the British retail industry is in recession mode and the stock value of the company has been constantly dropping owing to the worst holiday season. Amore financial concern for the company is the decision of the chief executive that the prices in the store would not soar. Rose is of the firm conviction that they should not move upwards and he challenges anybody to visit the store and see that they are the same. However, despite all this insistence, the bosses of the company have not entirely kept out the option of price hike in case the consumers are willing to take part in the corporate social responsibility realization. M&S is in the end a commercial organization with business interests and its well being is steeped in the shareholder’s equity. Yet, despite the financial pull, the plan remains an integral part and the prime concern within the company.\n\nIt seems that the costs of the plan would make up for all the expectations as is being envisaged by the company. It itself has taken a massive drive to ensure that it succeeds at all costs and no infirmity is kept in its execution. In the current year on the anniversary of the plan, the company issued the report that all was going well and there were massive developments on all fronts. The break up of the plan includes, “climate change, waste, sustainable raw materials, fair partner and health”. These are the five planks on which the building of the plan is based. The tremendous strides, the company has made in climate change speak for itself and is the role model for the other companies in this realm. Several thousand tons of carbon dioxide has been eliminated from the annual emissions which itself is a very big achievement. In UK and Ireland, the company gave the carrier and in the latter place, it charged customers quite a bit to discourage the trend of using bags. The waste associated with them was cut down drastically. The capital gained was invested with a local charity organization that caters to the local environmental initiatives. Another venture on the same lines has been launched in southwest England if gone well would be sprinkled in all of the company’s stores. “An approach for CSR that is becoming more widely accepted is community-based development projects, such as the Shell Foundation’s involvement in the Flower Valley, South Africa. Here they have set up an Early Learning Centre to help educate the community’s children, as well as develop new skills for the adults. Marks and Spencer are also active in this community through the building of a trade network with the community – guaranteeing regular fair-trade purchases” (Maignan, I.; O. Ferrell, G. Tomas (1999). “Corporate Citizenship: Cultural Antecedents and Business Benefits”).\n\nBeing an eco-friendly and responsible business company in the international arena, M&S is acclaimed for practising appropriate ethical practices. Many bodies who are concerned with corporate social responsibility have hailed the measures undertaken by this big business company. It has taken some other measures which are by no means a simple one. “In 2006 the Look behind the label marketing campaign was introduced, the aim of this campaign was to highlight to customers, the various ethical and environmentally friendly aspects, of the production and sourcing methods engaged in by M&S including fairtrade products, sustainable fishing and environmentally friendly textile dyes” (Paddingtonwaterside, 2006, Marks And Spencer Launches New Label). Eco stores are being built on a trial basis to gauge the sustainability of the program. The company is persistently endeavouring to make a “Sustainable Construction Manual” on the basis of the data gained from this experience. The plan also covers buying fair trade cotton and a big share of UK fruit crops. The plan has additional features of being dynamic and adaptable. When it is realized that something is not working well it adjusts itself against the changing situations but the pace to meet the targets remains unaffected. The company earlier thought of exploiting bio-fuels but quickly learnt that would yield loss of habitats along with other problems. Consequently, the company has given up this option until sustainable sources are found. These accomplishments are impressive and the list given here is by no means a very exhaustive one. For the purpose of achieving the targets the company has borne sacrifices and has tightened the needs for getting a company car. These initiatives have reduced the number of the auto fleet. When fitted against the other attainable targets, this one should have been detached out of the spotlight. What seems to be a milestone is that every realm of the M&S business is heading to be more in line with the green vision. However, for a company as big as this one the small two partners enrolled on the website tend to hesitate to go along with it. The company is sending lavishly to make the plan successful while others keep the meaningful silence. What is the fate when one changes the business profile so drastically, it would be seen in the perspective of the bottom line of the giant company? “We consider corporate social responsibility and corporate governance as mutually reinforcing concepts and such draw attention to the potential impact of a change in investors’ attitude towards CSR and the need for innovation in the area of financial modelling to incorporate CSR” (André Habisch,2005, Corporate social responsibility across Europe).\n\nThe plan is not without certain shortcomings or hindrances which are instrumental in choking the successful path of the plan. The two most ambitious targets of the plan which the chief executive would like to see meeting targets are to save the earth and recuperate the potential of the company to generate more and more capital. Both need British shoppers to be commensurate with the whole thing. Save the planet part of the plan tagged all products to communicate with the customers to tell whether the article was consigned by air. The consumer then determines to purchase it or not. The chief executive expects that they do not but it is not ready to reduce all non-refrigerated articles from the store. At this juncture, it is going to be an injury in ones’ own feet and that is unbearable too. On the other front of making more money, customers have to determine with integrity that they cater to the environment by avoiding buying things in other stores for discounted clothes. Marks and Spencer are comparatively expensive than Tesco and H&M. though the company stresses that there would be no price hike, the customers are being pressurized to pay more for the eco-friendly measures undertaken by the company and it has a shared advantage with the consumers. It is the Achilles heel of the plan—a potential scare for its ensured success.\n\nOne thing that should be properly weighed is British loyalty to the established UK franchise names. The company maintains that it has successfully persuaded its customers to conserve energy by washing laundry at 30 degrees Celsius instead of 40 or more. It is more than intended by the original plan. The company has also been going well in the case of carbon calculator which is a website designed to invite customers to look at the survey for evaluation of their personal carbon footprint. Things are not optimistic on the financial front. The first five months of the plan have witnessed growth; however, since then there has been a rapid fall. “I think if you were to look at just about any British retailer, you would see its stock going down. It’s a tough regional environment, along the lines of what you’re seeing in the U.S. That’s fairly heavily indebted consumers who are kind of tapped out, and the economy is slowing down so retailers are taking a hit” (Marx weber, 2008, CSR). The company itself has realized that the consumer outlook in 2008 may be absurd. It has also been floated that though the plan has been a very heavy drain yet the financial woes of the company do not spring from it. The stock prices that have gone down have no link whatsoever with the plan. It is very impressive that the company does not care for any downfall and is totally committed to the absolute execution of the program at all costs. Amidst the gloomy financial scenario, it is a great sacrifice on behalf of the company. It is a living beacon for others to emulate. “As a simple device to enable busy people to visualize quickly what practical issues are covered by the responsible business agenda, the approach of the food technology division of Marks and Spencer is hard to beat” (David Grayson, Adrian Hodges 2004,63).\n\nThe end goals of the company in future are quite huge. For example, some stores and companies carbon label their products. It shows that the amount of co2 emitted in preparation for the product. M&S is in no mood to do that. The company is thinking of ways and means to search for the appropriateness of the development of a national plan for the carbon labelling of the products. It gives an insight into the ultimate end of the company, it does not just want to improve the prospects of the company but it also wants to see the entire country changed. “M&S has the philosophy of ‘helping others to help themselves” (Article13, 2005, CSR Case Studies). The company knows that it would take extraordinary efforts to meet the targets of such an initiative yet it maintains its determination to undertake things of this magnitude.\n\nThe chief executives long to defy nature. He also wants to invest money in the programs planned for increasing the tenure of the growing season in the country’s agriculture and in turn tightening the emissions of transporting from overseas. “We’ve completed work with the Carbon Trust to develop a unique carbon footprint of our entire food business, covering all the food we sell. This reveals that Marks & Spencer’s 4.3% share of the UK food market generates around 3.3mt of C02e during the production of raw materials, manufacturing, transport, sale, use and final disposal of the food we sell. We’re currently developing tactics and targets to reduce this ‘food footprint” (Marks &Spnecer, 2007, See How Much Progress. We Have Made On Plan A). This would greatly help in putting pressure on the emission of co2 abroad. This would also serve to witness declining revenues in the foreign coffers which have raised alarm bells in their circles. However, for the chief executive of the company, it is very significant to cut drastically the carbon emissions and the world must undertake concerted efforts in this regard. On his part, he has given the lesson on how to begin and the modality offered by him is a sure way to meet the targets. Will Mr Rose come up with flying colours and be able to beat past his competitors in the retail industry. Unfortunately, it is very early to gauge the true indicator of the situation. What endows plan with the unparalleled features is that M&S is not the market leader as far as market volume is concerned. She is already being knocked out by its heavy rivals. Despite this hard adamant fact, the company attaches high priority to its corporate social reasonability by spending considerable money which otherwise could have been spent on the business side. Even more noticeable is the fact that the expenditures are not meant for advertisements only. Marks & Spencer is going this way because its boss has dictated it so and it is a means to an end—a wider end, that is to gain some edge in the market. The plan envisions entire Britain to be eco friendly and by taking such measures as would involve all the consumers to be on board, the company needs to be met with applause. It would serve Britain and also manoeuvre it as one of the pioneering companies of the country to be taken pride in. We owe to the model put forward by it and pray for its success as it seems to be a great effort for the mutual benefit of consumers and producers and caters not only Great Britain but also to the world at large.\n\nReferences\n\nMarks &Spnecer, 2007, See How Much Progress.We Have Made On Plan A. 2008.

      "Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s Criticisms of the Nineteenth-Century Gender Order Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Thesis\n 3. Main body\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nElizabeth Cady Stanton was one of the leading feminists who fought for equal rights and liberation for women. Elizabeth Cady Stanton’s life was characterized by controversy. From the unusual academic and athletic achievements of her adolescence to her demand for female suffrage in 1848 to her declaration of a feminist ideology of independence to agitation for radical social change, to attack the Bible, her actions and attitudes provoked debate and dissension. Her politics, prejudices, rhetoric, associates, and attire-raising practices alarmed many.\n\nThesis\n\nIn spite of the controversy of Stanton’s ideas and values, she had made a great contribution to women’s rights wonderment figuring for equal opportunities between men and women and gender equality.\n\nMain body\n\nIn the late 1890s and the early 1800s, women obtained a low social position and were deprived of their rights. The culture of the era was marked by a radical, multifaceted social reform movement steeped in the tradition of Christian evangelism. In the name of the perfectibility of man and the coming of the golden age, there was an upsurge in resolve to change life-to abolish slavery, the family, and marriage. Stanton’s supposed that women’s suffrage should be based on “wealth, education, and refinement” (Stanton 23). She supposed that black men and immigrants should be excluded from this amendment. Stanton called it ‘educated suffrage” which meant that educated and literate men and women should receive a right to vote.\n\nHer behavior outraged the socially conservative element of the population. Eventually, it offended her liberal allies as well, including her husband and her successors in the suffrage movement. Although she appeared to be a respectable woman, Stanton was accurately perceived to be a revolutionary—not a suitable role for a nineteenth-century woman. Having a revolutionary as an ally was a source of embarrassment to Stanton’s colleagues. Stanton’s angry opposition to a reconstruction program that enfranchised black men but excluded black and white women created a conflict in the ranks of suffragists. It resulted in the creation of rival organizations, the National and the American Woman Suffrage associations. The National Association, founded by Stanton, had a broad platform that addressed other women’s issues in addition to demanding a constitutional amendment to enfranchise women (DuBois and Dumenil 33).\n\nSuffragists feared that Stanton’s radical feminism and religious heresy would damn their chances for success. This first phase in the long march toward liberation corresponded to a struggle for social and then political rights in an era when traditional values were being questioned. In the America of Andrew Jackson, the mood was one of social reform and utopian aspirations toward change in the areas of religion and family, and with regard to what Stanton and other abolitionist writers of the time called the “peculiar institution” (Stanton 38) of slavery. For many women who joined the various reform societies, the search for an identity and a status in their own right set them imperceptibly on the road to independence, even before they formed their own movement in 1848. In a letter written from Seneca Falls and dated 20 June 1853, Stanton counseled her humorously, “Susan, I do beg of you…to waste no powder on the Woman’s State Temperance Society. We have other and bigger fish to fry.” (Stanton 52). Stanton was one of many activists, who believed in women’s moral superiority and fueled demands for an independent movement (Buhle et al 82).\n\nWith characteristic audacity, Stanton proposed a call for women’s right to vote, the only one of twelve resolutions not to be unanimously adopted. It was Stanton who stood up before the 300 people crowded into the small Seneca Falls chapel to read this historic text, which covered the full extent of women’s subordination in the United States and detailed discrimination in the workplace, at school, in the family, in citizenship, and in religion: it was an act of accusation and provided a carefully considered catalog of demands. (Buhle et al 89). Stanton believed in the need for reforms to ensure profound changes in women’s position in the family and the working world, and in sexuality, became more and more remote.\n\nEarly feminism in the United States had been forged in a distinctly American cultural and historical context, but the movement was to undergo outside influences as the waves of immigration increased at the end of the 19th century. Stanton thus thought the moment had come to introduce the question at the tenth national convention of the women’s rights movement in New York in May 1860. However, the ensuing debates on divorce brought to light the profound ideological disagreements that existed within the movement before it was to split. But her position became marginalized in the new association, which disagreed with most of her opinions-the importance of the vote as a means to exert political pressure, “educated suffrage, ” the liberalization of divorce laws, and, finally, her analysis of the role of religion and the Scriptures in the oppression of women, as presented in The Woman’s Bible (1898). During these years, advocates of women’s suffrage placed particular emphasis on the civilizing mission of women, an argument that had served them in the 1820s and 1830s to clear away into the public arena (Buhle et al 72).\n\nAt the beginning of the 21 century, women experience discrimination and social inequality in many spheres of life including wage differences and Title IX. The dilemma of inequality in employment is one of the most imperative issues these days. The society in which we live has been created historically by males. Sexual discrimination can also be indirect. Indirect discrimination happens if requirements are the same for everyone but have unfair effects on certain people due to their gender, marital status, or pregnancy. So as to inspect this state of affairs one must make an effort to get to the root of the problem and have got to recognize the sociological factors that cause women to have a much more hard time getting similar benefits, wages, as well as job opportunities as their male counterparts (Buhle et al 122).\n\nTitle IX stipulates that all persons despite their gender have equal access to education programs. Thus, many young women now claim that they have fewer opportunities to succeed at their work because of poor education and programs studied at colleges and Universities. Men usually are perceived as career orientated in contrast to women. Men are more readily supported by colleges and Universities than women. In spite of equal rights opportunities and affirmative action policies, women occupy lower-paid jobs in contrast to men. As a whole, the disparity between the expected behaviors of women and the appropriate professional behaviors makes it extremely difficult for most women to prove to their male peers and supervisors they have “what it takes” to be leaders (Buhle et al 122).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn spite of controversial ideas and beliefs, Stanton supported the women’s rights movement and raised women’s consciousness and self-determination. Education unquestionably played a key role throughout the century in women’s drive for their “elevation” and emancipation. Stanton called for women to leave the confinement of the home and to make their voices heard in the political and social spheres.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBuhle, Mari Jo, and Paul Buhle, editors, A Concise History of Woman Suffrage: Selections from the Classic Work of Stanton, Anthony, Gage, and Harper , Urbana: University of Illinois Press, 1978.\n\nDuBois, E.C., Dumenil, L.

      "Painting as the Second of the Classical Art Forms Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nVarious forms of art have been prevalent in all stages of civilization throughout the world they have all undergone constant and continuous changes with the passage of time. One can trace the origin of art in rock paintings and engravings in the ancient caves. The nomads used these caves as their dwelling place and tried to express their thoughts and ideas through the medium of painting and carving. The abstract ideas were expressed graphically long before the introduction of writing.\n\nThese paintings and carvings undertake the social, spiritual, and ritual meaning of their life. Moreover, it unveils the development of human consciousness and cultural aspects, and it helps us to have a glance at the rich beliefs of our ancestors and it reflects the social order of that age. Here, the paper tries to discuss the evolution of painting and sculpture as important forms of Art, and the reason behind the consideration of painting as the second most classic form of art behind the sculpture.\n\nThrough generations of humanity, Art had changed its face, and the importance given to various art forms varied because of the cultural difference among different societies. Painting and Sculpture are the two important forms of Art and from the origin and evolution onwards, there was a competition between both art forms. As painting is considered as the imitation of reality, and sculpture as presenting credible perfection in an artificially excessive nature, there is a high chance for conflict and competition. As both Painting and Sculpture are two forms of Art, the Artist possesses the freedom to choose the form of expression to express his views and ideas.\n\nEarlier, the painters were employed as skilled artisans and their creativity was not considered. From the 13 th century onwards, the Italian painters used the sculptures as the source for their paintings. As it was ‘still’, it was easier to use sculpture as a model. The three-dimensional form and the light and shade on the sculpture helped the painters to finish their work into a more realistic form. After the Renaissance in Europe, important painters claimed social status, and they were no more considered as merely skilled artisans, but as scholars and courtiers.\n\nMoreover, there occurred an intense relationship between the painters and their patrons who were ready to help and protect them. Later, in the 19 th century, the social status of painters in western societies began to decline.\n\nThe painters became more independent and they began to conduct exhibitions of their own paintings with entrance fees. By this, world-renowned works of painters were able to reach the masses through exhibitions and art galleries. The painters invented their own visual language and some others tried to do experimental works. So as to defend the sculpture, the painters even tried to imitate the sculpture by superimposing three-dimensional abstract images. This helped the development of painting as an art form.\n\nIn the late 19 th century, the palette, i.e. the art of painting became rich in style and subject matters and it gave importance to patriotic sentimentality. This boosted the formation of new groups and art schools at the beginning of the next century. In the 20 th century, the artists challenged the conventional mode of expression with new forms of expression and new ideas. The prominent artists of the time were Pablo Picasso and George Braque, who were the exponents of cubism. They expressed their views through fractured forms and space into shifting planes. But the painters of another school called surrealism exploited the internal worlds of the imagination and unconscious.\n\nThe origin and development of sculpture are not much different from painting. In the first phase of development, sculpture as a form of art was unable to defend painting and the hotspots of this art form were two European cities, Vienna and Munich. Then the growth in architecture due to the renaissance invited more and more artists to decorate new buildings with figures. The new trend of decorative sculpture and erecting memorials in public places became general in the 19 th century.\n\nMoreover, the tendency of the people to commemorate their poets, national heroes, and eminent statesmen lead to the erection of their sculptures in public places and it helped the growth of sculpture as an art form. Alajos Strobl (1856-1926), is noted for his authentic nature in openness and convincing works. One of his works is ‘Matthias Fountain’ (1902), with that of the groups of other figures as if a waxworks shown on the huge wall of Buda Castle in Europe.\n\nAgain, the sculpture in the Romantic age revolted against the coldness of classicism. At any age, any piece of art, whether it is painting or sculpture, was intended to satisfy the viewers with its quality of perfection. But at the time of the renaissance, there emerged a question: whether the sculpture was inferior, equal, or superior to painting. At the same age, the sculptor was considered as an artisan who does hard labor especially breaking stones and rocks.\n\nBut the social status of the painter was high and similar to a humanist scholar. The painting possesses a magic touch, to lead the viewer to the threshold of satisfaction and individual interpretation. Here, Frederick A. Praeger points out the importance and significance of painting through his own words: “To those who look at a picture, furthermore, it serves as a bridge that leads them to the work of art. But if the beholder goes no farther and imagines that it is enough to be absorbed in the ‘subject’ alone, he has merely entered the forecourt of art’s temple. We need not be artists to be able to portray an object with pencil or brush; anybody can do that more or less adequately.\n\nArt begins only when we can perceive the realm of pure form beyond the outward manifestation, and only those who pay as much attention to the interpretation as to the object portrayed will truly understand a work of art.” (Praeger, 1958, p. 8). The piece of art must be that much powerful, i.e., it must be able to move the mind of the viewer. The abstract idea of the artist is transformed to the concrete form and the people who view the art form possess the right of free interpretation.\n\nAgain, at the time of the renaissance, the sculptors were ready to accept the arguments against them and accepted some of the modes of expression that are used by the painters of that age. This was the time when there was a give and take policy between painting and sculpture. But in the 70s, it showed the tendency of more and more women becoming painters and challenging the male domination in painting. But deconstructing and institutional structures artificially supported the male domination. Again pointing to sculpture, it is undergoing criticism as it is the mere imitation of old classic works whereas painting is considered as highly associated with emotion and it is the art of illusion and imagination. One of the merits of the painting is that it can express movement, variety, and light.\n\nGoing through the evolution and development of painting and sculpture through the ages, one can see that the importance given to these art forms varied in different cultures and societies. For example, in ancient times, both these art forms were considered as equal. Both the Painting and Sculpture symbolize either the cultural or historical significance of humanity; and behind the color and craftsmanship, one can trace the rich history, culture, lifestyle, and tradition of the older days. At the time of the renaissance, the sculpture captured attention because it was the age of the development of architecture.\n\nBut in the late 19 th and the beginning of the 20 th century, there emerged new schools and forms of painting and it captured much attention. One of the reasons for the importance rendered to sculpture is the social movement in Europe in the latter half of the 19th century, which was due to the impact of industrialization on society. The withdrawal of romanticism declined the creative aspects of the artists and the priority was shifted from handmade crafts to machine-made goods.\n\nBoth the art forms signify the development of culture and society. On one side, the painters used the sculpture as the model for their paintings and on the other side, some artists used painting to establish their art form of sculpturing. Moreover, there was a give-and-take relation between painting and sculpture. The age of the renaissance helped to raise the status of the painters. But the industrialization reduced the importance of painting because the priority was gradually shifted from handmade crafts to machine-made goods. By concluding, one can say that by shifting painting to the second place behind the sculpture, its importance as a form of art can never be undermined or underestimated.\n\nReferences\n\nPraeger, Frederick A.

      "Fire Service: Boston Leather Radio Strap Proposal Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Abstract\n 2. Why Boston Leather Radio Strap\n 3. About the Boston Leather Radio Strap\n 4. Disadvantages of the device\n 5. Conclusions and Recommendations\n 6. References\n\nAbstract\n\nFire fighter and other rescue personnel who have to use the radio harness to hold their radio often face a problem when the belt holding the radio and the mic starts swaying away from the body. This can create further problems as the personnel would be forced to use one of their hands to restrain the radio and it creates an issue of personnel safety. The Boston Leather Radio Strap is designed to hold the radio close to the body and save the personnel from such issues. This paper analysis the device to understand its benefits. The conclusion offered is that in spite of the higher acquisition costs, the Boston Leather Radio Strap should be recommended for use.\n\nWhy Boston Leather Radio Strap\n\nAccording to a report by Associated Press (October 08, 2007), some 15 firefighters have died in the last year because some of the safety devices they used did not function properly. Also included in the report is the problem faced by firefighters when they are climbing ladders or dragging fire hoses into burning, smoke filled buildings. One of the main support systems in such events is communication with team members through radio. Firefighters have only two hands that they must use to hold the fire fighting equipment. While fighting fires and when the operator is not standing straight, the radio strap tend to sway this way and that and firefighters have to reach out with one hand to pull the radio close so that they can speak. When this is happening, one of their hands is otherwise engaged and there is a severe possibility that the operator would get injured while fighting the fire and risk his life. There is also the possibility that the swaying radio strap along with the radio may get entangled and trap the firefighter. In such cases, there is an urgent need to ensure that the firefighter is free from these problems. The Boston Leather Radio Strap helps to prevent the sway of the radio strap away from the body.\n\nAbout the Boston Leather Radio Strap\n\nThe Boston Leather Radio Strap (Boston Leather, 2008) is a device that holds is the safety device that mates to a radio holder with rust free scissor snaps for easy removal. The radio holder device has to be purchased separately. The strap is available in heavy-duty leather of 1 1/4″ width and it is provided with a reflective backing for extra safety. The buckle locking is positive and allows clamping and removal easily. Shown below is an image of how the device appears.\n\nFigure 1. Boston Leather Radio Strap (Boston Leather, 2008)\n\nThere is another unit called the anti-sway strap that actually fits to the gear and stops the radio from swaying and swinging around. An image of the device is as shown below.\n\nFigure 2. Boston Leather Anti-Sway Strap (Boston Leather, 2008)\n\nThe length of the strap can be adjustable and for taller fire fighting personnel who are more than 6’1”, the item is manufactured in extra large size. The speaker microphone is attached to a leather loop so that it can be accessed easily. The strap can be fitted in over any of the shoulders. The buckles, hooks and eye bolts are made of high temperature resisting Nickel. The devices are lightweight and weigh less than 1 pound.\n\nSurvey of preferences for the belt.\n\nA poll was done to assess the user acceptance of the device and among 100 fire fighting personnel. The personnel was asked for reasons as to why they would like to use the device. Among the 100 people polled, 67 people said that they liked the device while 20 said that they did not like the device. 13 people said that they had no comments about the device or that they did not care. The results of the survey are shown in the following graph.\n\nFigure 3. Survey Results of preferences\n\nAs seen in the above figure, 67% of the respondents have agreed that the device is useful and would be ready to accept them. Among the reasons for liking, the respondents have suggested:\n\n  * Ease of caring for product\n  * Holds radio microphone in place\n  * Slides easily over turnout gear\n  * Keeps radio knobs reachable\n  * Keeps radios from falling on the floor\n\nDisadvantages of the device\n\nIt is reported that the device costs between 40 to 50 USD and there is also an adjustment period that some of the people did not like.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nThe discussions in the paper have shown that the Boston Leather Radio Strap has many advantages as it can save personnel from injury and protect the radio from being damaged. There are also some benefits such as Ease of caring for product; Holds radio microphone in place; Slides easily over turnout gear; Keeps radio knobs reachable and Keeps radios from falling on the floor. The only issues is the cost of the strap that is about 40 – 50 USD. A survey showed that 67% of personnel liked the product while only 20% did not find it acceptable.\n\nConsidering the life and safety of the fire fighter that is irreplaceable and the cost of the radio that costs much more than the 40-50 USD of the strap, it is recommended that the Boston Leather Radio Strap be purchased and can become a part of the regular attire of the firefighter.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Public Relations and Their Functions Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nAny esteemed organization should aim at having managerial, technical, and logistical effective systems, and to make this happen and to have it realized sustainably, a good fostered public image is needed. It is always clear that the good public image of an organization is always related to the well-formulated and exemplified organization’s Vision, missions, objectives, and strategies. Hence it comes out clear that the enhancement of good public relations in the organization counts a lot in the development of the organization’s public image. The general importance of public relations can be placed into the category of societal and organizational. Among the many challenges that face any thriving organization is the association of the organization with the public or with the media.\n\nIn any given well-established organization the public relations is well integrated into its management systems. It is so an important aspect that all the people in a given organization who come into close association with customers or the general public should practice good public relations principles when undertaking their duties. Some of the basic types of widely practiced public relations include consumer relationships, societal or community relations, media relations, publicity relations, industrial relations, and governmental relations. Each one of the above-stated outlets of public relations plays its distinctive role. In mentioning, an example of organizational public relations functions includes; keeping the general public and the stakeholders of the organization aware of every advancement or failure in the organization. On the other hand examples of the societal public relations functions include an organization’s social responsibility and organization’s publicity. The domain function of societal public relations is to sustain a well-natured consistent relationship with all the organization’s systems (Daniel, 2004).\n\nMedia and organization relationship\n\nA well-established organization should always be sensitive to its receiving clients or the public and should try to improve the relationship with the society to attain an enabling environment to enable the organization to expand. Media relations between the organization and the society stand out to be one of the major organizational functions of the public relations processes of an organization. The mass media is a credible entity of corporate management in many organizations in the world. One of the common scenarios with organizations is the characteristic of any organization trying to influence the general public hence the public relations initiatives help the organization to develop a good understanding of the organization and the kind of product they offer the society (James,1998).\n\nThe way the organization repackages its information to reach society should be considered with caution to be sensitive to the interest and other factors which might be compromised by improperly packaged media information. Mostly the media comprises the use of print and electronic media. The most organization does not have control over the information that is disseminated in the media especially with the most adverts portrayed in the media and hence the kind of message to be disseminated to the public is therefore left in the hands of the advert presenters and reporters.\n\nHence in the cycle of good public relations practices and functionality, the above-mentioned aspect of the organization’s messages or information being left at the mercies of the advertisers and reporters tends to compromise the good relationship that an organization might wish to continue fostering into the public since the information advertised by the media agencies on behalf of the organization might consist of some levels of either untrue information, Unfiltered or culturally insensitive messages which might tarnish the name of the esteemed organization.\n\nWhen we take an example of a hotel business, it might be that a certain hotel is giving out a promotional package aimed at enhancing its public image in both external and internal spheres. The hotel might be doing these promotions in the form of giving out discounts on the products they are selling. When critically observed from the organization’s point of view the kind of incentives they are giving to their customers are aimed at enhancing the sales. When the hotel is doing such a promotion it should repackage the promotion well and it should be coupled with good public relations features.\n\nEnhances Productivity among Workers\n\nGood public relations, makes the employees of an organization feel as if they are part of the organization. These workers play an important role within a given organization and hence the management can make the workers feel motivated by just enhancing the public relationship between the management and the workers. Side by side with that the organization should make sure that it takes all its senior and junior management team for refresher bonding and public relations training sessions to sustain the management to staff relationship in the organization. It has been observed that if the management practices good public relations with its staff the staff will be productive and also extend good public relations to the public on behalf of the organization. Organizations can then easily organize fully staff team participatory events without the doubt of the bad outcome. A worker’s relation is very important in that it helps organizations to sustain a lively line of communication to make its workers interested in new ideas and to share the vision and mission of the organization equally with the management.\n\nEnhancement of Social Responsibility\n\nGood public relations practices and Social responsibilities account for some of the flourishing transition of collective expectations and depend mostly on how the organization addresses and responds to moral conduct. The enhancement of an organization’s social responsibility strictly has more to do with how well that particular organization relates to the beneficiaries or the public. Hence the way an organization conducts itself in its immediate surroundings will work towards its acceptability or bad reception by the general public. Hence the kind of relationships a given organization displays to its surroundings is a clear determining factor of the organization’s ethical procedures (Harris, 1998).\n\nResolving Some of the Organizational Malpractices of Public Relations\n\nApart from the already mentioned above the need of every visionary organization involving all its staff and management in public relations training forums and refresher courses the organization should instill working ethics and proper standards without compromising on the welfare of the workers and the receptive society. Management ethics are the key elements in an organization’s governance and coordination. It is also important that every organization or company make informed public relations and ethical policies and direct the workers to follow and abide by them.\n\nConclusion\n\nPublic relations principles are very important and applicable in a vast array of activities that have both direct and indirect impacts on the organization on different levels. Numerous details could be mention above exhaustively but they rotate around the already mentioned facets of societal or organizational public relations functions. All the organizational and societal public relations function seems to interrelate well between each other in a properly functioning organization. In all the cases when a given organization needs to share out information or messages to either its employees or the general public the organizational and societal public relations functionality will come into play and they will influence the way that given information is disseminated. Hence the organizational and societal public relations functions overlap each other significantly.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris, B.

      "The Concept of Transnational Public Policy Essay\n\nInternational arbitration is increasingly being accepted by the international business community as an efficient and flexible method of dispute resolution. The increased use of arbitration has led to the publication of awards and the evolution of a considerable body of juridical writing on the subject. The publication of awards would contribute to the systematic elaboration of rules governing choice of law in international commercial arbitrations.\n\nJuridical writings, which are often cited in arbitral awards, would also play a useful role in this regard. The majority of the critics admit that the essential elements of international arbitration are thus its consensual and binding nature, and the active role played by the participants in choosing the arbitrators and determining the procedure for resolving their disputes. However, the role of national law in international arbitrations is noteworthy, the scope of national law interventions in international arbitrations is continuously being circumscribed and streamlined.\n\nDuring the early stages of the twentieth century, when international commercial arbitration was still in its infancy, the regulation of international arbitration was essentially left to national jurisdictions. With the development of better means of transportation and communication and the attendant increase in the volume of international trade and commerce, the practice of arbitration was increasingly embraced in international trade.\n\nIn no time it became obvious that domestically cultivated laws of arbitration–which mostly reflected attitude and policy amenable to the needs of the domestic community–were ill-suited for the regulation of international arbitration. This realization argued the need for the development of effective international regimes that would not only unify the law relating to international arbitration but also formulate rules that are appropriate in an international arena. The arbitrations that fell outside the convention were subject to the procedural rules of the place of arbitration that were often not well developed to handle international arbitrations. Several countries still had arbitration laws dating from the period when national courts were hostile to arbitration (Anton and Beaumont 34).\n\nAdditionally, the divergence in national arbitration laws complicated the ability of arbitrators to familiarize themselves with arbitration laws and procedures (Bondzi-Simpson 3). The above factors underscored the need for the modernization and harmonization of national laws relating to international commercial arbitration. It is hardly useful to stress that the above conventions and the Model Law apply only in those countries that have either ratified or enacted them into law. Despite this fact, Dolzer and Schureuer (33) make constant reference to these conventions and the Model Law because they embody an emerging consensus on how the practice of international arbitration should be organized and regulated.\n\nAn arbitration clause is significantly different from the substantive agreement in which it is contained. While the latter outlines the rights, duties, and obligations of the parties, the former contains the procedure for resolving any disputes that have arisen or may arise under the substantive agreement.\n\nThus the one may be described as substantive and the other procedural (Dolzer and Schureuer 62). The issue may arise whether or not an arbitration clause survives the invalidity of the substantive agreement in which it is contained. Does the invalidity of the main contract adversely affect an arbitration clause contained therein? If the question is answered in the affirmative, an arbitrator cannot assume jurisdiction in situations where one of the parties contends that the substantive agreement containing the arbitration clause is invalid, at least until the validity of the substantive agreement is determined (perhaps by a national court) (Dolzer and Schureuer 66).\n\nAccording to Bondzi-Simpson (3), It does not take much effort to see that if the validity of the international public policy clause is dependent on the validity of the main contract, a party seeking to frustrate or delay the arbitration process need only plead that the main contract is invalid in order to preempt the arbitrator’s jurisdiction and seek a court resolution of that preliminary objection. The principle of the autonomy of arbitration agreements is designed, in part, to prevent the use of this kind of tactic installing the process of arbitration.\n\nThe principle of the jurisdictional autonomy of the arbitration agreement proclaims that an arbitration agreement is autonomous in relation to the contract from which it originates. In this sense, an arbitration clause is independent of the commercial agreement in which it is contained, and cannot be automatically affected by the fortunes of the substantive contract (Jacobs 211). One effect of the principle is that the arbitration clause survives the invalidity of the substantive contract unless it is shown that the cause of the invalidity also specifically applies to the arbitration clause (Anton and Beaumont 75).\n\nThe primacy accorded to party autonomy in the determination of applicable substantive and procedural law meshes neatly with the private nature of the arbitration. Nevertheless, it should always be remembered that arbitration can never be entirely privatized, for it must continually respond to the policy demands of those jurisdictions whose legitimate interests are implicated in the proceedings. It would seem that the survival of international commercial arbitration as a legitimate system of dispute resolution depends not only on its responsiveness to the needs of the participants but, perhaps more crucially, on its respect for vital juridical interests (Anton and Beaumont 41).\n\nThis preeminent public policy is sometimes labeled transnational public policy or truly international public policy. Like the concept of public policy in national law, the concept of transnational public policy presupposes the existence of “a certain community and of certain fundamental values.” Unlike national public policy, the relevant community here is not a national community but the international community.” (Jacobs 201).\n\nWhile the public policy of a State embodies the moral and ethical philosophy of the State, transnational public policy performs the same role for the international business community. There is a certain similarity between the two: principles that embody the fundamental and ethical values of a national community would in most cases be equally fundamental in the international community.\n\nFor example, the requirement of fair hearing and due process is considered a basic element of justice in both national and international communities. However, so long as national public policy represents particular and narrow national interests, while transnational public policy represents the values of the world community, the two strands of public policy can not be identical (Jacobs 215). Thus, while the act of gambling is against public morals in some societies, it can hardly be said that the abhorrence of gambling is part of the fundamental values of the world community (Jarvin 85).\n\nThe transnational public policy represents the fundamental values, the basic ethical standards, and the enduring moral consensus of the international community. Its principles are derived from “the fundamental rules of natural law, the principles of universal justice, jus cogens in public international law” and the public policy accepted in the generality of nations (Jarvin 85). These principles, which include the abhorrence of racial, religious, and sexual discrimination and the repudiation of corrupt practices, are in a sense the mandatory rules of international commercial relations that must be respected in all arbitrations. The application of transnational public policy is seen as crucial to the maintenance of minimum standards of conduct and behavior in international commercial relations (Anton and Beaumont 77).\n\nArbitrators are particularly suited to apply the principles of transnational public policy because they have a responsibility to maintain a certain element of equity and fair play in the international commercial arena, and they are not guardians of the public policy of any particular State (Jnger 176). Responsibility is partly discharged by their balancing the will of the parties with the legitimate interests of the international community in preserving the basic notions of contractual morality and justice (Jarvin 85).\n\nArbitrators, as guardians of the international commercial order, refuse to enforce a contract if it contravenes transnational public policy. This was the result in ICC Case No. 1110 . In that case, the claimant claimed some money as commission for his efforts in helping the respondent procure an Argentinian government contract. Having determined that the commission amounted in effect to a bribe, the sole arbitrator held the contract in violation of transnational public policy:\n\n[I]t cannot be contested that there exists a general principle of law recognized by civilized nations that contracts which seriously violate bonos mores or international public policy are invalid or at least unenforceable and that they cannot be sanctioned by courts or arbitrators. This principle is especially apt for use before international arbitration tribunals that lack a “law of the forum” in the ordinary sense of the term (Reported by J. Lew, supra note 23 at 553 cited Jnger 177).\n\nTransnational public policy could also be a ground for an arbitrator’s refusal to apply the mandatory rule of relevant national law. The transnational public policy represents values that are superior to those of particular national systems.\n\nTherefore, when a mandatory national rule is in conflict with a transnational policy, the latter prevails, at least in an international arbitral forum, This is because arbitrators owe a paramount duty to the international community. Illustrating this principle, Jnger (196) gives us an example of certain boycott laws that establish restrictions on the grounds of race and religion. He rightly argues that an arbitrator should in the name of transnational public policy refuse to enforce such mandatory laws because they seek to institute racial or religious discrimination which contravenes transnational public policy.\n\nThe contractual theory emphasizes the contractual nature of the arbitration. The jurisdiction and powers of an international arbitrator are, as noted above, dependent on the mutual intention of the parties as reflected in their agreement, and without their agreement, there can be no valid arbitration (Jnger 176). The classical version of the contractual theory contends that arbitration is wholly a product of the consent of the parties and argues against State intervention in the process. Critiquing the classical version of the contractual theory, A. Samuel (cited Jnger 176) points out that an arbitrator cannot be regarded as an agent of the parties for a variety of reasons.\n\nFirst, unlike an agent, the authority of an arbitrator can be made irrevocable and the duty of the arbitrator to render an impartial and unbiased award is inconsistent with an agent’s obligation to conform with the wishes of the principal. Second, since no agent could do something that the principal is incapable of doing, an arbitrator cannot be acting on behalf of the parties in conducting an arbitration because the parties are not in a position to judge impartially the merits of their dispute (Anton and Beaumont 75).\n\nThe modern version of the contractual theory repudiates the idea that the arbitrator is an agent of the parties as understood in the law of agency and disowns the belief that an award is primarily a contractual document. However, it emphasizes the contractual nature of arbitration; it stresses the fact that the arbitral process is a product of the consent of the parties, and that the parties should be given a free hand in adapting the process to their particular needs. It thus recognizes the competence of the parties to choose the law to govern the arbitral process, free from the interference of national legal systems (Jnger 176).\n\nIn terms of international public policy, every State has the right to supervise and regulate any activity occurring within its territory (Jnger 54). The arbitration agreement is binding on the parties not just because of their mutual consent, but because a national legal system decides to attach some legal consequences to their agreement. It follows then that the intentions of the parties as reflected in their agreement can only be binding to the extent they are sanctioned by the laws of the place where the arbitration is conducted. This theory is useful because it stresses the importance of national laws in the conduct of the arbitration.\n\nUnlike the contractual theory, it underscores the fact that national laws are an essential component in the process of understanding the nature of the arbitration. However, just like the contractual theory, it overemphasizes what is at best a singular, albeit significant, consideration in the arbitration process: that is, the role of national legal systems. It does not give sufficient regard to the role of the parties’ agreement.\n\nMuch as it is correct to state that it is a national law that confers legitimacy and efficacy to arbitration, it is also valid to state that there can be no arbitration without the agreement of the parties, except in cases of compulsory arbitration It is a recognition of the significance of the parties’ agreement, and the need to respect their desire to resolve their dispute privately and outside the confines of national judicial systems, that explains the current trend toward limiting judicial interference in the arbitration process (Chen 28).\n\nThe importance of international arbitration theories is that they also suggest that unhindered party autonomy is crucial to the full development of arbitration. Respect for the parties’ freedom of choice, the theory maintains, will fulfill the aspirations of those who use arbitration and also help in the development of arbitration as an institution (David 109). It is true that an understanding of the goal and purpose of arbitration is useful in appreciating the character of arbitration.\n\nThose who realize the fact that parties who consent to arbitration consciously intend to opt-out of the judicial resolution of the dispute by national courts in favor of a private and flexible arena are more apt to appreciate the need for minimal judicial interference in the arbitration process. Parties to arbitration do not expect the arbitration process to be frustrated by unrestricted judicial intrusion into the process (Anton and Beaumont 61).\n\nIt is useful to enter a caveat regarding the use of transnational public policy in refusing to apply national mandatory rules. If the use of this doctrine is not placed under careful and continual scrutiny, it may become a ready tool at the hands of some jurists who wish to utilize this theory in refusing to recognize or apply those national laws that they deem unsuitable to their regional interests.\n\nNow and again one hears all sorts of rules being pleaded as part of transnational public policy, rules that often do not embody generally accepted principles (Lalive 285). For example, the doctrine of pacta sunt servanda and the principle of good faith are often pleaded in support of an alleged principle of transnational policy that ordains the immutability of State contracts in the absence of a common agreement of the parties to alter the contractual provisions.\n\nThis argument is made despite clear and readily accessible evidence that State practices in many jurisdictions (for example, State practices in France and those jurisdictions whose legal systems are modeled on the French) adopt the theory of administrative contracts whereby the State in municipal relations has, under certain conditions, extracontractual powers to alter the provisions of a government contract. The type of transnational public policy that could exclude the application of mandatory rules of national law should be interpreted as including only those policies, standards, and principles that truly represent a consensus of the world community and that are necessary for securing contractual morality in international commercial relations (Born 55).\n\nThe theory of transnational public policy originates from an attempt by arbitrators to enforce those fundamental ethical and moral values that are necessary for the security of international commercial relations. It is the case that the concept of transnational public policy is rarely raised before arbitrators as a ground for invalidating a contractual obligation (Baird 583). Nevertheless, its presence in arbitral practice is a constant reminder to potential arbitrating parties that the relative independence of the arbitral process does not imply that the process could be used to circumvent the application of basic concepts of morality and justice (Anton and Beaumont 73).\n\nMandatory rules are one of the ways in which the doctrine of party autonomy is adapted to the legitimate interests of States in ensuring that the arbitral process affirms the basic elements of contractual morality. Of course, arbitrators are not expected to apply each and every mandatory rule that is pleaded as relevant to the case. Their mission in this regard is to examine the nature and purpose of relevant mandatory rules and ascertain whether the enacting State’s connection with the parties’ transaction warrants the application of such rules. Where the connection is limited or merely speculative, the arbitrator should decline to apply such rules (Hunter and Redfern 72).\n\nArbitrators should also ensure that disputes before them conform to the requirements of truly transnational public policy. The enforcement of appropriate mandatory rules by arbitrators would send a signal to prospective arbitrating parties that the arbitral process is certainly not a device for circumventing imperative laws of States with which their transaction is substantially connected. (Mistelis, 21). This attitude will justify the confidence of those States that believe arbitrators are well suited to adjudicate claims involving sensitive matters of State policy (Baird 583).\n\nMost of the attempts to determine general principles so far have involved the comparative examination of the laws of developed Western countries. The rationale for this may be that laws in most developing countries are largely influenced by those in countries that formerly colonized them. This view contains some element of truth, but there are still large areas in which laws in developing countries take their own individual courses.\n\nThus, the problem of identifying general principles would be further compounded if the comparative methodology involved in this process includes the examination of laws in developing countries, as indeed should be the case (Mistelis, 12). A commentator has suggested that the problem of identifying general principles may be attenuated by comparing only the principles recognized in the legal systems of the parties involved in the particular dispute. Thus, in a dispute between a Swiss party and a Taiwanese party, the arbitral tribunal, in applying general principles, will apply those principles of law that are common to Switzerland and Taiwan (Anton and Beaumont 72).\n\nThis is an idea that merits serious consideration, but where the laws of the parties’ nationalities differ radically from each other, the process of elaborating general principles would be no less onerous than a project involving a broad selection of legal systems. Even if the principles in both States coincide, they cannot, properly speaking, be labeled general principles as they would not necessarily be generalized to a broad selection of other States (Bondzi-Simpson 101).\n\nLord McNair in his seminal article on general principles of law suggested that those principles are particularly suitable for application to economic development agreements. He argued that public international law was inapplicable to these agreements because public international law is an “inter-State system” that applies only to inter-State relations.\n\nIn his view, general principles of law constitute a “legal system” and its principles, which share “a common source of recruitment and inspiration” with public international law, are amenable to State contract disputes (Anton and Beaumont 71). Other critics (David 33; Carbonneau 56) have also advocated the application of general principles to State contracts. These principles have sometimes been adopted by parties as their choice of law, and arbitral tribunals have had to apply them in some arbitrations. In some instances, arbitral tribunals have had to apply general principles in situations where the parties did not expressly adopt them (Bondzi-Simpson 107).\n\nAn example is ICC Case No. 3572 of 1982, where the agreement between the parties did not contain a choice of law. The truth is that despite the attraction of the concept of general principles of law to academic critics and some arbitrators, these principles do not constitute a readily identifiable and comprehensive system of rules to regulate the complex contractual relations that are often involved in State contracts. It would seem that any principle that is indeed general to a genuinely representative selection of legal systems would often be too broad as to be unhelpful in specific cases (Anton and Beaumont 72).\n\nIn terms of international public policy, state contracts are, however, much more unstable than private contracts because the intervening events that affect the contractual equilibrium include the public interests of the State party and the necessity for it to secure its ability to discharge its public duties (Anton and Beaumont 72). The situation in State contracts is further complicated by the fact that some State contracts–for example, those dealing with the exploration and exploitation of mineral and other resources–may be so central to the economic well-being of a State that the activity contemplated by the contract is considered an integral part of the State party’s economic policy. Take the case of States that are members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) (David 87).\n\nThe economies of most OPEC members are often so dependent on the vagaries of the oil market that they take particular interest in the contracts involving the exploitation or sale of their petroleum resources (Bondzi-Simpson 101). The private party, on the other hand, is continuously afraid of being made to bear singly the brunt of a State policy, a policy that may, in furtherance of some public good, result in the frustration of the private party’s contractual expectations.\n\nIt is true that private parties do not enter into contractual arrangements in order to promote the public interests of the State party; their interests are normally that of profit maximization and the furtherance of their individual or corporate interests. It is then dear that the tension that is evident in State contracts emanates from the conflicting interests of the State party’s need for contractual flexibility and the private party’s insistence on contractual stability (David 77).\n\nAll the efforts to subject State contracts to international law or general principles of law, or to engraft stabilization clauses into these contracts, are commonly targeted at the same goal: the freeing of the contract from the control and regulation of the State party and its laws. Advocates of these clauses do not give adequate regard to the considerations of public interest that the participation of the State party impresses upon a State contract. A more realistic approach would be to recognize the right of State parties to terminate a Stale contract, subject to the payment of appropriate compensation (Anton and Beaumont 98).\n\nInternational public policy is drawn from the fundamental rules of natural law, the principles of universal justice, jus cogens in public international law, and the general principles of morality and public policy acceptable to the generality of countries. The international public policy includes a synthesis of the fundamental presumptions and practices that underlie legislative and judicial practice in a broad selection of countries.\n\nIt, therefore, includes such transnational principles as good faith, estoppel, and pacta sunt servanda , principles that are present in most legal systems (Bondzi-Simpson 23). If States and their agencies were to comply with the prohibition of arbitration agreements under their national laws by not entering into such agreements, problems would not arise (Bondzi-Simpson 101). But there is a certain element of bad faith in a State or its agency consenting to arbitration, only to turn back later and seek to deny the agreement by relying on its incapacity under its national law. Such approbation and reprobation are not conducive to the need for trust and reliability in international commerce.\n\nA State should be sovereign enough to abide by its promises. More important, reliance on incapacity would be inconsistent with the notion of good faith and the principles of pacta sunt servanda , which are embodied in the concept of international public policy (Bondzi-Simpson 23).\n\nThis viewpoint endorses the position that a State or its agency should not be able to rely on its incapacity to arbitrate under its domestic law as grounds for invalidating an arbitration agreement to which it had willingly consented. Some arbitral awards have addressed the issue of capacity of State agencies to arbitrate. In these cases, State agencies pleaded their incapacity under their national laws to enter into arbitration agreements as a bar to the jurisdiction of arbitral tribunals. The consensus among arbitrators was that such a plea is unacceptable (Buchanan 511).\n\nThe general consensus is that a State cannot plead lack of capacity under its national law as a bar to the jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. International public policy repudiates the idea that a State, after consenting to arbitration and carrying into effect the underlying commercial agreement, can turn back to plead incapacity to arbitrate. Such an attitude is incompatible with the need for trust and reliability in the commercial world (Carbonneau 71).\n\nWhile it amounts to bad faith for a State to plead incapacity to enter into an arbitration agreement, it will be contrary to the principle of party autonomy–that cardinal principle of arbitration–to impose arbitration on a State if it did not in fact consent to it. An arbitrator should as a preliminary step examine the consensual basis of the arbitration agreement. Unless a State conducted itself in a manner that makes it unconscionable for it to rely on its lack of consent to the arbitration, Carbonneau (32) underlines that of no reasons of policy why it may not challenge the arbitrator’s jurisdiction on that ground.\n\nPrivate parties should ensure that they deal with authorized agents of the State (Bondzi-Simpson 29). In the absence of any law regulating authority to bind the State, the private party may rely on the ostensible authority of appropriate State officials. As arbitration continues to gain prominence as a method of resolving international commercial disputes, restrictions on the ability of States and their agencies to consent to arbitration will be gradually dismantled. Foreign investors will no doubt be skeptical about investing in a country that insists on resolving all contractual disputes under its own national legal system (Carbonneau 78).\n\nHowever, it is possible to conceive of a situation where an arbitrator need not apply the mandatory rules of the law chosen by the parties. An example would be cases where the underlying purpose and objective of the rule indicate that it is aimed at purely domestic situations as opposed to cases involving international disputes. Additionally, an arbitrator may decline to apply a mandatory rule of a law chosen by the parties in the unlikely event that the rule is contrary to “transnational public policy (Carbonneau 73).\n\nAn question in this area of arbitration is whether arbitrating parties can legitimately exclude the application of the mandatory rules of the law that they choose to govern their agreement. In effect, can the parties slice off unacceptable portions of the governing law of their contract? In theory, it could be argued that since the parties selected the governing law, they could as well determine which parts of that law would govern their agreement; after all they could very well have chosen another law as the governing law. And since the arbitrators are bound to apply the law chosen by the parties, they should have no choice but to respect the will of the parties (Bondzi-Simpson 37).\n\nThe will of the parties is not sacrosanct; the parties’ will prevails so far as it is consistent with relevant public policy. Consequently, since mandatory rules are designed to apply regardless of the parties’ choice of governing law, arbitrators may legitimately refuse to recognize the parties’ exclusion of mandatory rules of the lex contractus in cases where the parties’ transaction is very closely connected with the jurisdiction whose law is the lex contractus, and the mandatory rules were designed to regulate such transactions (Carbonneau 71).\n\nFor example, if a Canadian company enters into a distribution agreement with a Japanese auto company for the distribution of cars in Ontario (and the parties choose Ontario law as the applicable law), an arbitral tribunal may refuse to apply a contractual provision excluding Canadian competition laws. To respect the parties’ will in such a case would be tantamount to the subjugation of Canada’s legitimate interest in regulating its business environment to the interest of private contracting parties (Bondzi-Simpson 23).\n\nThe plea of uncertainty as a justification for nonapplication of foreign mandatory rules sits a little ill when it is remembered that other principles of law are no less certain. For example, in the absence of an express choice by the parties, arbitrators usually apply the law most closely connected to the contract. Certainly, this process of determining applicable law does not afford complete certainty of application. Moreover, one wonders why the need for certainty should supersede the necessity of respecting the mandatory rules of foreign laws that are substantially connected to the dispute (Chen 48).\n\nThe application of foreign mandatory rules should involve a balancing of the public interests of the enacting State with the private interests of contracting parties. In contrast, the favorable approach to the application of mandatory rules recognizes that foreign mandatory rules may be so connected with the dispute as to compel their application, even though they are not part of the governing law. This approach, acknowledging the fact that the will of the parties has to be reconciled with the interests of those States that are closely connected to the dispute, entertains the possibility of applying foreign mandatory rules in appropriate cases (Carbonneau 53).\n\nOne of the enduring areas of tension in arbitral practice is how to strike a balance between arbitral autonomy and vital juridical interests. True, arbitration is a private system of dispute resolution, but does this imply that the arbitral process is to remain totally unregulated by national laws? Is arbitration in essence a system of private justice unfettered by national interests? (Bondzi-Simpson 123). The theories and critics mentioned above stress the reciprocal and dynamic interaction between the will of the arbitrating parties and the interest of various national legal systems in ensuring the fairness of the arbitral process and its respect of vital national interests (Chen 61).\n\nThe process of arbitration cannot be totally understood without an appreciation of the role that national legal systems play in supporting arbitration at three crucial stages. These are the stages of enforcing the agreement to arbitrate, aiding the conduct of the arbitration proceedings, and recognizing and enforcing arbitral awards. Without this help provided by national legal systems, arbitration would be nothing more than a convergence of conduct and expectations between the parties, totally unenforceable at law.\n\nArbitrators recognize the central place of national legal systems in the survival of arbitration. They thus respect the public policies of relevant national jurisdictions in determining the arbitrability of subject matters, in the conduct of the arbitration proceedings, and in determining and applying the law governing the merits of the dispute (Chen 85). This is as it should be, for arbitration should not be allowed to become a means for businesspeople to escape the mandatory rules of jurisdictions in which they do business; neither should the fairness and justice of the arbitral process go unsupervised by national law (even if such supervision is done by reference to international standards) (Bondzi-Simpson 38).\n\nThe requisite test should be the connection of the jurisdiction (whose policy is at issue) to the dispute and the nature of the policy involved. An arbitral tribunal should first determine that a particular jurisdiction is so closely connected with the dispute that its public policy ought to be respected or enforced in the proceedings. In addition, the tribunal should determine that the particular policy is designed for application to international commercial relations (David 87).\n\nIt was also argued that an otherwise applicable national public policy could be denied application if it is contrary to transnational public policy (for example, policies that enact discrimination based on race, religion, or ethnic origins) (Chen 88).\n\nIn sum, it is clear that the answer to the above questions directly affects the way critics and researchers view what role the legal process should play in arbitration. A contractual theorist would necessarily advocate unhindered party autonomy, whereas a critic would argue for substantial judicial supervision of arbitration. An adherent of the mixed or hybrid theory is likely to favor an effective mixture of autonomy and regulation, whereas an autonomist would focus on what is necessary to ensure that arbitration meets the needs and objectives of the parties. Each legal system must struggle to reconcile these conflicting interests.\n\nAs argued above, no one approach is entirely satisfactory: current international public policy represents a way of looking at arbitration. A fuller and richer view must, of course, contemplate its object from all possible perspectives. In this regard, the law should reflect a blend of the above theories so as to ensure that arbitration meets the larger needs of society. The mixed or hybrid theory meets this objective by focusing on both the contractual and the jurisdictional basis of arbitration.\n\nThis theory cautions us always to remember that international arbitrations cannot be entirely divorced from the legal systems with which they come into contact. While supporting the conclusion reached by the arbitrators, it must be reiterated that reference to the proper law as a determinant of capacity may result in discordant results depending on the content of the applicable proper law.\n\nEven if the proper law is adopted as a suitable guide, it does not lead to the evolution of a single substantive rule on the capacity of States to arbitrate because the different approaches adopted by States on the issue of capacity to arbitrate preclude the extraction of a common principle from national laws. Refusal to recognize national laws denying capacity to States and their agencies should be founded on international public policy. The principles of good faith, pacta sunt servanda , and estoppel are common to most if not all legal systems. These principles coalesce into a substantive rule of public policy that precludes a State from relying on its national law to challenge its capacity to arbitrate.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAnton A. and Beaumont P.

      "Security in Grocery Store, Bank of America, Wal-Mart Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nDifferent locations experience security issues in the course of carrying out the day-to-day operations. Great care needs to be observed in order to avoid losses that result due to neglect or failure to take the necessary preventive measures. Theft is a serious problem of security that needs to be taken care of by employing experienced security guards and using videos in areas where business is carried out to ensure the movement of customers are monitored so that those who commit a crime can be noticed easily. The three locations discussed below include; grocery store, Bank of America, and Wal-Mart all of which are affected by various security issues that need to be taken care of for all the activities to run smoothly without encountering losses arising due to lack of adequate security measures.\n\nGrocery store\n\nGrocery stores put effort to be successful in a competitive industry by minimizing losses and maximizing their profits. These stores are affected by employees stealing goods and shoplifting by customers. The loss that may be incurred can be kept under control by using brand names on the products so that cases of loss due to theft can be easily identified. Technology such as an electronic system for controlling costs is also important in areas where sales are made.\n\nVideos are used to monitor the movement of goods and how customers carry out their shopping so that any goods were taken from the store pass through the cashier for payment to be made immediately. If any case of cheating is noticed through the video, it should be dealt with on the spot so that the customers may not go out of the grocery store without paying for the goods and explaining why they decided to disappear without settling their bills. The person who is assigned to monitor the movement of goods through the video should have enough experience of the area he is assigned to take care of so that he does not take a lot of time before tracing where theft has been detected.\n\nThere are places where criminal activities are detected most of the time; remote guards should be in a position to communicate with other employees to ensure that all the criminals are caught and dealt with accordingly. All the customers who visit the grocery should use a shopping cart or basket in order to prevent the people who go to the store only to browse and make a comparison of prices without purchasing anything. Those who guard the grocery store are supposed to have stun guns to arm themselves to ensure that all the activities carried in the store are properly guarded and no intruder should get in without permission. (Kenyon, 2002 pp24-25)\n\nBank of America\n\n(Jay, 2002 pp34-35) found that, Bank of America experience cases of bank robberies that require police to be employed. The police should be experienced in detecting cases of robbery if there is suspicion that there is planned robbery. Internet alerts are important so that the entire bank can be aware of security issues that affect operations of the bank and be prepared in advance to deal with them or stop them before their occurrence.\n\nIf theft or fraud is detected, there must be adequate protection using improved technology from casinos such as video networks, facial scans, and sophisticated databases for visitors who come without the knowledge of the bank. Once the bank detects theft, care should be taken in informing the public about it so that customers may not lose confidence in the bank because identity fraud may make customers doubt the security of finance in the bank.\n\nBank of America requires combating schemes for laundering money due to cheating using false identities. Technology for putting signature is established so that no one can be in a position to forge a signature and use it to withdraw cash from the bank. This will help to take care of fraud mechanisms that are complex and help to manage risks in the bank using fraud strategies. The use of fake identity cards should be handled through analyzing identity cards using networks so that the right identity card is used by customers of the bank when transacting.\n\nWal-Mart\n\n(Jay, 2002 pp36-39) Argues that, Wal-Mart encounters a breach of data at the point where sales are made especially in the store. Security is enhanced by giving retailers payment cards once they make their purchases. If the payment system is not installed properly, the company is exposed to loss due to the risk of compromising data that is used in making follow-ups of all the sales made and their payments. The store malicious software resulting in data loss and critical files need to be monitored all the time and if the unauthorized change has been made, the appropriate personnel should be notified immediately because, and data of the consumer may be affected resulting in loss of confidence by the consumers about the company.\n\nProtection of data is very important and integrity of files for the Wal-Mart to be able to carry out effective analysis of all the activities that are carried out and identify issues that are difficult to notice which ensure data is well protected and accessible to only the people who have the right to access it. The method of collecting data about Wall-mart need to be protected and in good operation so that corporate network do not hang off at the point of data collection and printers should be put everywhere in the enterprise systems.\n\nThe containers used to transport goods are scanned to ensure that they are not smuggled by terrorists because once the ships leave the port they can be tampered with due to lack of security where a ship is hijacked and bribed so that extra content can be loaded into it. The person held responsible for transit should ensure that the goods loaded into the ship are taken to their various destinations without being interfered with on the way.\n\nAnalyzing the similarities\n\nGrocery stores, Bank of America, and Wal-Mart have similar security issues where all of them are at risk of theft by employees. This can be solved by ensuring there is a security guard employed to detect all the planned theft and report immediately to the higher authority. Theft is also carried out by outsiders who visit with the intention of benefiting either by stealing cash or taking away commodities. Quality security personnel can be employed from companies so that once the theft is detected, an alarm is used so that armed security can take control of the situation and arrest the criminals.\n\nSecurity of information is very necessary for the three locations where confidential information should not be availed to the outsiders about the operations and how money is generated. This ensures there is no risk of publicizing confidential information about the success of the companies to its competitors that may result in a lack of growth and progress due to high competition. Finance departments should not disclose the financial position so that the security of the money is maintained without losing it to people who are aware of where it is kept before storing it in safe custody. (Wylder, 2004 pp16)\n\nAnalyzing the Differences\n\nGrocery store\n\nMost of the time, goods are prone to theft where customers go unnoticed and steal the goods and fail to pay for them. This requires frequent stock-taking to establish whether such cases are occurring before they reach advanced stages that result in greater loss. Every employee can be assigned a particular section to take care of and monitor the movement of customers which may be very easy to note customers who put goods in their bags without paying for them. The goods dealt with in grocery stores can be easily discovered if the inspection is done to suspected customers because they have the trademark of the grocery store and valuable evidence about the theft can be easily established. (Kenyon, 2002 pp26-27)\n\nBank of America\n\nMoney stolen from the bank may be difficult to identify unless a person is caught on the spot trying to steal. Inspection may not help because; money is denominated in similar notes and coins. Tight security is very important and idlers should not be allowed to access the bank and all the customers should have their identity cards before they enter into the bank to show that they are customers to the bank without any other intention. The technology required by the bank should be high so that everybody can be monitored as he enters the bank even if it is congested, the proper arrangement is put in place so that everybody can be seen and his movement is properly monitored. (Wylder, 2004 pp14-15)\n\nWal-Mart\n\nThe number of days taken when goods are in transit should be taken care of to ensure that no unnecessary delay is caused on the way so that the goods may not be interfered with or stolen before they get to the customers. Delaying shipment should be stopped through having good timing of the appropriate time to park goods and ensure they are ready. Wal-Mart is entitled to scan its containers using an x-ray machine that individuals and businesses park. Loss of money from sales should be prevented by ensuring that, the salesperson does not understate the money generated from sales where he is required to have a stamped receipt book for all the money generated from sales. (Tipton, 2005 pp24-27)\n\nRecommendations for any additional security needed and justifications\n\nThe grocery store should have all the items with print labels and properly arrange them on shelves. Data for all the sales made should be viewed and compared with data for the inventory to ensure there is no loss at the end of the day. When making the final report, the history of all the sales needs to be given in detail for effective reporting. All the account receivables should be properly managed to ensure there are no cases of theft.\n\nBank of America should change the password regularly to ensure there is safety. This can be done using internet banking where after a certain period of time, the bank requests a change in the password that may not be accessed by unauthorized users. The password should be a mixture of numbers and alphabetical letters with six characters so that it can not be used by any other person. Internet banking should be logged out to make it inactive immediately after use and ensure accessed pages are cleared.\n\nWal-Mart needs to have advanced software for making cost-benefit analysis so that the cost of goods produced is always lower than the revenue generated from the sales made so that all the money generated by salespeople can be accounted for without stealing some of the money secretly. If any of the buildings are threatened with a bomb attack, they should be vacated before the actual bombing occurs to avoid a loss that may accrue to the Company and ensure employees are safe as they work in the company.

      "Montessori’s Concept of New Education Essay\n\nDr Montessori was born in Italy in 1870. In 1896, she actually became the first female doctor in Italy. She began her research about the development of the child and the necessary conditions required in order for the child to fully grow from a medical perspective, researched about the child and her mission was actually to study about the child on a educational perspective and this was actually intended to help improve their opportunity for better learning and their development and hence it was through her research that could help understand the child.\n\nShe based her work on the direct observation of young children and it was due to her own research that she refused the opinions about these children abilities and neither did she attempt to manipulate these behaviours of these children by reward or punishment towards any end. This actually led her to develop some materials which were linked to the children’s interest, their needs and their developing abilities in order to help this child to develop and these actually made educators to give her the name of miracle worker because of her determination in understanding the child. Some of the quotes she made in her new education include “free the child’s potential and you will transform him in to the world”. (Montessori 1996).\n\nIn Montessori 0-3 program, which she opted to work with in the first place, she realized that working with children who are older than three years of age, was too late to have the most beneficial results on the life of a human being so she decided to work with the 0-3 program which would give better results on the life of the human being and in understanding how a person actually develops. But she later came up with the two-year full time course for adults living or working with children from birth to three years of age.\n\nChildren below three years can give better results of understanding the young child since these children below the ages three do not know anything and mostly do play with anything they come across with and hence achieve a state of profound peace order and harmony. (Jung, 1954).\n\nMontessori quoted that” learning child sees not so much the task of filling the mind with information, but of rather constructing the mind through activity according to inner directives and urges. Sere she meant that children below ages three do not want to understand anything by filling their minds with information they are not able to remember but through the activities they perform since children at ages below three have poor memory, can’t go to school but they learn through the activities they mostly do like playing with toys. For children age of six and older, the computer can be a very positive part of the environment, but it is still important to decide what to do with it”. (Montessori, 1996).\n\nYou find that children above age six have a bit of knowledge and can operate some of the machines like computers since they have gone to school and have operated most of these things. In a period of forty years she wrote many books in which she opted that many people would follow her suit in trying to understand the child and helping the child to understand to understand herself. She also found out that given the right scientific conditions the young children can shed ordinary pattern of disorder, in attention and fantasy, entering in a totally new state of self discipline, love of order, peace, attachment to reality and complete harmony with the environment and viewed this as the Childs state of normal being since it arose from within the child itself.\n\nChildren at these ages are normally disorderly and end up messing everything they come across with. People can learn about children by observing their behaviours that is what they normally do with certain things like the toys and other playing materials. Children below the ages three like mostly playing with materials near them and it’s through this then that a child can develop and grow and reach an order person. (Jung, 1954)\n\nThe practice of the Montessori new education for children below the age of twelve in home and at school provides a good advice for using Montessori new education in all kinds. She said that if a child has the capability of doing something, then she should be left to do it all along since its through this then that the child will have experience of doing it and understand it more since the child is doing it without any assistance and in this she quoted that “never help a child with a task at which he feels he can succeed”. (Montessori, 1996).\n\nMontessori education is a way of discovering and supporting the normal life of a child in the natural setting. His teaching can be carried out as viewing children as having their own inborn nature, their inner guidance and also is a way of been committed to infinite and eternal laws of nature. It has been a source of developing appropriate Montessori books, toys, and other educational materials, and this in turn helps parents and teachers to develop educational environment that fosters creativity, independence of thought and action. And hence as a result, this can help the child develop full potentials of inner respect, creativity and more so understanding the laws of nature.\n\nShe also quoted that “the world of education is like an island where people, cut off from the world, are prepared for life by exclusion from it” The toys and materials in the home and school should be of the very best quality to call forth self-respect, respect and care from the child towards the environment and the development of an appreciation of beauty. (Froebel, 1980)\n\nDr. Montessori new education discovered the phenomena of the Childs true nature in 1907 and eventually elaborated his discovery in various publications and further research she conducted throughout the world thereafter until her death in 1952.She wrote many publications which includes, the joyful child and this publication is available from the Michael Olaf company which is a company which was began by Montessori student established in 1982, another publication is the child of the world which actually explains Montessori practice for children from three to twelve years and are available directly from the Michael Olaf company, a company which was began by Montessori student. (Ashton, 1964)\n\nDr. Montessori approach has shown the teacher conducting some experiments with children and in using by using the available technology and this helps the child to understand the laws of nature around each child, and in which in practice it functions to control the environment instead of controlling the child. Her environment also provides an order and arrangement of self-teaching materials that children use according to their own choice for learning and intellectual development. Her teaching today creates the right potentials for the emergence of upright normal being in young children. Also it helps to supports normal development in older children by following the laws of nature.\n\nIt’s through her books that many people are in a position to understand the development of a child, how a child grows through various activities like playing with objects around her. Since her death she left a vision for a new education, which many people should follow, her suit in trying to help and understand the child. Her new education would bring about a whole new and better humanity in the world. So it’s upon teachers and students to follow the right education in order to be in a position to know the development of a child. (Cohen, 1983)\n\nThe practice of the Montessori new education for children below the age of twelve in home and at school provides a good advice for using Montessori new education in all kinds. She said that if a child has the capability of doing something, then she should be left to do it all along since it’s through this then that the child will have experience of doing it and understand it more since the child is doing it without any assistance.\n\nReference\n\nJung, C (1954).

      "The International Monetary Fund Review Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe international organization, popularly known as the IMF is an organization with 185 member countries and was primarily formed to promote international monetary cooperation, exchange stability, make financial arrangements, foster economic growth and to provide temporary financial assistance to countries to help ease balance of payments adjustment. The main functions include surveillance, economic assistance and technological assistance to meet the changing needs of its member countries in the changing world economy.\n\nThe Article I in the Articles of Agreements of the IMF elucidates its purposes as to promote international monetary cooperation through a permanent institution which provides the machinery for consultation and collaboration on international monetary problems and to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade, and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income and to the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy. The Article also elaborates the purpose as to promote exchange stability, to maintain orderly exchange arrangements among members, and to avoid competitive exchange depreciation and to give confidence to members by making the general resources of the Fund temporarily available to them under adequate safeguards, thus providing them with opportunity to correct maladjustments in their balance of payments without resorting to measures destructive of national or international prosperity. The Fund is guided in all its policies and decisions by the purposes set forth in this Article I.\n\nThe Main Functions of IMF\n\nSurveillance\n\nThe IMF has been authorized to oversee the international monetary system and monitor the economic -financial policies of its 185 member countries to promote global economic stability through multilateral cooperation by active surveillance. This includes expert assessment of economic and financial developments, advice on risks to stability and policy adjustments. This is especially true in present-day global scenario where financial setbacks and economic policies of a country profoundly affect other countries as well. In fact the surveillance of IMF has evolved to an extent where there are country-specific surveillance programs that list the priority objectives in a member country that covers both operational objectives such as IMF exchange rate analysis and economic objectives such as the reduction of current global imbalances.\n\nEconomic Assistance\n\nThe IMF provides loans to countries experiencing balance of payments problems enabling these countries to rebuild their international reserves stabilizing their currencies. A member country can take IMF financial assistance if it has a need for balance of payments. A need for balance of payments is a situation where a country is unable to find sufficient financing on affordable terms to meet its net international payments. The IMF helps also the adjustment policies and reforms to correct its balance of payments problem and restores strong economic growth. An IMF loan is provided by an “arrangement”, which dictates the policies and measures a country has to implement to resolve its balance of payments problem. The loan is released in phased instalments through the Fund’s Executive Board. Poor countries can borrow at reduced interest rates under Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility or the Exogenous Shocks Facility of the fund in contrast to the Stand-by arrangements known as SBA. The IMF also offers Emergency assistance fund during natural disasters and conflict recovery at reduced interest rates. Except for funds borrowed under Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility or the Exogenous Shocks Facility, all other fund assistance is subject to the IMF’s market-related interest rate, known as the “rate of charge,” sometime with a surcharge. The rate of change is revised weekly to take account of changes in short-term interest rates in major international money markets (Erwin et.al, 1990). Access limit is the term used to denote the amount that a country can borrow from the Fund. This varies depending on the type of loan and usually a multiple of the country’s quota from IMF. These loan facilities are sometimes referred to as instruments. Some of the instruments are Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) and Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF) , Stand-By Arrangements (SBA) , Extended Fund Facility (EFF), Supplemental Reserve Facility (SRF), Compensatory Financing Facility (CFF) and Emergency assistance.\n\nTechnological Assistance of IMF\n\nIMF supports the development of the productive resources of member countries by providing technical assistance.This helps them to effectively manage their economic policy and financial affairs. Technical assistance is provided free of charge to any requesting member country, within IMF resource constraints. IMF technical assistance largely goes to low and lower-middle income countries, post-conflict countries and emerging economies. Technical assistance accelerates the progress of these countries towards a more robust and stable global economy (Axel and Jensen, 2007). Specialized technical assistance is also available from the IMF for effective policymaking, including in support of surveillance or lending operations. The core expertise areas that allow IMF technical assistance are macroeconomic policy, tax policy and revenue administration, expenditure management, monetary policy, the exchange rate system, financial sector sustainability, and macroeconomic and financial statistics.\n\nMore interesting is the fact that recently some countries have asked for help to address financial sector weaknesses identified within the framework of the joint IMF-World Bank Program. These countries have translated their economic policies to adopt and adhere to international standards and codes for financial, fiscal, and statistical management; implement recommendations from off-shore financial centres assessments and strengthen measures to combat money laundering and the financing of terrorism (Axel and Jensen,2007). Simultaneously, there is also a demand for technical assistance from low-income countries to build capacity to design and implement poverty-reducing and growth programs. Donors to the IMF’s technical assistance program include Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, China, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Portugal, Russia, Singapore, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and the United States. They are referred to as bilateral donors. Multilateral donors include the African Development Bank, the Arab Monetary Fund, the Asian Development Bank, the European Commission, the Inter-American Development Bank, the United Nations, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), and the World Bank.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, The IMF is a non-profit global economic organization that aims to curtail global economic problems. In contrast to the World Bank, that aids specific projects, IMF aims and aids at a broader policy level as discussed.\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Axel Dreher and Nathan M. Jensen (2007).

      "Students’ Information Privacy Problem and Solution Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Rebuttal\n 2. Works Cited\n 3. Appendix A\n 4. Footnotes\n\nThe problem is unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of student information over the internet produces an unsafe learning environment.\n\nThere are countless schools facing the same problems of internet privacy attacks and the protection of students’ personal information. The population using the internet has much of the same diversity as the population in general. This includes those who might take advantage of a student’s openness and naiveté. (Aftab, 58). While students should not be afraid of using the internet, they should exercise the same caution as they would in any situation where there are strangers.\n\nDiscussions and instruction relating to the safe use of the Internet must begin long before the student ever sits in front of the computer. One of the most important issues to discuss with the student is under what circumstances and according to what guidelines they will be allowed online access.\n\nPeople, whether attending school or not, understand the numerous dangers facing students today. Forty-three out of fifty people polled felt that violations of a student’s personal privacy or theft of personal information over the internet are a significant problem for secondary education. 1\n\nTen of the students polled were currently attending secondary schools, while another ten were within five years of having graduated. 2 Five of the seven believing it not to be a widespread problem agreed that the situation could easily be solved by not allowing internet access in secondary schools. 3 “This problem goes well beyond the classroom. These students do not have the know-how to keep these types of problems from happening. They need oversight from those that not only have the knowledge but also how to keep the students safe,” says Reta Mills, a professional educator at Seoul American High School. Students must be taught that the same rules they follow in their daily lives also apply to strangers they meet through e-mail or an internet conversation group.\n\nThese issues lead to unsafe learning environments which adversely affect the students. Concentration is the vital key for successfully completing secondary levels of education. This concentration is broken when constant attempts are made to invade privacy and steal personal information from such useful tools. Concerns about privacy on the internet have become pervasive in the past few years as more and more folks use the internet with little sense of how their privacy may be compromised. (Poftak, 36).\n\nParents are correct in trying to protect the privacy of children who may be quick to give away information about them. Privacy concerns are both of a general and specific nature. The mass appeal of the internet and the ease with which folks can use information about almost anyone make it a challenge to protect privacy. Using manipulative measures to give them other information is one of the many ways they could use personal information.\n\nChat has been around on the internet since the late 1980s. Until recently, most internet chats were done using a command-line interface. Folks would connect to a channel on a server running the Internet Relay Chat protocol. (Gomez and McNamara, 39). These systems enabled folks from anywhere on the internet to interact with each other. Channels often center on hobbies, technologies, entertainment, or sex. As the popularity of the internet increased, folks began using graphical client interfaces for chatting. These interfaces are easy-to-use and often allow folks to select avatars or characters who are their representatives in the chat room. In the past two to three years, the most popular chat interface has become web-based. Thus, many websites now attract traffic by offering chat rooms on virtually any topic.\n\nInstant messaging refers to any client that allows direct back-and-forth communication between two parties on the internet. Tonn (16) explains, that, unlike chat rooms, anyone who downloads and installs the client software can immediately begin corresponding with others who are also using the software — the two parties don’t have to enter a chat room and there is never any moderator. Instant messaging products may be inherently safer than chat since the user must generally send a message specifically to someone whose screen name or user name they have obtained. Of course, if the user wants to limit access to his or her user name, he or she must be careful about what information is made available. If they put in a certain street address, then someone can find anyone’s name from a list that results from a search carried out on the address field.\n\nThe concerns of teachers and administration with these technologies are mostly self-evident and are broken down into three categories. According to Fabiansson (36), while less serious than some other problems, some students find the use of chat rooms and instant messaging software to be somewhat addicting. This can be particularly problematic if the student doesn’t have much social interaction outside of the computer environment. Students can easily be tricked into volunteering or giving out information about themselves that may go beyond the bounds of safety. (Hick and Halprin, 70). For example, the student may mention that he is bored because his parents live in a certain neighborhood, of which there is only one in this community. All of these examples are not so unimaginable.\n\nAlthough countless causes can be discussed concerning the disclosure, use, and dissemination of students’ personal information, these can be grouped into categories that form a much bigger picture. Students who are simply uninformed about the threats which are present as well as policies and procedures in place to protect them are the foundation of this problem. Teachers and administration are either uninformed or disillusioned of the actual situation also form the nucleus of internet safety issues in the classroom. Unfortunately, the intentional student misuse of school computer hardware and the software does cause harm to other students. For these reasons, a thorough policy must be drawn up and contain all necessary measures to protect students against these problems.\n\nRebuttal\n\nOpponents say that most people would find it difficult to believe that students in today’s society, students would not know about internet threats, especially with usage continually growing. The idea that secondary students do not know of internet dangers does not make sense. (Barrett, 184). The average student spends over thirty hours per week on the internet; they know what the threats are. Students realize these dangers and yet do not educate themselves to protect their personal information from electronic attacks. There are countless tools for this education; to include: books, electronic tutorials, and software designed to detect and neutralize privacy attacks and theft of personal information. Students are not ill-informed or ill-prepared; they simply do not take the time to educate themselves.\n\nThe problem of privacy attacks and the theft of students’ personal information is overstated. School districts have taken the time to develop plans for these contingencies through the use of internet protection software and some have even adopted usage policies. These policies, however, cover the information that the student is allowed to access. This is due to previous attempts of students to attain electronic files of questionable and unsuitable content while working with school computers. (Embar-Seddon, 1035). The faculty has truncated this by supervising the students during periods of computers and internet use.\n\nThe unauthorized disclosure, use, and dissemination of student information over the internet produce an unsafe learning environment for students. This problem is even more prevalent in secondary education environments, especially with the increase in computer and internet usage among students. The current safeguards designed for student internet usage have been ineffective and inefficient in deterring privacy attacks and the theft of students’ personal information. Students must be informed of the threats to their privacy and personal information to protect themselves. Parents, teachers, and administrators also have a responsibility to ensure a safe learning environment. These threats will continue to increase if educating students do not become the top priority facing secondary school systems.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAftab, Parry. “Online Safety at School.” PC Magazine (2004) 58.\n\nBarrett, Laura. “Not Just ‘YourSpace’: Educators Urged to Be Careful on the Internet.” Education Digest. 73.2 (2007) 9-11.\n\nEmbar-Seddon, Ayn. “Cyberterrorism: Are We Under Siege.” American Behavioral Scientist. 45.6 (2002) 1033-43.\n\nFabiansson, Charlotte. “Young People’s Perceptions of Being Safe – Globally and Locally.” Social Indicators Research. 80 (2007) 31-49.\n\nGomez, Juan and McNamara, Patrick. “But It All Happened Online.” Journal of Cases in Educational Leadership. 9.1 (2004) 35-43.\n\nHick, Steven and Halpin, Edward. “Children’s Rights and the Internet.” The Annals of the American Academy. 575.1 (2001) 70.\n\nMills, Reta.

      "Eargo: Innovative Product Solving Customer Pain Point Essay\n\nIn the modern world, the idea of innovation has to meet a number of criteria, and one of them is to be useful to the people in need. In addition, in business, marketing success includes the possibility to solve customer pain points and develop interesting entrepreneurs’ stories. In this project, attention will be paid to Eargo, one of the new representatives of the hearing aid market. Despite the fact the company was founded and launched its product several years ago, not many people are aware of its propositions to customers.\n\nVena is the Forbes author who has been investigating the latest technological innovations, including those of the hearing aid market that promote life-changing experiences. There are many reasons for Vena to focus on the Eargo product as its success depends not only on technology and innovations but on an outstanding marketing company.\n\nMillions of people around the globe, including Americans, suffer from hearing loss or other hearing problems. Vena (2019) states that about 38 million Americans aged 18 and over officially report problematic hearing. The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders (NIDCD) contributes to the discussion of hearing loss, its predictors, and severity. Therefore, the solution offered by Eargo is a unique chance for the NIDCD and people in need to improve the quality of their life and find out a convenient, effective, and easy-to-use product. In the majority of cases, the Eargo models are introduced in a multi-prong manner (Vena, 2019).\n\nIts developers have investigated the needs of potential customers and came to the conclusion that people do not want to wear hearing aid devices if they may avoid it and related problems (battery life or comfort). The solution of Eargo is to create invisible products and help people hide their needs for hearing aid from the outer world.\n\nAlong with the level of comfort offered to clients, Eargo’s employees combine their supply with the value proposition. Eargo focuses on a number of aspects, including packaging and charging cases (Vena, 2019). In the chosen article, the author explains that the case may automatically change various models, use Bluetooth-enable systems, and sound sensitivity control, resulting in convenience and increased interest among customers (Vena, 2019). Price is one more aspect that attracts people’s attention in the hearing aid market. The latest investigations show that the price varies from $1,650 to $2,750 per device with a monthly payment of about $70-130.\n\nFinally, the marketing campaign of the product is strong due to the existing audio podcast and live webinars for the users of Facebook. Customers are able to develop their specific engagement philosophies and check for news and interesting offers any time they want. Therefore, Eargo is not only a significant technological innovation but a good social and medical device for people of different ages and social statuses.\n\nIn general, the world of business undergoes multiple changes regularly. The creation of a new product may be a failure for one company and a successful achievement for another organization. In the case of Eargo, the hearing aid device has a number of positive feedback and recommendations. Obtaining more than $50 million in funding, employees are able to introduce more effective approaches in marketing and health care. The solution to design a device that changes human lives is provocative each time, and the attempt taken by Eargo results in the establishment of new standards for other companies and their market strategies.\n\nReference\n\nVena, M.

      "Experience of a Retreat in the Spiritual Life Essay\n\nThe inner need to be alone with oneself has always guided people who wanted to achieve enlightenment. Suffice it to recall the famous examples of Gautama Buddha, who lived alone and attained nirvana, or Jesus Christ, who fasted for forty days. In many cultures, such seclusion is called a retreat and is seen as a way to explore oneself deeper. The time of a retreat is used for meditation, prayer, or meditation. This essay will focus on how the practice of a one-time retreat can affect spiritual life.\n\nIn the pursuit of fleeting pleasures in the stream of daily worries, people do not always have time to understand the meaning of existence. The practice of retreat makes it possible to realize and accept this meaning to find inner freedom. Fading away from the world and being alone is the ministry to God (Nouwen, 1995). During exercises, people try to go beyond habits, stereotypes, to overcome themselves, their emotional prohibitions, and restrictions, to break the existing blocks that prevent them from living a full life. In this sense, a retreat is a conscious attempt to organize one’s thoughts and protect oneself from reality.\n\nToday, the meaning of spiritual solitude has slightly changed its form. Whereas retreat used to be a significant part of the lives of many monks and prophets, today, it is more of recreational activity. To achieve a state of complete spiritual solitude, people often go to distant countries or visit specialized institutions. Depending on the religious culture, retreat practices vary greatly: retreats can be both individual and collective. Sometimes the retreat is accompanied by complete silence, but other times it, on the contrary, implies active live communication. Such solitude is reduced to almost continuous meditation, which is only occasionally interrupted by sleep and food.\n\nMy spiritual experience of retreat was connected, first of all, with rethinking myself. In a moment of loneliness, being a beginner in this field, I quickly caught myself thinking that I could not control the flow of my thoughts.\n\nHowever, immediately after the spiritual practice, there was an improvement in the perception of the present moment, attention, and consciousness, including the body’s feelings. This effect can be associated with short-term changes in dopamine and serotonin levels (Newberg, Wintering, Yamen, Zhong, Bowen, Averick, & Monti, 2018). Ordinary, rapidly changing everyday life has suddenly become more balanced and concentrated.\n\nIn a moment of silence and ritual, my mind was doing amazing things. It emphasized all the movements around me, the physical sensations, the contact with the air that touched my skin. At that moment, I had a bright feeling that the room was beginning to move, and I was with it. The masters asked me to be especially attentive to the process of my breathing, to concentrate on it. So, the state of trance enveloped me, and I started hearing inner voices.\n\nJust a week after the retreat began, I realized how beautiful the world was. It is a confusing feeling, but I felt like I had a vision at the atomic level. At that moment, I loved not only myself but everyone else around me. According to Nouwen (1995), this feeling seems to be the union with God. This feeling did not leave me for a long time, and these days I felt like the happiest person on the planet.\n\nEmphasizing all of the above, there are many religious ways to find yourself. In many cultures, there is a tendency towards isolation and spiritual loneliness to distract oneself from the bustle of the outside world. Spiritual practices of retreat today are somewhat different from what they used to be, but serve the same purpose. A retreat is a more potent form of meditation that can affect your world view and change values. This practice is closely linked to going beyond the comfort zone and discoveries. It is important not to lose this spiritual state after the course, but to learn to live with it.\n\nReferences\n\nNewberg, A. B., Wintering, N., Yaden, D.

      "America’s Moon Landing Program and Its Significance Research Paper\n\nNowadays, the success of the American Lunar mission Apollo 11, which resulted in the landing of a man on the Moon, is commonly regarded as an important milestone in the way of humanity’s technological advancement. Therefore, it indeed makes much sense to reassess, again and again, the significance of the mentioned historical event from different perspectives. This paper aims to do just that. In the aftermath of having researched the subject matter, the author expects to gain a better understanding of what was the main driving force behind the development in question.\n\nWhen it comes to reviewing the thematically relevant literature, concerned with the US-led Moon landing mission, it can hardly escape one’s attention that most authors make a point in explaining what were the specifics of the political climate on this planet at the time. That is, the fact that during the late 1960s-early 1970s, the Cold War between the US and USSR has reached the peak of its intensity.\n\nTherefore, back then the space exploration programs in both countries primarily served the cause of increasing the emotional appeal of Capitalism and Socialism, respectively. In 1961, the Soviets succeeded in launching the first man (Yuri Gagarin) into space and returning him safely back to earth. Thus, it is fully explainable why America decided to embark on the Lunar mission: this country needed to show to the whole world that it was still ahead of the USSR, in the technological and economic sense of this word.\n\nOn May 25, 1961, President John F. Kennedy addressed Congress with the message “On Urgent National Needs” while proclaiming that the country’s national priority was to land an American citizen on the Moon before the end of the decade. Throughout the next eight years, the nation continued to apply an extensive effort into ensuring that this objective will be achieved as scheduled. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) was put in charge of organizing the Lunar mission and overseeing the project’s sub-sequential phases.\n\nThe German-born aerospace engineer Werner von Braun was appointed to be in charge of designing the Saturn-5 rocket, which was to provide enough thrust to propel the Command and Lunar modules to the Moon. On their part, the Soviets were hoping to beat Americans in what later came to be known as the “Moon Race” (Logsdon 23). The former, however, we’re doomed to sustain a fiasco, in this regard. On July 16, 1969, the Apollo 11 mission was launched from Kennedy Space Center with three astronauts on board: Neil Armstrong, Michael Collins, and Edwin Aldrin. Their destination was the Earth’s only satellite. Four days later the mission has reached the Moon.\n\nThe Command module with Michael Collins inside was to continue orbiting the planet, whereas the rest of the crew took their places inside the Lunar lander (Eagle) and began descending. Even though it proved very challenging for Neil Armstrong and Edwin Aldrin to land Eagle on the surface of the Moon, they still managed to do it. Neil Armstrong was the first man in the history of humankind to set his foot on another planet.\n\nIn total, both astronauts had spent twenty-two hours on the Moon’s surface. While there, they collected about ten kilograms of Moon rocks and conducted several scientific experiments (Willems 167). Then, they crawled back into the Lunar module, launched themselves onto the orbit around the Moon inside the upper (detachable) part of it, and set the tiny capsule on the rendezvous course with the Command module. It has taken the astronauts another three days to make it back to Earth.\n\nIn total, NASA had sent six manned missions to the Moon, with the last of them having been launched in 1972 (Apollo 17). Following the launch of Apollo 12, the Soviets had effectively given up on trying to win in the “Moon Race” with America. Their Lunar rocket N-1 was cut into pieces and reduced into metal scrap. Thus, it will be logical to suggest that America’s victory in the “Moon Race” did contribute rather heavily towards bringing about the eventual defeat of the Soviets in the Cold War.\n\nThis simply could not be otherwise: by having landed a man on the Moon and brought it safely back to our planet, the US has proven itself to be technologically and economically superior to its main geopolitical rivalry. The USSR and Communist China were the only countries that refused to allow their citizens to have a live glimpse of the US-led Moon landings on TV. It must be mentioned that the historical event in question continues to spark a strong public controversy across the world. Many people believe that America’s Lunar mission was all faked. To prove the validity of their suggestion, they commonly refer to the seemingly incomprehensible aspects of how this mission is represented on film.\n\nFor example, those who doubt that the US was able to land a man on the Moon, point out the fact that there are no stars to be seen in the Moon’s black sky on the astronauts’ photos. They also suggest that, contrary to what should have been the case, the American flag on these photos appears to be moving, as if there was air all around (Grimes 6). Nevertheless, even moderately educated individuals will be able to refute such claims with ease. The main proof that American astronauts have indeed been to the Moon in the presence of a few laser reflectors on the planet’s surface. There was no other way to bring these reflectors to the Moon but using manned spaceflight. Most credible scientists have long ago testified to the full soundness of this statement.\n\nIn light of what has been said earlier, it will be appropriate to conclude this paper by suggesting that there are two dimensions to the actual significance of the Apollo Lunar missions: scientific and political. It is the truth that by landing a man on the Moon, the US has contributed rather substantially towards keeping humanity on the path of progress. At the same time, however, the concerned historical development would not have taken place, had it not been up to the Cold Word between America and the USSR through the 20 th century’s second part (Launius 168).\n\nHence, the foremost insight, yielded by this research: contrary to what many people assume to be the case, science is secondary to politics, at least in the cause-effect sense of this word. Therefore, the USSR may well be regarded as America’s unwilling collaborator in putting a man on the Moon. After all, the US government would indeed have very little reason to invest in the American Lunar program, had it not been suspected that the Soviets were planning to launch their Lunar mission.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGrimes, David. “On the Viability of Conspiratorial Beliefs.” PLoS One , vol. 11, no. 1, 2016, pp. 1-17.\n\nLaunius, Roger D. “First Moon Landing was Nearly a US–Soviet Mission.” Nature , vol. 571, no. 7764, 2019, pp. 167-168.\n\nLogsdon, John. “Winning the Moon Race.” Aerospace America , vol. 57, no. 7, 2019, pp. 20-37.\n\nWillems, Brian. “The Potential of the Past: First on the Moon.” Science Fiction Film and Television , vol. 9, no. 2, 2016, pp. 159-179.\n",
      "Artists’ Legal Advice Services Definition Report (Assessment)\n\nLike any other worker, artists require the support from communities as well as organizations that will give them some advice or even help financially. For this assignment, it was chosen to discuss Artists’ Legal Advice Services (ALAS), which is operated and managed by a team of volunteer law students and professional lawyers. The team members dedicate their time to offer advice to artists unable to pay for expensive consultations. The organization’s headquarters is located on 56 Wellesley Street West, Toronto, Ontario. ALAS has an official website that artists are encouraged to visit when seeking relevant information about the organization.\n\nThe help of ALAS is imperative to creative individuals because it provides advice from experienced individuals in the fields of arts and entertainment. Fostering the environment of support and collaboration is the main goal of the organization, especially given the complex social climate, challenged by such issues as the rights of minorities, the pay gap, racial discrimination, and so on. Since artists tend to reflect the social climate in their works, supporting them from the legal standpoint is important not only to prevent the mistreatment on the part of businesses or communities but also to ensure that negative situations do not occur in the future.\n\nAccording to ALAS’ website, artists can schedule appointments with the legal team. They usually take around thirty minutes, during which a lawyer will listen to the concerns of the client and provide summary advice or overall guidance targeted at solving any legal problems. It is imperative to mention that all consultations are free and artists are not forced to pay anything. However, there is a recommended donation of $20, which ALAS clients can make either in person or via PayPal. Through the use of the organization’s website, artists can fill in the form to schedule an appointment with a lawyer.\n\nThe contribution of ALAS should not be overlooked because artists’ unions are imperative for strengthening the side of labor and culturally empowering workers to enhance their work (D’Arcy, 1994). As mentioned in the article “When artists meet unions,” there is a need for collaborative effort between artists and unions: “artists must depict union life with respect and accuracy, and unionists need to learn to listen to artists and to negotiate clearly the terms of alliance” (D’Arcy, 1994, p. 21). ALAS has shown to foster collaboration with artists through holding events during which artists share their experiences and ask for the advice of the organization’s team. For instance, on January 30, 2018, ALAS held a “Music roundtable” that discussed the issues emerging performing artists when trying to engage in professional business (ALAS, 2018). Law advice was provided by Paul Sanderson from Sanderson Law, information on publishing and booking was offered by Adrian Battiston and Stefanie Purificati, while label advice was given by Laura Cappe from Royal Mountain Records.\n\nTo conclude, ALAS is an organization that provides legal support to creative individuals and offers artists an opportunity to resolve their problems. The fact that it works on a charitable basis is important to note because too many artists live on the poverty line, struggling to sustain their living. Being well-informed regarding issues of law is a weapon that any artist can use to his or her advantage, especially when it comes to avoiding challenging issues such as copyrights and intellectual property.\n\nReferences\n\nALAS.

      "The Bukhansan Mountain: The Quintessence of Korean Culture Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Abstract\n 2. Introduction\n 3. Historical Reference\n 4. Modern Korea as Seen from Bukhansan\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nAbstract\n\nThe present paper gives valuable insights into Korean history, culture and architecture observed through a journey up the Bukhansan Mountain. The national park of Bukhansan is full of historic buildings and monuments. Here a traveler can find Jinheung’s Sunsubi, a memorial commemorating the border inspection of King Jinheung; the Bukhansanseong Fortress, an eighteenth-century defensive structure; and many Buddhist Temples. The top of the mountain offers a view of a modern city with all its cultural and economic controversies. From the peeks of the Bukhansan Mountain, hikers can contemplate the shift from the standardized structures built in the late 20 th century towards preserving the national culture in the early 21 st century. In brief, for tourists who have a minimal amount of time, it would be beneficial to take a hike up the Bukhansan Mountain to get a complete picture of the Korean culture.\n\nIntroduction\n\nForeign visitors to Seoul are often amazed by its architecture due to the prevalence of uniformed high-rise apartment blocks. However, a closer look into some of the quieter neighborhoods, Buddhist temples, fortresses, and palaces reveals a rich heritage of ancient traditional, colonial, and modern architecture (Jackson, Koehler, & Jin-Hyuk, 2014). One of the most pleasant and convenient ways of contemplating Korea’s cultural legacy is to climb up the Bukhansan Mountain. Many historic sites, Buddhist temples, and cultural assets make this place one of the most popular tourist attractions in South Korea (Oh & Lee, 2016). The present paper offers a look at Bukhansan National Park as the quintessence of Korean culture, architecture, and history.\n\nHistorical Reference\n\nSeoul, the capital city of South Korea, is surrounded by many mountains as it helps the city’s defense. Bukhansan Mountain is located northwest of the city and is a national park. The mountain has three triangular peaks: Baegundae, Insubong, and Mangyeongdae, for this reason, the locals often refer to the mountain as “Samgaksan Mountain” (Oh & Lee, 2016).\n\nOne of the most important attractions of the Bukhansan Mountain is King Jinheung’s Sunsubi, a monument commemorating the border inspection by King Jinheung of Silla. The monument was built between 561 and 568 A.D. during the Three Kingdoms period (Jackson et al., 2014). The upper part of the monument is missing, while the lower part shows why and how King Jinheung visited the Bukhansan Mountain. This monument is an important cultural site as it contains one of the earliest Korean writings.\n\nSeoul got its original shape during the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910) when Taejo Yi Seong-gye (1335-1408) ordered to lay a new city (Yun, 2017). During this period Korea suffered many invasions, hence defense became a great concern for the kings of the Joseon Dynasty. While hiking up the Bukhansan Mountain, a traveler will surely come across one of the most remarkable memorials of this time, the Bukhansanseong Fortress. This fortress was built as a stone structure in 1711 for the emergency purposes of the kings and could stand independent of the capital city (Jackson et al., 2014).\n\nAs Oh and Lee (2016) point out, the Bukhansan Mountain is also home to many Buddhist temples, such as Beophwasa, Deokamsa, Nojeoksa, and Sukchunsa. All of the temples, while having a unique Korean style, are tributes to Chinese architecture. The temples are built under pungsu, the Korean adaptation of feng shui, where nature had the most fundamental influence. Mountains and rivers are crucial elements of pungsu, as they provide wind protection and water sources correspondingly. In short, Bukhansan Mountain provides excellent examples of cultural sights of all the main periods of Korean history.\n\nModern Korea as Seen from Bukhansan\n\nWhile hiking to the top of the Bukhansan Mountain can make any traveler forget the urban vanity and hustle, a look down from any of the three peaks changes everything. A large almost faceless modern metropolis, Seoul, rises before one’s eyes with the prevalence of uniformed high-rise apartment blocks. In the early 1990s, there arose a need for globalization, as the country’s growth was slowed tremendously ethnocentrism that had prevailed before (Yun, 2017). On the one hand, because of the tendency, Seoul began to expand in an economically effective way, thus adopting standardized structures. On the other hand, the city accepted a cosmopolitan tolerance to other cultures, with this intention many western-modeled buildings arose.\n\nIn the 2000s the development priorities shifted towards acquiring the image of a cultural city. At the beginning of the 21 st century, it occurred to researchers, that Seoul could attract global investments if the city shifted its focus “from manufacturing industries to cultural industries, and to promoting a higher quality of life” (Yun, 2017, p. 4). The result of this trend was a discourse alternation that led to designing Culture History Routes in the historic part of Seoul to preserve cultural heritage. These areas can also be seen from the top of Bukhansan Mountain and add a unique tinge to the grey picture of a modern city.\n\nFrom the top of the Bukhansan Mountain there comes a realization that due to the rapid urbanization of Seoul there appeared a need for recreation zones. Humans “maintain a stable mental state when the environment around them is comprised of at least 30% green” (Oh & Lee, 2016, p. 33). As artificial structures take up 80%-85% of Seoul, Bukhansan National Park serves as a significant environment and emotional purification zone for the citizens. In brief, while Bukhansan National park is a resting place for numerous cultural and historical sights, the views from the top of the mountains offer a picturesque view of modern South Korea.\n\nConclusion\n\nBuchanan National Park is a unique place that offers a short insight into Korean heritage. It allows travelers to look at Buddhist temples, historical monuments, and ancient buildings. Nevertheless, a view from the top of the mountain provides a picturesque scenery of Seoul, a modern metropolis. In conclusion, a hike up the Bukhansan Mountain offers a broad overview of Korean history and culture in a short period.\n\nReferences\n\nJackson, B., Koehler, R., & Jin-Hyuk, L. (2014).

      "Memory as a Topic of Modern Studies in Psychology Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Modern Studies: Research by Holt and Delvenne\n 3. Modern Studies: Research by Amso and Serif\n 4. Lessons Learnt\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nMemory is an interesting subject of research, as it includes a variety of topics that explain how people think and store information. Therefore, choosing two articles to study that directly deal with such a subject allows demonstrating both the current trends in memory research and the development of some of the authors mentioned by King (219). Learning from studies and reflecting on them may help increase awareness of the ongoing research directions within the psychology community.\n\nModern Studies: Research by Holt and Delvenne\n\nShort-term memory is the topic that is deeply relevant to storing information on a scale that permits recalling it only for a brief period. Holt and Delvenne present a research paper on the effect of rehearsing on memorization, stating that there is a connection between “spatial” attention, repetition, and short-term memory (59). Their research deals with conducting four different experiments that aim to show the effect of cues on the process of remembrance (Holt and Delvenne 55). Thus, it is possible to discuss the significant influence of positioned clues when rehearsing and repeating information.\n\nModern Studies: Research by Amso and Serif\n\nVisual attention is another important aspect of memory that allows concentrating on data and recalling it later. Also and Scerif discuss the effect of focusing on remembrance, stressing the “interplay of genetic and environmental influences on visual attention mechanisms,” which has an impact on the storage of information (616). Therefore, their paper may be relevant to a great variety of topics within memory research, with links to studies that deal with attention deficiency.\n\nLessons Learnt\n\nBoth chosen articles deal with the concept of memory and how using various tools and approaches may help to improve it. However, in addition to this, Amso and Scerif urge that improving memory is not the process that is achieved by memorization alone but instead requires a joint effort of different human actions (615). The findings of Holt and Delvenne also partially support this statement by demonstrating that experiment results vary when different cues are used (54). These conclusions may successfully connect the two different research papers.\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile memory, attention, and rehearsal may seem automatically connected, there are varieties of different supporting acts that help them achieve their effect. Recognizing that there may be a minimal number of processes, which do not affect others, is an essential part of carrying out research. This understanding makes important finding not only the cause and effect of results but also possible connections between those actions that may seem not relevant.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAmso, Dima, and Gaia Scerif. “The Attentive Brain: Insights from Developmental Cognitive Neuroscience.” Nature Reviews Neuroscience , vol. 16, no. 10, 2015, pp. 606-619.

      "Seamus Company’s Mobile App-Supported Solution Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Abstract\n 2. Proposed Solution\n 3. Related Works Review\n 4. Goals, Objectives, and Deliverables\n 5. Projected Timeline\n 6. Resources and Costs\n 7. Outcome\n 8. Justification and Proposal Highlights\n 9. References\n\nAbstract\n\nThe proposed project based on the development of a mobile application for learning grammar and supporting Seamus Company’s other products directly solves the problem of extending its product portfolio and focusing on innovation. The mobile application will address Seamus Company’s requirements as it will be cost-efficient, based on emerging technologies, and easily integrated into the system of the company’s products.\n\nThis application will support specific tasks from the company’s grammar books, using the same characters: Patricia Present, Calvin Continuous, Peter Past, and Petra Perfect. Seamus Company will benefit from applying the application through increasing the customer base and profits or sales. Thus, it is possible to expect increases in the company’s customer base by 15% and profits from promoting the application by 10%. The overall cost for completing the project will be $125,600, which is lower in comparison to the market’s averages. The reason for selecting this project is that the authors have more than ten years of experience in developing mobile applications and software for various clients.\n\nProposed Solution\n\nSeamus Company (SC) is facing the problem of integrating technology-supported solutions in order to contribute to innovation in the company and extending its product portfolio. The company is interested in receiving the solution that is based on the integration of the latest technologies in teaching grammar to address learning modules and students’ learning styles. Thus, the solution is expected to be cost-efficient and innovative.\n\nTo address these requirements, it is necessary to propose the design and development of mobile applications for learning grammar based on SC’s grammar books. The mobile application will work appropriately on iOS Android, and Windows platforms and be available for students on their smartphones, tablets, and laptops. The application will provide grammar-related activities and exercises for students from different grades, and they will be able to select their level. The grammar content will support topics and tasks from SC’s grammar books with the help of using the same familiar characters: Patricia Present, Calvin Continuous, Peter Past, and Petra Perfect.\n\nWhile implementing this solution, SC will expand the product portfolio with an innovative product that requires minimal costs to be designed. SC will not require implementing more expensive solutions like virtual reality, games, and simulations as these functions can be partially covered in the application. Therefore, SC will benefit from introducing the mobile application that can be sold along with other products as a supplement. The company’s goals regarding the expansion of the product portfolio based on emerging but cost-efficient technologies will be addressed.\n\nRelated Works Review\n\nMany publishing houses and companies specializing in producing learning tools and books for learning grammar and other language aspects have launched mobile applications to address their customers’ needs. According to the expert reviews by specialists from App Advice LLC, Bluster! designed by McGraw-Hill School Education Group is one of the most popular mobile applications in the field of learning grammar.\n\nIt is free and appropriate for school-aged users, but it also has paid add-ons (“Bluster!,” 2019). McGraw-Hill gains profit through advertising its books through this application and promoting add-ons. This review indicates the possibility of following the same model for SC.\n\nOne more publishing house that introduced a mobile application known as Mad Libs belongs to Penguin Group. The application is free, but it allows in-app purchases while providing school-aged users with opportunities to train their English grammar with the help of a game (“Mad Libs iOS app,” n.d.). The focus on promoting applications allows for attracting more users who need to spend only a few minutes to download the app, and this approach is also working for SC.\n\nBlufish LLC offered their variant of a grammar textbook while changing a traditional approach to presenting rules and exercises to the framework of a mobile application. The comparably low price of the app allowed for increasing the customer base interested in the product and loyal to the company (“English Grammar by Blufish LLC,” 2019). This model can also be imitated by SC to promote its other products and reach more potential customers.\n\nGoals, Objectives, and Deliverables\n\n  * Goal 1: SC will increase the company’s customer base and profits by developing an innovative mobile application for learning grammar.\n      + Objective 1: By the end of the third month of the project development, SC will develop and introduce the 100% completed mobile application for learning grammar.\n          o Deliverable 1: The first outcome to achieve is the discussion and development of the project’s objectives, plan, components, learning modules to include, and necessary resources.\n          o Deliverable 2: The second task is the design of the mobile app to address requirements and the integration of SC’s products with the app.\n          o Deliverable 3: The third task is the development of the mobile app with a focus on the target audience and determining components.\n      + Objective 2: By the end of the project development, SC will increase the company’s customer base by 15% and profits from promoting the app by 10%.\n          o Deliverable 1: The first task is the revision of the app to address customers’ needs.\n          o Deliverable 2: The second outcome is the expansion of the app functions and options.\n          o Deliverable 3: The third task is the development of more paid user-oriented add-ons.\n\nProjected Timeline\n\nDescription of milestones or deliverables                                      Duration   Projected start date  Anticipated end date\n                                                                               (hours)                                              \nDiscussion of objectives, a plan, components, learning modules, and resources                                                       \nMilestones:                                                                    64 hours   1 May 2019            10 May 2019         \n– creation of a plan                                                           40 hours   13 May 2019           17 May 2019         \n– allocation of resources (hardware, software)                                                                                      \nDesign of the mobile app                                                                                                            \nMilestones:                                                                    160 hours  20 May 2019           14 June 2019        \n– completed design                                                             40 hours   17 June 2019          21 June 2019        \n– integration of SC’s products with the app                                                                                         \nDevelopment of the mobile app                                                                                                       \nMilestones:                                                                    200 hours  24 June 2019          26 July 2019        \n– completed development                                                        40 hours   29 July 2019          2 August 2019       \n– testing and evaluation                                                                                                            \nRevision of the app                                                            40 hours   5 August 2019         9 August 2019       \nExpansion of the app functions and options                                     120 hours  12 August 2019        30 August 2019      \nDevelopment of paid add-ons                                                    120 hours  2 September 2019      20 September 2019   \n\n\nResources and Costs\n\nTo develop a mobile application, it is necessary to hire experts and apply hardware and software to design and develop the product. For this project, laptops, smartphones, tablets, software, servers, and web cloud services are expected to be used and paid for. The following table provides the list of different required sources with a focus on their costs to determine the budget for the product. Two servers will be purchased additionally for this project with an average price for each of $1,000 (Gildred, 2018). Thus, identified costs were estimated after retrieving the market information and focusing on average costs.\n\nResource                                  Quantity                                 Cost    \nLabor                                     3,296 hours (824 hours per 4 employees)  $100,000\nHardware (laptops, smartphones, tablets)  12 (different types)                     $14,000 \nServers                                   2                                        $2,000  \nWeb cloud services                        2                                        $3,000  \nSoftware                                  10 (different types)                     $6,000  \nInternet                                  6-8 months                               $600    \n                                          Total                                    $125,600\n\n\nOutcome\n\nThe effectiveness of the solution for the company will be measured in terms of its possibility to attract new customers and increase profitability.

      "Discourse: Argumentation and Exposition Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe definition of the term “argumentation” differs; however, in general, it describes a process of communication in which someone is providing supporting facts to justify an idea. Van Eemeren (2015) states that argumentation utilizes language to “justify or refute” a point the author of the argument is making (p. 226). Thus, it can be used to provide a critique for a certain suggestion. Additionally, Van Eemeren (2015) describes it as a verbal, social activity. The aim of it is to secure the argument as part of someone’s view on things.\n\nMain body\n\nThe Collins Dictionary describes exposition as an explanation of an idea or thought. In this way, the exposition is similar to a description that is often used in narratives (“Exposition”, n.d.). However, the distinct feature that differs exposition from explanation is the use of logic to structure the exposition. In addition, one can utilize analysis, contrast, comparisons, and definitions for proper exposition. The difference between an exposition and an argument is that the latter requires understanding the general idea that one tries to express without having a formed opinion on it.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe types of arguments, deductive and inductive, offer a distinctly different method of creating a viewpoint. Reed (2016) states that in deduction the process of building arguments begins from the idea as a whole. Then, from the general thought one begins to understand ideas that the thought consists of. Induction utilizes an approach in which one transfers from different parts of an idea to an overall understanding of it. Additionally, deductive argumentation implies that the truth of the premises leads to the conclusion being false, while inductive arguments involve stating the unlikeliness that the truth of the premise leads to the conclusion being false.\n\nReferences\n\nExposition .

      "Private Equity and Lack of Transparency Essay\n\nThe end of the 20th century was characterized by the rapid development of the private equity market. Numerous funds were created by private equity firms to privatize giant corporations and improve profits (Demaria 10). The rise of this tendency can be associated with the appearance of potent actors who concentrated significant sums of money in their hands and looked for an opportunity to invest them to generate revenue (Burmester 34). However, this very motif preconditioned the ambiguous nature of the phenomena of private equity and gave rise to numerous debates about its impact on the development of the economy.\n\nThere are diverse definitions of the given notion. Thus, private equity can be determined as specific not publicly traded investment funds organized by large institutional investors, university endowments, and wealthy individuals (Demaria 11). In other words, this sort of capital comes from accredited investors who can offer significant sums of money for extended periods hoping to derive benefit from this sort of deal (Burmester 23).\n\nThe majority of private equity firms engage in so-called leveraged buyouts when substantial sums are utilized with the primary aim to finance large purchases and own particular companies (Gadiesh and Hugh 65). Having conducted these transactions, private equity firms try to improve their states and revenues using a newly bought organization.\n\nAnother fact is that money invested in companies regarding private equity is not presented on the stock exchange. The given fact triggers numerous debates about the issue as it can also be associated with the lack of transparency and control. For instance, in 2015, claims to assess the functioning of the private equity industry emerged (Zeisberger et al. 56). To a greater degree, these were preconditioned by the high level of incomes and unprecedentedly giant salaries earned by employees working in the sphere (Burmester 45). At the same time, the use of money and assets that are not traded on a stock exchange complicates the monitoring of these firms functioning and results in their increased power to interfere with the work of other companies.\n\nMoreover, private equity firms demand a majority stake to ensure that their funds will be secured. In such a way, even getting much more money, companies might experience losses because of the lack of ownership and control over their finances (Kelly 70).\n\nParticipation of private actors means a significant loss of control as they set new strategies and approaches to team management (Kelly 78). Under these conditions, organizations become deprived of an opportunity to impact their development and become observers. The case of Simmons Mattress evidences the given problem. Having experienced a buyout, the company lost its ability to control the situation and turned into a source of cash for the private equity firm (Creswell).\n\nAltogether, private equity is one of the topical aspects of the modern business world. However, it should be considered a dangerous practice that lacks transparency. Moreover, it deprives other companies of an opportunity to control their functioning and finances which has a pernicious impact on their rise.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBurmester, Daniel.

Comparison between the Old and New Tall Building Structures\n 5. Problems concerning tall buildings and their possible solutions\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. References\n\nAbstract\n\nThe history of the tall building is very old. According to the Old Testament, in the City of Babel, people made a tower with bricks to save themselves from the flood. The tall buildings are the symbol of any country’s pride. This paper first tells about the historical background of tall buildings and discusses some famous high rise buildings. It further compares the structure of the buildings created in the past and present. The paper analyzes the problem in tall buildings and then discusses the rectification of those problems. It concludes that the advancement in computer and material science has made it possible to make high rise towers efficiently.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe modern-day tall buildings symbolize national pride rather than being the embodiment of corporate wealth. The erection of super-tall structures in the Middle East and Asia that supersede the famous high-rise structures like the Empire State Building and the American Towers etc. denotes the idea of projecting the status of a country at the global level.\n\nA building is a structure of walls, floors, roofs, and windows. “A ‘tall building ’is a multi-story structure in which most occupants depend on elevators [lifts] to reach their destinations. The most prominent tall buildings are called ‘high-rise buildings ’in most countries and ‘tower blocks ’in Britain and some European countries. The terms do not have internationally agreed definitions” (High-Rise Building: Definition, Development, and Use, 2009, p.1).\n\n“Generally, a high-rise structure is considered to be one that extends higher than the maximum reach of available fire-fighting equipment. In absolute numbers, this has been set variously between 75 feet (23 meters) and 100 feet (30 meters), 5 or about seven to ten stories (depending on the slab-to-slab distance between floors)” (High-Rise Building: Definition, Development, and Use, 2009, p.2).\n\nThesis Statement: Structure issues have been present in tall buildings for ages. This paper is an attempt to examine these structure issues under the following points:\n\n 1. History of tall buildings\n 2. Comparison between the old and new tall buildings’ structures with respect to the methods of construction, the material used, and their architectural designs\n 3. Problems occurring in tall buildings and possible solutions to minimize such problems\n\nHistory of tall buildings\n\nIt is mentioned in the Old Testament that after the Flood, people at that time wanted to create a new city by the name of Babel. They wanted a tower to be made which could reach heaven. That tower was made with bricks, stones, and tar (High-Rise Building: Definition, Development, and Use, 2009).\n\n 1. During the era of the Roman Empire and in the reign of Julius and Augustus Caesar, many apartment buildings were constructed. Collapsing buildings became a frequent story due to structural failure. As a result, the laws were passed, and the heights of the buildings were limited to first 70 feet and then to 60 feet.\n 2. The history of such buildings says that there have been many other tall structures like towers, pyramids, cathedrals, and castles, but skyscrapers were created only by the end of the 19 th century. One hundred and fifty years ago, the structure of the buildings in which people used to live or work was very different from today’s buildings. The height of such buildings used to be rarely over a flagpole.\n 3. In the middle of the 19 th century, two major developments took place that encouraged the construction of skyscrapers at a large level throughout the world:\n 1. \n     1. Elisha graves Otis, an American, invented the first elevator in 1853. This helped people to travel upwards speedily and without much effort as required in walking.\n     2. The steel frames were introduced as a substitute for cast iron and wood in the 1870s.\n\nThe two of the tallest buildings were constructed in 1930 and 1931. They were Chrysler Building (319 meters) in New York City and Empire State Building (381 meters). After this 40, 50, 60 story structures were constructed in the whole of the United States. In the late 19 th century, most of the buildings’ structure was based on steel frames (Moon et al., 2007).\n\nComparison between the Old and New Tall Building Structures\n\nThere have been many changes in the structure of the tall buildings since the very first high-rise building appeared. Presently, the structure and design made of glass, steel, and concrete is followed everywhere internationally. One of the main differences in the tall structures of the 1970s and 1980s is that the structural and architectural elements avoid regular repetition. In spite of the complexity involved in constructing the non-prismatic shapes, the past few decades have witnessed practicable use of products that are quite unusual in building the superstructures. Most of the non-orthogonal tall structures are erected with the purpose of marking them on the world map. These buildings generally have curved or organically shaped facades and distorted elevation. Architects have CAD modeling tools on hand, which is quite useful in constructing tall structures. In place of the conventional box form with rectilinear shape, modern architects are constructing many exciting and unexpected new shapes (Taranath, 2011)\n\nThe comparison can be made on the basis of the following three categories based on three generations of high-rise buildings:\n\n 1. First-generation: The external walls of these buildings were made of mainly stones and bricks. The use of cast iron was also prominent for decorative purposes.\n 1. The columns were made of cast iron, beams were made of steel or wrought iron, and floors were made of wood.\n 2. In the event of a fire explosion, floors could collapse, and the iron frame would not be that strong to hold anything.\n 3. A single stairway could be used for escaping from the floor.\n 1. Second generation: The Metropolitan Life Building (1909) and the Empire State Building (1931) belong to this generation. These buildings are the frame structures.\n 1. Riveted-steel columns and beams are used in the whole building.\n 2. These structures are considered extremely strong, but their floor space is not much attractive.\n 1. Third generation: Buildings which were constructed after World War II till today are the most current high-rise buildings.\n 1. Steel-Framed Core Construction: In such type of building construction, lightweight steel and concrete frames are used. In the center of these buildings, an inner load-bearing core is created. With this central code, the utilities and services of the buildings are attached.\n 2. Steel-Framed Tube Construction: Tube structures changed the design of steel-framed buildings. They are so strong that they can control the lateral forces of wind and the effects of the earthquake.\n 3. Reinforced Concrete Construction: Concrete, which is made tough against embedded metal, is known as reinforced concrete. It is very strong for any construction.\n\nProblems concerning tall buildings and their possible solutions\n\nA building has to be a secure place for working or living. Therefore, it is very important to focus on the probable tribulations that may arise during the construction of a tall structure and find their possible solutions.\n\n 1. Wind excitation: The most important factor in the construction of tall buildings is to choose the structural system that would defend against the lateral load. Tall buildings, being supple structures, need extra attention with respect to their response to wind excitation. “Therefore, their dynamic response to wind excitation is critical in assessing their loading and performance particularly with respect to buildings’ deflections and accelerations at the top occupied floors” (Taranath, 2011,p.452). There can be a cross-wind response and along-side response in this situation. However, the across-wind response is more pervasive in this background. The present-day computer-based geometric designing of tall buildings have transformed the shaping of tall structures perpetually (Taranath, 2011). Improving aerodynamic properties of tall buildings can lessen the effect of wind forces carried by them (Ali & Moon, 2007).\n 1. Comfort: The wind load can cause vibrating sway in the tall buildings. If the load is strong and constant, it may result in the development of cracks in the concrete and consequently make the structure fragile to further sway. There is a possibility of people to feel motion sickness in such buildings. Therefore, it is important to create aerodynamic structures to make them stronger against sway. While creating such tall structures, the frequency range should be kept under consideration (between 0.1-1.0HZ).\n 2. Load distribution: In a tall structure, load transfer from the surface to the foundation is influenced by all the significant stabilizing components of that building. The floor slabs are firm and unbending. Their bond with the vertical stabilizing components is helpful in dispensing the load between the mechanism that makes the tall structure firm and stable. However, it is important that the assumed solidity of the floor slabs should correspond with the real slab. The uncertain correspondence of slabs combined with the uneven load leads to force distribution, specifically in tall buildings.\n 3. Twisting and open cross-connections: To stabilize tall buildings, engineers use various stabilizing coordination in their construction. Generally, there is a stabilizing tower in the middle of the tall buildings. However, it is difficult to calculate problems related to load distribution at the center in cases of changes. The open cross-sections like U-shape and L-shape experience unbalanced pressure and are subject to unexpected distortion in the opened towers. The tall structures have an adverse effect due to larger rotation along the elevation. The twisting effect can lead to the displacement of the edges and overhanging in the axial and on the sides of the structure. However, the floor slabs work as supporting beams to avert this displacement.\n 4. Interaction between the soil and the foundation: The connection between the soil quality and tall structures is significant in view of the stability of the structure. Solid bedrock provides an entirely fixed foundation to a tall building. Foundations resting on the layer of clay are not considered as a permanent base for tall structures. In tall buildings, the piles are subject to move in a lateral direction and compress the soil due to their vulnerability to the vibrating sway. In such cases, it is important to maintain a stable bond between the soil and the piles to stabilize the structure.\n 5. Pierced shear wall: Shear walls are the firm stabilizing components of a tall building. It is evenly stiff, and it is easy to set up forces and moments and assume the linear pattern throughout the wall. However, the assumption of force distribution is not simple in pierced shear walls. Hence, it is wise to use an elastic method applicable to all types of pierced walls in common (Gustafsson & Hehir, 2005).\n\nConclusion\n\nOn the whole, the structure of tall buildings has been analyzed from many perspectives. It has been established that the advancement in computer and material science has given the solution for making taller and lighter buildings. Tuned Mass Damper is a very good solution for excessive wind-induced vibrations. The use of TMD has been beneficial for Taipei 101, and it has reduced the acceleration in the tower by 40% (Kourakis, 2005).\n\nExcept this, it is advisable that the structure should be able to bear the weight of the building in cases of accidents like fire. Other components of the building should protect it from collapsing immediately after the failure of any significant component (Taranath, 2011).\n\nReferences\n\nAli, M.M. & Moon K.S. (2007).

      "Subject-Verb Agreement Errors in Teacher’s Perspective Research Paper\n\nResearch Results and Their Analysis\n\nChallenges for students in subject–verb agreement\n\nThe test has revealed the fact that students have major issues in coordinating the subject and the verb in a sentence.

The test has provided the information concerning both the scale and the possible root causes of the problem. As most of the teachers have shown, a major part of the students fails to carry out the code switching process required to switch from Arabic, which is the students’ native language, to English and its exotic rules.\n\nWhy do students make mistakes in subject–verb agreement?\n\nA closer look at the results of the evaluation carried out among the students will reveal that in most cases, students are aware of the general rule, according to which a subject and a verb are joined in a sentence.\n\nThe fact that in most cases, students have little to no background knowledge on what a subject-verb agreement is does not seem to be a problem. Indeed, building knowledge on the subject from scratch is difficult, yet it still is possible with efficient guidance of the teacher and the enthusiasm of the student. The problem emerges when the need to explain the nature of the subject–verb agreement to the student appears. According to the test results, only 70% of all students at best master the subject–verb agreement within the required amount of time.\n\nIn addition, the study has also shown that students make most mistakes when it comes to practicing the newly acquired knowledge. To be more exact, in the process of writing and speaking, most students fail to pick the correct subject–verb combination. The aforementioned fact is especially remarkable when considering the evidence of students having no problem in identifying the subject in a sentence.\n\nThe aforementioned detail shows that students might need both more practice and a specific approach towards learning the pattern. More to the point, a strategy that will make them see the pattern in the subject–verb agreement is required. Hence, it can be suggested that a range of exercises, which show the correlation between the subject and the verb in a sentence, will help the students learn the principle of a subject–verb correlation.\n\nThe answers to the open questions provide a lot of food for thoughts as well. More to the point, since this type of questions is not related to a specific set of answers, the teachers are free to formulate their answers the way that they consider to be the most appropriate. Despite the length limitation, these answers are much more informative than the responses to the multiple choice questions.\n\nBased on the results of the test, it can be assumed that the key challenge faced by students in the process of learning the key principles of subject–verb agreement concerns understanding the mechanisms of coordination between the two. The test results show that students tend to memorize the rule instead of analyzing it, which leads to their further failure to apply the theory to a practical problem.\n\nHow to reduce these errors?\n\nIn addition to an impressive amount of information concerning the key obstacles, which students usually face when dealing with the issue of subject–verb agreement, the questionnaire filled out by teachers may also provides a range of ideas concerning the mans to improve the process of teaching students the subject–verb agreement rule. As it has been stressed above, the key complexity that students have to deal with concerns the lack of practice and the need for the teacher to prompt their intuitional understanding of the rule. Hence, two key strategies must be used to address the issue.\n\nFirst and most important, a number of drills must be carried out on a daily basis. By including small exercises, in the course of which students will drill the correct subject–verb agreement, a teacher will be able to help students develop a habit of applying the rule to practice.\n\nSecondly, a teacher must prompt the students to discover the rule on their own. It will be much more efficient if the students will come to a conclusion regarding the rule of subject–verb agreement on their own. Thus, instead of learning the rule by heart, they will develop an intuitional understanding of it, thus, being able to apply it even in the situations, which they have not dealt with yet (e.g., the use of a singular form of the verb in the sentences with a complex subject).\n\nIt should be noted, though, that the problem in question is not going to dissolve instantly. A teacher must get ready for hours of drilling exercises that students must complete until they develop the required reflexive skills, thus, making the process of coordinating the subject and the verb occur on a subconscious level. More to the point, students have to understand the mechanics of the process in order to develop the aforementioned skills. The more effort a teacher puts into developing the new strategy, the more efficient it is going to be.\n\nConclusion: When the Time to Make Changes Comes\n\nIntroducing ESL students to the issue of subject–verb agreement is very tricky and requires considerable patients from a teacher, along with an ability to be flexible enough. The latter quality is important for developing the strategies that will help every single student not only learn the basic rules of the subject–verb agreement by heart, but also to understand the mechanism of the subject–verb agreement, thus, being able to apply the acquired skills to practice. Therefore, as long as the teacher provides the students with the required drills and is capable of finding creative and efficient ways of explaining students the principles of the subject–verb agreement, efficient learning process is guaranteed.\n",
      "T-Shirt as Political Clothing and Its Message Essay\n\nThe article under discussion reflects on the notion of thinness and its increasingly growing popularity among young girls. The author considers this current tendency and tries to explain it through the lenses of anorexic girls who use dieting in pursuit of beauty standards. Johnson claims that fat is alien to any human body, making it shapeless and amorphous (652). At this point, thinness helps to wear the most beautiful clothes and make them fit better. This article proves the fact that clothes is a means of people’s self-expression. However, people can express not only their desire to look better but also their economical, cultural, and political views through their clothes. Let us consider a T-shirt as political clothing.\n\nAs a rule, a T-shirt is an attribute of casual style. However, it also can be a means of expression of a certain political message. According to Smith, “famous business people and politicians are known to be consistent with their wardrobe because it’s their brand identity” (par. 6).\n\nFor example, Zuckerberg, a Facebook CEO, owns about 20 grey T-shirts. Although it is not expressed directly, a dress is a trademark of a person’s attitudes. Being an intermediate color between black and white, grey is considered a neutral color. It is often preferred by business people to identify their personality. In particular, Zuckerberg’s preference for grey T-shirts can be regarded as a neutral position to politics or his liberal viewpoint.\n\nPersonally, I have no political T-shirts. Nevertheless, it is possible to suggest that such messages as an expression of a person’s political preference in support of a certain party can be sufficient to put on a T-shirt. In their turn, some politicians use a T-shirt as an attribute to provide in their election campaigns. In particular, writing their slogans calling to vote for a certain candidate and designing them in an appropriate color, politicians are likely to attract more population.\n\nFurthermore, several designers create clothes with the politicians’ names and prints. For instance, Sonia Rykiel, a prominent French designer, “made a political statement with a collegiate look with Obama” (“Revisiting Sonia Rykiel’s Most Memorable Catwalk Moments” par. 1).\n\nThis can be aimed at support of the idea of patriotism and proud in one’s country and promote political upbringing of adolescents. Another possible message can be associated with opposition to politics accepted by a state. People can wear T-shirts calling for prohibition of a political reform or a potential action revealed through an inscription or pictures that are typically marked by red color due to its aggressive nature.\n\nHowever, why a T-shirt? I guess that this form of clothing is one of the most popular ones nowadays. People choose it to wear on a daily basis and add some accessories when visiting formal meetings. Therefore, the expression of political views through a T-shirt becomes quite widespread among different people, either politicians or ordinary ones. Both of them can use prints, symbols, slogans, or specific colors to convey the message to the public.\n\nSpeaking of the effectiveness, it is essential to point out that this method can be regarded as one that is highly effective. On the one hand, it helps a sender to formulate his or her ideas and identify a political position. On the other hand, it serves as a useful tool to employ in political games.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nJohnson, Rebecca. “The Body Myth.” Vogue , vol. 186, no. 9, 1996, pp. 652-57.\n\n“ Revisiting Sonia Rykiel’s Most Memorable Catwalk Moments. ” The Telegraph . 2016.

      "The Art of Rhetoric Essay\n\nThe importance of persuasion has long been recognized by many philosophers and political leaders who could pursue different objectives (Hexter 3). In both ancient and modern times, the rhetoric is associated with the ability of a person to convince other people and prompt them to a certain action. It is possible to say that the definition of rhetoric has not evolved considerably. However, there is a significant difference that should not be overlooked.\n\nIn particular, ancient orators usually addressed a very limited group of people such as the Roman senators. In contrast, modern people often have to address very wide audiences. Their oral or written messages can be received by millions of people. This argument is particularly relevant if one speaks about political leaders or social activists. As a rule, they need to find arguments that can be understood and accepted by people who may represent different social, cultural, or religious groups. Therefore, the task to persuade can be much more challenging. Nevertheless, in both cases, the use of rhetoric can be critical for the long-term development of the society.\n\nWhile discussing the importance of rhetoric in the ancient world, one can mention Cicero’s speeches known as Catiline Orations (Pernot 109). They were aimed at exposing the plot against the government (Pernot 109).\n\nOverall, it is possible to argue that Cicero succeeded in averting the coup d’etat that could threaten the existence of the Roman Republic. More importantly, Cicero was able to convince the senators that they needed to take action against politicians who planned this coup d’etat. Overall, Cicero was able to change the course of the Roman history. To some degree, he shaped the development of the entire ancient world. This is one of the details that can be distinguished.\n\nAdditionally, it is possible to mention the speech that Winston Churchill made in 1940. It is known as the Blood, toil, tears and sweat . In particular, the British Prime Minister warned the public about the dangers of the war with the Third Reich. In particular, he noticed that the citizens of the country should be ready for hardships. More importantly, in his opinion, the victory in this war was critical for the survival of Great Britain in the long term. To a great extent, this integrity proved to be beneficial because people could put more trust in Churchill’s decisions and policies. Nowadays, this speech is regarded as a great example of rhetoric. These examples indicate that the skillful use of rhetoric techniques can have profound implications for the society. These are the main arguments that can be advanced.\n\nAristotle’s views on rhetoric continue to be influential because he identified the key methods that a person could use in order to change the opinion of the audience or persuade these people to do something (Gross and Walzer 197). They continue to be widely applied nowadays. On the whole, in his books, Aristotle argues that rhetoric can be defined as the ability of a person to choose a technique that can best influence the audience (Gross and Walzer 197; Aristotle 6).\n\nOverall, this philosopher implies that rhetoric can be viewed as a skill that every educated person should acquire and develop. One can say that his views profoundly influenced the practices of many educators who could represent different historical periods or cultures.\n\nIn his works Aristotle introduces such concepts as ethos, logos and pathos which can be viewed as different methods of appealing to the audience. In particular, a person can appeal to his/her credibility. In other words, the speaker needs to emphasize that he/she is sufficiently qualified to make arguments about a certain topic. Under such circumstances, speakers tend to refer to their expertise in a particular field.\n\nAdditionally, people can lay stress on the rational validity of their claims. They try to show that their claims are based on empirical evidence or logic. This approach seems to be the most convincing one because a person does not try to impose unfounded opinions on other people. Finally, an individual can attach importance to the emotions of the audience. Under such circumstances, a person tries to evoke the sympathy of the listeners.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, an orator should combine these appeals (Gross and Walzer 197). Nevertheless, there are situations when a person can give preference to only one of these methods (Gross and Walzer 197). In this case, much attention should be paid to the setting in which a certain speech is made (Aristotle 6). This is one of the issues that should not be overlooked.\n\nOverall, one can argue that Aristotle’s views continue to be influential, and the main concepts that he outlined in his works are important for analyzing the arguments put forward by other people. Furthermore, the knowledge of these concepts can help a person avoid the risk of being manipulated. Moreover, they are critical for understanding how to create more convincing oral or written messages that should be conveyed to wide audiences. These are the main details that can be singled out.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAristotle. Rhetoric, Philadelphia: Pennsylvania University Press, 2010.

Mobile systems and communication technologies have moved to a new level of development. Smartphones, tablet PCs, and other gadgets gradually replace push-button telephones. Besides, the role of media entertainment has been increased and now practically every owner of a smartphone has a mobile application, a fascinating game, or a social network for communication. “Clash of Clans” (COC) is a popular mobile game. It is famous for the innovation of unusual educational and competitive environment. The game makes one feel excited because of belonging to the great virtual society.\n\nThe game erases cultural and physical borders and makes communication easier and enjoyable in any place. In the following paper, we will concentrate on the history of mobile games, describe “Clash of Clans” and examine the reasons for its popularity, and, finally, we will discuss the disadvantages of mobile games.\n\nHistory of mobile games\n\nThe media entertainment market becomes more and more popular year by year. With the appearance of new gadgets, game developers are adapting their projects. Such an ordinary thing as a smartphone, which several years ago has been a technological wonder, now is taken for granted. With the help of some mechanical operations, an owner of a smartphone has an opportunity to dip into the atmosphere of another fantastic world. There are many positive features in mobile games. They are amusing and educational at the same time. Mobile games open the new era of life — digital communication and time spending.\n\nFor a range of reasons, the first mobile games were not so widespread as the contemporary versions. The first models of mobile phones with liquid crystal screens did not have color graphics or a powerful sound card. This fact determined the relative simplicity of mobile games. Nokia developed the first mobile game in 1997. It was Snake. The appearance of this game was significant progress for that time.\n\nThe distinctive features of the first games were the fact that they were free of charge and supplied together with a mobile phone. In other words, the popularity of one or another model depended upon the popularity of the model of the phone. The appearance of the phone with a camera was a new stage in mobile games development. New graphical possibilities and relatively high storage space gave to the developers an opportunity to produce games with higher resolution and graphics. For instance, such games that demanded the usage of the camera appeared. As a result, the Namco Company introduced a new fighting game.\n\nThe players could create characters with the help of personal photos. At that time, the Panasonic Company developed the game that was the analog of Tamagotchi in which a virtual animal was nourished by pictures of food. The characteristic features of this stage were the first sales of mobile games, which made a profit for their developers. At the beginning of the XXI century, many various applications from simple puzzles up to games in 3D format were represented in the world game market. At that time, arcade games with shortened playing sessions were especially popular.\n\nNowadays, with the appearance of smartphones and tablet computers, mobile games are viewed in another quality. After the implementation of 3D API technology, the development of mobile games in this format has become a promising trend in this sphere. At the same time, many contemporary mobile games fulfill entertainment as well as communicative functions. They enable players to exchange messages, create their clans, and even trade with each other.\n\nAmong an excellent variety of mobile games, it is possible to distinguish a separate category where players can communicate with each other. The existence of a chat system in this type of game provides players with additional opportunities.\n\nOne of such games is “Clash of Clans” – a strategy game that has been created by the Finnish developer Supercell. The game is for mobile devices, and it is free of charge. Playing the game via a mobile device is an easy and quick task. Almost everyone has a smartphone. The only thing one needs is access to the Internet. One can enjoy playing “Clash of Clans” everywhere: at home, in the car, in a café, and any other place (Islam, Islam and Mazumder 75).\n\nClash of Clans. The description of the game\n\n“Clash of Clans” is a real-time strategy that combines such genres as RTS and Tower Defense in which a player has to plan every action carefully. A player has not only to defend his base from other players but also to attack them. Apart from a single campaign, it is possible to take part in competitions, which imply battles with other users. No player of this game is protected against the attack. A player has to elaborate a definite tactic and strategy to be successful in this game. Besides, one has to create a feeling of confidence and collaboration in a team to be able to move forward.\n\nThe plot of the game, which is represented by a single company, is rather straightforward. It is necessary to fight against enemies conquering and destroying their fortresses. As for the rest, a player has an opportunity to act without any limitations. This fact is one of the reasons that has predetermined the success of the game. It is possible to be a peaceful builder and a founder of a powerful colony, or it is possible to become an aggressor and a conqueror. In such a way, a player is not restricted to any limitations. The role chosen by a user may reflect his or her individuality.\n\nOne of the most significant opportunities in the game is the ability to create their clan or to join the existing one. The access to a clan opens up new possibilities for a player. It gives a chance to take part in various battles among different alliances. Li and Counts state that “team play is found to be counter to the casual nature of the game, but competition acts as an effective motivator” (696). This statement is true for the game “Clash of Clans”. Apart from tactics and strategy, the success in the game drastically depends upon the clan.\n\nThis game has a smart cartoonish graphic and well-elaborated gameplay. The clan system and the chat are the essential factors that have predetermined the success of the game. The membership in a group increases the power of a players base significantly. At any moment, a player has an opportunity to ask for help from the members of his group. If there are experienced players in a team, who have been playing for a long time they can help with more powerful units.\n\nA system of continuous war is one more feature of the game. COC is one of the most popular top rank mobile games. After its release in 2012, it rapidly became the most popular game in Apple App Store (Tweedie par. 2). It is possible to distinguish several reasons that have predetermined its success and which are typical of many mobile games of this type.\n\nReasons for the popularity of mobile games\n\nThe most important reason is that any person has a communication need. In such kind of games, there is a chat system that enables players to communicate with each other. A necessity for communication may be compared with such basic human needs as water or food. It is possible to argue that the various acts of communication are present in our everyday life. Nevertheless, everyone has a job, hobby, and problems in the real life.\n\nThe act of communication in mobile games differs significantly from that taking place in the real life. In the game, players have common interests, which band people together. The communication is rather specific here. These games attract people from all over the world who have never seen each other before. In such a way, there are no social prejudices in their interaction. It helps shut-in personalities to loosen up. There is no social inequality in mobile games.\n\nFor instance, a top manager of a huge corporation and a student may be the members of one clan, and the only difference between them lies in the levels of their virtual characters. At the same time, the user obtains new knowledge concerning one or another aspect of the game while communicating with other players.\n\n“Clash of Clans” enhances communication between people. I would like to provide an example from my life to exemplify this reason. I like playing COC everywhere. I can sit on the bench in the yard and enjoy my favorite game. Two Japanese girls live in the same area. Once, they noticed me when I was playing the game. We started a conversation because they recognized the game. COC is popular in their country. That is why they decided to speak to me and discuss it. This situation exemplifies the first reason as well as leads to the understanding of the second one.\n\nThe second reason, which makes these games attractive lies in the fact that a man is a social creature. He or she needs assistance from friends. Many people are lonely in the real life. At the same time, new contacts are quite natural in online games. Players are more sociable when they belong to a particular group that represents one clan or unity in a game. The need to create a society even in virtual reality exemplifies the phenomenon when one is alone, but the game renders the feeling of belonging to the community (Li and Counts 697). Such a function of the game proves the fact that a man, as a social creature, finds any possible means to interact with others.\n\nThe next reason, which may be distinguished, is self-actualization. Quite frequently, a person is not satisfied with his or her real occupation while nothing is impossible in virtual reality. The development of a character and the implementation of a goal is a possibility for an ambitious person to realize his potential. Regardless of his status in the real life, a mobile game helps a person to become the best hero. Digging into the atmosphere of virtual reality a person forgets his problems and troubles finding himself in the world where he can fully realize himself.\n\nMoreover, there is a lack of freedom in the real world while there is no restriction in the world of fantasy. A user has an opportunity to choose the behavioral strategy that cannot be realized in the existing life. Besides, at any moment a player can project himself into another character.\n\nIt is possible to say that all the factors mentioned above are present in the mobile game, which is called “Clash of Clans.” Besides, the mere existence of such a game promotes different connections between people. Apart from the particular communication that aims at various game activities such as the development of a common strategy or participation in a definite event, the players of this game create different groups based on other chat platforms.\n\nIt may serve as evidence that those people who have a general idea have a thirst for communication. The professional chat platforms provide many opportunities that are absent in chat systems integrated into mobile games. For instance, the creation of a definite group or photo and video sharing. Sometimes, there is a need to distinguish between several topics of communication. In the majority of web communities, there are many helpful hints given by experienced players to newcomers.\n\nDangers and disadvantages of mobiles games\n\nMobile games have their disadvantages as well. The primary hazard, which is hidden in online games, is their possibility to cause addiction. Like any drug or alcohol, mobile entertainments hurt a person. Being addicted to mobile games, a person completely loses the touch with reality and even refuses food and sleep. Psychologists prove that children who experience low self-confidence are more likely to become addicted. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises parents to allow children to play no more than two hours per day (“Hooked: The Attraction of Casual Mobile Games” 3). Excessive playing is a severe psychiatric deviation, which requires medical treatment.\n\nPreschool children and adolescents represent a separate at-risk group. While an adult person can resist excessive playing, the childish mentality, which is not fully-fledged completely, comes under the influence of online games. It also should be mentioned that the sense of time of an adult person differs from that of a child. An adolescent may spend several hours playing computer games thinking that he spends only several minutes. There are many cases of crime commitments by adolescents with computer dependency.\n\nAt the same time, there is a particular financial danger from mobile games. The fact that a mobile game is free of charge does not suggest that there is no need to spend money on successful playing. For instance, equipment, resources, virtual buildings, virtual animals can be purchased for real money. The majority of online games provide this kind of service. There is a category of players who earn money by playing. In such a way, even the distribution of free programs implies a significant material benefit for the software developer (Islam, Islam, and Mazumder 75). There are many cases when a computer addicted person spends large sums of money to develop his character as quickly as possible.\n\nAnother negative side, which is also worth mentioning, is the fact that mobile games promote a lack of self-trust. A child used to be a hero in a game, and he or she is confused after facing the reality, which leads to self-doubt, irritation, and depression.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is necessary to mention that mobile games are rather useful in simulating various educational scenarios. As Schmitz et al. put it “using authentic game scenarios based on the patterns Physical Navigation, Collaborative Actions and Roleplaying can be successful in training younger school children” (169). Lu et al. state that “advances in mobile technologies and the popularity of handheld devices have opened up new accessibility opportunities for education” (101).\n\nMobile games, such as COC, band people together. At the same time, the problem of excessive playing also exists and it should not be neglected. It is significant to familiarize players with the dangers concerning too much playing. As a variant, game producers can set a limited timing for playing. One more solution is to allow free play for a particular time and then require a high fee for continuation. Mobile games represent a prominent step towards technological development. It is a new form of communication that unites people. “Clash of Clans” makes people closer despite their location, nationality, or personal beliefs.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHooked: The Attraction of Casual Mobile Games. n.d.

      "Leadership Theories in Organizations: Built Environment Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nNo known civilization in the history of mankind has ever claimed to exist without leaders. From the ancient Greek civilizations to the 21st-century global arena, leaders have always held the capacity to influence the destiny of their respective societies, institutions, and organizations. However, what amazes many leadership scholars is the admittance that the formal study of leadership is a relatively new phenomenon when evaluated in relation to other fields of interest (Bennis, 2007). Large volumes of literature have been generated from the scholarly works of researchers interested in the study of leadership. As leadership scholars become more proficient in the field of administration, innovative definitions and paradigms of leadership have been introduced, and new strategies intended to assist individuals in understanding the concept of leadership have been adopted (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). Nonetheless, the field of administration remains largely unformed despite the numerous studies that have been accomplished on the topic (Hackman & Wageman, 2007). This essay purposes to critically evaluate and discuss some of the existing leadership theories in organizations while laying a particular emphasis on the built environment.\n\nAccording to Hackman & Wageman (2007), the concept of leadership is “extraordinarily important both as a social phenomenon and as a subject for scholarly research and theory” (p. 43). Bennis (2007) argued that leadership affects and influences the quality of our lives to the core, yet individuals always tend to forget its immense importance. Indeed, Bennis was of the opinion that “…leadership always matters, and it has never mattered more than it does now” (p. 2). Despite the importance, there are no generally established descriptions of what leadership is, no overriding paradigm for studying the concept, and there exists minimal concurrence about the best approaches for developing and exercising leadership (Hackman & Wageman, 2007). This scenario calls for a critical evaluation of the existing leadership theories with a view of demonstrating how these theories can be used to comprehend leadership in organizations, especially in the built environment.\n\nDefining Leadership\n\nAs already mentioned, leadership scholars have, to date, failed to come up with an all-encompassing definition of leadership. It is imperative to note that leadership is one of the most significant characteristics of organizational context. Nonetheless, defining the concept has remained a challenging undertaking, with much of the existing literature on leadership defining it in relation to the context and field of use (Avolio, 2007). According to Giuliani & Kurson (2002), leadership can be defined as the manner and approach of offering direction, implementing plans and strategies, and motivating individuals. It can also be described as a process of social influence in which one individual can solicit the assistance and support of the other in the execution of a common task. Northouse (2004) argues that leadership can be defined in terms of the focus of group processes, personality perspective, actions or behaviors, power relationships between the leader and followers, skills perspective, and as an instrument of goal achievement.\n\nContrary to popular belief, “leadership isn’t mystical and mysterious. It has nothing to do with having charisma or other exotic personality traits. It is not the province of a chosen few” (Kotter, 1998 p. 37). Many people have been quick to equate leadership with management. However, the two plays distinctive and complementary functions in the organizational context. While power is about dealing with complexity in organizations, leadership, by contrast, entails negotiating with change (Kotter, 1998). While both management and leadership are critically important to achieving success, organizational leadership has become more critical in recent years since the modern business environment has increasingly become competitive and volatile. Consequently, more changes in organizations always require more supervision.\n\nA brief overview of Leadership in the Built Environment\n\nAccording to Chan & Chan (2005), one of the most significant areas receiving comparatively little attention in the built environment is leadership. However, it is essential to note that direction in the construction industry is as critically important as leadership in other critical sectors of the economy, such as banking and finance. As is often the case in different sectors, leadership is often regarded as a social exchange course of action in a leader-follower relationship in the built environment. Chan and Chan argue that direction, in conjunction with issues of socio-economic and cultural variations, has been found to inflict considerable influence on the performance of construction projects, including determining the success of projects in the built environment.\n\nBusiness entities in the built industry have been facing enormous problems and difficult situations in today’s swiftly changing environment. As it is the case in other sectors, such pressures and challenges have ultimately urged business leaders in the built environment to “become more responsive and flexible, to proactively adapt and keep pace with the changes” (Chan & Chan, 2005 p. 413). The built environment, also known as the construction industry, is remarkably characterized by its pulsating and rapidly changing climate on a global level. In such circumstances, an adequate understanding of the leadership theories by organizational leaders in the built environment is essential to ensure efficiency, good working relations, and success in the projects undertaken. Indeed, good leadership is needed more in the built areas than in many other sectors since it is always the norm of professional personnel in this field to meet specific requirements of time, budget, quality, and safety. According to Kotter (1998), more changes in organizations always require more leadership. The nature of the jobs in the built environment is characterized by recurrent changes in working environments, and therefore, good leadership is needed to make the person more flexible, receptive, and adaptive to deciphering challenges with new strategies of thinking (Chan & Chan, 2005). This calls for a thorough understanding of leadership theories.\n\nLeadership Theories in Organizational context\n\nThere are as numerous theories of leadership as there are descriptions and definitions of leadership. While the multiple leadership theories can be graded into several groups, numerous variations and discrepancies exist in each sub-category of leadership theory (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). According to Northouse (2004), early leadership theories centered on the qualities and characteristics that distinguished leaders from their followers, while subsequent leadership theories focussed on other variables such as the leadership context, situational influences, and skill level. For purposes of this discussion, various leadership theories will be classified into several broad groups, namely the grand man theories, trait theories, behavioral theories, situational theories, management theories, relationship theories, and participative theories.\n\nThe Great Man Theories\n\nThe grand man theories are founded on the assumption that the capacity of leadership is intrinsic – that leader is born, not made (Northouse, 2004). These theories are also based on the belief that great leaders will arise in societies once they are needed to do so by existing conditions. Most of these theories often depict leaders as heroic and mythic. During the conception of these theories, leadership was primarily considered to be a quality that was innately male, hence the term “Great Man.” Although these theories have been reflected in military and political leadership, their effectiveness in the 21st century built environment remains somewhat limited. In the modern business environment, any leadership theory that chiefly relies on patriarchal dispositions and family pedigree to lead organizations rather than laid down strategies in leader-follower relations is bound to fail. According to Avolio (2007) and Kotter (1998), organizational leadership is no longer viewed in the context of mystical or mysterious powers.\n\nTrait Theories\n\nTrait theorists are in general consensus that individuals are born with some intrinsic characteristics that are predominantly suitable for leadership. The theory further assumes that individuals who make good leaders are born with the right combination of traits (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). According to Northouse (2004), early studies on leadership were mostly based on the identification of characteristics and traits thought to be inherent to successful leaders. Some of the character traits identified as critical to leaders include adaptability to situations, alertness to social environments, ambition and accomplishment-orientation, Assertiveness and decisiveness, dependability, dominant, energetic, persistent, high levels of stress tolerance, self-confidence, and willingness to take responsibility (Northouse, 2004).\n\nAccording to the trait theory, some of the skills possessed by leaders include cleverness, conceptually skilled, creativeness, good communication skills, diplomacy and tact, high level of organization, persuasiveness, knowledge about group tasks, and excellent social skills. Other essential traits identified by trait theorists include emotional stability and composure, capacity to admit error, good interpersonal skills, and a comprehensive intellectual breadth. Bennis (2007) seems to agree with the assertions made by trait theorists but includes other traits such as creativity and charisma. However, Bennis argues that “psychologists have not sorted out which traits define leaders or whether leadership exists outside of specific situations” (p. 3)\n\nThe above character traits and skills are fundamental constituents of leadership in any field or sector in society, including the built environment. Indeed, leaders in the built environment must be flexible enough to adapt to diverse situations and social environments since most of their work entails working in cross-cultural environments (Chan & Chan, 2005). For example, many architects, structural engineers, and building constructors are often required to work on foreign assignments that require them to relocate to another country in line with the needs and requirements of the contract or project. As such, these character traits and skills will go a long way in assisting the leaders in the built environment to not only lead and manage individuals that are culturally and socially diverse but also to become more receptive and flexible to the following changes (Chan & Chan, 2005). Leaders in the built environment must have the capacity to adjust and keep pace with the ever-changing environment. However, this theory ignores situational and learned influences in leadership. Avolio (2007) decries such leadership theories that “frequently focus on the leaders to the exclusion of other equally important components of the leadership process” (p. 25).\n\nBehavioral theories\n\nBehavioral theories contradict the Great Man theories in assuming that leaders are made, not born. Behavioral approaches also believe that successful leadership is ultimately based on definable and learnable behavior on the part of the leader. According to Northouse (2004), behavioral theories of organizational leadership are interested in evaluating the actions of leaders rather than seeking some inborn character traits, internal states, or capabilities. Deeply rooted in behaviorism, these theories suggest that individuals can actively learn the desired leadership traits and characteristics through teaching and observation (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). Behavioral approaches can be described as postmodernist by their recognition of the fact that effective leadership is achieved through a learning process rather than inherent capabilities. Behavioral theorists also view leadership skills as a pattern of motives rather than a set of intrinsic traits. Consequently, behavioral theories open the channels to leadership development and training.\n\nSome of the most commonly used behavioral theories include the role theory and managerial grid theory (Northouse, 2004). The former theory assumes that individuals define roles and expectations for themselves and other individuals based on social learning and reading processes. In the built environment, leaders must always thrive on forming expectations about the responsibilities that they and their followers will play to succeed in a specific project. The leaders in the built environment must have the capacity to ingeniously encourage their followers to operate within the role expectations that have been designed for them. The managerial grid theory is chiefly concerned with the power and ability of a leader to strike a balance between taking care of the needs of followers and getting the work done (Northouse, 2004). This is an essential concept in leadership within the built environment since it determines the success and failure levels of building projects. The managerial grid has several variables that include poor management, authority-compliance, country club management, middle of the road management, and team management (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). Many leaders operating within the built environment, especially in developing countries, have been known to use the authority-compliance variable to get work done. In this variable, strong emphasis is put on getting the job done, but with little or no concern at all for the employees who are mostly semi-skilled and impoverished. Reliable experiences point to the fact that most Indian contractors use this particular variable that focuses on the efficiency of completing a project at the expense of employee satisfaction. Consequently, this form of leadership is mostly viewed as a form of exploitation (Northouse, 2004).\n\nParticipative Theories\n\nParticipative leadership theories assume that involving all stakeholders in the decision-making process enhances the understanding of all the issues affected by the individuals who must carry out the activities (Northouse, 2004). The basic presuppositions of the theories suggest that not only do individuals become more committed to actions that involve them in decision-making processes, but they also compete less and corroborate more when they work on mutual goals. According to the theories, decisions made by all stakeholders are more binding than decisions that are made by one individual. The latter assumption reinforces Avolio’s (2007) assertion that leadership must also be viewed in terms of the followers as well as the context in which it takes place. Some of the most commonly used participative theories include Lewin’s leadership styles and Likert’s leadership styles.\n\nIn the built environment, a participative leader must never be seen to take autocratic decisions. Instead, he must involve other organizational followers in the leadership process, a situation that Avolio (2007) correlates with improved organizational performance and success. This form of leadership is useful in many fields that utilize highly skilled and structured labor, such as architecture and building Technology, whereby the employees are given an opportunity to propose a decision but the group leader holds the final say on its implementation depending on a multiplicity of other factors such as viability, cost, and timeframe (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). In some participatory leadership models, the leader may decide to delegate all decision making processes to the team (Northouse, 2004). However, this is rarely the case in the built environment due to the nature of the tasks handled and the experience required (Chan & Chan, 2005). A participatory leader must reveal a well-ingrained capacity to sell a particular organizational concept to the team, including the ability to clearly define and describe the objectives and aspirations of such an idea. However, corporate leaders practicing participative leadership must never ask for opinions from employees and then go ahead to overlook them as such a scenario is more likely to occasion cynicism and perceptions of betrayal. Consecutive studies and experience point to the fact that participative leadership may fail to work in less structured, low skilled, labor-intensive built environments as the high number of employees may fail to make a decision within the required timeframe (Chan & Chan, 2005).\n\nSituational Leadership Theories\n\nSituational theories suggest that organizational leaders choose the most excellent course of action based on a multiplicity of situational factors (Northouse, 2004). Some of the most commonly used situational theories in organizational context include Hersey and Blanchard’s theory of Situational Leadership, the Normative Model by Vroom and Yetton, and the Path-Goal Theory of Leadership by Robert House. According to situational theorists, situational decisions are affected by a wide allay of factors, including the motivation and capacity of followers, leader-follower relationships, leader’s perceptions of his or her follower’s, leader’s perceptions of own self, stress levels, mood swings, and other situational factors (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). Some situational variables that are required for effective leadership include subordinate effort, subordinate ability and capacity, role clarity, organization of work, cooperation and cohesiveness, resources and support, and external coordination.\n\nThe above critical points on situational leadership reinforce Bennis (2007) assertions that leaders can never exist in a vacuum. According to Bennis, “leadership is grounded in a relationship. In its simplest form, it is a tripod – a leader or leaders, followers, and the common goal they want to achieve” (p. 3). These models of leadership are well represented in the building environment, especially in building construction where leaders mainly concentrate on such influences as developing and reinforcing external relationships, acquirement of resources, managing the demands of subordinates, and managing the existing structure and cultural orientations of the group (Chan & Chan, 2005). In essence, these theories postulate that the actions of a leader within the organizational context are primarily dependent on the characteristics and aspects of the situation in which he operates (Northouse, 2004).\n\nManagement Theories\n\nThe management theories, also identified as Transactional theories, lay their emphasis on the function of supervision, organization, and team performance (Northouse, 2004). The concept of leadership in many of these theories is based on an arrangement of reward and punishment. Most of these theories are often utilized in business organizations with a view of rewarding successful employees and reprimanding failures. Transactional theories assume that a transparent chain of command assists organizations to function correctly. Transactional leadership also requires subordinates must follow the rules set by organizational leaders since their contractual agreement facilitates them to cede all authority to their leaders (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002). Although punishments are not declared openly, they are well understood by subordinates, and formal channels of discipline are usually entrenched in the rules and regulations of the organization. Rewards include salary and other benefits.\n\nIn the built environment, transactional leadership models are rampantly used to formalize leader-employee relations. The subordinates receive a salary package and other benefits at the expense of ceding their authority to the leaders. Once work is allocated by the transactional leader, the associates are considered to be entirely accountable for the job, whether or not they have the capacity and resources needed to carry it out (Northouse, 2004). Ultimately, the subordinate is considered to err when things don’t work out as initially planned. According to Northouse, most transactional leaders often utilize the principle of management by exception, meaning that processes and activities working usually are left undisturbed. A study conducted by Chan & Chan (2005) on building experts in the construction industry revealed that the three transactional factors, namely contingent reward, passive management by exception and active rule by exception, are considerably associated with leadership outcomes of employee satisfaction and motivation, extra effort on the part of employees and leader effectiveness.\n\nRelationship Theories\n\nRelationship theories lay particular emphasis on the working relations formed due to constant interactions between organizational leaders and followers. There are also known as transformational theories. Transformational leaders motivate and encourage individuals by assisting them to recognize the significance and higher good of the task (Northouse, 2004). While transformational leaders are mainly centered on the performance of organizational members, they are also concerned with assisting individual employees in fulfilling their respective potentials in the corporate context. Examples of relationship theories include Bass’ Transformational Leadership Theory, Burns’ Transformational Leadership theory, and Kouzes & Posner’s Leadership Participation Theory.\n\nTransformational theories have been rampantly used in the built environment. In any particular field of leadership, individuals have been known to go after a person who inspires them (Northouse, 2004). Leaders have also been known to utilize enthusiasm and energy to get things done in the organizational setting. In essence, transformational leaders care about their employees’ wellbeing while at the same time ensures that work is done to the required level. They must therefore be able to develop the vision, sell it to their followers, and lead from the front. The study by Chan & Chan (2005) on building professionals in the built environment revealed that Bass’ transformational leadership theory led to higher levels of organizational performance and employee satisfaction than transactional leadership.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the above discussion on leadership theories, it is clear that the agenda of leadership studies and research has been evolving from a focal point of internal dispositions and innate characteristics associated with successful leaders to broader suggestions that emphasize leadership behaviors, attributes, and the social contexts in which both leaders and followers are enthusiastically entrenched and interact over time (Avolio, 2007). As already mentioned, there exists a wide range of literature on leadership, which remains undifferentiated. The immense task ahead for leadership scholars of the 21st century is to come up with useful benchmarks that will evaluate direction in the context of both leaders and followers. As Bennis (2007) argued, leadership does not subsist in a vacuum. It is up to the leading scholars to come up with a new leadership model that will try to answer the needs and requirements of the ever-changing business environment while taking care of all the aspects that come into play to make a particular leader effective.\n\nList of References\n\nApril, K.

      "Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main Body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe article by Casey Hayden and Mary king seeks to ameliorate the position of women in the society and the formation of movements as an avenue to fight for their rights. They draw an analogy on the treatment of women in the society and the treatment of Negroes. They argue that women find themselves in common law caste that forces them to operate in a hierarchical power structure which alienates them not only in public situations but also in personal situations.\n\nMain Body\n\nThey identified the following as the factors that bedevil women in the society; caste system that is not institutionalized by law, which women can withdraw from any situation or even overthrow, and biological difference. They discussed it in the following three dimensions;\n\nHaving learned from the movement to think radically about the personal worth and abilities of people whose role in society had gone unchallenged before, a lot of women in the movement have begun trying to apply those lessons to their own relations with men. (Hayden and King 1).\n\nInstitutions; there have been questions about societal institutions that shape the perspectives of men and women, these has led to people experiencing with different forms of child bearing patterns.\n\nConclusion\n\nWomen and the problems of work; the unconventional caste system in the society clearly stipulates the roles that are assigned to men and women. This role definition range from who cleans leadership house, who occupies leadership position to who does secretarial work. There are also problems with the association among women especial the black and white ones (Hayden and King 1).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHayden, Casey and King, Mary . “Sex and Caste: A Kind of Memo.” In “Taking’ it to the Streets”: A Sixties Reader by Alexander Bloom & Wini Breines, (Eds) .

Shape My Mind Frame: The Magazine World vs. Reality\n 3. A Sociable Superman Is Looking for a Charming Superwoman\n 4. Conclusion: Opening Your Eyes\n 5. Reference List\n\nIntroduction: Men and Women. Searching for the Points of Contact\n\nPeople have always been dependent on the opinion of the most authoritative sources. Instead of shaping their own vision of the world, they tend to listen to the pieces of advice given by the gurus of the spheres they are interested in. Thus, although the modern world is highly concerned with the impact of the mass media on people’s ideas, the magazine articles impose the ideas that are most profitable for the owners of the magazines, which results in creating another trend in fashion.\n\nConsidering two articles taken from two separate magazines, one can realize whether magazines impose the necessary vision of the world on the people reading the articles and whether this influences the opinion of the public to a considerable degree.\n\nIt would be a good idea to consider the opinion concerning one of the most important issues of the modern world – the aspect of physical health and physical attractiveness, as known as fitness. There is no secret that once set the trend for a trimmed and fit figure, magazines offered a number of articles that worshipped the ideal figure and suggested a number of means to improve what does not fit the “standard”. In the recent issues of Men’s Health and Women’s Health, the aspect of fitness was raised once again in the articles entitled Ge t Fit Tricks and Muscle: The Next Level.\n\nShape My Mind Frame: The Magazine World vs. Reality\n\nAccording to the most recent data obtained from the research in the sphere of mass media, the impact of the latter is truly incredible. It offers the most insistent viewpoint without being hindered at all. Why so, would the audience ask; the answer is rather simple. Guarded by the law of the States, the press is free to express their opinion openly: “In the United States of America media is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution” (Siegmund 2008, 3), which explains a lot.\n\nGuarded by the law, the mass media is practically invincible to any outside influence, which means that the opinion expressed in the articles is fully imposed by the magazines in which they are printed. It must be mentioned that the situation is becoming even more complicated as various means of imposing the magazine opinion on the population are utilized – according to Hancock (2001), the varieties of ways include language, style, images, headlines, and especially editorial comments (25).\n\nA Sociable Superman Is Looking for a Charming Superwoman\n\nConsidering the articles mentioned more closely, one can notice that the opinions presented in the magazines actually dub each other. This means that the articles suggested in both magazines offer the viewpoint that is most profitable for the magazines at the moment. Tracking the elements of the plurality of opinions in the articles, one is doomed to a failure – the ideas offered by the magazines are a one-way movement road to the bliss of the publisher and sponsor.\n\nWhat can be traced in both articles is longing for the standard of beauty imposed by a range of other magazines and other mass media long before. A quick glance at the articles in Women’s Health is enough to trace the evidence for that: “You want to drop a few pounds”, “Each session improves your posture and creates more confidence, which breeds self-improvement” – all these lines presuppose that the person reading the article agrees with the magazine’s opinion that the fitness sessions are intertwined with the essence of beauty and spirituality.\n\nComparing these statements with the ones found in the article in Men’s Health, one can trace the same tendency to create an impression of the connection between the advice given by the magazine and the key to a happy life and personal development: “where there is weakness, there is a great opportunity – to build muscle”. Bright and encouraging, these articles reflect the ideas of the magazine, not the reality.\n\nConclusion: Opening Your Eyes\n\nIs there a way of getting rid of the influence that magazines have on people with their articles? To answer this question, it is required to measure the impact that media has on the public. However, despite the obvious existence of the influence, it is completely impossible to define the extent of its impact. According to what Janda (2008) says,\n\nAmericans overwhelmingly believe that the media exert a strong influence on their political institutions, and almost nine out of ten Americans believe that the media strongly influence public opinion. However, measuring the extent of media influence on public opinion is difficult. (113)\n\nThus, the ways to define the extent of the mass media impact on people’s lives is impossible. However, since there is no doubt that the effect is constant and often harmful, ways to decrease it must be found. With help of reasonable restrictions imposed on magazines, the impact of the magazine articles on people will be diminished, which will positively result in their life.\n\nReference List\n\nHancock, J., Green, T., & Turton, P.

      "Credit Creation and Expansionary Monetary Policy Essay\n\nCredit creation process of commercial banks entails lending cash to creditworthy borrowers, who pays interests to the banks. Subsequent to paying the interest to the bank, the borrower can use the credit to buy a product or service, through electronic transfer or cheque. The vendor, who receives the funds, then makes a fresh deposit in the financial segment, leading to credit growth. Thus, credit creation can be defined as the growth of bank deposits through the practice of offering more loans, investments and advances (Somashekar, 2009).\n\nThe degree of credit creation mostly relies on the monetary policy of a nation’s Central Bank. The Central Bank has the authority to control the amount of money in flow and, thus, the amount of credit that the banks make (Dwivedi, 2010). Besides, the Central Bank possesses strong weapons, such as, open market operations and the bank rate, with which it can apply control on the extension and reduction of credit by the banks. Thus, the capacity of a bank to generate credit may encounter various restrictions. However, we can not undermine the significance of credit creation by banks, in an economy. This is because credit creation, by banks, has extensive effects on the running of the economy, particularly, in the business area.\n\nIf the amount of credit grows rapidly, some household and business overheads may be fueled because the level of AD becomes affected. Besides, inflation may arise from surplus credit or money in a market which is already working at its ability (Somashekar, 2009). Hence, strict government regulations on the volume of money must be put in place. This will avoid surplus credit, which may cause inflation. Conversely, little credit growth can smother processes. The planned regulation of interest rates on deposits and loans, by the RBA, is an essential mode of guaranteeing that the intensification in economic activity and AD is not too rapid or slow so as, to guarantee stability. This is a significant, stabilising aspect of monetary policy.\n\nThe diagram below (figure 1) demonstrates how RBA can employ reduced interest rates in fueling AD. As seen in the diagram, a decrease in interest rates is apt to raise national production from GDP0 to GDP1, and increase expenditure from AD0 to AD1.\n\nFigure 1.

      "Project Evaluation and Program Success Measurement Case Study\n\nAnalysis of the means of evaluation\n\nWhy the evaluation is necessary and what kinds of decisions to make as a result of the evaluation\n\nIn general use, the evaluation focuses on measurement, appraisal, or judgment of the output and result of the project about the objectives (Milakovich and George 3). This is the only way the Project Manager can determine the project’s relevance, effectiveness, and benefits to the target group. Thus, evaluation concentrates on long-term outcomes and the effects of the project objectives.\n\nEvaluation of the Project Team Read A is necessary to help the Project Manager understand, verify, or enhance the impact of the reading process on learners. This will show that the project is changing the reading culture among its target group. This process will ensure that the Project Manager does not rely on her instinct or guesswork, trial, and error approach about the delivery of the reading project.\n\nEvaluation is also necessary to ensure that the project improves its delivery mechanism, becomes cost-effective, and efficient. It will also help in the identification of the reading program’s strengths and weaknesses to improve the project. This is because the reading project may end up being inefficient with several related and costly activities.\n\nThe Project Manager will verify the current activities and progress of the project. Several factors may influence the reading process. In the process, the initial plans for effective delivery of reading services may end up changing considerably; thus, evaluation is necessary to determine if the project runs according to the initial plans.\n\nAlso, the project evaluation will assist in determining if the project has met its goals, generate data that the Project Manager can use for verification, support the project before sponsors, promote a reading culture in the community, and creating public relations. It will also help the Project Manager determine effective programs suitable for retention in cases of financial difficulties. Finally, evaluation results can serve purposes of duplication of similar programs in other regions (Lane 2).\n\nDecisions to make after evaluation include reinforcing components that make the Team Read project succeed, duplicate the same program in other interested schools, increased retention of the project coaches, and reduce dropout rates among learners. The Project Manager shall initiate recommendations for future project development such as include parents and the community in the program to avoid interferences.\n\nThe program evaluation enables the Project Manager to identify the efficiency of the reading program in terms of resource usages, the effectiveness of the program through measuring performance indicators, or objectives against its goals. Program effectiveness and efficiency aid in decision-making, solve accountability issues, and program planning. It is also useful in enhancing operation, monitoring of the program, and reallocation of resources to other important areas. Thus, for Trish McKay to comprehend the value, and have knowledge of the elements of the reading program, evaluation is necessary.\n\nKey questions to answer during the evaluation\n\nThe evaluation process should reflect questions related to factors that have contributed to increased learning (changes in knowledge, perception, attitude, and skills among learners). It should also address questions of learning conditions such as self-reliance and increased reading or literacy.\n\nThe evaluation must also answer issues of the main activities under the project. This ensures that the project evaluation does not end up justifying irrelevant activities. Also, the evaluation should look into issues of the target goals and achieved goals. This leads to the question of whether the program implementation ended up as initially planned.\n\nThe process must also clearly answer the question of how many learners have successfully gone through the program, how many of them can reliably read on their own, and have shown remarkable improvements. There are also issues of coaches and learners attrition that evaluation questions must address, including project long-term sustainability.\n\nIndicators of success of the program, their definitions, and measurement\n\nProgram key indicators should demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of reading outcomes.\n\n  * Expected increments in learning (changes in knowledge, perception, attitude, and skills among learners): the project evaluation must identify the increased levels of reading among learners in terms of specific numbers and periods. This enables the Project Manager to track the efficiency of the reading program.\n  * Increased retention of coaches and learners: the evaluation must show the number of dropouts of both learners and coaches since the inception of the program and indicate positive gains.\n  * Increased benefits to coaches: coaches undergo reading training to improve their skills. The process identifies the number of coaches that have benefited from training opportunities due to the reading program.\n  * Enhanced efficiency and effectiveness in the use of resources: the program has a budget that guides the use of funds, and acquisition of resources.\n  * Some institutions have shown interest in the program through unsolicited phone calls and surveys. There are also cases of increased community involvement.\n\nExplanation of the proposed evaluation design, conducting the evaluation and data collection\n\nThis is an outcomes-based evaluation. This design will enable the evaluation team to collect specific, measurable, and observable characteristics among learners and coaches that reflect both achievements and drawbacks of the program. Outcomes reflect the benefits that stakeholders derive from the program. In this program, outcomes can be in the forms of observable changes in learners (enhanced learning), and acquisitions of skills among coaches, increased reading ability, and self-reliance. It must clearly define target groups with clear goals and objectives of expected outcomes.\n\nThe evaluation design shall include identification of the main outcomes the evaluation team wants to examine. This includes the overall purpose of the reading program and the impacts the program has on all stakeholders. Thus, we must evaluate the general benefits the reading program has on learners. At the same time, the team must concentrate on the main activities that the project team does to achieve such outcomes. This eliminates the chances of evaluating irrelevant activities and collecting unnecessary information.\n\nThe design will also prioritize outcomes that the evaluation team wants to examine such as increased levels of reading, benefits to coaches, usages of resources, and factors that result in dropouts among participants. This depends on available time and other resources.\n\nThe design shall also define program observable indicators. This is a critical stage in outcomes-based evaluation. The team must define indicators for intangible activities such as changes in attitude, knowledge, reading, and skills. There should also be specific indicators for concerns related to supports readers get from coaches. The evaluation team must be careful with results that present achievement of associated indicators simply because such indicators are present.\n\nThe evaluation decision should also reflect outcomes in terms of achievements against the target. For instance, the evaluation team may demonstrate dropout among coaches as shown here by the indicator.\n\nThis also shows how many coaches went through the program in certain periods, what number completed the session reliably, and continued with the program to date.\n\nThe outcomes-based design also provides the evaluation team with the means of efficiently and realistically collecting information about the reading program, analyzing data, and presenting the findings.\n\nThe evaluation team shall use purposeful sampling to obtain in-depth knowledge of problems under examination. The evaluation team shall take careful account of measurement instruments to ensure their technical aspects, reliability, validity, and avoidance of any possible bias. At the same time, instruments of the study are also appropriate to the study i.e. they are easy to use.\n\nThe evaluation team shall collect data from focus groups. This ensures that data collected have an in-depth presentation of issues under review. At the same time, the researcher ensured the confidentiality of the participants. The discovery approach, in the program, tends to be iterative as the study is interpretative. This method ensures that the team collects only relevant data to problems. The evaluation team shall also use interviews to understand learners’ and coaches’ impressions or experiences of the reading program.\n\nExpected problems and means to overcome them\n\nThe possible problems related to processes of evaluation. For instance, the team may experience challenges related to describing certain problems due to links, and casual relationships with other problems and cause agents. Further, such cases may present difficulties and consume a lot of time during analyses. There are also cost-related issues.\n\nTo avoid these problems, prior planning and defining what is within the range of program evaluation may help avert some of them.\n\nA critique of the recent evaluation\n\nDescription of the method of the most recent evaluation (What was done)\n\nThe methodology used revealed strong benefits to program coaches as the results for the main target group (learners) were equivocal. Only fifth-graders showed improvement in the test scores, second-and third-grade showed that fewer learners met the reading standard about control groups, and the results for fourth-grader were not available. This led to a recommendation for improved training and reinforcement. This was the first evaluation.\n\nThe second evaluation had an adjusted evaluation approach to hone the accuracy of the results. Still, the results revealed high levels of benefits to coaches and weaker gains for the learners than the control groups. This led the Programme Manager to doubt the results.\n\nThe evaluator used statistical methods for resolving data problems and improved the analysis of the program’s impact on reading skills. In doing this, the evaluator only focused on 10 schools in the second year of the program instead of all 17 schools.\n\nThe evaluator used open-ended questionnaires for data collection. The questions entailed both a qualitative and quantitative approach with surveys and interviews as methods of data collection. This method enables the evaluator to collects varied views from respondents.\n\nThe evaluator used the statistical significance of the effect size to authenticate results. However, we must note that when performing analyses of effects by relying on small sample sizes such significance tests can mislead and present wrong results. This is because statistical significance does not directly indicate the effect size. Instead, it works as the size of the sample, p (statistical significance) level, and effect size. This means the evaluator took the easiest means of looking at the directions of the results in terms of signs (<, >, and =) to establish the statistical meaning behind the results.\n\nWe must also note that the evaluator relied on published works of Borman and D’Agostino of 1996. This work determined the effect size as an effectiveness criterion by using a statistical formula based on 30 years of evaluation studies. However, the challenge is that such information on significance can cause problems during the practical interpretation of the results. This is because significance tests do not indicate the size of variations between different indicators (practical significance). At the same time, it is difficult to compare it across different studies.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of the last evaluation (Reliable results)\n\nThe evaluator’s method of analysis had some weaknesses. The report did not indicate how the evaluator arrived at such a criterion. Also, the evaluator did not perform site-specific analysis in the report. These aspects make such results lack authenticity; thus, unreliable. We have also noticed that, at some points, the evaluator did not perform analysis. Instead, she relied on assumptions such as “Is it reasonable to assume that the pre-and post-tests measure the same skills?”\n\nTo answer this question, the evaluator adopted a correlation criterion. For instance, “the correlation between pre-and post-tests was near or above 0.8, as was the case for the 2nd grade where pre-and post-tests were essentially the same, the evaluator interpreted the pre-to post-test change score as a gain score. However, in cases where the correlation coefficient was less than 0.8, the evaluator performed no analysis” (Source: Team Read B).\n\nThis idea of none reporting such results, and in some cases, specific results that the evaluator considered not statistically significant usually bring substantial cases of biases in the interpretation of results. Also, the evaluator assumed that only statistically significant results were essential for analyses, and results that had not significance were not necessary for analyses. This is the main weakness of the evaluation results.\n\nThere is also a problem with the data collection approach and sample representation. The evaluator did not take into account that qualitative and quantitative designs use different methods when selecting research participants. The evaluator could have used purposive sampling to collect in-depth information from coaches (qualitative study) and apply random sampling to gain quick information about learners’ experiences with the reading program (quantitative study). This is because coaches have specific views about the program and can form part of the focus group for valuable information.\n\nThe evaluation processes have strengths in the manner the evaluator performed technical analyses of data to derive conclusions, though interpretation was a challenge.\n\nWe have also noticed that the evaluator applied a mixed research design of both qualitative and quantitative design to collect rich information. This is a suitable approach to data collection as it enabled the evaluator to adjust research questions to fit the responses under a qualitative study.\n\nAssume that the second-grade results are correct (recommendations for making the program even better)\n\nThe second-grade results show improvement for most readers. Thus, we can make recommendations that can enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of the reading program for other graders.\n\n  * The use of high school students to coach elementary learners is cost-effective and increases instructional time.\n  * The application of a strong coaching session across the whole group is effective.\n  * Foster a good relationship among coaches and learners.\n  * Placing more emphasis on comprehension than phonics.\n  * Enhancing good central management of the program.\n  * There should be a one-on-one approach to reading rather than focusing on the group as a whole.\n  * There should also be varieties of other instructional activities to support the reading culture.\n\nHow might the next evaluation be changed to make it far more useful for learning about and improving the Team Read program?\n\nThe next evaluation process must avoid the problems highlighted above. First, the evaluator must ensure that information collected is valid and reliable. This implies that the evaluator must conduct a pilot study to determine the reliability, validity, and acceptability of the study instruments and measurement. The use of focus group will also help the evaluator capture in-depth knowledge of what coaches’ opinions are about the program.\n\nThe evaluator must also take caution when deriving an effect size using a significance test. The established significance value shall guide the evaluator in making reliable assumptions about the study. At the same time, the evaluator must avoid assumptions and treatment of some tests as insignificant to the study as they have overall effects on results. Also, the evaluator must account for what the significance test fails to tell us in terms of differences among the values. This implies that such tests require a standardization of the differences and make comparisons with zero. This leads to a better interpretation and reliable results.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLane, Fredrick.

      "Democracy Promotion and Humanitarian Intervention Essay\n\nOne of the characteristics to which a military conflict should adhere in order to be considered a just war is the ‘chances of success’ (Coady 2002). This principle implies that the possibility of succeeding and winning war should be high enough for the nation to engage in the conflict. Otherwise, if a fight is too difficult for the county to win, the war is unjustified because it can bring necessity losses and damages, while not changing the situation for the better (Fabre 2008). In this case, the limited and expansive views of the just war theory present different arguments for and against such interventions.\n\nAccording to the limited view, military intervention in general results in bringing many adverse outcomes for all engaged sides of the conflict. For instance, concern for unintended consequences should be considered. While the notion that democracy promotion brings exclusively positive results due to the good intentions of the intervening side may exist, it is necessary to assess all possible damages of military conflicts. The country or a group of countries intending to bring democracy to a state uses resources both tangible and intangible and engages people in order to achieve the desired outcome (United Nations Office on Genocide Prevention and the Responsibility to Protect: about n.d.). As any military conflict results in substantial losses of human life and destruction of property and land, it is unclear whether the cause of democracy promotion is a sufficient reason to endanger the country’s own resources. Therefore, an unintended consequence of severe losses undermines the legitimacy of such a cause for humanitarian intervention.\n\nSecondly, the possible consequences for the country of intended intervention should also be investigated. While a successful change of the regime may produce such positive effects as the increased level of freedoms and a better holistic approach to the nation’s development, it can also destabilise the economy and bring problems that cross the national borders, endangering the stability of other countries, both economic and political (Lefkowitz 2006). Thus, a conflict with an intention to promote democracy may escalate the country’s condition further, if it was unstable before, or create a situation that results in changing attitudes towards democracy. Furthermore, an unsuccessful attempt at installing democracy may result in even more significant adverse outcomes. These may include a harsh military response leading to devastating damages and the worsening situation for the civilians of the affected countries.\n\nIt is also vital to note that a force initiating the intervention may not fully understand the situation of the target location. For example, the misunderstanding of the regime’s rules or traditions may result in it miscalculating the rates of success, which, in turn, may lead to some critically adverse results (Nardin 2005). Moreover, the inability to adequately grasp cultural differences may also limit the side’s perception of the problem, resulting in a conflict with unclear intentions and vague determinants of success. Thus, a limited view supports the limits for military interventions to be strict – only situations where a terrible wrong (such as genocide) will be certainly prevented as a result of interference can be considered just.\n\nThe expansive view agrees that interventions should only be justified in cases with reasonable rates for success. However, its definition of success differs from that of the limited view. Here, for instance, a quick military action that results in destroying an oppressive or authoritarian regime is considered successful (Walzer 1980). The end of the intervention is perceived as the end of such military action, and the force promoting democracy is satisfied with eliminating the threat of the old regime (Oberman 2015). This concept, while possible, undermines the fact that such a rash decision does not acknowledge the situation in the affected country after the end of the intervention.\n\nThe war in Iraq started in 2003 can be taken as an example for the arguments presented in the limited view. The move to overthrow the government led by Saddam Hussein can be viewed as a movement to promote democracy as the better regime for the country (Roth 2006). Thus, the invasion’s success can be evaluated to support the presented points of the expansive view (Fabre 2007; Tesón 2005). However, while one may argue that the ending of the war, connected to the falling of the local government, can be considered a successful outcome, the events that followed these military actions cannot be viewed as strictly positive. The country was unstable and the political power vacuum resulted in violence between the country’s nations (Roth 2006). Moreover, the insurgency developed as a response to the actions of the United States and the supporting forces also increased the amount of violent activity in the country. Thus, Iraq, while being freed from the tyrannical government, suffered from chaotic outcomes of the intervention.\n\nHere, the limited view of the ‘chances of success’ is more reasonable to apply as it recognises both short and long-term outcomes of such interventions. While short-term results may seem as satisfactory for the war to be considered just, the long-term issues reveal the unfortunate consequence of the interference. Thus, it is possible to assume that the limited view is more reliable in its assessment of the factor of success. Consequently, the idea that democracy promotion is a just cause in itself is unsupported because of the high possibility of adverse outcomes and the lack of understanding of cultural, traditional and political differences between sides.\n\nReference List\n\nCoady, CAJ 2002, Peaceworks: the ethics of armed humanitarian intervention , vol. 45.

      "Primary Care Providers Treating Opiate Addiction Essay\n\nDescribe the indications of chronic opioid therapy (COT) and standards for initiating as well as maintaining COT?\n\nThe current opioid crisis causes significant concerns regarding the initiation of chronic opioid therapy (COT) and its maintenance. The need for using COT in pain management increases dramatically, while even small dosage of opioids may lead to addiction. The indicators for using COT involve non-cancer management of chronic pain occurred as a result of disease or injury (Waszak & Fennimore, 2017). For instance, specific fibromyalgia, back pain, or headache may be noted as the cases for COT prescription. The critically meaningful enhancement in a patient’s condition signals the effectiveness of the above treatment and prescribes further maintenance. The patients with COT should be subjected to continuous monitoring and receive relevant education.\n\nThere are several standards and evidence-based practical guidelines elaborated especially for nurse practitioners (NPs). Chesney and Duderstadt (2017) pinpoint that NPs who possess a full practice authority (FPA) may provide schedule II controlled substances for patients with opioid addiction. In many states though, the prescription of the above medications should be controlled by a physician in order to prevent malpractice. A patient should receive all prescriptions from one physician and pharmacy, thus avoiding any misunderstanding or errors related to treatment and maintenance processes. Jukiewicz, Alhofaian, Thompson, and Gary (2017) emphasize that none of the states require prescription drug monitoring programs to be utilized in practice. Instead, the prescribers are expected to focus on the best evidence-based practices to decide with regard to a particular patient. The fact that different states and even hospitals may have their own guidelines may cause inconsistency in schedule and dosage (Jukiewicz et al., 2017). Nevertheless, it is essential to specify that federal guidelines such as the Centers for Disease Control and Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration provide relevant clinical assessment tools and typology of outcomes.\n\nWhat are ways to stratify or even minimize patient risk of opioid addiction\n\nThe current evidence presents several ways to stratify and minimize patient risk of opioid addiction, among which one may enumerate utilization of primary care providers, patient-centered delivery of opioid pain therapy, continuous monitoring, education, and consistent consideration of laws, guidelines, and policies.\n\nThe review of the recent research studies reveals that insufficient attention is paid to the role of primary care providers in terms of COT. According to Jenkinson and Ravert (2013), there is a lack of programs and the number of nurses, who are unable to prescribe schedule III medications due to the fact that they do not have FPA. In this regard, the mentioned authors argue that a primary care setting is the most appropriate environment for opiate addiction stratification and minimization. Attentiveness and sensitivity with which primary care providers should treat patients would lead to their improved satisfaction as well as better health outcomes.\n\nThe patient-centered delivery of opioid pain therapy is another option to address opiate addiction. As stated by Waszak and Fennimore (2017), education for a patient and his or her family is essential to equip them with knowledge and skills in order to combat opiate addiction and minimize the risks for its development. The consideration of on a patient’s values, views, preferences, and any other critical peculiarities would provide more focused and specific care. More to the point, continuous monitoring along with staff education composes an integral part of stratifying and minimizing opioid addiction risks. Since today’s rapidly changing environment presents new challenges and opportunities in the field of patient care and opiate pain treatment, staff education should be timely and relevant. Ultimately, by consistently aligning laws, guidelines, and policies with the practical initiatives, it is possible to achieve the reduction in opioid addiction resulted from non-cancer pain management.\n\nReferences\n\nChesney, M.

      "Celebrity Advertisement in Social Media Marketing Thesis\n\nAbstract\n\nSocial media platforms created new opportunities for brands to interact with potential and existing customers in the digital space. The rise of micro-celebrities, also called social media influencers (SMIs), caused SMI advertisement development. There are many advantages to SMI advertisement, so many brands prefer it to other digital marketing tools. However, the popularization of SMI ads could potentially affect other marketing types, including celebrity advertisement, which has been among the critical methods used by brands to reach their target audience in the past few decades.\n\nFollowing a significant body of past research studying the factors affecting celebrity advertisement and endorsement effectiveness, this study aimed to determine if exposure to paid social media posts could impact people’s perception of celebrity trustworthiness, thus affecting their buying intentions.\n\nIntroduction\n\nCelebrity advertisement and endorsement are popular marketing methods used by businesses worldwide to promote their products or services. Celebrities are widely considered effective in advertising products and services as they allow companies to reach a wider audience by appealing to many people. With the rise of social media tools, many celebrities use their social media accounts for paid advertisements, which allows reaching millions of followers worldwide. However, social media platforms’ popularity also led to the popularization of social media influencers (SMIs).\n\nAccording to Hearn and Schoenhoff (2015), SMIs work to create celebrity capital by gaining attention on social media and establishing their personal brand via social networks. For businesses, SMI advertising provides the same benefits as celebrity advertisement or endorsement; even more so, SMIs can help businesses to reach a specific audience, as most of the SMI blogs are themed. SMIs gain a vast part of their income by posting paid advertisements, which leads to the high exposure of daily social network users to SMI ads. Consecutively, most people are aware that their favorite bloggers’ post paid advertisements. The present research aims to test the hypothesis that exposure to SMI advertisement leads to a decrease in the perceived trustworthiness of celebrities who also engage in social media marketing.\n\nSignificance of Research\n\nThe research will provide a multi-dimensional review of the relationship between SMIs and celebrities on social media sites. Apart from examining the influence of SMI advertisement exposure on celebrities’ trust, the research will also seek to compare respondents’ attitudes to celebrities who use social media platforms. Attitudes toward celebrities are essential as they are a major predictor of consumer attitudes toward the advertised brand (Zhou & Whitla, 2013).\n\nAlso, the audience’s perception of a celebrity can directly impact perceived credibility, which can also affect social media advertisement or endorsement (Rifon, Jiang, & Kim, 2016). Finally, the research will even attempt to discover the comparative influence of SMI and celebrity adverts on customers’ purchase intentions. Thus, the present research will contribute to the previous studies of celebrity advertisement and endorsement by extending them to the social media context.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nCelebrity Advertisement in the Online Context\n\nSocial media platforms represent a unique and fruitful environment for brands to interact with their potential customers. For instance, features such as themed accounts and groups allow brands to interact directly with their target audience. According to the study by Fosdick (2012), brand websites have been losing audience since 2009, which is mainly due to the increase in social media platforms, which might act as brand communities.\n\nThe brand’s presence on digital platforms, including social media, can help establish a relationship with customers, affecting their purchase intentions (Tiago & Veríssimo, 2014). For instance, brands can use social media to provide more information about their products or offer customer service support. ASOS provides an excellent example of the use of Facebook for customer service efforts, with a strong team of customer support that can be contacted from any device at all times.\n\nPeople use social networks daily, making it easier for them to interact with brands that use social media. For example, instead of checking the brand’s official web page, they can monitor the release of a new collection or product by subscribing to the brand’s social media account.\n\nMoreover, as noted by Cummins, Peltier, Schibrowsky, and Nill (2014), “because many shopping experiences are affect-based, the Internet represents a composite of visual, individual and interpersonal stimuli” (p. 170). In this case, celebrity endorsement becomes especially relevant to the majority of brands. Previous research suggests that celebrity-endorsed brands are perceived by customers to be more desirable and beneficial (Nelson & Deborah, 2017). Celebrities are perceived to be as attractive as mediums for marketing. According to Nelson and Deborah (2017), “the use of celebrity endorsement in the eyes of customers is the most compelling way of attracting their attention compared to a non-celebrity featured advertisement” (p. 30).\n\nMoreover, most of the celebrities have large follower bases on social networks, which allows them to transfer the image of the product directly to customers, thus creating stimuli for purchase. Nelson and Deborah (2017) noted that celebrity endorsement facilitates the interaction between the brand and its target customers in the online context, as celebrities can use their social media posts to outline the best features of the product and share information on its benefits and uses. However, the choice of celebrity endorser in the online context becomes difficult; the perfect match for most brands is a celebrity that has a large follower base and is perceived as trustworthy by the target audience.\n\nCelebrity Trustworthiness\n\nCelebrity trustworthiness is a problematic concept that has not been sufficiently addressed in research. Hence, there is no consensus among the researchers on the definition and use of the term. Out of all the secondary literature reviewed, Eren-Erdogmus, Lak, and Çiçek (2016) were the only scholars who proposed a specific definition of trustworthiness, considering it as an abstract concept depending on the perceived honesty, integrity, and believability of the source.\n\nThe vast majority of scholars view celebrity trustworthiness as a component of celebrity credibility, which is why most research studies only consider celebrity trustworthiness in light of the overall celebrity credibility. For instance, Rifon et al. (2016) state that celebrity trustworthiness determines the credibility of the message translated by the celebrity to the target audience and impacts purchase intentions and perceived brand image.\n\nSimilarly, Chung and Cho (2017) found that, in line with the source credibility model, source trustworthiness had a positive effect on brand credibility, thus also affecting the potential customers’ purchase intention. Tzoumaka, Tsiotsou, and Siomkos (2016) state that celebrity credibility relies on the celebrity’s perceived expertise and trustworthiness; however, celebrity trustworthiness significantly affects purchase intentions.\n\nThe researchers also describe previous findings related to the factors affecting celebrity trustworthiness. For instance, they note that the multi-endorsement of various products might lead to a decrease in perceived trustworthiness. In contrast, an appropriate communication approach to social media can help celebrities build trustworthiness (Tzoumaka et al., 2016). Another research that is important for the exploration of celebrity trustworthiness is a study by McCormick (2016), which found that the millennials’ purchase intentions depended on the familiarity of the celebrity used as an endorser; this supports the previous theoretical framework, as celebrity trustworthiness relies heavily on the audience’s familiarity with celebrity’s personal characteristics, such as honesty and integrity.\n\nThe perceived moral reputation of the celebrity was also studied by Zhou and Whitla (2013). They found that perceived moral qualities of the celebrity mediated the effect of adverse publicity on consumer attitudes. Reviewing the images of famous celebrity endorsers, the researchers found that those with a stronger moral reputation could maintain their effectiveness in brand endorsements (Zhou & Whitla, 2013).\n\nOn the other hand, the celebrity’s impaired perception following negative publicity was found to have a significant adverse effect on consumer attitudes (Zhou & Whitla, 2013). Overall, celebrity trustworthiness is among the key concepts in research on celebrity endorsement. Nevertheless, the concept is rarely viewed independently from celebrity credibility, which might create difficulties in research.\n\nSocial Media Influencers\n\nSMIs are a relatively new phenomenon, brought by the development and popularization of social networks, such as Facebook and Instagram. SMIs, also called micro-celebrities, are social media users who have managed to build a personal brand through social media networks (Hearn and Schoenhoff, 2015). The identification of the user as a micro-celebrity of SMI is based on complex account analytics and social scoring, conducted by companies such as Klout or Peerindex (Hearn and Schoenhoff, 2015).\n\nLike traditional celebrities, SMIs have a relatively stable base of followers, which allows them to act as brand or product endorsers in the online context. Moreover, compared to traditional celebrity endorsement, SMI advertisement is cheaper and can target a specific audience. For instance, beauty bloggers might be used to target women aged 16-30 with a strong interest in makeup and beauty tools.\n\nIn contrast, travel bloggers could advertise hotels and destinations to travelers from all over the world. Such flexibility is attractive to many brands, who opt for SMI advertisement instead of a traditional celebrity endorsement. Moreover, micro-celebrities were found to be more powerful in advertising products and brands; for example, a study by Djafarova and Rushworth (2017) showed that lower-end celebrities and bloggers were considered by customers to be the most influential in impacting the audience’s purchase intentions or opinions. One possible reason for this is that micro-celebrities are viewed as more approachable and inspiring.\n\nIn contrast, traditional celebrities live in entirely different settings due to their wealth and fame; bloggers are perceived as less superficial, which makes it easier for customers to identify with them. Djafarova and Rushworth (2017) indicate that the respondents were more willing to trust the celebrities they can relate to, which might account for the difference in perceived influence between traditional and micro-celebrities.\n\nResearch Hypotheses\n\nModeling a distinctive theory and hypotheses using the scarce amount of previous research was challenging, so the hypotheses were primarily based on assumptions. First of all, we assumed that people were generally dissatisfied with the high amount of paid advertisement posts on social media. Therefore, this study aimed to test the first hypothesis that people’s perception of celebrities could be influenced by their exposure to paid advertisement posts.\n\nAs suggested by Zhou and Whitla (2013), the negative perception of a celebrity could impair the effectiveness of his or her endorsement in influencing buying intentions. Moreover, research generally agreed that perceived trustworthiness was positively correlated with buying intentions (Rifon et al., 2016; Chung & Cho, 2017). Therefore, our second hypothesis was that exposure to paid posts on social media would be negatively associated with the respondents’ buying intentions. The two hypotheses that the present research aimed to test are as follows:\n\n  * Hypothesis 1. There is a negative correlation between exposure to social media advertisements and trust in celebrities.\n  * Hypothesis 2. There is a negative correlation between exposure to social media advertisements and buying intentions.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe present study utilized a quantitative methodology with a questionnaire as the primary tool for data collection. The survey was created based on the key concepts outlined in the literature review, including purchase intentions, perceived expertise, trustworthiness, and others. A full copy of the questionnaire can be found in the Appendix. To ensure that the participants were active social media users, the survey was online and advertised on social media platforms, including Twitter and Facebook.\n\nEnsuring that the respondents are active social media users helped increase the completeness and validity of survey results. People who are not active social media users would not be able to share their opinions on some of the statements. The questionnaire consisted of eleven statements with multiple answer choices based on the Likert scale, widely used in social science research. The use of the Likert scale is justified because it allows more answer options than in closed questions, which means that each respondent would have more chances of selecting options that best suit his or her thoughts and experience. An overall sample containing 117 respondents was obtained from social media platforms.\n\nThe findings were first presented using percentage charts, which allowed reviewing the prevailing trends. However, to establish a correlation between exposure to social media advertisements and purchase intentions or perceived trustworthiness, correlation and regression analyses were performed using Excel tools. First, the relationship between exposure to social media ads and perceived celebrity trustworthiness (Hypothesis 1) was analyzed. Secondly, we considered the correlation between exposure to social media ads and the influence of celebrity endorsement on purchase intentions, as stated in Hypothesis 2.\n\nOnce the first two steps were completed, we attempted to determine the correlation between celebrity and SMI trustworthiness and between celebrity and SMI influence on purchase intentions. Overall, the methodology allowed us to conduct an in-depth analysis of all the factors associated with customers’ perception of celebrities and SMIs, thus understanding the connection between exposure to paid SMI advertisement and trust in celebrities.\n\nFindings\n\nThe results are presented using pie charts, which helps to obtain a clearer understanding of the responses. For instance, Statement 1 aimed to determine the degree of respondents’ exposure to paid advertisements on social media. Overall, most respondents agreed that they see paid advertisement posts by celebrities or SMIs quite frequently. One of the critical statements in the study was Statement 5: “Seeing SMIs advertising products, services, and opinions decreases my trust in celebrities who also engage in paid posts on social media.” To this statement, 39.3% of respondents replied, “Mostly agree,” and 23.9% chose “Strongly agree,” which shows the people’s perception of the relationship between exposure to paid advertisement posts by SMIs and their trust in celebrities.\n\nDescriptive Statistics\n\nA detailed report of research findings can be found in Appendix 2. A total of 117 responses were collected. Although the responses were anonymous, some demographical data is available on the participants. For instance, gender distribution was fairly even, with 51.75% male participants and 48.25% female. Age was also included in the questionnaire, as it can affect the participants’ perception of advertisement and their use of social media sites.\n\nThe vast majority of the participants were 25-34 years old (63.48%). Age groups 35-44 and 18-24 constituted 18.26% and 12.17% of the sample accordingly. Less than 1% of the participants were 55-64 years old, and 5.22% were between 45 and 54. Another demographic variable that was measured as part of the study was the respondents’ economic situation. Over 50% of the participants were students, 32.17% reported being employed for wages, whereas 10.43% were self-employed. Shares of retired, unable to work, and stay-at-home respondents were small (0.87%, 0.87%, and 1.74%).\n\nDemographics and Attitudes\n\nThe impact of demographic factors on the buyers’ attitudes has been widely studied in the research. It can help inform marketing strategies for products that target specific audiences by gender, age, or economic status. In the current research, we collected information about responses to certain statements by age and gender. In particular, data was obtained for Statements 3 and 7, which address purchase intentions following SMI and celebrity advertisement, respectively.\n\nRegarding Statement 3, 52 percent of women and 51 percent of men disagreed that they would consider purchasing a product after seeing an SMI advertising it. Similarly, in the case with celebrity advertisement, 61 percent of men and 62 percent of women disagreed that a celebrity add would affect their purchase intentions. Thus, there is no significant variation in the results by gender. However, it is interesting that both men and women felt more drawn to buy products featured in SMI’s posts than those advertised by celebrities. Therefore, irrespective of gender, the respondents expressed more trust in the ads made by SMIs than in those posted by celebrities.\n\nAs part of the research, we also considered the influence of the participant’s age on his or her attitudes towards celebrities. Using Statement 11, “I became skeptical that most of the celebrities’ opinion posts about something on the social media are paid ads,” we studied the age breakdown of responses. All the respondents aged 18-24 agreed with the statements. Out of the 64 respondents aged 25-34, eight individuals (12.5%) disagreed with the statement, and 56 agreed (87.5%). The same trend could be observed in people aged 45-54; out of 8 participants, only one (12.5%) disagreed with the statement. Therefore, it can be concluded that people aged 25-34 and 45-54 have more trust in celebrities than those aged 18-24.\n\nData Analysis\n\nTo test if the respondents’ perceptions can be supported by statistical analysis, the influence of exposure on responses to Statement 10 was reviewed. The statement was made to measure the degree of trust in celebrities by determining if people view their paid posts as misleading. First, a correlation analysis was performed to establish the relationship between exposure and trust. The correlation coefficient was -0.091108623, which indicates a lack of a linear relationship.\n\nFurther regression analysis was performed to confirm the findings. With the p-value of 0.471 and the R² coefficient at 0.029, it is clear that exposure to social media advertisements did not affect people’s trust in celebrities. Therefore, data analysis provided no evidence in support of Hypothesis 1.\n\nNext, the influence of exposure on buying intentions was analyzed using correlation analysis. Buying intentions were measured by Statement 7: “If I see a celebrity advertising a product on social media, I will consider purchasing the product myself.” The correlation coefficient of the relationship between exposure and purchase intentions was -0.096717599, which shows a lack of a linear relationship.\n\nFurther regression analysis confirmed the findings: although the p-value was slightly higher than in the first case (0.685), the R² coefficient was lower (0.009), indicating that the degree of exposure to social media advertisement does not affect the purchase intentions of the audience. A similar analysis was performed to establish the relationship between trust in SMIs and trust in celebrities. The correlation coefficient for this relationship was significantly higher (0.360513095), which can be interpreted as a weak positive linear relationship. However, the R² (0.130) and p-value (0.118) figures did not provide any evidence for the significance of this relationship.\n\nSimilarly, the purchase intentions after viewing an SMI ad did not significantly affect purchase intentions following celebrity advertisement. The correlation coefficient for these variables was at 0.407368254; however, the p-value was too high compared to the desired significance level of 0.05 (0.075), whereas the R² coefficient was too low (0.116). Thus, Hypothesis 2 was also not supported by the analysis.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe data collection procedure yielded more results than anticipated, which allowed reviewing the information from more participants. There are two primary research results to discuss: the respondents’ perception and the statistical analysis of the results.\n\nThe respondents’ views are generally in line with the proposed hypothesis that exposure to SMI advertisement results in lower trust in celebrities. Moreover, most respondents agreed that celebrities should not use their social media accounts for paid advertisements as SMIs do. However, users’ purchase intentions following a celebrity post were still considerably high, which shows that celebrity advertisement still has a significant influence on the audience. Furthermore, most respondents believed that celebrities were pickier than SMIs regarding products, services, and opinions they advertise on social media, which could be among the factors contributing to purchase intentions.\n\nNevertheless, the results of correlation and regression analyses of Hypothesis 1 somewhat contradicted the perception of the respondents, showing that there is no statistically significant relationship between exposure and trust in celebrities.\n\nHowever, this diversion can be explained by the research discussed in the above sections. Based on previous studies, Eren-Erdogmus et al. (2016) define celebrity trustworthiness in terms of the perceived personality traits of the target celebrity, such as honesty, believability, and integrity. Therefore, exposure to social media advertisements did not affect perceived celebrity trustworthiness, as it depends on a different set of variables. The respondents’ view of the relationship can thus be associated with their personal opinion on the intrinsic qualities of the celebrities that they follow and not on the exposure to social media advertisements.\n\nThe participants would not be aware of this connection, which justifies their responses to Statement 5. In general, the results suggest that, although people express a certain degree of skepticism towards celebrities and influencers who advertise products and brands on social media, they still perceive celebrity advertisements as influential and trust celebrities to promote high-quality products.\n\nLimitations and Implications\n\nThe major limitation of this research is that it did not consider other variables that might impact celebrity trustworthiness. On the one hand, this would allow establishing if there are any factors mediating the relationship between exposure to social media advertisements and trust in celebrities. On the other hand, such research would need to have an entirely different study design and consider a variety of specific celebrities. Another limitation of the research was its time scope; to review the relationship between social media advertisement and the rise of SMIs and trust in celebrities, it would be useful to use a longitudinal research design that would allow viewing the gradual changes as they occurred over time.\n\nBoth of these gaps could be filled by further research. Although this study did not identify a significant relationship between the growth of SMI advertisement and celebrity trustworthiness, it remains a topic worth observing, as any existing trends would be valuable for businesses seeking to advertise products or services on social media. For instance, further research could establish particular characteristics or factors mediating the relationship between exposure to SMI advertisement and perceived celebrity trustworthiness. Moreover, studying the behavior of different celebrities regarding paid advertisements might help explain some of the effects observed in the current study.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rise of social media platforms has given businesses more opportunities to interact with their customers. Despite the growth of SMI advertisement, celebrity advertisements and endorsement remains among the popular marketing practices used by businesses worldwide to promote their products or services. In the online context, celebrity advertisement can be just as beneficial if the chosen celebrity’s followers are within the target customer audience of the company, service, or product.\n\nNevertheless, the popularization of social media advertisement and the rise of SMIs creates significant concerns for celebrity advertisement and endorsement. Research suggests that most users can determine if a post is a paid advertisement by looking at it; increased exposure to social media advertisement, on the other hand, might make people more skeptical of paid posts by SMIs or celebrities, as shown in the study.\n\nCelebrity trustworthiness is a powerful yet relatively unstudied phenomenon that could potentially impact celebrity credibility, thus increasing the effectiveness of the online advertisement. This research aimed to test the primary hypothesis that exposure to social media advertisement reduces perceived celebrity trustworthiness by making celebrity posts appear misleading. Although research findings did not support this hypothesis, other internal and external factors affect this relationship. Therefore, further research on the concept of celebrity trustworthiness in light of increased exposure to SMI advertisement could explain the findings of the present study.\n\nOverall, the present study offers a useful overview of the concept of celebrity trustworthiness in terms of the previous research, respondents’ perceptions, and statistical analysis of the results. As indicated by the findings, celebrity advertisement is still moderately influential, and businesses should continue to use it in promoting their products to the target audience. However, further research on the issue is advised to explore the relationship between the popularization of SMI advertisement and trust in celebrities.\n\nReferences\n\nChung, S., & Cho, H. (2017).

      "Leadership Failure Caused by Followers Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nSuccessful leadership entails the development of a strategy to align the leader’s interests with those of the followers. Followers have a major influence on the success of a leader because a lack of parallelism in the expectations of the respective parties translates to failure. Leaders should, therefore, look into developing high performance teams, and providing the necessary guidance to show commitment to empowering followers and facilitating the attainment of their expectations. Similarly, followers must ensure that they are committed to applying the relevant effort to deliver the required results. This study reveals that lack of cohesion, presence of differing expectations, and poor skills are the main reasons behind followers-related failure for leaders.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe primary role of leaders in an organization is to look into developing strategies to meet the goals highlighted by stakeholders. This implies that they need to be highly efficient in solving challenges that might face various projects, and they also need to provide guidance to the human assets handling the projects. The style of leadership assumed by a leader has a big influence on their success in leadership.\n\nFor instance, if the power distance between the leader and the followers is high, the leader might use the coercive approach to ensure the objectives of the company are attained (Prooijen & Lange, 2014). While leaders must look for solutions to the challenges emanating from their followers, the latter should also be obligated to show commitment to attaining mutual organizational goals (Banerjee & Ceri, 2016).\n\nLiterature Review\n\nAccording to Whistman (2016), one of the most important initiatives that a leader must take to avoid failure is ensuring that followers are in sync, in terms of skills and knowledge. It is imperative to develop a high performance team by first ensuring that every member of the team is acquainted with the desired goals and the timeline for delivering goals. Whistman (2016) suggests that the most effective way of eliminating failure resulting from incompetent followers is ensuring that training and development programs are availed for the entire team prior to the commencement of an important project.\n\nLahey (2014) also reveals that followers influence failure whenever their skills, beliefs, and motivation are not aligned with the inclinations of their leader. Leaders need to identify followers that have the same level of passion for the delivery of goals, and they have to select the highest performing teams, rather than working with everyone in the human resource base in important projects. Zeuch (2014) provides a comprehensive cover of the factors that have led to more leaders failing, with a close focus on the role of the followers in the failure. According the Zeuch (2014), leaders in the human resource department must be compelled to use a hands-on approach in training their followers to use current strategies in delivering goals.\n\nBell (2013) conducted a study that looked into the different ways that leaders attain success through their followers. Findings of the study revealed that fostering innovation among the followers is the most feasible way of succeeding in challenging projects. This implies that one of the major factors that results in failure for leaders is having followers with a low level of innovativeness. According to Steffens, Schuh, Haslam, Perez, and Dick (2015), the commitment of followers to attaining the goals highlighted by leaders is contingent on the ability for both parties to identify with each other.\n\nSinek (2014) reveals that lack of trust and cooperation in a team or organization is one of the factors that influence failure in leadership. If followers lose trust in their leaders, they are likely to portray a lower level of cooperation in the quest for success in various projects. According to Hughes, Ginnett, and Curphy (2015), the core value of successful leadership is ensuring there is a clear communication channel between the leader and the followers. Followers rely on leaders to clarify the requirements of different tasks. If followers misinterpret a directive, they are likely to apply efforts that contribute to failure, rather than success. It is, therefore, important to develop a communication channel that facilitates two-way interaction between the followers and the leaders (Gini & Green, 2013).\n\nPrimary Research\n\nThe research question for this study was; “How do followers cause leadership failure?” The primary method of research was an interview. The participant in the interview was a lady in the leadership function of the Dubai Electricity and Water Authority. I conducted the interview on a one-on-one basis because I work in the same organization. The participant holds the position of a manager in the internal audit section, which implies that she has a clear perspective of the factors that influence success and failure in the organization, with respect to the leaders and the followers.\n\nFindings and Discussion\n\nThe information provided by the interviewee revealed that it is important for the workplace to foster happiness among the employees. Followers require some motivation in the form of a reward system for their efforts. Leaders cannot influence high levels of commitment in their followers without making enticing promises, and delivering them when the desired objectives are delivered. For instance, the interviewee revealed that one of her approaches in leadership is ensuring that she communicates with her followers about the benefits to be received after delivering specific goals.\n\nLeaders are prone to failure if they do not have the right team. According to the manager, the right team is characterized with a high level of cohesion between the members, including the team leader. High cohesion in a team is attained through the development of effective interpersonal relationships among the members. The expectations of the leader and the followers must also attain parallelism for the team to acquire success in a given project.\n\nLeaders are charged with the responsibility of eliminating challenges associated with the presence of different expectations and interests among the followers. The manager proposed that leaders must continually enhance their leadership skills, and focus on motivating their followers. For instance, she revealed that she faces a challenge in being assertive with team members older than her. Working toward eliminating such challenges innovatively would result in success.\n\nInterview Analysis\n\nAccording to the findings from the interview, it is apparent that leaders have the perception that their followers must align their expectations and interests in a manner that attains parallelism with the desired goals. Some leaders might effectively communicate with the followers, but the lack of commitment and motivation on the part of the followers results in complications in the execution of the relevant tasks. In such cases, the followers are to blame for failure in projects. Identifying with the interests and expectations of the followers is, therefore, an integral part of ensuring that the followers do not foster failure in projects. The interview also revealed that effective communication is an integral part of balancing the relationship between the leader and followers.\n\nLimitations\n\nThe primary limitation for this study was the small sample space. I relied on information from a single participant, which implies that the validity of the findings might have to be tested by using a larger sample space in subsequent studies. Another limitation is that there is a professional relationship between me and the interviewer, which might have led to the provision of biased information from the participant. Future research on the topic should include leaders that are not affiliated with the interviewee.\n\nConclusion\n\nFindings from the research have clearly provided an answer for the research question. Lack of motivation, having different interests and expectations, and the lack of sufficient skills and knowledge in handling tasks are the main factors attributed to follower-influenced failures. Leaders must provide training and guidance to the followers when handling important projects. Additionally, there should be a balance in the relationship between the two parties. Selecting a high-performance team from a group of followers is also one of the ways that leaders can ascertain that their followers will help in delivering the desired objectives.\n\nReferences\n\nBanerjee, B., & Ceri, S.

      "Clinical Nurse Leaders in Patient-Centered Care Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Leadership and Management\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe topic selected for the research is the critical analysis of the roles of nurse navigators, clinical nurse leaders, and leaders in patient-centered care. The said topic is important for several reasons. First, the developments in the field of nursing in recent decades have created a respective expansion of the roles and responsibilities pertinent to nurses. At this point, it is important to understand that such an outcome is an inevitable side effect of the evolution that the concept of nursing currently undergoes.\n\nHowever, it is also important to recognize the undesirable effects associated with the phenomenon, such as the lack of recognition of responsibilities within specific areas, conflicts of interests, and, by extension, the decline in both individual and organizational performance (McInnes, Peters, Bonney, & Halcomb, 2015). Therefore, the issue is not to be ignored since its resolution can be beneficial on the organizational scale as well as for individual stakeholders.\n\nLeadership and Management\n\nSecond, the concept of leadership, which has garnered recognition as a cornerstone of the organizational development process, continues to be misunderstood and misused by some of its proponents. In the current situation, several roles that incorporate leadership as one of the primary aspects of the employees’ activities have been introduced into the nursing field. In the current form, some of the characteristic features of these roles interconnect or overlap while others are understandably different.\n\nCombined with the inherent complexity of the nursing profession, such a situation will likely contribute to confusion at the administrative and managerial levels. Also, it is possible to anticipate a certain amount of misattribution of the responsibilities both on the part of the practitioners and their colleagues, further undermining the efficiency of the innovation in question.\n\nThe first of the roles identified as requiring additional insight is that of the nurse navigator. According to the consensus, the role is intended to offer guidance to the patients and assist them in the healthcare process. Such an approach is justified considering the growing complexity of the healthcare system which becomes less approachable to an unprepared person. Simultaneously, the existing knowledge in support of the benefits of patient involvement makes it reasonable to expect the trend to continue in the identified direction (Brett et al., 2014). Simply put, a nursing navigator in its current form will grow in both demand and significance in the short term.\n\nThe second role is that of a clinical nurse leader. The increasing demand for the quality of care has created a need for consistent improvement of nursing proficiencies and skills, which has been addressed by the introduction of clinical nurse educators. However, the ongoing shortcomings in the safety of health care have identified the need for workers who could facilitate leadership at the point of care. In other words, the clinical nursing leader is someone who combines the educational and guidance capacities of the nursing educators while at the same time having the necessary degree of involvement with the care delivery practices and experience characteristic for advanced practice registered nurses. Also, clinical nurse leaders are expected to enable knowledge sharing, promote interdisciplinary relationships, and improve the workplace climate.\n\nThe third role in question is that of leaders in patient-centered care. Currently, patient-centered care is recognized as both a necessary and beneficial component of quality in health care delivery. However, its adoption at the organizational level remains a challenging task due to the resistance to change, insufficient understanding of costs and benefits associated with it, and lack of clarity regarding the approaches to it (Cliff, 2012). The leaders in patient-centered care are expected to address the identified issues by assisting the stakeholders at each organizational level with the process and offering guidance and counseling.\n\nAs can be seen, the roles contain intersection points – most notably, all of them rely on practices specific to the domain of leadership while addressing the issues. Also, all roles incorporate education, counseling, and encourage intra-organizational interactions. However, it is also evident that each role targets a specific area of health care – nurse navigators are oriented towards interaction with the patients whereas clinical nurse leaders engage in nurses’ professional development, and leaders in patient-centered care deal with change primarily at the administrative and managerial level. Thus, aside from the unreasonable expectations, the misattribution of the roles may lead to improper resource allocation, setbacks in performance, unfavorable patient outcomes, and an overall decrease in the quality of care.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe selected topic applies to several course competencies. Most prominently, it helps integrating concepts related to lead into the professional nursing role. While all of the roles in question are expected to incorporate leadership practices as a part of their responsibilities, a comprehensive inquiry will likely identify the areas where leadership is equally relevant for the majority of nursing roles and specialties, thus enhancing the understanding of the matter. Second, since all of the roles in question rely on interaction with the personnel, the research will identify the beneficial effects of collaborative leadership styles and illustrate how it may enhance the role of a nurse leader. In addition to clarifying the issue at hand, it will broaden the scope of application of leadership practices throughout the nursing domain.\n\nReferences\n\nBrett, J., Staniszewska, S., Mockford, C., Herron‐Marx, S., Hughes, J., Tysall, C., & Suleman, R.

      "Part-Time Studies Impact on Employee Performance Research Paper\n\nAbstract\n\nThe idea behind part-time studies entails looking for effective ways of improving one’s performance by accomplishing advanced tasks accurately and at the required standards. One arm of literature on the effect of part-time work on employees’ performance suggests that a flexible work environment has a positive impact on an organisation’s productivity.\n\nAlthough such literature does not consider activities undertaken by part-time workers after job, the current research hypothesises that the quest for increased performance drives the need for pursuing part-time studies with the view that employees can increase their knowledge repositories, hence enhancing the demand for their input in their career lines. However, considering the human capital theoretical framework, another hypothesis emerges that engaging in part-time studies reduces the time that is necessary for the accumulation of human capital.\n\nThus, engaging in part-time work with the objective of securing an opportunity for studies has negative effects on employees’ productivity. To test these hypotheses, data will be collected in the food and service industry. However, due to resource constraints, quantitative and qualitative data will only be collected from McDonald’s food chains, owing to its multinational nature. The research will use a sample size of 385 employees derived from 50 McDonald’s stores and franchises located in California.\n\nIntroduction\n\nPart-time work entails an increasingly popular phenomenon across the world. For example, in Germany, Sweden, and the UK, in every four employees, one of them works on a part-time basis while nearly 50% of the total workforce constitutes part-timers in Netherlands (Künn-Nelen, de Grip, & Fouarge, 2013). One realm of literature finds part-time jobs as having positive effects on job satisfaction (Garnero, Kampelmann, & Rycx, 2014). Hence, workers’ productivity (one of the measures of a firm’s performance) increases. The other realm argues that part-time work leads to a reduction in workforce capital, which compromises an organisation’s performance.\n\nThe changing environmental dynamics force corporations to integrate flexible work structures into their operations in an attempt to maintain competitiveness. Part-time work is viewed as one of the mechanisms for attaining such flexibility. Organisations adjust their schedules to meet their respective workforce’s preferences, for instance, balancing work and employees’ personal and family lives (Den Dulk, Groeneveld, Ollier-Malaterre, & Valcour, 2013).\n\nInflexible work environments may increase employees’ decisions to leave an organisation voluntarily. For example, according to Cegarra-Leiva, Sanchez-Vidal, and Cegarra-Navaro (2012), Merrill’s survey conducted in 2005 revealed that 16% of all baby boomers sought part-time jobs. About 42 percent of those studied preferred jobs that allowed time for leisure. In other words, the emerging workforce prefers companies that provide flexible jobs to permit them to take charge of other equally important life aspects such as pursuing further studies (Revels & Morris, 2012).\n\nSince employees’ performance entails an important factor that contributes to organisational productivity and hence profitability, companies risk losing their edge if part-time studies are proved to have negative impacts on workforce performance. This paper proposes a research to determine the effects of part-time studies on employee performance in the food and service industry.\n\nAims and Objectives\n\nBased on the data collected from McDonald’s, the current study aims at investigating how part-time studies affect employees’ performance in the food and service industry. This aim is important since companies are adopting flexible work structures that allow people to engage in other equally important life activities such as pursuing further education or advancing their careers (Cegarra-Leiva et al., 2012).\n\nThe primary objective of the research entails determining whether this trend affects food and service businesses positively or negatively in terms of employees’ performance. The secondary objective is to prescribe recommendations on the appropriateness of the part-time study programmes in companies that operate in the industry.\n\nRationale for Study\n\nBusinesses have different desired outcomes. Hence, a discussion of aspects such as part-time studies, which may affect organisational performance, cannot be accomplished through an examination of performance variables in general organisations. This basis underlines the rationale for limiting the study discussion to a multinational organisation such as McDonald’s. It is crucial to question the logic behind examining the possibility of a link between part-time studies and employees’ performance.\n\nIndeed, companies have responsibilities that range from increasing returns on their investments to availing higher financial resources for CSR initiatives with the goal of meeting their obligations to their owners and stakeholders. Accomplishing these responsibilities only happens following the optimal utilisation of key resources and capabilities, including employees, in enhancing organisational productivity.\n\nCritical Review of Literature\n\nEmployees’ performance is critical in enhancing organisations’ productivity. McDonald’s uses people as one of its most important resources and capabilities to deliver value to its clients. In this quest, the organisation ensures that it does not create situations that give rise to employee-work conflicts, which subsequently lead to a high labour turnover (Carlson, 2015). This initiative links well with the existing literature on the impacts of work-life balance on employees’ performance. For example, Cegarra-Leiva et al. (2012) examined whether initiatives of employees’ work-life balance had any direct impact on their retention in an organisation through the stimulation of high work satisfaction in SME settings.\n\nThe study recommended the improvement of workers’ satisfaction to increase their retention. This recommendation is essential in establishing the role played by McDonald’s increased focus on ensuring that its workers are contented with their jobs. Such business strategy has led to a substantial increase in the organisation’s performance. However, it may not answer the question of whether part-time studies entail one of the work-life balance initiatives that can enhance employees’ performance in the organisation.\n\nChanges in working conditions force human resources to behave differently, hence resulting in their vocational adjustment with the view of experiencing better work success and/or fulfilment (Carlson, 2015). Hence, if workers fail to respond to any transformations in their work environment, including the need to pursue further career growth through part-time studies, they may be frustrated. This situation may lead to occupational maladjustment (Kramar & Syed, 2012, p. 79).\n\nHowever, this understanding of workers’ adaptation in responses to internal and external stimuli does not depict the role of part-time studies in enhancing their performance. Nonetheless, Kramar and Syed’s (2012) argument forms an important paradigm for understanding how part-time studies affect staff performance.\n\nThere lacks an extensive literature on how part-time studies influence workforce performance. However, it can be analysed from the context of the effect of part-time work on staff performance, a strategy that is founded on the assumption that after working, one can engage in other personal growth activities, including part-time studies. Such an approach yields two strands of theoretical frameworks. The first one analyses how flexible work programmes, including part-time work, influence a firm’s performance. Giannetti and Madia (2013) examine how flexible work structures affect the performance of innovative companies from an Italian context.\n\nThe research is restricted to the analysis of the effects of flexible work on employees’ capacity to create innovative goods with reference to the percentage of new commodities sold against yearly total sales. Giannetti and Madia (2013) conclude that part-time work directly contributes to an increased level of workers’ innovation and performance in a firm. Therefore, one can hypothetically argue that part-time studies offer employees an opportunity to acquire new knowledge repositories, which enhance their innovation levels, including their capacity to create original products.\n\nThe second line of literature discusses in details the concept of part-time work and its effects on employees’ performance. For example, using Belgian data, Garnero et al. (2014), after differentiating between large part-time and small part-time work, reports that those working for huge part-time add more hourly value to their organisations’ financial performance compared to permanent workers. However, small part-time workers had no significant effects on their companies’ financial performance when compared to full-time employees (Garnero et al., 2014). The research also claims that the gender of the part-time workforce contributes differently to the increased performance.\n\nKünn-Nelen et al. (2013) studied the role of part-time job in enhancing staff performance in the service sector by focusing on the pharmaceutical industry in the Netherlands. The researchers analysed annual sales as the mechanism for measuring financial performance. They also investigated the appropriate optimal working hours for part-timers by differentiating between extensive, standard, and low working hours.\n\nThe researchers found that part-time work had a positive statistical significance in terms of increasing the pharmaceutical industry’s annual sales, with medium part-time work having the biggest effect. A critical review of past literature reveals that it has focused mainly on how part-time work contributes to employees’ performance without considering the tasks undertaken after work. Therefore, research on the impact of part-time studies on employees’ performance introduces a new theoretical framework for analysing how part-time work influences employees’ productivity as measured by an organisation’s financial performance.\n\nResearch Design and Strategies\n\nApproaches\n\nThe current research focuses on testing two the hypotheses with the goal of examining the possible relationships. It investigates the link between part-time studies (independent variable) and employees’ performance (dependent variable). Through a strict procedure (structured interviews), both numerical and non-numerical data will be collected followed by the respective analysis. Hence, the research uses deductive and inductive approaches. Here, the goal entails to not only prescribe a theory on the relationship between part-time studies and employees’ performance in the food and service industry but also establish a pattern of the underlying meanings.\n\nPhilosophical Orientation\n\nDepending on the number of hours worked before attending part-time studies and following Garnero et al.’s (2014) approach, this research differentiates three types of part-time study groups, namely, low, standard, and extensive. The Bureau of Labour Statistics (2015) informs that people in America work for an average of roughly 39 hours in a week. This figure is lower relative to the conventional 40 hours of work in a week, which this paper regards as the fulltime working hours in a week.\n\nThe current research is founded on the human capital philosophy. Part-time studies reduce the amount of time that a worker spends in the work environment. Hence, such employees have a lower level of human capital accumulation (Erskine, 2012). This research hypothesises (H 1 ) that part-time studies have a negative impact on employees’ performance in the food and service businesses where such schooling deviates from the workers’ line of duty.\n\nThe studies lower an employee’s individual productivity and hence the overall organisational performance. Otherwise, it hypothesises (H 2 ) that part-time studies have a positive impact on employees’ performance in the food and service companies if they are in-line with the workers’ line of duty since they give an opportunity for improving their skills in their specific areas of operations.\n\nResearch Strategies\n\nResearch can adopt qualitative, quantitative, mixed methods (pragmatic approach), or the emancipator approach (participatory or advocacy design) (Saunders, Lewis, & Thornhill, 2012). The current study will adopt both quantitative and qualitative approaches, otherwise referred to as the mixed methods. This pragmatic approach deploys both quantitative information and numerical data (Saunders et al., 2012). Therefore, this research will deploy the mixed methods strategy\n\nChoices and Time Horizon\n\nAll studies consume time and monetary resources. Since such resources are limited in supply, researchers make modifications and choices on how to conduct a study that achieves the intended aim(s) and objective(s) (Saunders et al., 2012). The researcher of the current project chooses to perform the study in the context of a multinational organisation, McDonald’s, but only focusing on its stores in California due to monetary and time constraints. Table 1 shows the time horizons for the study\n\nTable 1: Time Horizons.\n\nTime      Activity                                                                                                             \nWeek 1    Review and submit the proposal for approval from McDonald’s stores in California where the research will be conducted\nWeek 2    Review data analysis software programmes and consult with my instructor to determine the appropriate one for use     \nWeek 3    Consult with the management of the stores to secure an interview opportunity                                         \nWeek 4    Recruit data analysts                                                                                                \nWeek 5    Collect data assuming the proposal has been approved                                                                 \nWeek 6-7  Analyse data and submit the findings                                                                                 \n\n\nPopulation and Sample\n\nInterviewed subjects will be sampled randomly in 50 McDonald’s stores and franchises in California. Quantitative research will begin with the selection of a sample size or the number of research subjects. The sample size will vary according to the expected statistical confidence levels (Saunders et al., 2012). When selecting the subjects of the study, sample parameters, for instance, confidence interval or error margin, the size of the studied population, the expected confidence level, and the Standard Deviation (SD) must be known.\n\nIn this research, the total number of employees or the population of the 50 stores and franchises may be important. Although this data may be obtained from the respective stores’ human resource departments, it is not necessary. In most studies, the population is commonly unknown (Saunders et al., 2012). The only important thing is to determine the most appropriate demographic group for the study. This group constitutes McDonald’s partial workers who engage in part-time studies. Full-time workers will also be recruited as a control group. After determining the target group for the research, establishing the confidence interval for the research will follow.\n\nPerfect samples do not exist in any research (Saunders et al., 2012). This awareness underlines the importance of setting limits on the permissible error or the confidence level. The current research uses a standard value of +/-5. This range means the study will deploy the 95% confidence interval. It also uses an SD value of 0.5. Different confidence levels correspond to dissimilar Z-score figures. A 95% confidence level corresponds to a Z-score value of 1.96. This value makes it possible to compute the sample size using the equation:\n\nSubstituting the chosen values in the equation yields a sample size of 385.\n\nData Types and Sources\n\nThe current research focuses on how employers and employees interpret the issue of part-time jobs and/or studies with reference to how partial working dictates organisations’ work output and consequently their ability to make more sales. Hence, the current study begins by selecting a sample size that yields powerful qualitative and quantitative information for making the appropriate recommendations on the effects of part-time studies on workers’ performance in the food and service industry. In other words, the research uses non-numerical and numerical data types from a primary source. The primary source is based on McDonald’s employees working in stores and franchises in California.\n\nTo qualify for inclusion in the study, such employees should have been successfully recruited through random sampling and/or accepted to participate in the project by signing consent forms. They should fall into one of the four groups: permanent, extensive, standard, or low part-time employees. Apart from being full-time workers, the other three groups should also be participating in part-time studies.\n\nData Collection Techniques\n\nStructured interviews encompass the data collection technique. The researcher will explain to the respondents the study purpose and its significance. Each respondent will be required to sign a consent form before taking an interview that will last for a maximum of 20 minutes. The interview will begin by capturing the respondent’s demographic information such as educational background, age, and gender.\n\nQuestions will also be administered to collect information on the respondents’ experiences with the issue of combining part-time work and part-time studies at McDonald’s. They will also respond to the question of whether they had been recording increasing sales over time. If yes, they will comment on whether their part-time studies provided the necessary knowledge to enhance their selling abilities or contribution to their respective companies. The researcher also will also collect a three-month employees’ sales data from the head of sales department in every store and franchise. Data will be collected according to the following procedure:\n\n 1. Three hundred and eighty-five copies of interview questions will be distributed without selecting the target audience in all the stores and franchises\n 2. The respondents will indicate their gender on the questionnaires. After collecting the filled interview questions, the next step will involve data cleaning and analysis using the SPSS tool.\n 3. After the analysis, the results will be presented followed by a discussion of the findings.\n\nMethod of Analysis\n\nThe research yields numerical data that has to be analysed to help in drawing findings. For example, relationships will have to be determined. This process requires skills in data processing and analysis, which the researcher does not currently possess. Therefore, services of a qualified statistician will come in handy. However, in addition to the SPSS tool, the statistician will use Künn-Nelen et al.’s (2013) approach to empirical estimation of the impacts of part-time work on employees’ performance in the selected stores and franchises.\n\nHe or she will use data on the sales made by the studied employees. Here, the statistician will differentiate between products sold by employees pursuing part-time studies in areas related to their work and those of workers pursuing part-time schooling in areas unrelated to their current partial work at McDonald’s. Before applying Equation 1 below, as described by Künn-Nelen et al. (2013), it will be crucial to differentiate sales’ data from full-time workers.\n\nThe variable ( i ) is the dependent variable (sales) at any time t . As explained by Künn-Nelen et al. (2013), “the main explanatory variables are the share of employees working in a large, medium or small part-time job measured in full-time equivalents, whereas, δ1,ζ and η¹ denote the corresponding regression coefficients” (p. 1186). X stands for the controlled variable while U1 refers to the error term of sales ( i ) made at time t . Since part-time studies may have an impact on sales made by an employee, using the pooled Linear Probability Model (LPM) and estimating using pooled Ordinary Least Squares (OLS), Künn-Nelen et al. ‘s (2013) Equation 2 can be developed.\n\nLimitations of the Proposed Methodology\n\nThe methodology assumes that part-time studies have equal effects on employees’ selling capability given that such workers engage in one kind of partial job (extensive, standard, or low). It ignores one’s giftedness or ability to win more customers. However, the biggest limitation arises from the use of pooled Ordinary Least Squares to estimate Equations 1 and 2. The approach is misleading since an organisation may employ partial employees who are pursuing part-time studies due to a shortage of the labour supply or the lack of competent and skilled full-time workers. To this extent, the concept of part-time work becomes endogenous.\n\nThis situation underlines the need for introducing additional approaches to the analysis process. For example, the strategy of instrumental variable estimation may help to overcome the challenge. Lastly, an organisation may not have the capacity to keep data on the contribution of each employee in the total sales made, for instance, in a week, a month, or annually.\n\nReferences\n\nBureau of Labour Statistics.

      "Visual Cameras and Inspection in Fast Food Restaurant Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Plan of Work\n 2. Vision Systems and a Competitive Advantage\n 3. Reasons to Support the Technology\n 4. Vision Systems as a Used Production Method\n 5. Advantages and Disadvantages of Visual Inspections\n 6. Benefits of the Technology\n 7. Impact of the Technology\n 8. References\n\nRegarding the current technological progress and the recognition of new approaches and methods in the food industry, many people and companies from different countries are bothered with an idea of how to achieve a competitive advantage, make a right choice, and understand what type of improvement in production technology can be more appropriate for their products. In this paper, the issue of recent advances in production technology will be discussed in order to investigate the worth of visual systems in the food industry.\n\nToday, it is not a complicated task to develop new products and follow the norms and requirements that are established by special organizations. However, many company or certain individuals find some new ways to break the system and overcome important rules that may influence the quality of services and products that can be offered to ordinary people. The implementation of vision systems is an area of technology that promotes advances, enhances the production of high-quality products, and improves productivity at different levels.\n\nPlan of Work\n\nA firm aims at producing fast food for the US population. This field is rather competitive in the world, and it is necessary to introduce some advancement in production technology and prove the importance of the chosen approach. The description of the peculiar features of visual inspection in a particular industry, fast food, is a step to be taken. Then, the evaluation of the current studies and the explanations of how this technology becomes a used-production method in the food industry are required. Finally, a comparison of advantages and disadvantages of vision systems and inspection should help to clarify the benefits and the possible impact of this technology being implemented by one of the American firms on people, communities, organizations, and the food industry.\n\nVision Systems and a Competitive Advantage\n\nNowadays, people try to control each other’s activities and make sure that no rules are broken, and all instructions are followed. However, in many cases, inspections organized by humans remain to be exhausting and intense causing certain errors or omissions. Heizer, Render, and Munson (2017) suggest using vision systems as one of the possible types of advancement in production in terms of which video cameras and computer technologies perform inspection roles.\n\nModern people want to know as much as possible about everything. They find it necessary to surf the web and learn their diagnoses before they actually visit a doctor or investigate the history of a restaurant before place an order. Almost the same things happen in the food industry. People want to know how and under which conditions their food is prepared. Vision systems turn out to be a solid competitive advantage for many organizations with the help of which they can provide their potential and regular customers with the required information and a level of awareness and, at the same time, control the work of employees and the quality of food offered.\n\nReasons to Support the Technology\n\nA firm that wants to achieve positive results and stay competitive in the fast food industry has to adopt a vision inspection technology because of several reasons. First, it helps to inform customers about what happens in the kitchen, how their food is prepared, and if they can trust to the chosen organization. Second, leaders can use this technology to gain control over the work of their employees. Finally, visual inspection can be appreciated and even financially supported by special organizations that aim at controlling food quality.\n\nSome restaurants have already used Instagram or other social media sources to inform their regular or potential customers about the quality and variety of food that can be offered to them (Guidry, Messner, Jin, & Medina-Messner, 2015). Not many companies are ready to support constant video inspections available online due to a number of organizational and legal issues. Those companies that choose to be open online are usually preferred by people. In other words, visual systems can increase customer trust and loyalty.\n\nVision Systems as a Used Production Method\n\nDuring the last two decades, the level of awareness of food safety issues and food environments has been increased (Choi & Scharff, 2017). There are many TV shows that discuss how food has to be prepared. People want to know more about how different services that they have access to are developed and checked. Vision systems have been already successfully used by different banks and companies where control and order are required. Video cameras are used in stores and offices to check if there are some problems or violations in buildings. With time, it becomes interesting if there are some challenges in the kitchen. So that vision systems, as a used production method in numerous organizations, can be offered as an advanced technology in the fast food industry.\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Visual Inspections\n\nThe main advantages of visual inspection in fast food restaurants are its price (as a rule, cameras do not cost a lot), fast image acquisition (people observe what actually happen in the kitchen), and ease inspection access (people watch and check if everything is ok in the organization). However, it is also necessary to remember about the possible disadvantages of this technology. For example, certain ethical concerns and employees’ freedoms may be taken into consideration.\n\nAll employees should agree with an idea of being broadcasted online all the time. Not all organizations may allow these cameras being implemented due to different reasons. Visual inspection should not be defined as an obligation for all American companies. Finally, there is a small field of view in cameras. There are no guarantees for people to be sure that they can see everything. Therefore, the implementation of visual cameras may cause a number of ethical concerns that have to be solved.\n\nBenefits of the Technology\n\nTaking into consideration the history of the chosen advancement technology and the advantages and disadvantages of this idea in the fast food production industry, modern organizations and restaurants have to be aware of the main benefits of visual systems being implemented. First, it improves people’s awareness of what is happening in the restaurants and the areas which are not demonstrated to ordinary visitors. Second, the price of this technology is not high, and the outcomes such as an improved customer base and high-quality production are priceless.\n\nFinally, the leaders in the chosen industry have a chance to control their employees and observe their activities anytime they want. Food production is the area that is characterized by a number of requirements and norms. Visual inspection is a good way to check and improve human activities.\n\nImpact of the Technology\n\nTo understand the impact of the technology, it is enough to think what can happen if it is not implemented. First, it is necessary to realize that other companies may use this technology and attract new people. Second, it is a good chance to improve the quality of services and food. Finally, people may think that if it is not adopted than an organization has something to hide. Clients’ concerns and guesses can hardly lead to some positive outcomes.\n\nReferences\n\nChoi, J., & Scharff, R.L. (2017).

      "Customer Decision Making in Shopping Malls Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Objectives of the research\n 3. Information required for fulfilling the research objectives\n 4. Considerations during a research process\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis report will outline the significance of customer research decision making when it comes to the Australian Westfield Shopping Malls in comparison with Chadstone shopping center. Research into customer satisfaction decision making is crucial for any marketing manager that aims at driving up the sales figures that are recorded at his organization. The Australian Westfield Limited owns modern malls both in New Zealand and Australia under a common international brand known as the Westfield Corporation.\n\nThe report will first dwell on the retail chain’s marketing objectives followed by the information that is needed to complete effective research. However, it won’t be complete without having a look at some of the main pitfalls that the marketing manager should be concerned about during the entire period that the research is ongoing. The final section will highlight the significance of the marketing manager’s role during the entire marketing research and implementation phase.\n\nObjectives of the research\n\nThe main objective of this particular research is to better inform the Australian Westfield Shopping mall’s marketing department and manager of the changing consumer trends. The exercise will also seek to identify the current consumer response to the organization’s goods and services. It will also be a good chance for the marketing manager to evaluate the company’s reputation versus that of its main competitors such as the Chadstone shopping center.\n\nWith increasing levels of competition in the retail sector owing to the advent of online shopping platforms, the research activity will assist the company in introducing new goods and services, as well as improve on its existing portfolio (Alrubaiee & Al-Nazer 2015).\n\nNot only does it give the mall an added advantage over its main competitors but also re-energizes the enthusiasm of its existing clientele base. The availability of numerous marketing platforms means that the company should select not only those platforms that are suitable and effective in reaching its targeted clientele base (Bijmolt et al. 2010). An effective marketing campaign involves the collection of market information that can be useful to the retail chain’s decision-makers when it comes to making core objective strategies, plans as well as policies.\n\nInformation required for fulfilling the research objectives\n\nSuccessive retail chains possess extensive knowledge of their competitors, as well as customers. After identifying the research objectives, the marketing manager will have to come up with several research questions that touch on the market segment, closest competitors as well as the customers. The information collected will fall into two main categories, i.e. quantitative and qualitative information.\n\nThe success of the marketing research project will be heavily dependent on the relevance and quality of the information or data collected. The quality of the data will depend, to a large extent, on the techniques or methods that have been used to collect it (Nargundkar 2008). The overall suitability of the diverse methods at the researcher’s disposal plays a crucial role in their eventual selection. Reliable and accurate information allows the business to have a clear picture of the nature of the market that it is operating in allowing it to make accurate projections.\n\nConsumer tastes and preferences are crucial information for the marketing manager of the Australian Westfield Shopping malls. An individual consumer harbors a set of values and preferences whose determination may easily lie outside the conventional realms of economics (Parasuraman, Grewal & Krishnan 2007). These are dependent upon their level of education, culture, individual tastes, among several other factors.\n\nThe measure of such values in this model for a particular good comes regarding the real opportunity cost to the individual who buys and consumers the good or services. In case an individual purchases a particular item, it means that the opportunity cost of the particular purchase is the forgone service or good that the person could have bought instead. The information collected during the research will be used by the marketing manager to develop a model in which the retail chain can map or even graphically derive the preferences of the consumer (Wiid & Diggines 2009).\n\nThe objective of the consumer is to select the bundle of goods that provides the greatest amount of satisfaction as they define it. However, such consumes are significantly constrained by their choices. Such constraints are directly defined by the take-home income, as well as the prices of the goods that have been placed on offer.\n\nThe marketing manager is aware that a consumer’s primary objective is to allocate income between different goods to achieve the greatest level of utility. An extensive gathering of information by the marketing manager can reveal consumer preferences that were otherwise unknown to the organization. In the case of a shopping center or mall, the customers’ perception or liming of the interior can influence his final decision on whether or not to make a purchase.\n\nThe shopping center’s interior design can create a particular ambiance or personality to the shopping center through lighting, decorative features, air-conditioning as well as floor finished that serve to enrich the atmosphere and differentiate it from its closest competitor in Chadstone shopping center. The mall’s environment can be further enhanced through the creative location of the main tenants, movement facilitators, and leisure facilities.\n\nThe shopfront design or display also plays a crucial role in sprucing up the shopping mall’s circulation and environment. Customers are less likely to feel compelled to hang around in a mall that has poor air circulation, tenant layout, confusing signage, and dead-end corridors. Such an element greatly affects the impression of both the existing customers and any prospective customers. An attractive shopping center interface may make the customer have a great experience and increase the likelihood of them returning to the same mall (Schmidt & Hollensen 2006). Westfield and Chadstone shopping centers compete for a similar demographic and customer class. This, therefore, means that the slightest improvements in the ambiance or the environment can be pivotal in swaying the preferences of the customer.\n\nThe research process can also collect information on effective communication strategies that can be employed to sway potential customers from the Chadstone shopping center. A successful shopping center is expected to engage in integrated communication campaigns that include advertisements placed on the local media and TV stations to counter any negative perceptions (Delre et al. 2010). Promotion stands for the marketing communication of a product to generate a positive response from the targeted customer. It will aim to improve the company’s image in general by establishing a unique brand in the customer’s minds (Bradley 2013).\n\nPromotional activities of the mall will also be an effective platform to differentiate it through increased patronage, image communication, as well as stimulate merchandise purchases. The element of customer service plays a central role in customer retention (Delre et al. 2010). A simple improvement such as making the stairways disability-friendly may endear the mall to the surrounding community and set it apart from Chadstone shopping center.\n\nConsiderations during a research process\n\nThe pivotal role of marketing research is to provide a retail chain with accurate market information. Sound decisions are reliant on verifiable information and are not only based on one’s gut feeling. Marketing managers are expected to make several strategic decisions (Zikmund & Babin 2007). Organizations take part in marketing research to identify and solve any available marketing problems (Delre et al. 2007). In the case, the Westfield Shopping center may be facing stiff competition from its closest rival, the Chadstone shopping center. The latter’s marketing manager would best decipher such a trend through surveying customers that frequent both malls to know their opinion on the differences that make them choose Chadstone over Westfield shopping center.\n\nMarketing and consumer research have both witnessed resurgence with the broad adoption of the World Wide Web and the popularity of Facebook and other social media platforms. It has become easier for organizations to directly link up with customers and gather their information that is fed into a central database and get matched with millions of other pieces of information that have been collected in unrelated activities.\n\nHowever, how a marketing manager carries out his research may have grave ethical repercussions that impact the lives of individuals in a manner that they are yet to understand fully. More so, companies may have to deal with an unforeseen backlash in case their market research activities are deemed to be unethical (Parasuraman, Grewal & Krishnan 2007).\n\nThe marketing manager should avoid using deceptive practices when conducting his research activities. The effortlessness with which the organization gets its hands-on customer information may create premises for unethical practices. The phenomenon may manifest itself in a variety of ways. For instance, the owners of the site may deliberately conceal the fact that the personal information of the users is collected as they log in and browse the site; similarly, a change in the database numbers may be used to retrieve the customers’ data without informing them about it. Either way, the organization opens a leeway for deceitfully acquiring customers’ data, which makes the identified actions not only ethically questionable but also illegal.\n\nPrivacy invasion is another issue that needs to be touched upon when addressing the controversial aspects of market research (Wiid & Diggines 2009). Due to the extensive opportunities that the latest technological advances provide, modern companies have vast options of collecting, keeping, processing, and transferring the customers’ private data, therefore, treading the territory of clients’ security.\n\nAs a rule, companies using the identified strategy tend to disclose their activities from their clientele, which means that the target audience is unaware of the firm’s actions. The organization may make use of this kind of information to contact the customer or his close associates with targeted advertising. Even though the effects of targeting as an advertising tool might be viewed as alluring in theory, the actual outcomes of an aggressive targeting-based strategy are likely to repulse the audience from purchasing the product or using the service suggested to them.\n\nConfidentiality breach is yet another ethical issue that one has to watch out for when conducting marketing research. Organizations commonly share information about their clients with affiliates or partners (Wiid & Diggines 2009). Customers are often allowed to opt-out of the information sharing in case they do not want to be part of the business’ information-sharing agreement with its partners. It is unethical to disclose a person’s information without proper authorization.\n\nAdvertising changes how customers perceive certain ideas and concepts, shaping public philosophy and ethics so that the target products could sell successfully (Wiid & Diggines 2009). Consequently, the market research must be carried out in a manner as honest and transparent as possible so that its outcomes could reflect the actual situation (including the customers’ needs, the specifics of the local culture, the current social issues and dilemmas, etc.).\n\nFurthermore, the challenge is aggravated by the results of biased studies based on prejudiced concepts and ideas. The outcomes of the identified researches are dire; although companies benefit financially to a considerable degree from applying the study results to their marketing strategies, the social constructs that are used in the process destroy the very fabric of social relationships by reinforcing negative stereotypes instead of subverting them (Wiid & Diggines 2009).\n\nA good example may be seen when marketing research that has a one-dimensional view of ethnic or racial minorities may do a significant amount of harm if he is permitted to shape a particular marketing campaign based on his unfairly skewed data collection (Bradley 2013). For instance, the ubiquitous nature of the information gathering strategy used by the Westfield shopping mall creates leeway for carrying out deceptive practices, which require a counterstrategy for protecting the customers’ right to privacy.\n\nThe marketing manager should also be careful not to design surveys that a significant number of the customers decide not to bother to respond. A failure to respond to a survey increases the number of gaps in the collected information. Such non-respondents may search for reasons why individuals do not want to take part in the survey. They may arrive at conclusions such as the survey being too lengthy or that the incentive to take part in it was not appealing enough (Zikmund & Babin 2007).\n\nSurveys may also include several sources of bias. The shopping center’s marketing manager may believe, for example, that they have come up with an online survey to appeal to respondents that are drawn from all sorts of ethnic backgrounds (Wiid & Diggines 2009).\n\nHowever, the utilized images or even queries might be biased or favor a particular ethnic community or may offend several ethnic groups. The contents of the survey, as well as the format, should be acceptable to all the possible audience from which the shopping mall is seeking information (Zikmund & Babin 2007). Any forms of bias can be eliminated from the surveys being done by remaining neutral in the questioning.\n\nNeutrality can be enforced by the marketing manager submitting the pre-written questions for a peer review. An opinion from a third party who has no interest in the outcome of the survey helps to remove subtle bias that may otherwise be unseen by the one conducting the survey. The survey should also avoid questions that come with a set of possible answers and instead opt for more questions that allow the respondent to give their opinion with no constraints.\n\nA significant amount of research normally involves observation of customers in action while in the process noting their unique preferences. In the case of a mall, a significant number of the customers walking down the aisle are on the premises to window shop and compare prices before making up his mind on what to purchase and from which store (Zikmund & Babin 2007). In case such customers feel pressured or intruded upon by the staff members observing them, they will opt to shop at Chadstone shopping center in the process denying Westfield Shopping Centre much-needed revenue.\n\nThe marketing manager should impart the principles of ethical marketing to the organization’s staff to endear it to the customers (Zikmund & Babin 2007). However, although it contains the term marketing, ethical marketing is less of a marketing method but more of business philosophy. As a result of implementing the philosophy described above, opportunities for enhancing the importance of fairness and essential ethical principles can be created in the environment of an organization to prevent the further instances of abusing customers’ privacy and misusing the data collection tools at the company’s disposal (Zikmund & Babin 2007).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe marketing manager’s role in the entire research process cannot be understated. This is because he has intimate knowledge of the mall’s business policies as well as projected goals over the coming years. His involvement in such an exercise allows him to marry the reality on the ground with the policies being pursued by the top management. If the two do not tally, the manager may recommend some changes to the board to allow the organization to take full advantage of the changing conditions on the ground.\n\nWithout his involvement, an honest assessment of the direction and efficacy of the company’s policies would be difficult to come by. This would render the exercise futile and a waste of resources without any clear benefit for the company’s strategic position in the community or market at large. The marketing manager or department serves as the board’s ears and eyes on the ground.\n\nReference List\n\nAlrubaiee L & Al-Nazer N 2015,’Investigate the impact of relationship marketing orientation on customer loyalty: The customer’s perspective’, International Journal of Marketing Studies , Vol.2, no. 1, pp. 101-112.

      "Is Facebook Making Us Lonely? Essay\n\nNowadays people cannot imagine their lives without social networking. Social networks are everywhere: we like pictures on Instagram, we read the latest tweets on Twitter, and we interact with our friends on Facebook. Most of the people take for granted the fact that people spend eight to ten hours on social networking every day (Antoci, Sabatini, and Sodini 33). Even though social networks have been created to make people interact with each other and fight loneliness, many people agree that social networks actually destruct the real-life conversation and emotions.\n\nIt is pretty reasonable to mention that there are two points of view that are opposing each other in the present day – the ones who think that social networking does not harm the human character and those who believe that social networks destroy the human spirit and give a fake feel of happiness (Tufekci 1).\n\nThere are four basic needs that every individual has: the need for company and friendliness, the need for security with the purpose of coping with indecision, the need for meaning, and the need for the venture and new experience (Cotterell 14).\n\nThere have been numerous researches on this issue, and the researchers have always wanted to identify some things: how their testees felt in general, how anxious and deserted they were, how much they had used Facebook, and how frequently they had had direct communication with others since the prior text message. It has been found that the more people used Facebook in the period flanked by the two texts, the less content they felt—and the more their total level of fulfillment decayed. The data illustrated that Facebook was making them hopeless and gloomy (Konnikova 1).\n\nAccording to Marche, loneliness is definitely not something that Facebook or Twitter or any of the less important forms of social networking is doing to us. He believes that it is only us, who should take full responsibility for what we do. Casting technology as some ambiguous, impersonal essence of the past making us do something we do not want to do, is a frail explanation. We make choices about how we use our technologies, not vice versa (Marche 1).\n\nOur ubiquitous new technologies trap us into more and more artificial connections at just the same time that they make dodging the chaos of human communication easy. The attractiveness of Facebook, the cause of its influence, is that it allows us to be social while getting us out of the disconcerting reality of the world – the unintentional revelations we make, the awkward moments, and the overall ungainliness of direct interaction. As an alternative, we have the good-looking smoothness of a superficially social engine. Marche explains that Facebook has discovered that a connection is not identical to a pledge and that prompt and absolute connection is no rescue, no permit to a more contented, healthier world or a more open-minded version of civilization.\n\nSherry Turkle, in her article, is much more unconvinced about the positive effects of online culture. She articulates that today, unconfident in our relations and worried about intimacy, we want technology to find the ways to be in relationships and keep us away from them all at once. Turkle explains that the problematic part of digital confidentiality is that it is eventually imperfect. The bonds we create through the Internet are not, at long last, the bonds that link us, but they are the bonds that worry us. We don’t want to encroach on each other, so as an alternative we continually intrude on each other, but not in the real world (Turkle 19).\n\nSelf-presentation on Facebook is incessant, strongly mediated, and influenced by a pretentious indifference that abolishes even the probability of spontaneity. Managing the demonstration of the self has become a permanent occupation for numerous individuals. Turkle finds a noteworthy connection between Facebook use and self-admiration. She writes that Facebook users have advanced levels of overall narcissism and exhibitionism than those who do not use Facebook. She, in fact, argues that Facebook explicitly fulfills the narcissistic person’s need to participate in self-promoting and insincere behavior. There needs to be a profound and thoughtful discussion about appreciating each other – as people, nothing more or less.\n\nTo my mind, both authors provided great insight into the impact of Facebook on people’s lives and personality changes. The issue of people living their lives online instead of seeking a direct face-to-face conversation becomes more relevant to every other year. Marche’s and Turkle’s points of view both were consistent and based on the factual data, but the author tends to agree more with the latter opinion.\n\nThe propaganda of narcissism has become evident later as more and more people fall for the “selfie” trend and the feeling of self-love is ubiquitous. In fact, in a decade, most of the people would not even want to see each other in real life and feel quite comfortable as they get used to just texting each other. That is truly upsetting, and people should pay attention to the problem that crept up unnoticed to humanity and represents a real threat to character traits.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAntoci, Angelo, Fabio Sabatini, and Mauro Sodini. “Bowling Alone but Tweeting Together: The Evolution of Human Interaction in the Social Networking Era.” Quality & Quantity Qual Quant 48.4 (2013): 1911-927.

      "Karl Marx’s Sociology and Conflict Theory Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nKarl Marx’s contribution to sociology is indisputably great, as he is considered one of the most influential theorists in the sphere of sociology. He is well-known for criticizing Capitalism and the political, economic, and social consequences that it can bring. He vividly describes his vision and provides the advantages of Communism in his works, predominantly in “The Manifesto of the Communist Party” and “Capital” (Crossman). Also, he introduced such concepts as false consciousness, base and superstructure, and historical materialism, which are cited in numerous works of other researchers.\n\nAccording to Marx’s conflict theory, when power and resources are unequally distributed in the society, the conflicts occur between different groups of people, some of them demanding for social changes and equality, while others resist, as they do not want to lose the power and capital. Marx’s conflict theory focuses on the reasons for the occurrence of social conflicts and their consequences (Crossman). In this theory, there are two opposing parties, namely, bourgeois (or the upper class consisting of capitalists) and the proletariat (or the working class consisting of poor people).\n\nThe appearance of Capitalism in Europe gave Marx the idea that this system would not last long because of the large chasm between the rich and the poor. He theorized that the feeling of social injustice would give the stimulus to the working class to demand changes and that the feeling of reluctance to share power in the upper class would force them to resist (Carter 113). Thus, in Marx’s opinion, Capitalism causes the alienation of the masses and the constantly growing indignation of the proletariat for being exploited by the bourgeois.\n\nIn terms of Marx’s philosophy, he created the so-called dialectical materialism based on Hegel’s dialectics, which is dialectical idealism. Marx thought that the main focus of dialectics should not be placed on the ideal world but the material world. Marx’s dialectical materialism maintains the material aspect of the ever-changing reality of economic activity and production. His theory became the philosophical basis of Communism.\n\nThus, according to Marx, Capitalism will eventually cause a revolution, which will result in either suppression of the proletariat by the bourgeois or its victory. In the first scenario, the revolution will inevitably repeat until the bourgeois is defeated (Carter 154). In the second scenario, the social system will change, and Capitalism will be ousted by Communism, where everybody will take according to their needs and give according to their abilities.\n\nThe Relevance of Marx’s Ideas on Contemporary Capitalist Societies\n\nDespite the changes that have occurred in capitalist societies since Marx’s times, his theory is still relevant today. The reason for this is that in most countries, there is still a big chasm between the rich and the poor. Although in developed countries, people have managed to find a compromise, there are still people who are unhappy with the situation they are in.\n\nAs for Communism, certainly, after such major failures with its implementation in the 20 th century, which caused many wars and resulted in many human casualties, people either despise it or are skeptical about its successful realization (Sunkara). However, certain countries have managed to adopt Socialism, the milder version of Communism, and are now thriving.\n\nThe notion of “Social Exploitation”\n\nThe notion of “social exploitation” is one of the central concepts in the conflict theory in sociology. The reason for this is that it is, in fact, one of the main causes of the conflict between the proletariat and bourgeois. Marx thought that social exploitation is inevitable in the capitalist society; therefore, the conflict between the rich and the poor is also unavoidable (Carter 46). Thus, the main focus of Marx’s sociology is to find a solution to this conflict in the form of Communism where everybody will be happy.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCarter, Bob.

      "Telehealth: New Methodologies Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Research Evidence of the Effectiveness of Telehealth\n 2. Challenges Faced\n 3. Telehealth as an Alternative to Face-to-Face Practice\n 4. References\n\nResearch Evidence of the Effectiveness of Telehealth\n\nThe practices of telehealth refer to the provision of healthcare services on a distance (Schlachta-Fairchild, Elfrink, & Deickman, 2008). This term can be used along with or replaced by such terms as telenursing and telemedicine. In that way, searching for the relevant research and evidence concerning the practice of telehealth must include all of these variations of the name. The body of research exploring the effectiveness of telehealth practices is substantial and concerns many different fields such as mental health, pediatrics, maternal care, chronic diseases, and long-term care, among others (CADTH, 2016).\n\nThe American Telemedicine Association (ATA) specializes in the collection of data and research as to the effectiveness of practices in this sphere. Currently, the ATA has a sufficient body of information that confirms the cost-effectiveness of telehealth for both the care providers and the patients (American Telemedicine Association, 2015). Namely, the researchers find that the telehealth models can adequately support the primary care practices and reduce the pharmacy and medical costs of the treatments, reduce the number of admissions to the hospital; in addition, telemedicine was reported to improve the patient experiences and overall treatment outcomes (American Telemedicine Association, 2015).\n\nIn particular, the study by Salisbury et al. (2016) demonstrated the effectiveness of telemedicine in depression and anxiety treatments and showed a higher response rate to this type of treatment. However, the research by Dixon (2016) that also involved the depression patients showed that the cost-effectiveness of the telemedicine approach was low due to the consumption of the practitioners’ time and the comparatively low gain in QALY. The evidence collected by NHS (n. d.) presented the results of home telemonitoring of the patients with diabetes, COPD, and heart failure and showed that in all three conditions, telemedicine helped reduce mortality and hospitalization rates significantly.\n\nAs a result, a conclusion may be made that telemedicine is a somewhat practical approach when applied to mental health conditions, chronic diseases, and long-term health problems. The primary positive effects for public health were the reduction of the mortality rates and hospitalization cases, thus reducing the hospitals’ costs. However, the time and effort spent on the provision of distance care are some significant factors that reduce the cost-effectiveness of the telehealth models.\n\nChallenges Faced\n\nEven though telemedicine is widely recognized as an effective, innovative approach that can strengthen primary and preventive care, it has a number of disadvantages. Practicing telemedicine, medical professionals are likely to face versatile challenges. For example, my experience of the telemedicine model was complicated by the fact that it targeted mainly the elderly population and required the use of the Internet (emails) and telephone connection. The problem was that almost none of the patients had regular access to the Internet or knew how to use the computers. Telephone communication was complicated by the fact that many patients had hearing and memory issues, and the likelihood was high that the patients would either misunderstand, misinterpret, or forget the information provided over the phone.\n\nMy personal impression was that telemedicine approaches that target the patients of age are far more effective when they include the caregivers (family members of close people), and the instructions are provided to the latter as well as the patients in order to ensure appropriate supervision. The report by O’Connell (2015) supported this point of view and provided evidence that the supervision was critical in the telehealth models based on self-assessment, daily questionnaires, and home testing.\n\nIn addition, there are many ethical questions that apply to the use of telemedicine when the monitoring and supervision are provided by the people who are not licensed medical professionals; some of these issues involve the acquisition of confined agreement to undergo procedures, and the appropriateness of the inclusion of untrained people in such activities as collecting and handling the medical test results (O’Connell, 2015). In other words, telemedicine may save costs to healthcare institutions, but it is also likely to cause a decrease in morality.\n\nAnother personal observation to add to this report concerns the importance of the stable connection between the medical personnel and the patients. Its meaning has been established and confirmed as a factor that improves patient experience, treatment response, and trust between the patient and the medical professionals. Telemedicine attempts to limit the in-person contact of the two parties and is likely to lead to the loss of trust and alienation of the patients (Hjelm, 2005).\n\nTelehealth as an Alternative to Face-to-Face Practice\n\nBy nature, medicine, first and foremost, relies on the results of testing and assessments. As specified by Singh (2016), in some areas of health care, the results collected by telehealth methods can be equal in terms of their precision to the ones collected during a face-to-face assessment. However, many of the assessments cannot be conducted by the patients autonomously or by their caregivers.\n\nIn particular, such tests involve the use of complex equipment that requires that a professional or a specifically treated person operates it. In this aspect, face-to-face care is more beneficial. Besides, even though such methods of data collection as questionnaires that can be equally misleading when a patient does not disclose full information, during an in-person assessment, the medical professional can rely on their individual perception of the patient’s behavior and body language and detect whether or not the truth is being told. In this aspect, the advantage is also on the side of face-to-face medicine.\n\nHowever, the studies show that telemedicine can be effective in the form of primary care, prevention strategies, and follow-up treatments (Gulla, 2013). This form of care allows the medical professionals to monitor a larger number of patients and provide a deeper and more thorough level of care the stretches out beyond the clinical settings.\n\nTo conclude, the results of efficiency and cost-effectiveness of telehealth differ depending on the area where it is applied and the type of care that is provided on distance. Basically, the results are controversial because, in different fields, the practices show different results. More research is required in order to find out which areas are more and less compatible with this form of care.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Telemedicine Association. (2015).

      "Cooperation and Communication in Hotel Departments Case Study\n\nThe following case demonstrates the unique importance of the improved cooperation between different hotel departments and outlines problems that might appear in case the staff lacks mutual understanding and makes some crucial errors.\n\nMr. Smith from Florida is going to visit New York on his business and books a room in a hotel. Considering the fact that at the period of time when he visits the city a great income of tourists and other people is expected, Mr. Smith decides to book the room in advance and points out that he will stay in a hotel for ten days. A specialist responsible for online bookings receives the order reserves a room for one person. A worker also wants to specify if there are any additional demands. Mr. Smith states that hypoallergenic linen should be used as he is allergic to the traditional one. Moreover, he insists that the breakfast served for him should consist of non-fried and mild dishes as he suffers from gastritis. At the same time, Mr. Smith from Kentucky also books a room via the telephone. He wants a luxury apartment for five persons as the whole family will arrive to New York. He will spend 3 nights there. There are no specific demands to menu, linen, or other aspects. His order is also reserved.\n\nIn two weeks Mr. Smith from Florida comes to the hotel and wants his room. Receptionist shows him a hotel suite. Surprisingly, Mr. Smith admits that it is not a single room but a luxury apartment. Trying to elucidate the situation he comes to reception; however, a hotel clerk is sure that everything is fine as there is a booking for Mr. Smith. At the same time, the family from Kentucky arrives. It is obvious that a room for single person is too small for them and they are more than dissatisfied with the service. An arrived manager starts the investigation of the case and discovers several poor mistakes that come from the lack of the understanding between the departments and result in the great displeasure. First of all, the front-office department confused customers names and the main demands to hotel suits. Additionally, they provided the wrong information to accounting, kitchen, and housekeeping departments. As a result, beds in a luxury apartment are made with hypoallergenic linen. Moreover, a special menu is also suggested to the visitors of this very room. Moreover, considering the fact that the orders are confused, a room for one person is provided for the Smith family for three nights and then new guests are expected; when the luxury apartment is reserved for ten days. It is obvious that a great problem appears. Even in case the numbers will be changed, Mr. Smith will have no place to live as in three days a new person will arrive. Therefore, one should also realize the fact that prices for these rooms are different which means that the accounting department also makes a mistake and confuses the names and fees.\n\nIn consequence of these misunderstandings, the hotels image is damaged. Its customers are not satisfied with the suggested services and would hardly recommend it to their friends.\n\nWhat are possible solutions to this very problem?\n\nWhat could you recommend to improve the understanding between different departments to avoid the situation of this sort in future and preserve the image of the hotel?\n",
      "Communication Skills in Pharmacists Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Analysis\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is a great number of professional fields where specialists are supposed to work with other people and provide them with support. Working with people, it is extremely important to be able to take into consideration specificities related to the field and other things that may be important for particular clients. Speaking about communication skills, it is necessary to pay increased attention to the profession of pharmacist. In order to work with their clients in an effective way, they have to possess a wide range of personal qualities and communication skills. It is common knowledge that the ability to provide the clients with the help is regarded as their primary task. Nevertheless, pharmacists may also need to consult the client’s relatives or cooperate with other healthcare specialists. Considering specific situations that occur during the work, there is a great number of communication skills that may be required.\n\nAnalysis\n\nTo begin with, there are many opinions on certain communication skills that may be regarded as the most important for those who work as pharmacists. Reflecting on the role of good communication skills for pharmacists, many authors agree that it cannot be overestimated. There is no doubt that proper communication helps to improve the state of health of clients and provide them with moral support. Speaking about the particular communication skills that are essential for the specialist, it is important to remember about the pharmacist’s ability to concentrate on the specific needs of the client. 1(p 14)\n\nIn this case, the clients should believe that they are the center of attention. To continue, another skill that has to be paid attention to is the specialist’s ability to motivate the client to comply with the instructions provided by other health specialists. This goal may be achieved with the help of different means. For example, a pharmacist may attract the attention of the customer to the consequences of drug abuse and misuse. At the same time, the specialist should make the statement using proper words and intonation patterns. The word choice and the use of intonation are important because any skilled specialist related to healthcare and medicine should sound polite during the conversation with people who need help. Considering the importance of words and their meanings that may sometimes be understood unclearly, it is necessary for any pharmacist to be proficient in the official language of the country where he or she works. Speaking skills are extremely significant because effective oral communication is the tool that may help the pharmacist to obtain necessary information concerning the client’s needs, attitudes, and specific problems.\n\nThere is no doubt that verbal communication is very important for those specialists related to the sphere of pharmacy. Moreover, it is necessary to remember that any pharmacist has to communicate with people who belong to other cultures. There is a great difference between certain nations; due to that, it is also important for the pharmacist to be able to address the challenges related to possible misunderstanding. Working with clients who belong to racial and ethnic minorities of the country, the pharmacist has to pay attention to specific problems faced by the group and show a willingness to help the client to address the challenge. There are many cases when it is extremely difficult for clients belonging to specific groups to explain what they need. In this case, the pharmacist has to be very good at listening and responding because communication with a foreigner is impossible without being extremely attentive. 2(p 127)\n\nBesides listening and speaking skills, all the specialists in the field who would like to be able to work with clients in an effective way have to pay attention to non-verbal communication. This type of communication is important because it allows the specialist to impress clients favorably. Although conducting consultations related to different drugs and proper medicamentous therapy is the primary task of any pharmacist, it is also important to pay attention to emotional reactions demonstrated by clients. Due to the ability to work with non-verbal signs, pharmacists may show that they respect the clients and are ready to do their best to help them.\n\nTherefore, it may be stated that the ability to see and interpret non-verbal signs used by the client or other healthcare specialists is an important skill for pharmacists. 3(p 756) The issue is even more important if we talk about the situation when it is difficult for specialists and clients to understand each other due to the linguistic barrier that exists between them. In general, non-verbal communication skills are important for pharmacist because the proper use of facial expressions, gestures, hand signs, and body postures allow the specialist to encourage the clients to speak about any problems and concerns that they have. As for the ability to interpret clients’ signs, it may help to notice their discontent and provide them with better solutions.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn the end, there are a lot of communication skills that are essential for pharmacists. They include verbal communication skills such as the ability to listen to the client carefully and put ideas into words. Moreover, it is also necessary for pharmacists to be able to understand and use a wide range of non-verbal signs. Possessing the skills mentioned, these specialists can fulfill their tasks properly and be able to get across to any client.\n\nReferences\n\nKerr A, Strawbridge J, Kelleher C, et al.

      "David Brooks and Scott Adams’ Views on Education Essay\n\nLife before, during, and after college is often confusing for students and would-be citizens because it is subject to misleading information. Prior to joining college, most students are led to believe that college is the missing link between them and successful life. Therefore, most students end up persevering college life in the hope that when it is all over, they will be paid back in kind. These two articles are written by individuals who have realized that they were probably misled when they were in college.\n\nConsequently, they are offering their opinions on the reality that college students should expect after they graduate. One article is titled “It’s Not About You” by David Brooks and it advises students that their goals in life should not be ideally centered on themselves. On the other hand, Scott Adams’ article “How to Get a Real Education at College” claims that average students are being taught the wrong things in life. While Adams’ essay points out inconsistencies in the learning process and Brooks’ article is centered on the fallacies of post-college career advice, both pieces represent the lack of faith in the modern college education and the politics that surround this phenomenon.\n\nThe two essays address the misinformation that accompanies college education. On his part, Brooks addresses the common rhetoric that students are fed when they graduate from college. According to him, most commencement ceremonies “many graduates are told to; follow your passion, chart your own course, march to the beat of your own drummer, follow your dreams and find yourself” (Brooks 1). However, there is a possibility that this advice no longer applies to the dynamics of modern society whereby exploring oneself is more important than conquering the world.\n\nOn his part, Adams says that it would be more fruitful to teach B students other relevant skills such as entrepreneurship. His main argument is that it is unfair to group all college students in one category and then proceed to teach them in a similar manner. This approach offers an immense advantage to the bright kids while disregarding the actual skills of the rest of the students. Although the views of the two authors are not identical, they both touch on the burdens that a modern student is expected to shoulder due to a lack of accurate advice.\n\nThe author of “It’s Not About You” highlights how parents and other mentors push students to “find their passion and pursue their dreams” (Brooks 1). Brooks finds an issue with this hypothesis because he claims that there is no plan involved in this method and all success is left to chance. According to him, people should form a ‘self’ first, and then proceed to lead their lives.\n\nThis sentiment bears similarities to Adams’ call for students to be taught actual skills. Some of the skills that Adams proposes to resonate with Brooks’ claims on finding oneself. For instance, Adams proposes that students should learn how to fail, combine their skills, conquer fear, and attract luck (Adams 1). Not all the above skills are commensurate with an education curriculum, but they involve a great deal of self-discovery.\n\nThe two authors punch holes into the current system of transitioning learners from school to the actual world. However, the approach that is utilized by the two articles is different. One author suggests that self-discovery is quite important, while the other suggests that individuals can be pushed to discover themselves.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAdams, Scott. “How to Get a Real Education.” The Wall Street Journal, 2011.\n\nBrooks, David. “It’s not About You.” The New York Times , 2011.\n",
      "Preventing Terrorism: Strategies and Challenges Essay\n\nTerrorism is one of the major global concerns of modern society. The government of the United States is putting significant efforts to developing an efficient system of preventive measures against terrorist attacks. The purpose of such measures is to stop the destructive incidents that harm the citizens, property, and the entire quality of life of the nation (Bjorgo, 2013). The counter-terrorist programs are aimed at stopping the attacks from happening and prevent individuals from following the extremist groups. The authorities are working on increasing the national protection concerning the terrorism. In case if the attacks are impossible to avoid, the government is to make sure that the influence of such attacks is minimized. For an extended period, America used to address terrorism with “military forces and suppression” (Bjorgo, 2013, p. 3). However, lately, the officials give preference to the strategies that will ensure the longer safety. Such strategies include the thorough investigation of the enemy, known as intelligence.\n\nThe Intelligence in the United States is considered the best in the world. American intelligence organizations use a broad range of methods and progressive technologies to seek and study data from around the world. They incorporate various satellites, air forces, vessels and internet technologies. Annually the government spends a significant amount of financial resources to budget such institutions. Currently, there are seventeen organizations involved into intelligence cycle in the United States. Their work is related to the national intelligence, defence intelligence, military service intelligence, and civil department intelligence (Richelson, 2015, p. 12).\n\nNumerous executives in the US administration need intelligence to accomplish their duties. The process of policymaking requires a profound research of data not only within the country but analyzing the situation in the world. Richelson (2015) defines intelligence as a product of gathering, processing, integration, evaluation and interpretation of data regarding the global conditions and possible threats to the society (p. 11). National security is a sector that requires the proper intelligence the most.\n\nExamining data regarding the activities and objectives of different terrorist groups is a primary concern of intelligence organizations in America. The undertakings of such organizations include collecting information from media, people, different reports, and statistics. The workers monitor domestic and foreign newspapers, radio and television. The foreign nationals could also be engaged in the process by secretly providing the information. The military forces often get information through interrogations of those suspected in connection with terrorists. The terrorist activity is being monitored geographically by using electronic and radio devices to build maps and mark the locations.\n\nThe researchers define two types of intelligence: the raw and the finished one.\n\nThe “raw intelligence” contains the complex information taken from various sources, while the “finished intelligence” present a report with accurate facts (Richelson, 2015, p. 12). The intelligence gives the opportunity to predict the probable outcome of various global political processes and intentions of terrorist individuals. The intelligence cycle provides a forecast and guidance for the authorities regarding the preparation and implementation of policies.\n\nThe unpredictable nature of terrorism makes it extremely difficult to control it. The enemy is constantly invisible and tends to act without warning or clear purpose. Intelligence is a powerful tool to develop a forecast of the probable actions of the enemy. Since terrorist attacks is an issue of a global scale, the United States cannot fight it on its own. The joint effort of all nations is vital to address the problem. However, in the experience of cooperation, the Europe was not willing to share some secret information valuable for counterterrorism. The legislation of the European countries differs from the American one and has strict principles regarding personal information privacy (McGill, & Gray, 2012). To develop the most efficient framework of fighting and preventing terrorism the world nations must collaborate with each other.\n\nThe history has numerous evidence showing the importance of a proper intelligence and the results of the lack of it. The tragedy on September 11, was a failure of American intelligence organizations. The researchers could have foreseen the annexation of Crimea by the Russians and the nuclear weapon appearance in Syria. The data collected by the workers of intelligence organizations present the rough ideas of the political, economic and social conditions in the world and suggest the number of measures to be taken in order to influence these conditions. The possibility of a favorable impact on the events gives a chance to maintain stability within the country and prevent the negative events in the world.\n\nReferences\n\nBjorgo, T. (2013).

      "Cyber Law Policy and Standards Report (Assessment)\n\nQuestion 1: What is the difference between policy and standards?\n\nThe primary difference between policy and standard is the different intentions about particular actions while referring to steps to be taken. In this case, the initial goal of the policy is to determine the existence of a certain issue and its coverage (Eastton & Taylor, 2011). It assures the compliance of the individuals with the established legal system. Meanwhile, the standards in their nature are related to the particular level of quality while introducing the control measures (Eastton & Taylor, 2011).\n\nQuestion 2: Why are guidelines and recommendations optional while policies and standards are mandatory?\n\nIt could be said that the guidelines and recommendations have an optional nature, as they have a tendency to propose one of the ways of the actions, which the organization or an individual could follow in a particular situation (Whitman & Mattord, 2011). Meanwhile, the policies and standards could be considered of a higher power, as they identify the issue and determine the necessity to comply with the law regarding the particular issues.\n\nQuestion 3: Why are policies developed at a high level in the organization?\n\nIt remains apparent that policies are developed at a high level of organization for several reasons. One of them is the fact that the management is able to understand the necessity of the policy introduction by comparing it with the company’s needs, vision, values, and mission (Bolles & Hubbard, 2007). Meanwhile, a high level of organization has significant authority and power for the development and establishment of new policies.\n\nQuestion 4: Why is consistent enforcement critical for cyber policies, standards, and procedures?\n\nIn turn, the continuous enforcement of the policies, standards, and procedures is critical to the context of cyber law. This sphere is relatively novel, and its current standards do not cover all of the issues and questions (Kubota, 2007). Meanwhile, technology tends to develop on a regular basis, and this matter determines the necessity to establish new policies and redesign old ones on a regular basis (Kubota, 2007).\n\nQuestion 5: What is business continuity management?\n\nBusiness continuity management is a business strategy, which implies the continuous assessment of risks while evaluating the organizational responses to these threats (Hiles, 2010). Meanwhile, it aims at the development of stability of the firm and its resilience to ensure the relevant return of investment for the stakeholders.\n\nQuestion 6: What is the impact of incomplete or missing information on a security policy?\n\nIt could be said the lack of information in the security policy has an adverse impact on the functioning of the organization and its safety. In this case, this matter determines that the absence of coverage of the precise issues might be a cause of the wrongful decision-making and misunderstanding of the presence of the particular actions leading to theft and data leakage (Whitman & Mattord, 2011).\n\nQuestion 7: What is management’s role in cyber policy development and enforcement?\n\nMeanwhile, it remains apparent that the management’s role cannot be underestimated in the development of the cyber policies, as this entity has a key influence on the standards, procedure, or policy introduction (Bolles & Hubbard, 2007). It could be said that management defines the flow of the processes and identifies the existence of the issue, which has to be addressed to improve the company’s functioning and profitability. In turn, it has a superior power to influence the decision-making process and enforcement of the policies.\n\nQuestion 8: How is risk management improved, and residual risk decreased through sound cyber policies?\n\nIt could be said that the introduction of the cyber policies has a positive influence on the risk management, as it is related to the continuity management and minimizes the risks associated with the theft and leakage of the confidential information. Nonetheless, the residual risks tend to increase since the probability of the data theft continues to rise due to the constant development of technology and gaps in the information security.\n\nReferences\n\nBolles, D., & Hubbard, D.

      "China’s Superpower and the United Nations’ Concerns Essay\n\nThe UN must recognize that China has emerged as a major power in the world. Thus, the UN must understand the role China will have in the world if it emerges as a superpower. Specifically, China’s approaches to security, communist ideologies, currency, weapons, and influences on the world economy should be major concerns to the UN. The most critical matter for China today is human rights and political instability. The government does not tolerate any form of opposition, and it considers such attempts as interference with internal affairs and dissidence. China views the world with suspicion. On the other hand, the world has divided opinions about China. Sanaa Arora notes that superpower traditionally reflects “military, economic, political and cultural strengths and dominance” (Arora 1).\n\nThe economic reforms of the 1970s in China resulted in a prosperous nation. China’s Gross Domestic Product has grown steadily. China has enhanced its trading abilities with the West and Africa. Moreover, the country has accumulated large foreign currency reserves in the world and has embarked on foreign investments. The economic performance of China has been superb.\n\nChina can maintain such high rates of growth because of a large population, which provides cheap labor and a ready market. It also has vast resources. China has strived to overtake the US as the world’s largest economy, but not just yet. Analysts put it so close (Arora 1).\n\nChina started to upgrade its military in the 1980s. Today, it has increased the pace of its military upgrade (International Institute for Strategic Studies 152-5). Although China faces no major threat in the region, China has continued to prepare its military in readiness for potential wars. Past experiences like Tiananmen Square Massacre affected China’s relationship with the West. The country also analyzed the impacts of the Gulf War and its position. Consequently, China had to formulate a new defense approach for engaging in current combats, which could involve technology.\n\nFrom past wars, China has turned to build electronic warfare, unethical cyber theft practices, and the development of advanced weapons. It has also embarked on modernizing its air force and naval capabilities with rapid response approaches. Moreover, China has enhanced its military logistical supports.\n\nThe country’s upgrade of its military drew different reactions from the world. Others claim that modernization was inevitable because China had old equipment. On the other hand, other critics have raised concerns about China’s assertive approaches to territorial disputes and military modernization. The country has also turned to nuclear programs. Such missiles can even reach North America. Also, China wants to control space and cyberspace. These strategies show the country’s desire to dominate the world.\n\nThe UN must worry about China as a superpower. It has a growing economic strength alongside a large-scale upgrade of the military. Thus, the UN must understand how China will use its power if it becomes a superpower. So far, China has used its new power to assert itself aggressively in the territorial disputes with Japan, Taiwan, Vietnam, and other neighbors. Such aggressive tendencies have created tension in the region and friction with US relations. These claims show that China may resort to the use of force to control the islands. Thus, the security of neighboring countries with China as a superpower must worry about the UN.\n\nThe development in China as a possible superpower will only raise security concerns in the world. China’s growing power has poised it as a security threat to the region. In the past, China had engaged all its neighbors in some forms of disputes. Thus, it feels insecure as the region seeks strategic responses from the West. These diplomatic tensions can severely hurt China as a superpower. The country has limited chances of strengthening its position as a world leader. Many Asian countries have favored the role of the US in the region.\n\nOn the other hand, China only has rogue states as real allies. These include Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Cuba, among others. These are countries under political dictatorship and manipulation of powers to favor incumbents. These are political pariahs of the world. These relationships are quite artificial because they rely on China’s quest for natural resources in exchange for backing at the UN against sanctions.\n\nWhile one may argue that geography does not favor China’s security situations as a potential superpower, its dictatorship regime has thwarted emerging democratic candidates, which has contributed to its human rights abuse. Democratic and influential states cannot ally with a dictator. Therefore, it is difficult for China to form any meaningful security alliance with democratic states. China has failed to find a real strategic alliance with its partners because the country does not share security interests and ideological values with others because of the secrecy of the regime. Thus, there is no trust between China and its partners. As a result, China has resorted to ‘transactional diplomacy.’ Minxin Pei refers to this as “ romping around the world with a fat checkbook, supporting (usually poor, isolated, and decrepit) regimes like Angola and Sudan in return for favorable terms on natural resources or voting against Western-sponsored resolutions criticizing China’s human rights record ” (Pei 1). Thus, the rising superpower will have to address its communist ideologies, territorial disputes, and policies before qualifying as a superpower.\n\nThe UN must also express its concern over political stability and human rights issues in China. The Communist party has asserted its control over a billion people forcefully. The major agenda of the party is to retain power. According to China, issues of creating a democratic system and tolerating dissidence are strategies to impede its domestic affairs. Thus, if China becomes a superpower, then the UN will face serious challenges on how to handle it.\n\nThe public opinion regarding the role of China as a superpower may be split. The UN must find a way of dealing with rising China. A lack of secrecy approach to China’s situation could lead to a transparent superpower, a secure democracy, and a diplomatic state. Therefore, the UN must not tolerate or concede to China’s demands. Instead, the UN requires firm policies, and it must not engage in China’s games of distrust and suspicion. Ideally, a superpower must be a stable democracy, which can enjoy global supports. However, the secrecy of China and its present problems do not guarantee any promising position if the country becomes a superpower.\n\nAs the UN prepares for a possibility of China becoming a superpower, it must not underestimate security challenges, which China will pose to the Asian region and the West. Consequently, the UN requires a feasible security mechanism to control China and its rogue allies.\n\nThe economic transformation, the dollar and Yuan peg, trade imbalance, modernization of the military, and ‘transactional diplomacy’ of China have targeted the current superpower, the US. China strives to counter the current power balance. The UN must recognize that China has displayed open dictatorship in approaches to matters related to territorial claims and human rights abuse. China may face challenges of providing food to its large population. However, if the current rates of economic growth and military spending continue, then China may rise as a superpower and use its position to spread security threats, communism and control global trades with its Yuan as the global currency. Moreover, China aims to dominate technologies and the global economy. This implies that the country intends to create a foundation, which is stronger than that of the US.\n\nThe UN must ensure that China resolves security issues in the region. First, China must resolve all territorial issues with all its neighbors. Second, it must support a collective security approach and abandon the secrecy of the regime. Third, China must eliminate mistrust and fears among its neighbors. Also, China must enhance its relationship with the US. The country must also seek for real allies based on sound policies and principles rather than the current artificial approach of transactional diplomacy. Finally, China must embrace democracy in its political system. This would ensure support from the US and other democratic states. However, the UN must also remember that China’s interests are to protect its security and interests around the world, which happens as the country ignore other regions and the West (Britt 1). Certainly, with these tendencies and challenges, China may not promote the world order (Dellios 1).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nArora, Sanaa. China – The Next Superpower? 2011. Web.\n\nBritt, Robert Roy.

      "Tesla Corporate Social Responsibility: Issues, Activities, and Strategy | Essay Example\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Brief Overview of Tesla Company\n 2. Tesla CSR Initiatives\n 3. CSR Activities of Tesla\n 4. Tesla CSR Issues and Strategy\n 5. References\n\nTesla is an American company that deals with the manufacturing and sale of electric vehicles. It also manufactures and sells rechargeable batteries. The company has a Corporate Social Responsibility that is active. Although the company’s CSR has few shortcomings, the management has worked on a credible and sound policy.\n\nBrief Overview of Tesla Company\n\nTesla Motors, Inc is an automotive and energy storage company in the United States of America. The company started operations in the year 2003. The founders, Martin Eberhard and Marc Tarpenning, financed the company before they could find other financiers. Elon Musk joined the company and became one of the leading investors in the enterprise (Fialka, 2015). The company makes designs, manufactures, and sells electric cars.\n\nIt is also responsible for electric vehicle powertrain components and battery products. It is a public company and has listed on the NASDAQ stock exchange as TSLA (Fialka, 2015). The listing enabled the company to find more capital for the expansion of its services. The Tesla Roadster electric sports car was the first major production that brought the company to the limelight. It was the first of its kind among electric vehicles because it was fully electric (Pohl & Tolhurst, 2010).\n\nTesla Company.\n\nIt helped the company to speed up with the development of its second car. The Model S. It was a luxury sedan. It continued with a series of new launches like the Model X and the Model 3. Its Model S won several awards and accolades as the best electric and most selling car by the year 2015 (Pohl & Tolhurst, 2010). Other products are the home and office battery charging equipment. Its cars use electric batteries that need charging as compared to other gasoline-fuelled cars.\n\nAs a result, Tesla has installed quite some high powered Superchargers (Visser, 2011). It has also partnered with several shops and restaurants to serve its customers with fast chargers. The company’s CEO foresees a situation where the company would become an independent automaker with affordable pricing for its models. The anticipation is that by the year 2017, they would launch the newer version of Tesla Model 3 with great features at an affordable consumer price (Visser, 2011).\n\nTesla CSR Initiatives\n\nThe models that Tesla manufactures are already environmentally friendly. They do not emit gas in the air. They also do not pollute sound. It was one of the main goals that led to the founding of the company. It would build motor vehicles that are zero pollution to the environment. Tesla did the unthinkable thing by publicizing its patents for environmental purposes. Thus, it became the best company to use as an example of what is possible in environmental concerns.\n\nCSR Activities of Tesla\n\nWhen it comes to technology, Tesla has invested heavily in Research and Development. Many companies rely on Tesla’s innovations to complete their manufacturing concerns. For instance, Mercedes-Benz uses Tesla’s powertrain, while Toyota uses its motor (Fialka, 2015). Other companies like General Motors are eager to know another new thing that Tesla would come up within the market (Fialka, 2015).\n\nTesla has been known to be in the right place at the right time. When the company came into being, there were other car companies. But it established its niche and had become the best company for electric devices. It won the Obama Administration’s cleantech initiative in 2010 and got the government’s $465 Million subsidies in the form of a loan (Pohl & Tolhurst, 2010). It has since repaid the loan and cleared it.\n\nTesla has also managed to overtake companies like Ford, which had also started to produce electric cars. Although the Roadster could not compare to Ford’s F-150, it enabled Tesla to establish in the market. It has since expanded this dream by launching Model S. Its third invention would-be Model 3, which would now be affordable for many people.\n\nBelow is the CSR rating of the company since the year 2014 in comparison with other companies;\n\nThe company has also grown because of teamwork. The company’s CEO Musk has built a team in the enterprise that is eloquent at its work. The company’s staff know their limits. They have demanding tasks. With the encouragement from the CEO and the board, they work to better the business’s vision and build their careers (Pohl & Tolhurst, 2010).\n\nTesla has a good network of channels. It has managed to own all its distribution channels to control its flow of business (Fialka, 2015). The desire to be in charge and make the sales move has enabled these channels to become profitable. The company has moved from years of loss-making to profitability. With the development of the Gigafactory, the company would be selling fleets of cars. It would significantly improve its ratings.\n\nThe company also faced a financial crunch in its early years. It has since become profitable after getting more finance to support the business. However, the company has won the consumers’ trust. It has been through a long journey of struggle and increased pressure. Some of its cars were involved in grisly accidents. It dented the image of the company. However, most of the accidents resulted from careless driving. The cars are durable and efficient. Even the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has given the products a clean bill of health (Simpson & Taylor, 2013).\n\nTesla Motors Financial Performance (Simpson & Taylor, 2013).\n\nTesla CSR Issues and Strategy\n\nMany companies keep their patents private would sue for any infringement. Not so for Elon Musk and Tesla. The CEO thinks it is important for everyone to consider keeping the environment safe for future generations (Aras & Crowther, 2009). Apart from just making a profit, the CEO and chairperson of Tesla believes that the company would not solve all the world problems alone.\n\nTherefore, the company planned the release of its valuable patents. It would be great that every major company uses or develops what Tesla has done to promote a clean environment. The CEO wants other competitors to assist in the reduction of the emission of greenhouse gasses coming from gasoline-powered cars (Okpara & Idowu, 2013). The company believes that the process would also bring down the costs of electric vehicles so everyone can afford them. Although the shareholders were not happy at first, they saw that the reasons were valid. Tesla’s stock price per share increased by about $ 30, and it showed that he made the right decision (Aras & Crowther, 2009).\n\nPatents sometimes hinder progress. They only enrich the legal fraternity and build dominance for a few corporations in the market. It was the best decision that enabled the company to improve its CSR. It has pushed for the auto industry to think long term by investing in the battery-powered vehicles. CSR is not just about compliance. A serious organization would provide leadership in CSR (Okpara & Idowu, 2013). Tesla has provided leadership in the decision is made. It would just need to work extra hard in matters of gender. Since electric cars are expensive, its work on Model 3 would make it all-inclusive.\n\nReferences\n\nAras, G. & Crowther, D. (2009). Global perspectives on corporate governance and CSR .

      "Problem-Solving in Business Plan Creation Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Problem-Solving Importance\n 2. Problem-Solving Strategies and Techniques\n 3. Problem-Solving Method\n 4. Problem-Solving Approach\n 5. Conclusion\n\nProblem-Solving Importance\n\nThe main goal of the current business report is to explain how to start up a new business and make golf available to all people. The main challenge of the chosen activity is to investigate the particular business sector and identify the problems a new businessman can face with while creating a new captivating outdoor business. It is hard to avoid the problems and challenges in the chosen activity; that is why it is necessary to gather additional and necessary information relating to the problem and prove the correctness of the choices made.\n\nProblem-Solving Strategies and Techniques\n\nOne of the first strategies that can be used to solve the problem is brainstorming. Brainstorming is a widely-known technique within the frames of which a researcher is able to make associations about the problem that takes place. For example, the current business report aims at starting up a new golf business. The main challenge is to realize what step should be taken first. Brainstorming helps to begin: the researcher surfs the web, uses, for example, the Google searching engine, and clears up how to begin reading the credible material found on the sites with “.edu” domain or other specialized sites. Brainstorming may be also based on the interviews and conversations with different people involved in the sphere of business.\n\nAnother important step is to divide the topic into meaningful sections, underline the problems, and find their solutions in a certain order. This technique is also called as “divide and overcome”. The researcher has to understand the main stages of the work and complete each of them properly. As soon as each stage is taken, the expected results can be achieved. It is not necessary to solve the main problem at once. As a rule, it is very hard and even impossible. The results of such solution may be negative indeed.\n\nAs soon as brainstorming and classification of the problems are complete, it is possible to think about research that has to be done in the chosen sphere of business. Research helps to identify the solutions using the past experiences of different people and organizations. Golf business is not new, that is why a number of scholarly articles and books can be found. It is necessary to admit that the researcher of the current project has to use not too old sources of information. As a rule, the sources of the last ten years should be used.\n\nWith the help of research technique, it is possible to understand what golf business is all about, what initial steps can be taken by a beginner, and why some ideas may be not appropriate for a particular situation. This problem-solving technique is effective as for a new researcher as well as for the researcher, who has already achieved some results in his/her work. The golf industry is full of competitions and unexpected challenges. Research is a technique that informs a businessman about the most expected and even unexpected challenges. Even if the businessman is lucky to avoid some problems, it is still important to know about them and be careful.\n\nProblem-Solving Method\n\nIn addition to the problem-solving techniques mentioned above, it is also necessary to clarify the method that should be followed during the process. Among the existing variety of helpful ideas, the PDCA method seems to be the most effective and easy to follow. PDCA stands for Plan, Do, Check, and Act. The researcher, who uses this particular problem-solving method, is able not only to choose the most appropriate techniques and ideas but also to control and monitor the challenges that can take place. This method helps the research to set a number of goals that should be achieved, implement the plan according to which all activities can be organized, evaluate the results achieved and make the improvements, and develop a project in accordance with the improvements that are necessary. If all steps are taken into consideration accordingly, the results of the work can be successful indeed.\n\nProblem-Solving Approach\n\nIn fact, the researcher is able to choose any available approach and solve the problem. In the current project, it is very important to be creative and differ from other researchers. That is why creativity should be a crucial part of any approach offered. A creative approach is a chance to amaze the reader and prove that the chosen ideas and methods are interesting and effective indeed. To start up a new business in the world where a number of ideas have been already offered is not an easy task. Creativity is the only approach that can help to succeed. Though it is possible to follow the standards and consider the examples offered by the experts, a piece of creativity is that crucial point that cannot be neglected. In other words, it is not enough to do something. It is necessary to do something unusual, interesting, and reasonable.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn general, the above-mentioned techniques, approaches, and methods can help the researcher solve problems and start working on the project in which a new captivating outdoor business can be developed to make golf available to all people.\n",
      "The Sony Watch Product’s Marketing Opportunities Report\n\nGrowth opportunities for the brand using product/market expansion grid to increase sales\n\nFor the new Sony Watch for monitoring blood pressure and sugar for diabetes in individuals, the best product/market expansion grid is diversification. When the company develops and launches a new product in a new market, it will find good opportunities that are not available in its current business. Thus, Sony Watch could be a game changer for revenue growth and profitability for the company. In this case, the company will be launching a new product in a new market of the UAE. To grow, the company will focus on conglomerate diversification strategy. It is noted that Sony Watch, which is a wearable technology for individuals with diabetes, is a vibrant product for new markets not explored before (Armstrong et al. 45).\n\nPotential new market segments\n\nAlthough the company already has existing clients, Sony Watch is meant to target new market segments to create more opportunities for growth and profitability. The wearable technology perhaps has not penetrated the market as expected. In the UAE market, Sony Watch is a product that will specifically appeal to new group of consumers who are considered to be living with diabetes. By focusing on this market segment, the company will go beyond its traditional market segments.\n\nAlthough there are smart wrist technologies for diabetics, they have not gained grounds in the UAE markets. Given the number of rising middle class in the target, individuals with chronic diabetes and other lifestyle conditions is most likely to rise. This situation presents an opportunity for the company target new markets. For instance, in the UK, the wearable device has gained attention from many diabetics who initially had problems monitoring their glucose levels and blood pressure (Kirsch 1). While these products can be found in the UAE, they are not common in the mainstream target market. In fact, only well travelled, wealthy individuals possess them.\n\nApplication of the marketing mix\n\nSony Watch is specified as consumer product. In this regard, the company will market the Watch to mass market, just as it markets and promotes smartphones, tablets and others. Thus, the company must ensure that Sony Watch meets the needs of the new target market segment in the UAE.\n\nProposed Product\n\nSony Watch will present major benefits to potential customers. The Watch is designed to measure glucose levels and change the way in which about 20 percent of the UAE diabetics manage their conditions. It is estimated that the number is most likely to rise because of growing cases of obesity and lack of physical activities (Chaudhary 1). New cases of diabetes in the UAE will present even more opportunities for Sony Watch.\n\nThe product is worn on the arm to gauge the level of glucose in the wearers’ blood via the skin after specified period. As a result, diabetics can obtain vital real time information about their glucose levels and adopt best practices to keep the levels management or stable. Patients will therefore be able to avoid chronic challenges that arise from elevated blood sugar using Sony Watch.\n\nSony Watch is most likely to rely on minimal electric current to draw blood sugar via the skin. Through complicated processes based on positive and negative ions, the Watch would be able to collect glucose for analysis.\n\nSony Watch will be designed for convenience as the major product specification and benefit. It has been observed that several people with diabetes often fail to test their blood sugar levels due to inconvenience and pain associated with the process. While diabetics recognised that it is imperative to gauge their levels of blood sugar based on physicians’ recommendation, they usually fail to do so because of poor management of daily activities related to sustained levels.\n\nIn fact, diabetics understand that chronic complications may result in loss of kidney, heart diseases, stroke and even blindness. By portraying Sony Watch as a simple gadget that could prevent these adverse outcomes due to lack of measurement of blood glucose levels, consumers are most likely to realise these benefits and purchase it. That is, frequent measure of blood sugar levels would ensure that patients understand their conditions and take appropriate interventions to control the levels. Thus, they can avoid long-term advance outcomes.\n\nIt is expected that Sony Watch will have a chip to store all data collected regarding blood sugar and pressure for analysis and reference. In addition, it will be possible to warn diabetics when their blood sugar levels and blood pressure are too high, too low, rising steadily or dropping faster.\n\nProposed Price\n\nMany analysts have associated diabetics with changes in lifestyles supported by increased earnings. That is, the disease affects mainly the middle class and other affluent people. In this regard, Sony Watch should be a premium product, but the company should also develop other models for mass markets.\n\nIt is expected that the pricing strategy would accounts for product costs, costs associated with shipment, distribution, advertisement and promotion among others. It is however recommended that the premium pricing strategy should be considered once the market research has been done in the UAE to determine the most suitable price for the local market.\n\nIt is also imperative to recognise that Sony Watch will not be retailed at prices that reflect that it is a luxury brand. This implies that the pricing strategy would tout the product as convenient for consumers rather than a luxurious brand for the few.\n\nPrice skimming would be the best approach for Sony Watch. Through this approach, Sony Watch will maximise the profit for the company by retailing at a premium price for early adopters. Later on, the price of the product will gradually drop to attract a large number of middle class consumers. The innovative technology and wearable device fad will drive sales among target consumers who will be willing to pay high prices for the gadget. Once the sales drop or a new competitor enters the UAE market, the company will gradually reduce the price, skimming every segment until all segments of the target market are exploited.\n\nBy adopting price skimming strategy to launch Sony Watch, the company is most likely to derive four main advantages. The company will learn about what its target market segment is ready to pay for the Watch. Sony Watch will also enjoy prestige status associated with the product classification and pricing strategy. In addition, if the company learns that the entry pricing is far beyond many target consumers, it will be willing to lower it gradually.\n\nLastly, other potential customers will be enthralled to acquire Sony Watch at relatively lower price and, therefore, the company will be able to establish goodwill in the local market. One major drawback is that Sony Watch is most likely to attract multiple competitors because of its premium pricing strategy and large profits. On this note, the company must continuously introduce advanced watch through innovation to create competitive advantage.\n\nOverall, the pricing strategy would be guided by specific factors in the UAE market, the company’s image, brand feature such as “competitive intensity, market pioneering, brand reputation, and experience effects” (Spann, Fischer and Tellis 235).\n\nProposed Place\n\nGiven the premium classification of Sony Watch, the company will adopt selective distribution strategy. Through this approach, the company will be able to select specific dealers in the UAE market to resell the Watch. It will assist the company to ensure that all selected dealers comply with the strict criteria that reflect its brand and premium classification of Sony Watch. Thus, the company’s strategies will influence resellers’ strategies.\n\nThe company will use the Internet as a means of distributing its Watch to target online shoppers. At the same time, it will encourage the channel members to share distribution activities to ensure that practices are consistent. The company must coordinate the supply chain to position the brand as premium. This strategy would create premium value to support the product classification and the intended brand image, as well as justify the premium pricing strategy for Sony Watch (Parment 250). The company should be careful to ensure anchorage in the UAE market because it is significant for encouraging resellers and creating competitive edge. When the company identifies its distribution places, which will be high-end locations in the UAE market, it will be able to design appropriate strategies for distribution.\n\nIt is imperative for the company to recognise that a premium Sony Watch may not appeal to the local UAE market because of loose relations. On this note, the company must create competitive advantage through its supply chain, which will ensure strong brand recognition, identification and appeal to consumers. According to Parment, “consumer is likely to be attracted by the image of the premium brand than by the local dealer and thus creating a consistent brand experience is decisive for premium brands whose content to a great extent is global and goes beyond the influence of local dealers and cultures” (250).\n\nThe company should adopt a pull strategy to create demands and encourage consumers to buy premium Sony Watch. The pull strategy would ensure that the company appeals to the end user of its product. In this regard, the distribution strategy must create a strong, visible brand for the successful strategy. The company will adopt various ways in its pull strategy to promote Sony Watch. First, the advertisement would involve traditional media and the Internet to promote Sony Watch. Second, the company will focus on developing customer relationships to ensure that customers will always come back and create awareness about Sony Watch to meet specific needs of diabetics. Finally, sales promotion would drive the pull strategy.\n\nThrough the pull strategy, the company will create new demands for Sony Watch. The increased demands will ensure that distributors are active to serve the target market segment. For example, the company will adopt strategies used by premium smartphone firms to launch their products. The Internet and social media would also be instrumental in enhancing the pull strategy of the company.\n\nProposed Promotion\n\nA mix of promotional elements would be used for Sony Watch. On this note, the company would only focus on the most popular promotional strategies. Sales promotion would involve the use of incentives such as gifts to encourage the customer to purchase Sony Watch. For instance, customers will get gift voucher of specific amount to purchase any other products of their choice after purchasing Sony Watch. Through sales promotion, the company would realise immediate, short effects on sales volumes. It will allow the company to clear available stock. The sales promotion methods used such as stock clearance would motivate the distribution channels and consumers to purchase Sony Watch. At the same time, they would give the company a competitive edge against competitors.\n\nThe company will also use advertisement. Both traditional and modern media will be used to communicate merits of Sony Watch, its price and retail outlets in the UAE market. Through advertisement, the company aims to advance its pull strategy and create an impact by directly targeting and appealing to the target market of Sony Watch.\n\nPersonal selling will also be used as a promotional strategy to appeal directly to people with diabetics and explain how the product can assist them to manage their conditions. The face-to-face interaction with consumers will create a strong bond between sellers and consumers (Perner 1). The company will however not use this strategy to entice consumers and create unnecessary demands among consumers. Instead, it will act as an opportunity to establish good customer relations and enhance customer experience.\n\nIn addition, to the abovementioned marketing mix, the company will also use public relations by visiting some individuals with the condition and providing free Sony Watches to create goodwill in the local market.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nArmstrong, Gary, Stewart Adam, Sara Denize and Philip Kotler.

      "Equity, Inclusion and Diversity in the Canadian Society Essay\n\nThough in the XXI century, the humankind has advanced impressively in a number of domains, the issue of intolerance still remains on agenda. Despite the fact that Canada has never been homogenous in terms of its residents’ nationality or ethnicity, as well as the fact that over the past few years, the rates of interracial marriages have increased impressively, prejudices against African American people, as well as the representatives of other nationalities, still persist. By taking a closer look at the specifics of relationships between the African American members of the Canadian society and the rest of the Canadian population, one may possibly not only define the key problem of the modern Canadian society, but also come up with a viable solution concerning the factors that predispose the existence of this prejudice.\n\nIn the process of researching the issue specified above, several objectives are to be met. To be more particular, in order to define the actors that enhance racial profiling in Canada and providing the solutions for the problem of racial discrimination among the residents of Canada, the following steps are to be undertaken:\n\n 1. Analyzing the history of African American communities in Canada;\n 2. Defining the factors that contribute to the development of negative attitudes towards African American population in Canada;\n 3. Specifying the ethnic and racial stereotypes that affect the relationships between African Americans and Canadians;\n 4. Based on the answers to the aforementioned questions, designing the strategies to address the persistent racial stereotypes;\n 5. Based on the answers to the first three questions, developing the methods of changing the attitudes of Canadians towards African American population, which means designing the methods to establish the principles of ethnic and racial tolerance.\n\nTaking a closer look at the situation, one must admit that the issue of racial profiling did not appear out of nowhere; there are, in fact, a number of factors affecting the relationships between the two ethnicities and leading to suspicions at best and enmity at worst. The lack of diversity, which Canada had been suffering up until recently, must be the key factor that predetermines the suspicions towards the representatives of Black community within the Canadian society. Indeed, judging by the historical evidence, the Canadian population became diversified only about fifty years ago ( A Case Study of Diversity in Corrections: The Black Inmate Experience in Federal Penitentiaries Final Report para. 1), which is far too small a term for the citizens to get used to the idea of living next to the representatives of other cultures. While at present, the situation does not seem drastic, some of the recent researches indicate that Black people are not quite welcome in the Canadian society (Welch 276).\n\nSpeaking of the research framework, one must mention that the qualitative research method has been chosen for analyzing the problem specified above and searching for its solution. The problem will be analyzed after gathering a large amount of relevant information, which will come from the latest researches for the most part. First, it will be required to back the research up with a theory on racial profiling; the general theory of discrimination will help to take the given step. In addition, the measures undertaken by the Canadian government to address the issue of discrimination must also be analyzed.

      "Social Values: Freedom and Justice Essay\n\nFreedom occurs when people are given an opportunity to do what they want without any interference or influence. Generally, a society enhances freedom by providing opportunities that people desire for action and enjoyment. On the other hand, justice entails a commitment to respect equality claim of each individual that leads to happiness. It is evident that freedom and justice are mutually exclusive, as “the theory of justice signifies its implications in regards to freedom as a key ingredient to happiness” (Rawls, 2009). Mills theory appeals to considerations of justice to mark off the rightful domain of individual liberty regarding individual freedom. In light of this view, the goal of extending freedom to all members of the society is integrally linked to achieving social justice (Baum, 2010). In this paper, the discussion will be on how freedom and justice are mutually exclusive when it comes to social values.\n\nIn the past, colonialists used freedom as a tool of enslaving African Americans who later gained their freedom through social justice. The use of freedom as a tool to inhibit empowerment in individuals has been found to impact justice. For many years, racial discrimination was defined as a way of living, especially in schools, restaurants and social places, which were reserved for the whites; white-collar jobs were also mainly reserved for the whites (Loewy, 2009).\n\nMany African Americans looked for manual labor where they were gardeners and maids in households all over America. Interracial marriages were highly unpopular and many who engaged in them were discriminated. However, freedom came when justice was served as Martin Luther King fought for equality on both sides, marking the end of racial discrimination, although racial discrimination is still experienced in some places today.\n\nJustice presupposes that individuals are responsible, in some sense, for their actions. It tends to reward and punish in regards to good or bad behavior, contributions and harm brought in the society. In relation to this, when a person commits a crime that affects the society, the freedom he or she holds may be removed from him or her through a jail term. This relates to lack of social values on a personal level and using their freedom negatively; in this case, justice is used to bring order in a society. Moreover, if freedom is not limited, it can lead to social crimes, thus calling for justice to work towards instilling order (Johnson & Svara, 2011).\n\nAccording to Kant’s theory of justice, positive freedom is the ability of pure reason to be practical. Kant believes that if human beings did not have negative freedom, there could be no duty to obey moral law, which requires us to subordinate our sensible impulse to the demand of duty (Rosen, 2009). An example is the constitution, which enacts different civil and political rights of a country; if broken, these laws may lead to a distortion in moral duty. The need for a constitution provides law and order, and with it comes the freedom to choose whether to follow it or not. Citizens who break the constitution are judged through the same constitution; but in order for justice to prevail, freedom must be limited within the law (Neville, 2009).\n\nThe law provides for freedom of religion and it respects all individuals regardless of their own faith. Nevertheless, the same law allows pure intentions to avoid breaking the law through one’s religion. In recent times, there have been terror threats around the world where Muslim extremists have threatened peaceful coexistence (Andrain & Smith, 2007). According to Andrain and Smith, religious freedom is not free from justice; in this case, if a person performs an atrocity against the country in regards to belief and religious freedom, the same freedom can lead to execution through the justice system.\n\nAt times, freedom and justice tend to pull from different directions; for instance, those who are working and would like to accumulate wealth would rather have freedom instead of justice. They feel they need to control everything they own rather than allowing others to enjoy their sweat through justice. However, those who are disadvantaged in one way or another would rather have justice instead of freedom, as they feel that those who are advantaged may exploit them if granted freedom. This kind of extremity or exclusivity in terms of freedom and justice tends to create social breakdown, where everyone tries to push for own selfish interests. The ideal situation would therefore be to create a compromise or balance between freedom and justice such that everyone sacrifices some freedom in order to serve justice for the well-being of the whole society.\n\nEquality before the law promotes freedom, but leads to material inequality. When the state, through its laws, intervenes to create material equality, it consequently leads to a corresponding loss of freedom. Equality in constitutional sense means that, people who are similarly situated must be treated equally unless there are justifiable reasons to the contrary (Rabe, 2009). An example of inequality is racial discrimination of African Americans who fought for equality in order to be free.\n\nDuring this time, they were treated in whichever way the whites pleased, as no law protected them. The law of equality has been regarded as a just way of ensuring citizens are treated in specific ways that promote freedom and not slavery. In this concept, freedom and justice are mutually exclusive as they work together to bring order through social values (Sanderson & Pugliese, 2012).\n\nThe balance of freedom and justice in the society provides a more enhanced look at how these values affect our lives. Existence of freedom relates more to having a just society where equal measure is achieved and a place where law and order is achieved to enhance peace. The two variables exist together to provide a worthwhile environment in relation to people’s rights and freedoms. In discussing these two variables, it is important to know how extensively freedom and justice work to improve relationship of different situations in different ways. Freedom and justice can therefore be termed as mutually exclusive in regards to situational factors that permit both sides to work together.\n\nIn conclusion, freedom and justice are mutually exclusive as they work together to bring order in the society. Freedom relates closely with justice and becomes a social norm that destroys the society if not used well. We need to respect the freedom of others by justly judging them with no favor or bias. Consequently, the position of freedom in key areas such as race, equality, and religion in relation to good judgment is to enhance social freedom. In order for society to achieve total freedom, justice must prevail as a means of providing social order (Arriaga, 2006).\n\nReferences\n\nAndrain, C., & Smith, J. (2007).

      "The Trojan War: A New History by Barry Strauss Essay (Book Review)\n\n“The Trojan War: A New History,” written by a historiographer Barry Strauss depicts an issue that had been examined and studied widely for years; moreover, more and more studies are published in history works and belletristic narrations. The author made an effort to present the story of the Trojan War in a different light by giving inventive apprehensions and authentic assertions about the subject. The intentions of Strauss are displayed at once in the title of the book: the author claims to introduce an updated view of the Trojan War to the general public. The book is written in such a manner that both people involved in Trojan War studying and primers with broad interests would find it alluring and approachable without any doubts.\n\nIn this review, we will determine the approach of Barry Strauss to the history and reasons for the Trojan War. Moreover, my point of view regarding the “The Trojan War: A New History” its strengths and weaknesses; we will try to conclude whether Strauss provides enough background information to allow us to understand the arguments of the author. Furthermore, the references to Homer and his theories about the connection between Troy and the Bronze Age will be discussed, and the accuracy of the book will be determined (Latacz 82).\n\nBarry Strauss is a specialist in the military progress of ancient times, who has a reasonable point of view on many hoary wars. He rewrites the history of the Trojan War within the frameworks of its experiences, culture, economy, and topography; nevertheless, despite the practical approach, Strauss keeps in mind the literary value of these historical documents. In this connection, the author works with various appliances that allow shedding new light on the subject of Trojan Was, such as freshly-interpreted written records of Hittite. These memorials provide proof of the significance of the Troy Empire during the Bronze Age; moreover, they concede the relations of Hittite with the Trojan nation as allies during the war (Bryce 73).\n\nThis method of research gives the author a chance to establish the influence of Hittite on the life of Trojans, including their traditions, means of war, and their presumptions, the beliefs in divine powers, and contact with their gods along with the economic value and Greek’s interest in Troy. Moreover, the author uses a translation of the Iliad written by the Pope in 1720 as a confirmation of his theories. To be precise, the original Iliad state that the main characters Hector, Odysseus, and other characters, conduct themselves in ways that were inherent in the Bronze Age (Thomas and Conant 73).\n\nThe literary work of Barry Strauss is enjoyable, entertaining and reachable, but controversial and informative at the same time. The new accession of the book, which gives an opportunity to look at the Trojan War at the new angle, is considered to be intriguing and provocative. While the traditional justification of the Trojan War submits the altercation over the magnificent Helen as a small flicker to inflame already existing conflicts on internal and foreign political grounds, Strauss claims that the essential motive of the Trojan War was entirely different (Morris and Powell 344).\n\nWhile writing “The Trojan War: A New History,” the author confided on the original Odyssey written by Homer; as a result, Strauss detected that Helen was practically the sole reason for the conflict; which is characteristically symbolic for the people living during the Bronze Age (Hughes 58). This theory was stated at the beginning of the book: “The Bronze Age was an era that preferred to put things in personal terms rather than in [political] abstractions” (Strauss 17). So, according to the author, the participants of the Trojan War preferred to resolve family and friendship questions rather than political and justice concerns, as it was described in the first chapter. The following chapters of the book depict how the war unfolded; moreover, he dedicated the whole episode to Hector, Achilles, and other main characters, showing their personality changes.\n\nWhile reading the “The Trojan War: A New History,” a question rises inevitably: can the book be considered as historical? Sometimes it is hard to tell where historical evidence end and the imagination of the author begin. In the first chapter Barry Strauss introduce Helen, the main character of the composition and the war generally, to the reader: “Helen is dressed in a flowing, woolen gown… in black, taupe, and crimson stripes… The…sleeves leave exposed the pearl skin of her lower arms….” (Strauss 13). Such accuracy casts doubt on whether Strauss pursues strictly historical purposes. Furthermore, Strauss’s view of the Trojan War history failed to confirm his arguments with more predominant historical or academic rhetoric.\n\nThe book declares that the Trojan War was revolving around personal revenge rather than an economic or political issue; this is the point that is being contended throughout the whole composition. From chapter to chapter Strauss advances to defend the interpretation that was stated in the title of the book; as a result, we have a book with dynamic, diligent, and dramatic story with a vivid description of the characters rather than a clear recital of the historical facts, dates, and events that took place during the war. Based on this, it is hard to believe the claims of the author about the historical value of the book. The traditional historical approach to renovations seems to be utterly missing from the publication.\n\nNevertheless, the author stretches to historical facts in order to find evidence in support of his theory about the intentions of the Trojan War participants. For example, Strauss makes remarks towards various archeological discoveries; the author mentions the bronze disk, each side of which was carved with calligraphy. The disk was described in detail; however, unfortunately, this is an example of the evidence that was described but not explained to the contentment of the demanding reader of the book who is willing to obtain more credible arguments towards the connection of the object and historical events.\n\nIn conclusion, I would like to assert that “The Trojan War: A New History” is a fascinating and thoroughly delightful piece of writing; nevertheless, the question that arose at the beginning of the reading stays until the end of the book. Without any doubt, Barry Straus is confident in his theories regarding the motives of the Trojan War; however, in my opinion, several of his arguments could be classified as unreliable. There is almost no proof that is able to provide a firm foundation for the applications of the author. So, my overall impression of a book is positive, as the author suggests a new theory to what has already been studied for plenty of times. Barry Strauss revealed himself as an exceptional and alluring writer; nonetheless, it would be a mistake to consider “The Trojan War: A New History,” strictly historical writing.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBryce, Trevor.

      "“The World Is Flat” by Thomas L. Friedman Essay\n\nThe concept of market competitiveness occasioned by globalization has its roots well entrenched in the historical era of the industrial revolution when the demand for market and increasing focus on the quality of products became critical. However, Friedman in his book The World Is Flat: A Brief History of the Twenty-First Century , indicates that the concept became more profound with the emergence of globalization and intensification of international trade (60). This further diversified the overall scope in regards to production and consumption of different products and services. He posits that the concept of market competitiveness has further been intensified by the onset of information technology in globalization 3.0 that also links markets.\n\nThis has made the world a global village. Also, Friedman cites that the emerging trend in globalization 3.0 is a major threat among economies of more stable nations due to the presence of the World Wide Web (79). The latter has turned the once competitive business arena into a common platform(Friedman 200). Though he appears to differ with Ghemawat, who cites that the emerging global trends provide an opportunity for gaining competitive advantage, his argument is correct (45). As it stands now, one would agree that the United States is required to carefully sail towards the emerging forces of globalization so that it may enjoy the prevailing benefits. This may not be favorable at all.\n\nEmerging technologies continue to put pressure on the United States. This nation ought to change its systems to fit the international demands for security, intelligence, and communication. Indeed, globalization has made the world flatter and has also opened new opportunities by weakening poor nations. American-dependent groups and terrorist organizations no longer see their inabilities as the ultimate area of their problems. Owing to efficiency brought about by information technology, those above may easily affect other nations. As a result, Schechner argues that the US has reasons to never feel at ease (35).\n\nThough Ghemawat does not indicate that globalization and technological development have strongly threatened the US in the past, he voices his skepticism and indicates that he would not be surprised if he woke up and got all nations shifting their focus to the east (100). The author further indicates that competitiveness cannot be realized by an organization without assimilation of the necessary change demands. Globalization 3.0 makes the 21st century a highly dynamic era which appears to set many nations free from captivity. This has indeed been a major factor which has augmented global competitiveness. According to Friedman’s view, the need for factoring in change and therefore maintaining market competitiveness for the US is critical (280). This can be addressed by re-evaluating core strategies, changing the course, and taking more reasonable steps as well as a constant assessment of the path being taken by technological advancement.\n\nFinally, the United States is rapidly losing its full control of complete dominance because she is being compelled to obey external forces in a common playing ground. Such forces include politics and politicians who are always seeking to make a political score in cases where one technology is failing to provide the necessary services to protect national citizens and resources. Since political influence is slowly shifting from local to regional and even global arena, it is no doubt that the United States will be faced with a difficult task.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFriedman, Thomas.

      "Concepts of Networking Essay\n\nThe word ‘networking’ is obtained from the word ‘network’, which, is formed by joining two English words namely; ‘net’ and ‘work’. According to Computing-Dictionary.com (2011), networking can be defined as either “the working or organization of a network or the process of interconnecting more than or two computers for exchanging information.”\n\nThe computers do not necessarily need to be in the same room; thus, networking cannot be limited by distance. In computing, networking forms the foundation of data sharing and communication between computers but the term has also received extended meanings.\n\nIn computing, networking involves application of both computer hardware and computer software. SearchNetworking.com (2011) defines networking as “the construction, design, and use of a network that include physical devices, telecommunication protocol and computer software.” The definition further extends to management of the network and establishment of operation policies concerning the network. The physical devices involved in a “computer network include cables, router, bridge, hub, and switch” (SearchNetworking.com, 2011).\n\nAs aforementioned, the word network is uniquely a juxtaposition of two English words, ‘net’ and ‘work’. Although the “two component words originate from Germanic stock, the juxtaposition was first made in English and later imitated by the Germans as ‘Netzwerk’… The Latin term ‘opus reticulatum’ literally means ‘net work’ and therefore it may have formed the prototype of the English word” (Briggs, 2004).\n\n‘Opus Reticulatum’ is a type of brickwork ordered so that the mortar lines appear like a net. According to Briggs (2004), the earliest occurrence in English is in the Geneva bible of 1560 although the spelling appears differently in subsequent editions. The word is used in different situations throughout history from reticulate structures in animals and plants, rivers and canals, railways, distribution of electrical cables and later wireless broadcasting network in 1914.\n\nToday the word networking means different things beyond just computing. The common thing about all the definitions is that all of them originate from the literal meaning of joining. Networking means, “covering an item with an openwork fabric or structure” (Thefreedictionary.com, 2011).\n\nThis implies that the covering of the item is termed networking. As noted earlier one of the latest use of the term network referred to wireless broadcasting, thus networking is used to mean broadcasting over a radio or television network and this broadcasting is mainly done without use of cables hence termed as wireless broadcasting.\n\nThe latest invention of the use of the word networking is in the business and social settings. Here the basic meaning of the term has been applied in an intransitive state to mean interaction or engagement in informal communication with others for mutual assistance or support (Thefreedictionary.com, 2011). Further, it means forming business links and contacts through informal social confluences.\n\nThis meaning has led to emergence of social networking websites like Facebook and Twitter, whose foundation is to provide a platform for connecting people. The meaning of the term networking has expanded to include communication, make contact, exchange information, mingle or meet.\n\nWhen friends locate each other on social networking sites, they term it as networking. The business community has also formed forums for sharing information and knowledge both formal and informal to improve their profitability, which is also termed as networking.\n\nTherefore, the term networking though a computing term, is applied to mean different things in different situations. The origin of the term and the literal meaning, follow the aspect of connection between several items where these items are either devices or people.\n\nReferences\n\nBriggs, K. (2004).

      "VIVA Company Lean Management Principles Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nLean management “identifies and produces the best value for stakeholders without using numerous resources” (Blank 3). A company that uses the concept will understand the meaning of customer value. The company will also improve its processes in order to increase customer value. The strategy also promotes the best practices that can reduce wastes. Although the principle emerged in the manufacturing industry, it has become applicable in other businesses practices and processes.\n\nLean management has become a powerful approach towards planning, implementing, and executing new processes. This discussion applies the Lean Management Concept (LMC) to VIVA Company. VIVA is a successful mobile telecommunication country in the Republic of Kuwait. The paper will describe how VIVA can use this concept to achieve its business goals.\n\nImplementing the “Lean Management Principles” to VIVA Company\n\nIdentifying Potential Consumers and Specifying Value\n\nThis principle encourages organizations to focus on the best practices that can support their clients. VIVA Company should ensure its services are acceptable to every consumer. The company must define the goals and expectations of its consumers. This strategy “will create a new sense of Consumer Value” (Blank 3).\n\nThe next strategy is omitting every non-value activity in the company. This practice will be useful towards reducing the wastes produced at the company. VIVA Company should “create the best value using the viewpoints of its consumers” (Blank 4). This approach will ensure every activity maximizes the expectations of different clients.\n\nMapping the Value Stream\n\nVIVA Company is currently using modern technologies in the telecommunications industry. The company’s mission is to transform the nature of mobile communication, entertainment, and human information. This mission supports the company’s Value Stream (VS).\n\nThe company should “ensure its departments and segments work harmoniously to deliver the required services to the targeted consumers” (Blank 4). Every end-to-end-practice must focus on the changing expectations of different customers. An appropriate strategy must examine the demands of every client. This practice will ensure VIVA Company delivers quality telecommunication solutions to its customers.\n\nCreating Flow through Waste Reduction\n\nMany activities in an organization do not add much value. VIVA is a successful company in a service industry. This situation explains why the managers at the company must focus on the best activities in order to reduce costs and wastes. This approach will ensure every activity at the company produces more profits.\n\nThe “decision to eliminate different wastes will ensure the company delivers appropriate services to its consumers without interruption” (Blank 5). VIVA should use this principle in order to fulfill the needs of its consumers. The strategy will eventually create a “smooth flow” that can support the company’s performance.\n\nResponding to Customer Pull\n\nThe level of competition in the mobile telecommunication industry is extremely high. The number of players in the Kuwaiti Telecommunication Industry has been on the rise. Some companies such as Gulf-sat and Zain are attracting more customers in the region. This development explains why VIVA Company must examine the changing demands of different telephone users in the country.\n\nThe company must also analyze the strengths and weakness of its services. The next step is reducing the existing gap in order to support the demands of its stakeholders (Blank 4). The approach will ensure VIVA Company delivers quality services that can address the changing demands of different customers (Blank 6). This practice will be critical towards supporting the company’s goals and objectives.\n\nPursuing Perfection\n\nEvery activity in a service company must be sustainable. Companies must use appropriate practices in order to create “flow”. The company should reorganize every process in order to achieve the best outcomes. VIVA Company must “also link its operations together” (Blank 5). This strategy will make it easier for the company to identify new wastes.\n\nThe next plan is eliminating such wastes. This process will support the demands of different stakeholders. The “process will produce a theoretical end-point of completeness and perfection” (Blank 6). This principle will ensure every practice at VIVA Company adds value to its operations. The principle will also be critical “towards adding value for every targeted consumer” (Blank 5).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe five principles of Lean Management make it easier for corporations to implement new philosophies. Such philosophies can “ensure every company focuses on the best actions and practices” (Blank 7). The philosophy focuses on the best practices in order to maximize customer value.\n\nThe process also makes it easier for companies to focus on their organizational strategies. Managers should always review their strategies and processes in order to continue supporting the changing needs of their stakeholders. A new organizational culture should become evident at VIVA Company (Blank 7).\n\nThis approach will ensure VIVA offers quality services to its clients. The telecommunication company should also monitor its goals and objectives. The company will eventually grow and become competitiveness in the telecommunication industry. The company should also use the above principles in order to implement sustainable changes. In conclusion, the above five Lean Management Principles have the potential to transform the actions and goals of every company in the world.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBlank, Steve. “Why the Lean Start-Up Changes Everything.” Harvard Business Review 1.1 (2013): 1-9.

      "Hudson River Pollution Concerns Research Paper\n\nThe Hudson River had always been the cultural icon of New York, an essential feature of the city’s natural landscape, and a distinguishing element of its history. Unfortunately, the Industrial Revolution and the subsequent advancement of the local and national economy have turned the River into an object of environmental pollution.\n\nSince the 17th century, the Hudson River had served as a transportation route for the European settlers who came to America in their search for a better life (Simon, 2012). Today, it is severely polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls and other chemicals, having horrific impacts on the quality of environmental functioning. From the economic perspective, the Hudson River is an important public good, whereas pollution itself is a negative externality.\n\nThe absence of market incentives makes organizations less motivated to improve the situation. Numerous attempts have been made to solve the problem of Hudson River pollution, including criminal charges and command-and-control mechanisms, but market-based incentives and civil action remain the most promising ways to deal with the issue.\n\nThe history of Hudson River pollution dates back into decades. Since the beginning of the 20th century, polychlorinated biphenyls had been actively used in industrial manufacturing. They are well-known for their cancer-causing capacity and are often linked to developmental and reproductive health problems (Natural Resources Defense Council, 2013).\n\nBetween 1947 and 1977, General Electric, one of the leaders in the American energy market, dumped more than 1.3 million pounds of polychlorinated biphenyls into the Hudson River (NRDC, 2013). In 1977, the use of polychlorinated biphenyls in industrial processes was legally banned (NRDC, 2013). However, even today, these dangerous substances keep leaking into the Hudson River, making its water dangerous for consumption and living.\n\nCertainly, General Electric cannot be solely responsible for the immense pollution of the Hudson River and its far-reaching consequences for the local population. In 1987, Elizabeth Kolbert of the New York Times published a brief article stating that runoff from roads and farms could greatly contribute to the Hudson River contamination.\n\nWhile General Electric assumes responsibility for point source pollution, non-point source pollution remains a serious issue with the Hudson River. However, the real origins of pollution in the Hudson River are the presence of regulatory gaps, which make such pollution possible and easy (Kolbert, 1987).\n\nNon-point source pollution is a matter of serious concern. It is diffuse to the extent that makes the task of implementing effective government regulations virtually unachievable. In economic terms, the costs of cleanup for the Hudson River are likely to reach $500 million, of which almost $400 million will fall on taxpayers (NRDC, 2013). Still, the local and federal community does have a chance to improve the situation.\n\nAccording to Goodstein (2011), Hudson River pollution is a negative externality, since its costs are borne not by the producer but mostly by the consumer of the finished product. Simply stated, the dangerous pollutants dumped by GE into the Hudson River damage the health and wellbeing of those, who use its waters rather than those who are responsible for pollution.\n\nIn the market systems that keep natural inputs in goods and services underpriced, pollution is the most probable result of industrial production (Goodstein, 2011). Like many other environmental resources, the Hudson River is a public good, which is not owned by anyone (Goodstein, 2011).\n\nIn the absence of effective governmental mechanisms, industrial manufacturers are willing to use its waters, as well as other environmental resources, without any regard to the external costs of such use (Goodstein, 2011). For years, General Electric failed to compensate New York residents for Hudson River pollution.\n\nIn economic terms, the company failed to internalize the water pollution externality (Goodstein, 2011). Not surprisingly, the Hudson River was underpriced, and the company found it more economical and feasible to use its waters as a waste machine.\n\nAgain, from an economic standpoint, federal and state governments can use a variety of market-based incentives, to stop pollution. It is because of the absence of such incentives that the pollution of the Hudson River became possible.\n\nPollution-related charges, fees, and taxes top the list of the most effective environmental incentives, making organizations pay for the pollution they cause as a result of their primary activities (National Center for Environmental Economics, 2001).\n\nThe primary benefits of such incentives are in the number of revenues they can potentially generate, although the rates set by government agencies are often too low to have any tangible impacts on the environment (NCEE, 2001). Here, deposit-refund systems could also be used to alleviate the problem of environmental pollution.\n\nThese incentives are much more motivating for consumers rather than manufacturers, as they are used to control the disposal of dangerous elements and substances in the private sector (NCEE, 2001). By contrast, marketable permits represent an essential element of the economic struggle against environmental pollution. This type of economic incentives entails the issue of paid allowances on emissions (NCEE, 2001).\n\nThey have become particularly popular in the United States, although their transaction costs have always been high (NCEE, 2001). Allowances are likely to impede organizations’ technological progress for the sake of better efficiency and less environmental pollution. Subsidies, liabilities, and even information disclosure are intended to work for the benefit of society and meet its economic interests (NCEE, 2001).\n\nNumerous economic and legal attempts have been made to solve the problem of Hudson River pollution. Much progress has been achieved in the society’s striving to clean up its waters, but it is obvious that the government is still at the very beginning of its way to an ideal environment.\n\nOne of the first elements in the economic strategy against the Hudson River pollution was the passage of the Clean Water Act in 1972. According to Andreen (2004), “the Act utilized command-and-control regulatory techniques to implement a completely new, uniform system of technology-based effluent limitations” (p. 537).\n\nAll limitations adopted through the Clean Water Act were enforced as part of the federal permit program, coupled with the technology-based limits set on water pollution (Andreen, 2004). In many senses, the Clean Water Act was an innovative approach to water pollution, comprising the elements of environmental quality standards and technology-based limits (Andreen, 2004).\n\nThe document was severely criticized for its reliance on the command-and-control approaches to regulating polluting discharges – approaches that are often regarded as too expensive, too old-fashioned, and too ineffective (Andreen, 2004). It was also criticized for the unlimited discretion granted to the federal government in the matters related to water pollution (Andreen, 2004).\n\nThe positive effects the Clean Water Act had on the quality of water in the Hudson River can hardly be ignored. Through more than 40 years after passing the Clean Water Act, the Hudson River has turned into a relatively clean waterway suitable for recreation (Siart, 2012).\n\nThe uniqueness of the command-and-control mechanism set by the Clean Water Act is in that it allows citizens to enforce the standards for drinkable and fishable water, in case the government failed to accomplish its mission. Consequently, the public has become a watchdog monitoring the pace and progress of water quality improvements in the Hudson River (Siart, 2012).\n\nThe principles of command-and-control and clean technology approaches came together in the directive issued to General Electric in 2002. The purpose of the directive was to remove polychlorinated biphenyls from the Hudson River. Simon (2002) writes that two hundred miles of the river were granted the Superfund status in 1984.\n\nSince then, any pollution damaging water resources within the borders of the Superfund site would have a “polluter pays” status (Simon, 2002). It is not until 2002 that a directive to make GE remove polychlorinated biphenyls from the Hudson River was issued and signed (Simon, 2012).\n\nBetween 2002 and 2009, GE managed to remove 283,000 cubic yards of the dangerous substances and polluted sediments from the Upper Hudson River (Simon, 2012). In 2011, the second phase of the project began, and it would enable GE to remove the rest of the contaminated sediments from the Hudson River, NY.\n\nFor years, market incentives had been a dream rather than a reality in struggling against water pollution in the Hudson River. Even today, any information on market-based incentives provided to alleviate the burden of water pollution in the Hudson River is absent. Simultaneously, civil action remains a viable tool of environmental protection in the Hudson River area, leading to considerable improvements in the field.\n\nRiverkeeper is one of the most popular and active players in the context of water pollution and water quality protection in New York. The civil organization plays a fundamental role in improving the quality of water resources in the Hudson River. Riverkeeper’s mission is to protect the recreational, environmental, and economic integrity of the Hudson River.\n\nIt is the main law enforcer in everything related to the environmental protection of the Hudson River (Riverkeeper, 2013). Some of the chief civil actions and activities organized by Riverkeeper include but are not limited to the protection of habitat and wetlands, the creation of the Clean Water National Trust Fund, the provision of green funding, as well as providing information and resources needed to ensure smart energy use in New York.\n\nIt should be noted that in the absence of market-based incentives for environmental protection of the Hudson River, law enforcement and litigation becomes a matter of economic concern. Law enforcement remains the primary instrument of achieving a better quality of water resources in the Hudson River.\n\nThese attempts are closely related to civil action mechanisms, as civil organizations assume primary responsibility for monitoring individual and organizational compliance with the provisions of environmental protection laws (Riverkeeper, 2013).\n\nSurprisingly, large polluters like General Electric and Exxon Mobil faced few, if any, criminal charges about Hudson River pollution. In the meantime, other organizations, including Orange County Junk Yard, faced civil and criminal charges for polluting the Hudson River (Schneiderman, 1999).\n\nIn 1999, the Environmental Protection Agency filed a state lawsuit seeking cleanup of the contaminated groundwater and soils, to prevent further contamination of the Hudson River by Orange County Junk Yard (Schneiderman, 1999).\n\nAlso, criminal charges were made on the basis that the organization had violated state environmental laws (Schneiderman, 1999). The outcomes of the case are unknown, but it seems that most of what has been done to tackle the problem of Hudson River pollution is likely to become irrelevant and ineffective in the nearest future.\n\nLegal pressures and command-and-control mechanisms are not the best approaches to managing and reducing the scope of water pollution in the Hudson River. Since the 1960s, both economists and environmentalists have promoted the importance of incentive-based approaches to environmental protection as compared with command-and-control regulations (Goodstein, 2011).\n\nThe regulation presents a series of dilemmas, making it difficult for the society to keep up with the pace of economic growth and raising the costs of environmental control (Goodstein, 2011). The fact that regulations are information-intensive and, for this reason, are vulnerable to political influences, should not be disregarded (Goodstein, 2011).\n\nIn this situation, it is at least surprising that no explicit system of market incentives to reduce and eliminate pollution risks in the Hudson River has been proposed so far. Also, the emphasis placed on the use of clean technologies by large enterprises in the Hudson River area will hardly help to improve the quality of water.\n\nGoodstein (2011) suggests that clean technologies do not provide any profit advantage to the organizations that must comply with these principles. Private firms, be they large or small, have little motivation to adopt clean technologies for the sake of technologies, as they are not willing to spend their scarce financial resources on them.\n\nAt the same time, they do not wish to change their operational processes and make consumers adopt new habits and principles in using finished products (Goodstein, 2011).\n\nDespite the considerable progress made in terms of cleaning the Hudson River from polychlorinated biphenyls, it is high time for the state authorities to reconsider its approaches to the problem and develop a comprehensive incentive-based policy that will motivate individuals and organizations to improve the quality of the environmental resources in the Hudson River.\n\nIn conclusion, Hudson River pollution remains a matter of hot public and political concerns. No less problematic are the economic aspects of the problem. On the one hand, the costs of Hudson River cleanup are likely to reach $500 million, of which at least $400 million will fall on taxpayers. On the other hand, only economic incentives can promise to motivate organizations to reduce the scope of pollutants dumped into the Hudson River.\n\nNumerous attempts have been made to remove dangerous substances from the Hudson River and improve the quality of its waters. The Clean Water Act as a command-and-control mechanism, clean technology standards, and civil action were aimed to eliminate the problem of Hudson River pollution from the public agenda.\n\nDespite the tangible progress made in cleaning the Hudson River from polychlorinated biphenyls, it is high time for the state authorities to adopt a system of market incentives that will motivate organizations to treat available water resources with great care and responsibility towards the local community.\n\nReferences\n\nAndreen, W.

      "Dell Corporation Report\n\nThe report covers the developments, challenges, and strategies that Dell Corporation has adopted to maintain its top status in the U.S. computer industry. The authors provide an analysis of how Dell Company enlarged its supply chains, cut down costs, and engaged a team of competent management to outperform its main competitors in the technology industry for a long period.\n\nIn the report, the authors have clearly described the problem facing Dell, which concerns the company’s abrupt loss of customers and market share to its competitors. The loss of market share has been associated with the competitors copying Dell’s cost reduction strategies and supply chains.\n\nThe solution to this problem will not only enable Dell to win more customers but also revive its energies and regain its original top position in the PC industry.\n\nThe report examines how Dell Company’s success resulted from its ability to reach both the low income and high-income customers by expanding its outlets and making computers affordable and less technical to use. Dell had a policy of always seeking measures to reduce its production costs and listen to customers in order to understand their needs and obtain considerable market information.\n\nDell’s mantra states that the current company’s technology is its future commodity. Dell operates at considerably low costs and manages to hold low volumes of stock besides selling its products directly to consumers. The high-profit margins in Dell’s market segments give the company a competitive edge over its competitors.\n\nDell sells its products to governments and big companies in large quantities and at high prices; an aspect that places the company a step ahead of its competitors due to the high-profit margins and economies of scales. The authors have also stated the prioritization of customers’ needs, customization of products, and the expansion of service portfolios as the recent company’s resolve to tackle the emerging threats.\n\nThe report is clearly presented and provides an informative analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of the company. However, the report does not indicate the methodologies and techniques that the authors employed in coming up with the historical analysis of Dell Corporation. The industrial surveys referred to by the report are also not referenced or quoted in the report.\n\nThe report must be commended for its comprehensive analysis of the company’s marketing strategies and its recommendations. The recommendations provided by the report include expanding the company’s product line, charging competitive and affordable prices, enhancing marketing to reach the youth market, and opening a retail outlet stall.\n\nThese recommendations are adequate to restore the company to its original status, with the recommendation of raising prices to an affordable level being more successful than the option of lowering prices to outshine its competitors. Competitive prices act as an indication of quality to consumers and augment companies’ revenue margin.\n\nTherefore, the new recommended marketing strategy is more effective compared to earlier alternatives since it is more concentrated and broad. However, the report did not provide sufficient recommendations about Dell’s long term problem of concentrating too much on data collection from customers rather than the alternative of relation-building that is advantageous.\n\nThis is an area where future reports should focus on and formulate appropriate recommendations to solve this problem. Nonetheless, the report is excellent, and the implementation of these recommendations can restore Dell to its original number one position in the computer world.\n",
      "Performance Appraisal System Adoption Problem Solution Essay\n\nStopNShopToday Inc has to adopt a performance appraisal system which will objectively evaluate and allow continuous interaction between its employees and managers.\n\nThe Employee Performance Appraisal System should enable the managers provide objective descriptions and evaluations of the employees’ performance standards. There are several types of performance appraisal systems which can be adopted by StopNShopToday Inc.\n\nStopNShopToday Inc can adopt 360-Degree or Full Circle Appraisal to evaluate the performance of its employees. In 360-Degree Appraisal, an employee’s performance will be evaluated by everyone within StopNShopToday Inc with whom he or she interacts (Eichinger, 2004).\n\nThis will include the managers, colleagues, customers as well as members of other departments. Hakala (2008) asserts that although this appraisal system is expensive, it can be used to comprehensively evaluate the performance of key employees of an organization.\n\nStopNShopToday Inc can also adopt Management by Objectives (MBO) appraisal system. By implementing this appraisal system, each departmental manager will set objective goals with his or her subordinates so that at the end of the period, the manager evaluates the employee’s achievement of the set objective goals (Deming, 1994).\n\nAction statements in the MBO process begins with statements like “reduce rejected parts by 5%” (Hakala, 2008). It involves continuous monitoring as well as review of objectives to enable the manager keep the employees focused on achieving the set goals. During the annual review, an assessment is conducted on progress towards objectives so that new goals are set.\n\nRating Scale is another important appraisal system which can be implemented by StopNShopToday Inc. The Rating Scale would require each manager or the management to develop an in-depth grading system which would be used to evaluate each employee’s success within a range of areas which could include technical skills, creativity, communication skills, and teamwork among others.\n\nThe management/manager sets a minimum required grade which an employee has to receive to enable the manager consider the performance appraisal as a success. This method allows the organization to put those who do not make the minimum required grade on a performance improvement plan (Henderson, 2011).\n\nStopNShopToday Inc also needs to improve how it rates its performance assessment categories. Evaluating an employee’s procedural knowledge and skill as well as customer service Skills should involve rating performance standard by entering whole numbers on the Employee Performance Appraisal System Form to represent the manager’s perception/evaluation.\n\nThe numerical values should include 0 meaning unacceptable; 1 meaning development needed; 2 meaning fully competent; and 3 meaning Excelling. The manager has to document performance of each staff throughout the appraisal period by keeping written record of every staff’s accomplishments. It is this information that the manager should use to rate the performance of every employee.\n\nIn situations where the manager assigns an employee value 0 or 1, he or she has to list all areas which need improvement as well as recommendations for improvement. The manager must also provide a narrative explanation for his or her evaluation of each performance assessment category to justify the overall score assigned.\n\nIt is important that each manager for every department keeps written record of every employee’s creative work examples and judgment examples. This would allow the manager to quantify every employee’s creativity and consistent good judgment.\n\nAs a result, the manager can use comparative rating scale to evaluate every employee’s creativity and consistency in good judgment by using words such as low, medium and high. The examples should be used to justify the employee’s creativity and consistency in good judgment as rated by the manager.\n\nEvaluation of employee attendance should be more objective and accurate adopting rating scale which assigns numerical values to the employee’s average attendance.\n\nThis should involve calculating the number of days attended during the appraisal period as a percentage of the total number of days the employee is supposed to have attended, and assigning values 1-6 where 1represents less than 50%; 2 represents 50-60%; 3 represents 61-70%; 4 represents 71-80%; 5 represents 81-90%; and 6 represents 91-100%.\n\nStopNShopToday Inc would be able to improve its performance appraisal system by adopting a combination of appraisal systems. Besides, it has to improve its performance assessment categories to make them more objective and accurate.\n\nReference List\n\nDeming, W. E. (1994). Out of the crisis .

      "Risk Control Systems and Performance Report (Assessment)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Critical control systems\n 2. Critical risk control systems for a nuclear plant\n 3. Identification of risk control systems\n 4. Functional and survivability requirements\n 5. Performance assessment\n 6. Reference List\n\nCritical control systems\n\nCritical risk control systems are essential in various infrastructures notably those in the energy sector.\n\nDue to the increased integration in enterprise systems in modern settings, there is an increased need for the establishment of inherently secure risk control systems which are designed and implemented in such a way that they minimize vulnerabilities to constant threats being posed by both internal and external forces (Young et al. 2005).\n\nOccurrence of these risks would heavily impact on the effectiveness and efficiency of the organization consequently impacting on the profitability as well as the outlook of the organization (Fraser 2010). Energy companies are often confronted by severe technical security risks due to the delicate nature of their operations.\n\nIt is, therefore, the duty of the organization’s owners and operators to establish the link between the prevailing risks in production and distribution process for energy products and vulnerabilities inherent in the risk control systems (Young et al. 2005).\n\nSubsequently, the firm’s management should institute and integrate risk control systems, which should be continually improved in order to defend creation and distribution operations from any harm (unintentional and intentional).\n\nIt is essential for companies to implement efficient risk control systems since failure of the same may result in endangerment to human life and the environment, loss of profitability for the affected company, and harm to the nation’s energy production infrastructure (Young et al. 2005).\n\nRisk refers to the possibility of occurrence of an event that could adversely affect the company’s personnel, assets, environment, reputation, or even overflow to the external surroundings (Poupart-Lafarge 2007). Risk is, therefore, a necessary part of the organization which should be approached with a lot of caution.\n\nSince risk-taking is an inherent part of any business enterprise seeking to prosper in the market, it is important for the organization to embrace an amount of risk adequate for effective performance of the business. However, these risks require proper management and control in order to enhance the company’s ability to achieve its long term objectives and maintain its profitability.\n\nRisk management and critical control systems play an essential role in directing organizations towards achieving operations safety by continually preventing and managing these risks (Poupart-Lafarge 2007).\n\nRisk control systems, therefore, refer to a dynamic system adopted by a specific organization to regulate and maintain risks in the company at certain acceptable levels (Poupart-Lafarge 2007). Critical risks control systems entail a set of resources, procedures, guidelines and actions that are adopted by the organization in order to manage risks.\n\nThe risk control systems play a major role in creating and preserving the organization’s values, assets as well as its reputation in both the internal and external environment (Poupart-Lafarge 2007).\n\nThe risk control systems seek to identify and address the potential risks and opportunities that the company is likely to incur in the future on occurrence of risks after which they address and anticipate these risks rather than submitting them passively. The risk management systems assist in the process of decision making and the company’s processes to attain its objectives (Poupart-Lafarge 2007).\n\nThrough the control systems, the organization seeks to identify the main incidences and events that are likely to influence the company’s long term performance and interfere with the attainment of the company’s objectives. Since it is every organization’s goal to reach the highest level of performance, controlling these risks promotes the company’s performance and enhances the attainment of the company’s objectives.\n\nRisk management is an integral part of any organization’s decision-making and operating processes since the decisions made by the organization have to be based on the possibility of occurrence of various risk. Risk control systems allow managers to gain a comprehensive outlook of the company’s threats an opportunities consequently enabling them to make informed decisions based on the probability of risk.\n\nRisk control systems and risk management promote consistency of the company’s actions with its value (Poupart-Lafarge 2007). This is because they seek to address the issues likely to affect both the internal and external environment consequently demonstrating corporate responsibility.\n\nOccurrence of risks often threatens the company’s credibility and reflects the company’s lack of consistency between decision-making process and critical risk costs. It is therefore important for organization’s to contain the effects of risks occurrence by ensuring that the risk is efficiently controlled.\n\nSound risk control systems significantly reduce the probability of risk occurrence consequently promoting the image of the organization both internally and externally. In addition, risk management systems promote cohesion among company’s employees as well as other stakeholders as they work together behind a shared vision of reducing the incidences of risk occurrence in the organization.\n\nIt is the duty of each organization; therefore, to establish a risk control system that is applicable to its specific circumstances (Poupart-Lafarge 2007). The risk control system should incorporate an organizational framework that defines the roles and responsibilities of all the stakeholders, sets out the procedures, and clearly outlines the consistent standards of the system in order to enhance the attainment of its purpose.\n\nIn addition, the framework should constitute a risk control policy that sets out the system’s objectives in accordance with the corporate culture that should highlight the company’s approach to the identification, analysis and management of risks in the organization.\n\nFurther, the system should have an advanced information system that facilitates efficient and accurate dissemination of information within the organization. This ensures that the relevant information is transmitted intended recipient within the stipulated time, which consequently enhances performance in the organization.\n\nAn efficient risk control process manifests itself in a three-stage process; the three-stage process entails risk identification, risk analysis and risk management procedures (Poupart-Lafarge 2007). In risk identification, the company seeks to establish the main risks threatening the company’s attainment of its goals and objectives. These risks may derive from internal or external forces.\n\nRisk analysis, on the other hand, involves the examination of the potential financial, personal, and environmental as well as the reputation implications of the risk occurrence on the company (Greenberg 1991). This enhances the company’s response to accidents upon occurrence. Further, the likelihood of risk occurrence should be assessed in order to award priority to events most likely to occur.\n\nThe final step involves risk management procedures, whereby the most appropriate action plans for the organization are chosen and executed (Poupart-Lafarge 2007). The organization adopts these measures in order to maintain a certain acceptable level of risk necessary for effective performance of the company.\n\nThe organizations’ risk control systems seek to reduce the amount of risk, transfer the risk, and accept the risk or to completely eliminate the risks.\n\nThe company makes the appropriate decision by weighing the costs and the opportunities of risk management measures with due consideration of their potential effects on the overall performance of the organization as well as its environs. The organization should subject the risk control systems to periodic supervision and reviews, which facilitates constant performance improvement.\n\nCritical risk control systems for a nuclear plant\n\nNuclear plant activities carry with them an inherent risk that may negatively affect people or the environment (Heinrichs and Fell 1995). Consequently, the aim of all risk managers in the industry is to maintain risks levels as low as possible.\n\nThe governing bodies embark on extensive regulation and control of the plant in order to safeguard it from internal and external threats. The United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission protects nuclear materials within the country from misappropriation, sensitive information from unauthorized disclosure, and regulates the use of radioactive materials in the plants in order to protect people and the environment (NRC 2010).\n\nRadioactive materials pose danger to human life and the environment through exposure to ionizing radiations. As defined by IAEA in 1988, one of the significant goals of safety management in nuclear plants is ensuring the protection of the plant’s personnel, the general public, and the environment through extensive defence against radiological hazards (Neeb 2007). The US NRC has implemented various measures to attain this goal.\n\nThe events of September 11 th that resulted to massive losses of lives prompted the US to increase its emphasis on security of radioactive materials.\n\nConsequently, the NRC has been fully dedicated to the process of providing security to nuclear materials without discouraging their beneficial use through the office of federal and state materials and environmental management program and the office of nuclear security and incidence response (NRC 2010).\n\nIn the modern global energy, nuclear plant management are confronted with numerous dimensions of risks other than radioactive hazards. Therefore, the management has to address these risks in order to remain competitive in the global market (IAEA 2001). Due to major advancements in information technology, there is an increased need for securing sensitive information in nuclear plants.\n\nBoth classified and sensitive information relating to nuclear operations must be protected by the governing bodies due to its delicate nature. This is important since leakage of information to unauthorized persons may in some instances result in threat to national security, or enable unauthorized people to design, utilize, or manufacture nuclear weapons (NRC 2010).\n\nAccording to a report by IAEA (2001), the operating system of nuclear plant comprises of three major sectors; safety, productions, and commercial sectors which are embedded within a strategic outline and are interdependent of each other such that a decision made in one of the sectors consequently impacts on the performance of other sectors.\n\nAn integrated risk control system, therefore, analyzes these factors and aims at minimizing or eliminating the risk associated with the same.\n\nVarious bodies have been established to regulate nuclear activities in the world. These bodies award responsibility to the material licensees to maintain security and accountability of the radioactive material in their possession (NRC 2010).\n\nThe nuclear licensees and security regulators have consequently agreed on a shared vision to ensure safe, secure and efficient utilization of nuclear materials under the Regulatory Nuclear Interface Protocol (HSE 2009). Plant protection and mitigation systems form an additional yet separated system of layers to the control systems by monitoring the nuclear plant variables (Chapin 1997).\n\nIf these systems detect that the plant monitoring and control systems are not operating in line with the plant’s predetermined set of conditions, they proceed to shut down the plant.\n\nThe systems (mitigation and protection) are discrete for the reason that they are physically detached from the software and hardware being employed by the firm’s control and operating systems. Also, they are environmentally designed to survive in the harshest anticipated accident conditions e.g. earthquakes (Chapin 1997).\n\nLicensing of risk control systems is governed by the Regulatory Commission in the United States. The federal government has established the (DHS) which has the overall responsibility among the federal agencies for assessing the vulnerability of the nation’s critical infrastructure to external threats and coordinating efforts to enhance security of the same.\n\nBack in 2005, DHS sought to inspect the nuclear sites in the United States in order to conduct security reviews which would assist them in assessing the risk and consequences of various events likely to affect the nuclear power plants (Wells 2007). This enabled the body to establish the most effective way of allocating federal resources to improve security in the nuclear plants.\n\nFor the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the primary focus is on the security of the sites and the protective measures applied to enhance such security. The NRC staffs possess vast knowledge and experience on matters relating to threat assessment which comes in handy in the process of assessing the possibility of threat to the nuclear power plant.\n\nThrough the use of reports and secure databases, the NRC is able to analyze the information in order to identify specific references to nuclear power plants and to determine the possibility of terrorist attack to the nuclear plant (Wells 2007).\n\nIdentification of risk control systems\n\nFlight control is an interesting yet a technically challenging subject for which a wide range of engineering disciplines have to align their skills and efforts in order to establish a successful control system that ensures that the aircrafts are operated in safe conditions (Pratt 2000).\n\nSince airline operations require maximum security and safety conditions, it is essential for the airline management to ensure that the safety standards are maintained at all levels in order to avoid accidents.\n\nThe causes of accidents and incidents in aircraft operations refer to events or conditions that lead to occurrence of aircraft accident. Accidents, on the other hand, refer to occurrences that affect the normal operations of an aircraft.\n\nAccidents may occur during the operations from the time a person boards an aircraft to the time that all the people have disembarked from the plane that results into serious injuries to people, damage to the aircraft and/or the disappearance of the aircraft (National research Council 1998).\n\nIn the bowtie, the possible risks for the aircraft are clearly outlined. The causes of risks range from helicopter failure, overloading the helicopter, hazardous cargo on board which may result in aircraft accidents.\n\nIn order to reduce the probability of such risk occurrences, the management should utilize proper risk control systems. Aircraft operators should strictly adhere to quality control systems which considerably reduces cases of aircraft failures and accidents.\n\nAircraft owners and operators should ensure that their suppliers are providing them with approved aircrafts which have undergone extensive inspection and approval by the governing bodies. Aviation contractors should ensure that the helicopters are maintained in good and safe working conditions in order to promote safety in the long run.\n\nRegulatory bodies should certify effective aircraft manufacturers and constantly inspect their production processes in order to promote continuous quality aircraft manufacturing. In addition, the manufacturers must incorporate the standards upheld by airline operators which ensure that high-quality aircrafts are utilized consequently reducing the probability of aircraft failure.\n\nGoverning bodies should ensure that safety procedures are followed at all levels of operations in order to prevent helicopter. Aircrafts should be used for the appropriate duties and the operators should be highly qualified. Experienced and qualified pilots have the ability to execute their duties effectively and this significantly reduces the number of accidents.\n\nThe pilots should accurately calculate the required weight and balance for each trip in order to avoid overloading the aircraft, which often result in aircraft accidents. In case of adverse environmental conditions, the pilot has the authority to abort any take-off or landing in order to prevent an accident.\n\nA competent pilot has the ability to adjust route in order to avoid sudden environmental changes such as storm. However, the airline operators should ensure continuous and accurate monitoring of environmental conditions in order to avoid such incidences.\n\nEffective communication among the relevant stakeholders is essential in the coordination of aircraft operations. The helicopter landing officer should be in constant communication with the pilot in order to promote safe landing and take off. Pre-flight induction and video briefing should be highly emphasized in order to enlighten those on board on matters regarding safety and emergency procedures.\n\nEffective and constant communication between the pilot and air traffic controllers has been essential in tracing lost aircrafts in the past. Further, the communication enables the air traffic controllers to establish the accurate time for aircraft landing consequently reducing incidences of helicopter crash at the rig.\n\nFunctional and survivability requirements\n\nContinuous monitoring of the performance and quality standards of aircrafts and airlines is necessary in order to ensure that safety performance is achieved and maintained in the long run (Heldman 2005). Adopting critical risk control systems in the short run reduces the effectiveness of risk control systems in achieving long term objectives of the airline.\n\nTo avoid such incidences, the airline administration should make use of the AIR monitors to guarantee constant execution of safety standards and continuous scrutiny of the producer’s control systems in order to establish the level of protection and to incessantly validate that they are still abiding by terms of the documentation as well as the delegation that they hold.\n\nThe airline companies should establish solid regulatory bodies which should govern the safety standards in aircraft operations. Regulatory bodies should ensure that the rules and regulations such as IATA which regulates transport of hazardous materials are strictly enforced in order to avoid aircraft accidents resulting from hazardous material onboard.\n\nFurther, these bodies should ensure that aircraft operators are highly qualified. For instance, the regulatory bodies should ensure that the aviation personnel possesses valid helicopter underwater training escape training which they must present before boarding the aircraft. Regulatory bodies should constantly inspect the quality standards in aircraft operations in order to ensure that they are implemented and practiced in the long run.\n\nEffective communication should be embraced at all levels of aircraft operations. The management should constantly motivate their fellow employees to maintain safe standards in aircraft operations. Both vertical and horizontal communication should be promoted in order to promote coordination of the operations as well as contribution by fellow employees.\n\nRisk control system should be based on the basic fundamental principles of risk identification, risk analysis, action plan, and continuous monitoring of the process. Communication between aircraft operators should be enhanced through the utilization of modern technology which has substantially improved communication in the modern world\n\nPerformance assessment\n\nAlthough the airline management may implement risk control systems effectively, it is important for them to assess the effectiveness of the system in order to achieve the intended objectives. Integration of risk control systems and safety assurance enables the attainment of this goal within organizations.\n\nThe risk control process enables the management to identify the hazards prevalent in airline operations and the subsequent assessments of these risks. Performance assurance, on the other hand, takes control of the process by ensuring that the risks controls continue to be practiced within the organization and that they continue to achieve their intended purpose.\n\nThis system further provides for an opportunity for the assessment of the need for new controls arising as a result of changes in the operational environment (Halford 2008). The management should, therefore, review the long term objectives of risk control systems and assess the probability of achievement based on current performance.\n\nReference List\n\nChapin, D.

      "The Rose Company: Decentralization Strategy Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Problem Statement\n 3. Analysis and Implementations\n 4. Recommendations\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a decentralized management structure, a company’s senior management delegates certain decision-making functions to the lower administrative units (Hill, Martin & Harris, 2000).\n\nA decentralized type of organizational structure gives a plant or a line manager authority to decide (unilaterally) on plant-specific issues and implement necessary changes in the subsidiary without seeking approval from the senior management.\n\nA decentralized structure is necessary where a firm has multiple plant locations, which reduces the capacity of the senior management to monitor plant operations or make plant-specific decisions (Hill, Martin & Harris, 2000).\n\nThe system also functions in a situation where competition within the industry is high and thus, many urgent decisions are required to maintain a firm’s competitiveness. Rapid changes within the industry can force a firm to adopt a decentralized business model in a bid to enhance administrative control in each plant.\n\nBesides innovations, a growth in size and number of plants or subsidiaries can render a centralized management approach ineffective.\n\nThis paper explores the administrative problems that the Rose Company may face as it adopts a decentralized strategy for its new plant, Plant X. It will examine requisite policies, considerations, risks, and constraints associated with the new system.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThe Rose Company intends to implement a decentralized system to replace its centralized organizational structure. In the new organizational structure, a general manager will oversee the operations in a new plant, Plant X.\n\nUnlike the other plants, Plant X will be run on a decentralized basis and J. Pierce, Rose’s accounting executive, has been given the responsibility of implementing the new management structure. Pierce is new to corporate leadership.\n\nAs Rose’s accounting executive, Pierce worked under the vice president in the controller’s department. Although he is touted as an analytical, tough, aggressive, and efficient expert who can help Plant X reach new goals, he has no administrative experience.\n\nMoreover, Pierce, as the new general manager, anticipates administrative challenges in his first “line” assignment because of the many changes that will come with the decentralization strategy. First, plant X will require new methods and processes, as the company’s existing systems are based on a centralized structure.\n\nRose’s senior management wants plant X to adopt new production methods that would cut down processing and labor costs. Moreover, the new production methods, which have not been implemented in any of Rose’s plants, are expected to improve product quality and competitiveness in the market.\n\nHowever, since the methods are new, plant X employees may be unfamiliar with some of the new production processes and equipment. This means that they will need training to equip them with skills to work under the new system.\n\nSecond, the new strategy will also change relationships among various administrative units as defined in Rose’s current organizational chart. In particular, the strategy will affect Rose’s reporting lines, as the heads of departments will, under the new system, report to Pierce.\n\nThe failure of Rose’s ‘central control’ to monitor production operations effectively in each plant motivated the senior management to try out a decentralized model for Plant X.\n\nUnder this management approach, the production, industrial relations, and production planning line managers (vice presidents) will no longer exercise control over the respective units in Plant X.\n\nHowever, home managers will report to Pierce while maintaining a “functional” relationship with their counterparts at the headquarters. This kind of arrangement (not fully decentralized) or structure is likely cause many administrative challenges.\n\nAnalysis and Implementations\n\nA decentralized structure removes some decision-making roles from the senior management and assigns them to line managers.\n\nThis improves the rate at which decisions are made since it eliminates unnecessary bureaucracy and administrative barriers. It also gives the top management time to formulate major strategies for the firm.\n\nOn the other hand, a decentralized organizational structure can hamper information sharing due to “procedural differences” between the line manager and the senior management (Watson, 2003, p. 307). This can create control and administrative problems in a company.\n\nIn this regard, before implementing a new restructuring strategy, the management should first define how the new approach would improve a firm’s operations and competitiveness (Wheelen & Hunger, 2002).\n\nThe senior management of the Rose Company wants to restructure its organizational structure by allowing its new plant to operate independently with regard to its manufacturing processes and personnel management.\n\nThe management arrived at a decision to start Plant X, which, unlike the others, will adopt new manufacturing processes and reporting structures. It is evident that Rose’s case raises concerns related to strategy implementation.\n\nThe central management of the Rose Company should take into consideration several factors when implementing the decentralization strategy. One of the key considerations is the policy framework to support the restructuring process.\n\nPierce needs to create an implementation plan that will guide the restructuring strategy. Following decentralization, manufacturing at Plant X will involve new processes and methods.\n\nThus, a framework that details the functional policies will ensure that the decentralized operations (manufacturing) run as expected. Pierce foresees challenges related to administrative relationships in the decentralized unit.\n\nPierce will perform administrative and management roles that relate to personnel in the Plant X. In the decentralized unit, line managers will cease to report to their respective vice presidents at the home office.\n\nInstead, they will report to Pierce, as Plant X’s general manager. Thus, he needs to develop human resource policies to guide recruitment, staff training on the new processes, promotions, and dismissals.\n\nIn the Rose Co., certain risks and constraints may affect the implementation of the new strategy. Top among them is the management capacity of Plant X’s leadership.\n\nMr. Pierce has not been involved in administrative functions at Rose having served as the company’s accounting executive at the home office and thus, the assignment is new to him. Moreover, he has not worked at the new plant before.\n\nHe has no management experience, as the new job is his first major assignment. This presents a potential threat to the implementation of the new strategy. However, Pierce has excellent analytical and administrative capacity, which may prove essential in managing the new venture.\n\nAnother potential constraint relates to the partial “functional relationship” retained between Plant X’s line managers and their respective seniors in the home office. This system is likely to derail the decision-making process and restrict Pierce’s administrative powers.\n\nSince in the old organizational structure the line managers were answerable to their respective senior vice presidents at the home office, they will continue to do so if the reporting lines are left open. Thus, the functional relationships that exist between the two levels pose a threat to the successful implementation of the decentralization strategy.\n\nThe new manufacturing methods and equipment will constrain Plant X’s operations. According to the report, Rose’s top managers were unsatisfied with the management of the company’s manufacturing operations. This motivated them to experiment with Plant X a new management approach and novel manufacturing methods.\n\nIt is important to note that the Rose Company has never tried out the decentralized model and the production processes and equipment in any of its plants. Thus, the organizational changes will need a complete overhaul of Plant X’s systems and retraining of staff about the new production methods.\n\nIt will require the installation of new equipment and changes in the product production process. Thus, resistance to the new changes will present a threat to the implementation of the strategy.\n\nRecommendations\n\nBased on the findings of this analysis, it is recommended that the management of the Rose Company undertake measures to enhance the restructuring process involving plant X.\n\nThe central management should restructure the current organizational chart to ensure that all reporting lines in Plant X end at the general manager.\n\nAll line managers, except sales manager, should report to Pierce. The functional relationships between the line managers and the vice presidents will affect decision-making and the implementation of the strategy.\n\nThe central management should also allow the decentralized unit to operate independently in order to explore its business environment and evaluate its capabilities (Kozami, 2002).\n\nIt should be allowed to source for its supplies and sell or distribute its products independently, which, in effect, means that Plant X will incur costs or reap the profits depending on how it runs its activities. In this regard, it is recommended that the sales function, which Pierce does not oversee, be allocated to plant X.\n\nIn this way, Pierce can exercise full control of the activities of the decentralized unit. The senior vice presidents in charge of purchases, quality control, traffic, and plant control, who retain a functional relationship with Plant X, should not participate in the unit’s decision-making process, as this will usurp Pierce’s administrative powers.\n\nThe authority of both the senior executives and the unit management should be separated for the new strategy to work.\n\nThe Rose Company will also need to enhance communication channels to facilitate information sharing between Plant X and the other units. Under the current structure, Plant X will not be able to relate horizontally with the other plants.\n\nAccording to Wheelen and Hunger (2002), decentralization strategy induces a process of social learning and creates new forms of knowledge.\n\nThus, a policy that promotes horizontal cooperation will allow the new plant to communicate to the vice presidents in charge of production, industrial relations, and production planning the progress of the restructuring process.\n\nIt will create an atmosphere of interaction among Rose’s units, which will foster innovation and product improvement processes.\n\nIn addition, free transmission of knowledge will help the central management to understand “what is working and what is not working” in the decentralized unit and take appropriate steps (Aldrich, 2000, p. 45).\n\nThe knowledge transfer channels will serve as “best practice forums” that will allow the senior management to monitor the progress of the implementation process (Aldrich, 2000, p. 44).\n\nConclusion\n\nA decentralization strategy can allow large firms to improve the management of its units. The Rose Company’s decentralization strategy will allow the firm to introduce and test new manufacturing processes and equipment at Plant X.\n\nHowever, the retention of functional relationships between the line managers at Plant X and the senior vice presidents at the home office presents is a potential threat to the implementation process.\n\nThis paper has analyzed the considerations, policies, and risks and constraints associated with Rose’s current organizational structure. Recommendations on how the Rose Company can overcome these constraints and move from a centralized system to a decentralized structure for Plant X are also given.\n\nReferences\n\nAldrich, H. E.

Recommendation\n 7. References\n\nThe Burberry Company/Brand\n\nBurberry is a modernized fashion and a luxury retail company that emerged around 1856 from the United Kingdom when a twenty-year man, Thomas Burberry, opened a shop for selling drapers in an area known as Basingstoke in England (Moon, 2004).\n\nIn a short span of time, Thomas Burberry managed to invent three important retail products: a waterproof, a gabardine, and a breathable fabric that quickly penetrated into the market and emerged as the most preferred fashion for persons interested in exploring extreme atmospheres (Moon, 2004).\n\nSince the First World War, Burberry Company has managed to become the fabric of choice after the British Army preferred them to design official coats for the army.\n\nThroughout the years, the company expanded gradually and dominated several markets within the European world before venturing in the Asian Pacific regions and China emerged as one of the suitable destinations (Moon, 2004). Burberry introduced their checkered pattern that involved light brown, red, black, and white tartan designs that officially became the signature check trademark.\n\nThroughout the beginning and mid-1990s, the company was facing structural and strategic control dilemmas and questions of quality were emerging, although the profitability remained high (Moon, 2004). Reformists thought that the brand of the Burberry Company was lacking modernity, as it seemed turgid and conventional, and thus appealing only to the older consumers.\n\nRose Marie Bravo, a native New Yorker with over 25 years working experience in the fashion and luxury industry assumed the position of Chief Executive of Burberry and immediately proposed a series of innovative strategies (Moon, 2004). It was in 1997 and towards the new millennium, when the new chief executive emerged and begun reinventing the brand and trademark of Burberry.\n\nBravo repositioned the brand by introducing stylish and innovative luxury lifestyle brands, which seemingly attracted the younger consumers. Burberry has now diversified to women’s apparels, men’s wear, and various accessories (Moon, 2004). Burberry brand went through a series of innovative transformations until lately in China, when the Chinese trademark office revoked its copyright on red, black, and tan designs.\n\nLuxury Theory/Anti-laws\n\nReformists believe that the modern business world is dynamic and businesses depend on the interplay of various internal and internal environmental factors to succeed. Modern businesses and marketing of retail products depend on several business laws and marketing principles for perfection and survival (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013).\n\nOne luxury theory that has been repeatedly important in describing the consumption of goods and services and its relationship with marketing of luxury products within the luxury industry is the conspicuous consumption theory.\n\nThe most likely theory to fit in the case of Burberry is the theory of conspicuous consumption that directly relates to the innovations and inventions within the management of performance of luxury stores (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013).\n\nThe theory of conspicuous consumption reveals that the trends in purchasing of products depend on the social status. Essentially, the theory postulates that the higher the class a person seems, the more luxurious one deems. Luxury is a secondary want in the classification of human necessities.\n\nThe position of this analysis is positive on the question whether revoking the signature check trademark of Burberry on its red, black, and tan designs would influence its market viability.\n\nBased on the conspicuous consumption theory that majorly considers luxury products to be secondary products, whose purchasing depends on social class and not the direct efforts of strategic marketing of a company, the luxury marketplace for Burberry may remain intact (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013).\n\nLuxury anti-laws oppose the common marketing strategies that companies use to enhance brand reputation and sales promotion, and this notion typically means the luxury marketplace depends on individuals’ product preferences (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013).\n\nBased on the luxury anti-laws that Burberry may demonstrate based on its specialization, it is clear that the effectiveness of its products is on neoclassical approach and individual preferences that influence purchasing. The idea of revoking the signature check trademark for the Burberry luxury products may, therefore, have a mild impact on its market reputation.\n\nBefore the revocation of the signature check trademark, Burberry had recorded commendable reputation high class and celebrity consumers. The assumed classy association has significantly motivated the consumption of Burberry products within other medium and lower-class individuals.\n\nThe theory of the leisure class that Veblen developed postulates that within the conspicuous consumption trend, low profile individuals tend to imitate the consumption patterns of high profile individuals (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013). Changes in the social norms that determine such emulation trends tend to change significantly depending on changes in the social fabric and regional economy.\n\nThe impact of revoking the signature check trademark on Burberry products or services as luxury products oppose most of the marketing principles and rely on the anti-laws of marketing.\n\nBastien and Kapferer (2013) state that market positioning, customer demands, pricing strategies, customer relations, and business repositioning are the basic business-marketing laws that seldom apply to the luxury market, since the notion is that the perceived luxury or prestige makes the service of the product sellable.\n\nBurberry in Dubai\n\nAs aforementioned above, fashion and luxury companies such as Burberry have little reliance on the principles of marketing that aim at attracting and sustaining clientele.\n\nLuxury and fashion companies deal with conspicuous products or credence products, and advertisers use people in the higher hierarchies as pacesetters of the consumption trend. Joy, Sherry, Venkatesh, Wang, and Chan (2012) state that, “while the dream quality is essential for a luxury product, in some instances, a long history and heritage further intensify a brand’s strength” (p. 287).\n\nIn contravention of the marketing principles and pursuing the market using the anti-laws of marketing, business positioning as a competitive advantage is insignificant to most of the luxury companies.\n\nJoy et al. (2012) postulate that the anti-laws of marketing presume that luxury and fashion businesses tend to ignore business strategic positioning as a significant marketing strategy that modern businesses utilize. A closer look and overview of Dubai setting or positioning for Burberry brings some mixed perceptions, but anti-laws of marketing are applicable in such positioning.\n\nHigh pricing power and business location and relocation are not part of the marketing rules that most leading luxury brands follow. In Dubai, Burberry positioned its retail store within the Dubai Outlet Mall (DOM) alongside several other international luxury brand companies, including Nike, Timberland, Paris Gallery, Sketchers, Adidas, Massimo, and the Versace.\n\nDubai Outlet Mall is the biggest and most visited shopping mall for luxury and credence products or services in Dubai, where conspicuous buyers meet and compare product prices for efficient purchasing. The strategy of positioning store seems complex in this scenario, as such positioning means that Burberry might have ignored its competitors and decided to position itself with Dubai Outlet Mall.\n\nContrastingly, Burberry must have considered the market positioning since most luxury and fashion companies consider positioning their stores within accessible price segments. This also means that Burberry considered targeting the pool of consumers and the luxury reputation that the mall dominated within Dubai.\n\nMost interesting and important to understand, however, is the actual positioning of the Dubai Outlet Mall, where the Burberry luxury retail store operates. The location of the Dubai Outlet Mall is metropolitan since it is within the traditional deserted and desert-like Dubai sub-town, which is far away from the busy skyscrapers in Dubai City.\n\nAccording to Bastien and Kapferer (2013), the anti-marketing rules that luxury and fashion businesses use include concentrating on the brand attractiveness, dominating the client, communicating to the untargeted consumer groups, and going against the consumerism trend.\n\nJoy et al. (2012, p. 277) postulate that high-class consumers have anti-market stance that includes “consumer resistance, rebellion, boycotting, countercultural movements, and non-consumption traits.”\n\nJoy et al. (2012) notes that the conspicuous consumption theory and the anti-laws of marketing assume that luxury companies dwell on the stubborn notion that most high-class consumers are independent clients, who love uniqueness and credence rather than relying on the consumption trends of the majority consumers in the society.\n\nWithin the Middle East retail business environment, most of the marketing anti-laws, such as brand market positioning, art improvement, product flaws, are more dominant than others.\n\nMajor issues that are rising from the Middle East retail business regarding marketing is that Dubai and others are emerging economies that are increasingly witnessing economic expansion that has significantly changed the social fabric of the Emiratis (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013).\n\nIn Dubai, most retail businesses have breached the anti-laws that leading luxury brands use in their marketing, since product advertising is relatively high, product pricing is low, market communication is targeting main consumers, selling is the aim of marketers.\n\nBased on the perceptions of Bastien and Kapferer (2013) concerning consumer trends, the social fabric of the Emirati people is changing and the economic classes are reshaping and increasingly developing, with the majority of the conspicuous buyers being the youths, who are either low or middle-class individuals.\n\nIn emerging economies, business competition is high and marketing strategies are becoming necessary for product penetration and market dominance.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThe issues unfolding from the above information and the question that has arisen from the case of Burberry, there are numerous real-world challenges facing Burberry and its fashion and luxury brand.\n\nFour critical things that are emerging from the case of Burberry are consumer preference quandaries on luxury products, intellectual property rights, counterfeit regulations, and issues regarding business positioning and brand marketing.\n\nAs it is clear that the fashion and luxury industry intensively dwells under the principles of intellectual property in business, extra keenness in innovation must prevail to avoid signature check or trademark controversies (Bastien & Kapferer, 2013).\n\nWhether issues of trademark for Burberry are lawful or it is just a malevolent practice resulting from the Chinese capital behavior against international trade, the brand of Burberry is under difficulties.\n\nBurberry may potentially face marketplace censure and lose its reputation following its association with alleged imitation practices. According to Bastien and Kapferer (2013), quality of products associates with high status and is always a paramount consideration that conspicuous buyers look after during purchasing.\n\nSince conspicuous buyers will always have a propensity for quality, fashionable and flashy materials, their association with products perceived as counterfeits is almost impossible (Joy et al., 2012).\n\nAmong conspicuous buyers, the urge to search for exemplary, fashionable, and luxurious products from other industries may enhance purposely to avoid any connection with Burberry that currently may probably be having a tinted Chinese market image.\n\nIts historical positive market reputation may not be enough to maintain the skeptical consumers, so its future may depend on the efforts of the incumbent marketers who are to retain the image. Advantageously, there is enough history about the product branding of the Burberry Company and consumers with ample passed-on knowledge about the company will definitely maintain the rapport.\n\nMarketing techniques for luxury products come into interplay here, and if at all, consumers need less to understand such techniques, Burberry shall continue to suffice. A major quandary is the market position of Burberry in Chinese market.\n\nConsumer behavior is critical and is very important as it determines the present reputation and future survival of Burberry and its luxury marketplace in China. The reality is that conspicuous consumption is on luxury products and services where consumers tend to vary depending on their choices and purchasing power of the luxury product or service (Joy et al., 2012).\n\nAnti-consumerism is the behavior of most conspicuous buyers who have an anti-market stance and an attitude that is completely different from other groups of consumers, who believe on a multitude of consumers to consider a product or service as reliable.\n\nThe decisions of most conspicuous consumers are independent and rely on their inner desire and the instant purchasing power to buy a product or a service (Joy et al., 2012). Burberry may survive in the market based on its specialization on luxury goods that depend on high-class consumers, who act as the pacesetters for another medium and low-class product or service buyers.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe most difficult and challenging business marketing aspect for the marketers is the behavior of consumers and product markets that keep transforming. The case of Burberry losing its signature check trademark in the Chinese market involves interplay of several regional, consumerism and marketing factors that would influence its present reputation and future survival.\n\nThe theory of conspicuous consumption and the anti-laws of marketing in the case of Burberry significantly reveal a very crucial business marketing quandary where product marketing, product pricing, consumer relationship, business positioning, product designing seem to differ between businesses dealing with retail consumer products.\n\nApparently, conspicuous buyers tend to buy what they feel pleased with and not what pleases a community of consumers.\n\nSuch perceptions of the conspicuous consumption theory and the business marketing anti-laws give the company the survival probability in the Chinese luxury marketplace. Most worrying is that same anti-consumerism among conspicuous consumers, may make them develop a negative attitude against Burberry alleged imitation scandals.\n\nRecommendation\n\nBased on the critical analysis of the issues unfolding before the case of revoking the signature check trademark of Burberry and the interplay that comes from the conspicuous consumption theory and the business anti-laws, this report recommends the following for Burberry fashion and luxury company.\n\n  * Although higher pricing power is the privilege that most leading luxury brands enjoy, there is an urgent need to redefine its stand about marketing. Giving enormous discounts to trusted and reliable consumers would serve them an advantage.\n  * The notion of protection of consumers from non-clients as the marketing anti-laws suggest, and communicating with the potential buyers as opposed to the marketing anti-laws, would significantly boost the reputation of Burberry.\n  * A relentless diversification approach is essential to broaden the brand diversity and constant redesigning would help to pull a pool of potential consumers willing to acquire a variety of products in a single purchase and at the perceived discounted rates.\n\nReferences\n\nBastien, V., & Kapferer, N.

      "Future Leadership Pipeline Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Skills which future leaders require\n 2. How high potential leaders ought to be identified\n 3. Essential developmental experiences\n 4. Works Cited\n\nSkills which future leaders require\n\nFuture leaders of the organization will need to possess strategic management skills as this will be critical in top leadership situations. Instances of expansions through mergers or acquisition are becoming quite rampant. Alternatively, new opportunities to either change product design or introduce new ones are always lurking (Biggs 106). Therefore, one must know how to handle such scenarios through sound strategic decisions.\n\nA leader should also be familiar with financial skills as management of stock prices is critical in maintaining peak performance. Large organizations like Mattel reported dismal performance under a new leader because it lacked skills on how to handle Wall Street (Conger & Fulmer 81). To attain the mission and vision of the company, future leaders will require knowledge in marketing and public relations.\n\nThe firm’s survival is dependent on how much revenue it can generate, and management of the company image is imperative in this arena. For instance, a product scare may arise in a different part of the world (Charan 77). The leader needs to coordinate public relations efforts that would restore the company’s reputation. Failure to do so could lead to the loss of loyal consumers.\n\nOne must have operational skills that allow the person to manage product –related issues. Leaders who only have strategic and theoretical knowledge may make unwise decisions, which are unrelated to the goings-on on the ground. Having people skills is also critical for the future survival of the organization. Leaders need to know how to build consensus so as to cause the organization to move forward.\n\nPeople skills also entail knowing how to resolve conflicts, delegate duties as well as communicate effectively with individuals. Some of these skills can be taught formally through training classes. However, most of them require exposure to situations that involve them (Rothwell 32).\n\nThis is the point where leadership development becomes relevant. For leaders to achieve the vision and mission of the company, they need to undergo job rotations at junior level and then continue to do so at mid and higher levels so as to become competent.\n\nHow high potential leaders ought to be identified\n\nHigh potential leaders should be analyzed through a talent assessment system. This approach ought to involve the employee, his or her former and current supervisors, human resource management, as well as other senior level organizational leaders (Holincheck 18). All employees need to know that they are under continuous assessment.\n\nThe company needs to meet with these employees at least once a month to know the extent of their progress (Karaevli and Hall 77). Senior managers and the human resource team should meet with current and former supervisors of the employee so as to discuss their opportunities for growth.\n\nFor instance, they may decide that the assistant store manager for a certain branch lacks experience in store layouts. The person may be given a transfer to a branch that has perfected this practice so as to learn from it. Therefore having regular assessments of team members is a significant way of identifying potential leaders.\n\nThe company should identify its leaders starting with lynchpin positions. This will allow them to safeguard positions that are critical to the success of the organization.\n\nThey need to give potential candidates for this positions access to organizational information on their skills, competencies and potential for leadership. They can offer access through a secure database. The company needs to track ready candidates and focus on expanding the pool (Kur and Bunning 762).\n\nCurrently, the organization under consideration normally focuses on hierarchal positions within the company. For instance, if the supplies-and-logistics manager leaves the company or retires, senior management will consider his assistant to take up the task. If the assistant appears uninterested or lacks the right qualities, then the company will hire from outside. This approach is reactive and shortsighted.\n\nThe company only identifies leaders when there is a gap and someone needs to fill it. The company has missed out on promising candidates merely because it is so rigid in its approach.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of a long term focus on the matter implies that the company will not develop people sufficiently to handle the new responsibilities (Berke 55). Some of them may not be mentally prepared for such opportunities owing to the lack of strategic methods of leadership identification.\n\nEssential developmental experiences\n\nDevelopment needs to occur through classroom training in some instances. However, this should not be the sole focus of the experience; it will only work if the company combines it with a range of practical approaches. Leaders need certain technical skills that may assist them in performing their jobs, and this can only be learnt in formal classrooms (Caruso et. al. 44).\n\nA case in point is management of the supplies-and-logistics department. A leader will perform his job effectively if the person has some technical knowledge on logistics management. Some training experience in development is necessary.\n\nPerhaps one of the most significant developmental experiences is job rotations. Leaders have an opportunity to get past their comfort zones whenever they move from one position to the next.\n\nIt gives them a holistic view of the organization and causes them to understand how the different aspects of the company depend on each other (Charan et. al. 55). This approach also builds the skills base of employees as it augments their academic credentials with practical experience.\n\nSpecial assignments are also a critical method of carrying out leadership development. This method provides individuals with an opportunity to acquire managerial skills. It causes them to expand their strategic capabilities without hurting the company’s bottom line (Allio 22). Whenever by people who do not have much experience make strategic decisions, there is the risk that they might make the wrong ones.\n\nHowever, if senior leaders delegate a special assignment concerning a small joint venture is to an upcoming leader, then the company will not suffer tremendously if the venture underperforms. The risk is worth taking because it is small and provides so much experience on the part of the employee.\n\nFurthermore, special assignments reduce the need to wait for job vacancies before real leadership responsibility can be practiced (Britt 12). Even when opportunities for senior management are few, employees can still practice leadership skills through this approach\n\nLinchpin jobs in the clothing retail organization under consideration involve the operation of stores. The supplies-and-procurement position is a critical job; it determines the rate at which clothes enter the company and how effectively the firm meets customers’ needs. The store manager is also pivotal to the success of the company because he is in touch with clients on a regular basis.\n\nThe individual assesses their reactions to prices, sizes and designs. He is the bridge between senior management and consumers so he can give feedback to them whenever something critical arises. Another linchpin job is the sales and marketing position.\n\nThis person informs consumers about new designs, promotions and bonuses. Since the fashion industry is quite dynamic and competitive, one needs to be in constant communication with one’s consumers.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAllio, Robert. “Interview: Noel M.

      "Quartz Watches Strategic Management Report (Assessment)\n\nIntroduction\n\nEmerging technologies have been vital in improving operations of firms in the currently competitive marketplace. However, watch manufacturers have found themselves facing a new threat that they had not anticipated. There has been a shift in tastes and preferences when mobile phones were introduced to the market. Mobile phones have become almost a necessity in the society, and people currently prefer using it instead of watch to tell them time of the day.\n\nSome of the top brands in this industry moved with speed to change their marketing proposition in order to attract the market segment that was being lost due to the invention of mobile phones. These top watch manufacturers have found other sophisticated uses of watches other than telling time.\n\nHowever, some of the players in the market that were manufacturing simple wrist watches have found themselves in an awkward position as their products are currently considered meaningless in the market. One such firm is Quartz, a brand that is known for its low quality low cost wall clocks.\n\nIts wrist-watches are cheap, with minimal or no functionality beyond telling time. It may not survive the next decade if it continues selling the low-priced limited quality wrist watches. It must understand the market needs by increasing the functionality of its products. It must move from the dying watch industry into the fashion industry that has a huge potential.\n\nThis firm must find a way of competing with the giant brands in the fashion segment in order to survive. This paper will focuses on how Quartz can be repositioned to become a leading brand in luxury watches industry using some of the modern digital technologies.\n\nDiscussion\n\nCurrent brand positioning\n\nThe current brand positioning of Quartz Watch is outdated because it is still emphasizing on the function of the product as telling of time. People are no longer interested in this functionality given that their mobile phones do the same function besides being a communication gadget. Some of the new electronic appliances such as radios, television sets, and even cameras can tell time.\n\nIt would not be enough to convince the market that they need the watch on their wrist because its basic function can be performed by other products. This brand positioning was very appropriate when wrist watches were the primary gadgets that were used to determine time of the day.\n\nHowever, the world is changing due to changes in technology, but this brand has failed to adjust its positioning to reflect these changes. This led to a massive drop in the sale of this firm’s products. According to Dent (2011, p. 27), analogue watches have lost over 95% of their market share over the past fifteen years. It is even more worrying that this 5% that they currently hold is also moving away slowly and very steadily. This firm must transform its positioning if it expects to remain competitive in the market.\n\nFigure 1: Quartz Watch\n\nCompetitor set\n\nAccording to Rolnicki (1998, p. 49), competition in this industry has taken a whole new approach following the change in preference of the consumers. The figure below shows two of the leading competitors that this firm must outshine in order to achieve the market share that would make it attractive.\n\nFigure 2: Rolex Watch\n\nWhenever one is talking about the industry of wrist watches, Rolex is the first name that would be mentioned as the leading brand. This may be because of the social market niche that this firm occupies in the industry. Rolex is arguably the market leader in the luxury watch industry for the past several years.\n\nThis brand has been considered superior to its rivals because of its product offering. As Guirdham (1972, p. 72) notes, this brand offers more than just a wrist watch. The watch is an ornament made of precious metal to reflect its quality. The proposition that it brand has taken in the market is also very effective.\n\nThis product’s primary role is not to tell time. Telling of time is just an additional service it offers. Its primary role, as stated in its market proposition, is to demonstrate a sense of class. People who wear Rolex watch are identified with a higher social class in the society. As mentioned in their advertisement, you wear Rolex watch to show your class, just like other top brands in the market. It is more of jewelry than a watch.\n\nFigure 3: Omega Watch\n\nOmega is another top brand in this new market for wrist watches. Just like Rolex, Omega has positioned itself as an ornament, targeting male clients. In one of its famous advertisements, a gentleman is seen equating Omega to a golden necklaces and earrings that women wear to bring out their beauty (Lambert 1978, p. 32).\n\nThe message in the advert is very clear and it helps in bringing out the proposition of this watch in the market. Men cannot wear some of the ornaments that women do, but this does not mean that they do not deserve these ornaments. Omega wrist watch offers them this opportunity to have something that is masculine and attractive.\n\nThis has made the product very popular with men. Other major market players in the luxury watch industry include swatch, TAG heuer, and Rado. All these top brands have learnt the secret that the market is no longer interested with a time telling machine. This can be obtained from other gadgets. They have to go beyond this if they expect to remain relevant in the market.\n\nCurrent consumer profile\n\nConsumer profiling is an important marketing strategy that enables marketers to segment the market based on various demographic factors. As Wind and Mahajan (2001, p. 56) say, it is irrational for a firm to target the entire market. Different market segments behave differently. They have different preferences and purchasing powers. In this industry, Quartz must understand that it is no longer offering a time-telling machine to its customers.\n\nThis firm will now be offering a jewelry that must demonstrate a sense of class. It will be a symbol of status, and this must be demonstrated in the true value of its products. The current consumer profile that this firm targets include the poor and middle class members of the society who can afford cheap prices it is currently charging.\n\nHowever, it is unfortunate that this consumer class is always sensitive of the worth offered by their purchases. For instance, this group has come to realize that there is no value in having a simple watch and a mobile phone at the same time.\n\nThe service that was rendered by the watch can easily be offered by the mobile phones they have. For this reason, they would avoid buying watches and get this service from their phones. This is a way of saving to them. This is a clear indication that this group is no longer a desirable market segment to target. This current consumer that this firm targets do not value brand. They value quantity and pricing that is offered.\n\nQuartz was their favorite brand before the introduction of mobile phones because of its low prices. Currently, they do not need this product anymore, and this has led to a massive drop in sales for this company. This target market should be completely ignored by this firm in its long term strategies. They cannot afford the prices that luxurious products carry.\n\nRelevance of technology to the brand\n\nTechnology which helped in the creation of this product has been its main undoing because the firm failed to see the dynamism in the market. This brand is faced with the threat of extinction if it fails to define a new approach that it shall take to manage the market forces. The recent emergence of technology has not only been irrelevant to this brand, but also very disastrous. For instance, the major market segment for this product was the low income earners.\n\nThe watch had become so common that awareness creation was of little use. Those who did not know the product would easily know it once they were in the market. Given the fact that this segment would always be looking for cheaper products, Quartz would always be the ultimate choice because it was charging the lowest prices.\n\nThe management therefore, never made use of some of the modern technological tools such as the Social Media for the purpose of marketing their products. This must have been one of the main undoing of this brand, a mistake that it must correct now. In the planned new strategy, this brand must use online marketing to reach the new market segment. It must also embrace Social Media in its awareness campaigns. It is through this new approach that the management of this firm can achieve success in the current market.\n\nMarketing Campaign Plan\n\nIt is stated above that the brand Quartz will be introducing itself into the luxury watch industry as a way of remaining relevant in the market. This is a completely new industry for this brand, and it may take time to achieve success. According to Ryan and Jones (2012, p. 78), customers associate specific products with a given social class in the society. For instance, Mercedes Benz and BMW are brands of cars that are associated with the rich.\n\nOn the other hand, Toyota was introduced into the European market as a cheap and cost effective car for the low income earners in the society. When Toyota realized that it had ignored the rich who formed an attractive market segment, it came up with other sub-brands such as Prado. However, the tag ‘cheap’ car has never been erased from the mind of the consumers. This means that the rich do not consider Prado a superior car to Mercedes Benz or BMW.\n\nThe India motor company, Tata, was keen not to follow the footsteps of Toyota when targeting the rich in the society. When it bought Land Rover and Jaguar car brands, it retained their name and all other brand attributes. It continued producing its cheap Tata branded cars, but the Land Rover and Jaguar were produced under their original name. This worked magic. These two classy cars are very popular with the rich.\n\nThis is the strategy that this firm will employ when targeting the customers on the higher end of the social class. Fenwick and Wertime (2013, p. 86) says that it is always easy for luxury brands to attract lower end consumers. However, it is very challenging for firms that have been associated with lower end customer segment to target the rich. This is a challenge that must be overcome.\n\nAccording to Ryan and Jones (2011, p. 36), consumers will be more willing to try a new brand than to go for an existing brand that was serving a market segment of lower social class. Quartz will be forced to develop a new sub-brand and try to dissociate it from its main brand. The proposed brand name for this new product would be Digit Control.\n\nIt would be difficult to associate such a name with the known Quartz brand. The new product will carry this new brand name in the market. The digital marketing campaign plan for this new product and brand will be reflected in the 7 Ps of marketing as shown in the diagram below.\n\nFigure 4: 7 Ps of Marketing Model\n\nThis new product must be able to give the desired value in the current digital world. For instance, the watch should be able to receive a message sent from a mobile phone. Another desirable value would be its ability to monitor movements of a car within a given range. This is what the brand should stand for in the market.\n\nAs the name suggests, this new product will be more than a watch. It will be something like a remote control used to monitor and direct different machines. The pricing strategy should be completely different from the parent brand. The price should reflect the quality offered, and the segment that is targeted.\n\nThe place factor would play a very important role in this new product. It would be necessary to define new distribution models that reflect the new market segment that is targeted. The following innovating model may be appropriate when entering this new market with the new product.\n\nFigure 5: New distribution model\n\nAs shown in the above figure, the marketing team should identify the trends in the market in regard to distribution channels used by other major competitors. The team should then adopt emerging technologies in order to determine how they can be relevant in this distribution model.\n\nThe team should then scout for relevant technologies that would help achieve the desired results. Online marketing and Social Media marketing may be used as the digital options available for this new product in the market. When the marketing team is convinced that the new model is appropriate, they can then make the last move of entering and operating in this new market.\n\nThe promotional strategy of this new product should be an integration of online and offline channels. The Social Media such as Facebook, YouTube and Tweeter can be very instrumental in the promotional campaigns. Traditional promotional strategies such as television commercials and newspaper advertisement should also not be ignored when introducing the product to the market.\n\nPeople who will be engaged in various marketing strategies should be adequately trained in order to ensure that they deliver the desired output. Given that this product will be majorly marketed digitally, it may be important to define how the physical evidence would be presented to the customers. This may be in form of clear photos of the products being displayed demonstrating all its features, and how it is used. Such displays should be available in the company’s website and in the social media.\n\nThis is necessary because the consumers would want to understand why it would be prudent to stop buying Rolex, and instead buy Digit Control. This means that its uniqueness must be clearly elaborated in such displays (Hayes & Dredge 1998, p. 54). The process of delivering the product to the market should be conscious of the environmental dynamism.\n\nThe internal factors must be made compatible with the external factors. This means that if the firm embraces online marketing, it must be able to accept online payments from its customers. The process should be safe enough to protect its customers from cybercrime. This will help it define a new successful path in this new high end market.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt is clear from the discussion above that it may be challenging for a firm that was serving low income earners in the society to target the rich. The two social classes are completely different in their profile. However, Quartz has no choice but to target the rich in the society because its preferred market segment is no longer buying this product.\n\nTo achieve this, the firm will need to come up with a new product that meets the needs of the rich, and give it a new brand name that is not associated with the original brand. It must embrace the emerging technologies in manufacturing and distributing the new product in this new market.\n\nList of References\n\nDent, J 2011, Distribution channels: Understanding and managing channels to market , Kogan Page, London.\n\nFenwick, I & Wertime, K 2013, Digimarketing: The essential guide to new media and digital marketing , Wiley, Hoboken.\n\nGuirdham, M 1972, Marketing: The management of distribution channels , Pergamon Press, Oxford.\n\nHayes, J & Dredge, F 1998, Managing customer service , Gower, Hampshire.\n\nLambert, D 1978, The distribution channels decision, National Association of Accountants, New York.\n\nRolnicki, K 1998, Managing channels of distribution , AMACOM, New York.\n\nRyan, D & Jones, C 2011, The best digital marketing campaigns in the world: Mastering the art of customer engagement , Kogan Page, London.\n\nRyan, D & Jones, C 2012, Understanding digital marketing: Marketing strategies for engaging the digital generation , Kogan Page, Philadelphia.\n\nWind, Y & Mahajan, V 2001, Digital marketing: Global strategies from the world’s leading experts , Wiley, New York.\n",
      "History of Empires in Past and Modern World Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Empires\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nAll through history, there have always been reports of the growth and development of empires. The Egyptian, Roman and Greek empires are but some of the greatest empires during medieval times (Haspeslagh, 2010). During the 16 th and 17 th century, the Spanish empire was one of the strongest empires in the world.\n\nLater on, during the 19 th and 20 th century, the British Empire became the largest and strongest empire in the world (Hofstede and Hofstede, 2005).\n\nEven at the present day and time, there are empires. However, the composition and operation of the current empires are somewhat different to those of ancient times. This essay shall thus compare and contrast ancient and modern empires in order to determine their similarities and differences.\n\nEmpires\n\nContemporary empires differ a lot in the manner in which they are constituted and operated (Hobsbawm, 2003). The modern world has become vast and almost everything is integrated. As a result, each and every action is dependent on many other factors and its overall outcome has the chance of affecting almost all aspects of life.\n\nDuring the beginning of the 21 st century, for instance, SARS, a respiratory disease that originates in China affected transport, communication, international relations, the global market and the entire economy of the world (Hobsbawm, 2003). This is because the world that we are living in currently is mainly dependent on globalisation.\n\nThus, a lot of operations other than political matters are conducted across the physical boundaries of nations (Hofstede, 2009). This globalisation is mainly dependent on technological advancement. Thus, many nations have adopted technology, which has been incorporated even into the military to ensure that states are able to defend their citizens and interests effectively and efficiently.\n\nAt the present moment, USA is the largest empire in the world. However, to achieve this, it has used relatively different tactics as compared to ancient empires (Hofstede, 2001). However, the manner in which the United States Empire is organized is quite different as compared to that of ancient empires like the British Empire during the 20 th Century for instance.\n\nUSA is a vast nation comprising of individuals from different nationalities hence it has a universal purpose (Deusen et al, 2003). In addition, the empire comprises of a number of satellite states mainly in the west that have come into an alliance that has benefits from both ends thus it does not colonize its subjects.\n\nBritain on the other hand is a small nation that mainly comprises of individuals from similar culture and backgrounds hence the British Empire had a British purpose. Despite that the British Empire comprised of approximately a quarter of the globe during the 20 th century, all of these territories were actually acquired via colonization (Minkov, 2007).\n\nHowever, the British did not control the world to achieve political or military supremacy. Instead, they control the world for economic reasons in order to get raw materials and convert them into finished products that were sold to developing countries at exorbitant prices (Alessio, 2010). The US Empire on the other hand mainly works hard to protect its internal interests (Hobsbawm, 2003).\n\nDuring the 21 st century, the US Empire has worked hard to protect its industries from external competition (Asenova et al, 2002). In addition, the nation also strives for arms power especially during the cold war. Thus, these two empires were based on the concept of globalization but had different interest (Jovanovic, 2011).\n\nConclusion\n\nIn history, several empires have been in existence. However, the manner in which ancient and current empires are constituted is quite different.\n\nDespite the fact that both of these empires have been based on globalization, modern empires like the US Empire strive to achieve economic and military supremacy while ancient empires like the British Empire aimed at meeting their own interests that was economic sustainability. Therefore, both of these empires have some element of similarity and difference.\n\nReferences\n\nAlessio, D 2010, ‘Monopoly Imperialism: How Empires can be Bought or Leased’, Social Affairs Europe, Sage, London.\n\nAsenova, D, Beck, M, Akintoye, A, Hardcastle, C and Chinyio, E 2002, ‘Partnership, value for money and best value in pfi projects: obstacles and opportunities’, Public Policy and Administration , Vol. 17 No. 4, pp. 5-20.\n\nDeusen, C, Mueller, C, Hofstede, G and Charles, T 2002, ‘What goals do business leaders pursue?

      "Screening Mammography Cost-Effectiveness Beyond 65-Years Essay (Article Review)\n\nThe Mandelblatt et al.(2003) article examined the cost effectiveness of screening patients 65 years and older on the basis that such tests were warranted given the potential for sufficient treatments to be applied so as to prevent the spread of cancer and ensures that the patient live a longer life.\n\nSuch a position goes against the notion that elderly patients (65 years and older) should not be given mammogram screenings given the fact that their advanced ages means that should cancer be detected the various procedures that can be implemented to treat it (i.e. surgery or radiation therapy) may wind up killing the patient.\n\nIt must also be pointed out that other arguments which are on the opposite end of spectrum as that of Mandelblatt et al. (2003) point out that such elderly patients have a greater propensity to develop other illnesses/complications aside from cancer which may kill them earlier than the cancer itself.\n\nStudy Design\n\nThe study design was actually quite straight forward, Mandelblatt et al. (2003) performed a quantitative examination of statistical data which examined breast cancer screenings and evaluated the cost effectiveness of mammography for elderly patients.\n\nThis was done through an evaluation of the costs associated with the procedure, the possibility of treatment and the rate of survival for elderly patients that were detected with breast cancer. The study also examined how rates of detection (i.e. if a cancerous tumor is detected early on) factored heavily into the participation rates of older women who adhered to a set examination schedule for breast cancer detection (Mandelblatt et al., 2003)\n\nMethods Utilized\n\nIn order to prove the cost effectiveness of their assumptions, Mandelblatt et al. (2003) conducted a systemic review of various articles obtained from MEDLINE dating back from January 1989 to March 2002 in order to examine studies that related to breast cancer screenings and their cost effectiveness throughout various age groups. This was done through the use of various keyword search terms which pertained to the topic that they were analyzing.\n\nResults Interpretation\n\nThe practical significance of the findings of the study can be utilized as a means of helping to improve the current healthcare policy standpoints regarding cancer detection in older women by showing how screening patients who are 65 years or older can be cost effective given their survival rates and the fact that if the cancer can be detected early on it can be treated with a minimum amount of harm to the patient.\n\nStudy Strengths\n\nThe strength of this study lies in the sheer amount of data collected over the span of several months which enabled the researchers to effectively examine various aspects of their hypothesis. Through a combination of the data collected and the amount of academic research compiled, Mandelblatt et al. (2003) was able to present their data in an effective and easy to understand manner with an undeniable veracity in the results shown.\n\nStudy Limitations\n\nOne of the inherent limitations of the study is that it focused primarily on patients within the U.S. A broader approach would be necessary in order to determine the applicability of the methods utilized by the researchers on medical cases in other countries to see if the same level of cost effectiveness is present there or if it is primarily limited to the U.S. alone.\n\nReference\n\nMandelblatt, J., Teutsch, S.S., Hoerger, T., Siu, A.L., Atkins, D., Klein, J., et al.

      "Educational Strategies for the Fourth Grade English Language Arts Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Learning and applying the English Language Arts content\n 3. Preparing for the New York State English Language Arts test\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nFourth grade is the fourth year of school for students after kindergarten. Students in this grade have ages of between nine and ten years. Teachers must use effective educational strategies and instructional methods in teaching English Language Arts.\n\nThis discussion explores the strategies and methods of instruction that the teachers can use in order to ensure comprehension and application of the content by fourth grade students. The strategies used should also ensure that the students perform well in the New York State English Language Arts test. The teachers should also use teaching strategies that ensure that the New York English Learning Standards for fourth grade are met.\n\nLearning and applying the English Language Arts content\n\nEnglish Language Arts is supposed to polish the reading, writing, speaking, and listening skills of students. At each grade, there are certain expectations that students should meet in their mastery of the English language. At fourth grade, students have already learnt reading, writing, listening and speaking skills from earlier grades.\n\nThey use these skills to comprehend more complex texts. In order to sufficiently master English Language Arts in this grade, the students need to be exposed to opportunities that will enable them to have active involvement in reading, research, speaking, and thinking about relevant topics in their grade.\n\nFourth grade teachers should incorporate games and interesting activities in their lessons in order to capture the attention of the students and to engage them in learning activities. Various vocabulary and reading activities and games can help the students to grasp facts in a fun way (Moore and Moore 2004).\n\nAt fourth grade, students are supposed to improve their reading skills. At this stage, students are exposed to different kinds of literature, plays, poetry, speeches, drama, fables, folktales, short stories, myths, legends, and autobiographies, among others. The students can read these texts on their own without the teacher’s intervention. They use these literary texts to observe the use of words by authors to bring out a particular meaning, text structures, and the use of graphics to explain the text.\n\nThey read these texts and draw conclusions. They also learn to differentiate different authors’ points of view. Moreover, they learn about various figurative features used in writing hyperbole, personification, metaphors, among others. They also use these literary texts to understand the concepts of themes, character traits, and conflicts in the text. Teachers should enhance their students understanding of these texts by asking them to respond through dramatizing or paraphrasing them.\n\nWhile reading, fourth grade students enhance their understanding of difficult and ambiguous text through strategies like self-questioning methods.\n\nThe teachers should engage their fourth grade students in literature response activities that are challenging, for instance, asking them to relate with the characters or asking them what they think the outcome of the story would have been if something was done differently. This encourages the students to think critically about the texts and therefore, enhance their comprehension (Eggen and Kauchak 2008).\n\nTeachers also enhance their fourth grade students’ skills by exposing them to informational texts such as magazines, textbooks, tables, charts, recipes, maps, advertisements, and photographs, among others. The students are taught how to interpret this information and make conclusions.\n\nThey learn how to use features such as captions, print styles, chapter headings and subheadings appropriately in their writing. Fourth grade students also learn the use of structures like appendices, table of contents, index and glossary in their writing. Moreover, they learn how to construe graphic features like charts and tables. Students also learn to examine texts in order to get facts, opinions, and relationships. They can respond to these texts through writing and creative dramatization (Perullo 2003).\n\nStudents in fourth grade also learn how to build their vocabulary and analyze words in order to be able to read fluently. These students need strategies to develop vocabulary and be able to analyze and understand texts as the complexity of their texts increases. Students start to apply the complex vocabulary that they learn in their reading to their writing and speaking. They learn the meanings of complex words and words with more than one meaning.\n\nThe teachers should use strategies to enable the students to learn the use of euphemisms, affixes and roots and be able to apply them in their work. The students also learn what it means to connote and denote in text. Teachers can enhance their students’ reading skills through asking them to read texts and narratives aloud in class while checking for proper accuracy, fluency, pacing, and expression.\n\nThis will make sure that the students are actively engaged in learning and enable the teacher to identify the weak points in the students’ grammar. Correcting the students will make sure that they do not repeat the same mistakes again and therefore their grammar will be improved (Moore and Moore 2004).\n\nVocabulary building can be improved through creative ways like putting new words in word walls, vocabulary journals, and other devices in the classroom. Another strategy that teachers can use to build their students vocabulary is to use complex words as they teach and encourage the students to use those words in their writing and speech. In addition, teachers can encourage the students to read a wide variety of books because they are likely to encounter more new words.\n\nStudents should also practice reading various fourth grade level texts on their own in order to broaden their vocabulary. The more they read, the more they will come across many new words and when they try to find out their meanings, their vocabulary will be broadened (Eggen and Kauchak 2008).\n\nThe students in fourth grade also hone their writing skills in preparation for the English Language Arts test through various strategies. They need to develop writing which is well organized, clearly focused, well elaborated and with the proper application of conventions. The students continue to polish their writing skills through writing, revising and editing texts. They learn how to develop content, use conventions and organize their writing.\n\nTeachers should ensure that the students practice writing every day so as to sufficiently sharpen their writing skills. Enough practice will enhance their mastery of the English language and thus, they will be well prepared for the English language Arts test. The students improve their grammar by identifying and using verbs, prepositions, adverbs, and conjunctions in their writing.\n\nThey also practice the correct usage of commas, parenthesis, apostrophes, italics, quotation marks, capitalization, and underlining in their writing. Teachers should engage fourth grade students in activities like brainstorming and using literary models and graphic organizers to organize their ideas before they start writing. They should also practice writing proper paragraphs by stating the main idea and providing details to support it (Moore and Moore 2004)\n\nFourth grade students also learn how to develop focused writing using different words to ensure clarity. They incorporate various transitional features in their writing like conjunctions in order to maintain the flow of their ideas. They also learn to use revision strategies to edit and proofread their work to ensure clarity and eliminate any mistakes. They proof read to ensure the proper usage of commas, punctuations, capitalization, and spelling, among others.\n\nTeachers should train the students to use technology to develop their documents. They should show a mastery of the English language by writing compositions that are comprehensible and free from mistakes. Teachers can help sharpen the writing skills of their students by giving them assignments to write compositions describing certain experiences, events or objects.\n\nThe teacher should then mark the compositions and include corrections to the mistakes made so that the student can learn from them and write better next time. Writing skills can also be improved through strategies such as writing conferences, shared writing and peer response and writing. In shared writing the students and the teacher contribute their ideas and thoughts during the writing process to compose a text. In peer response and editing, students evaluate each other’s written work and give response and feedback.\n\nThis enables the students to learn from each other. The teacher is also able to gauge whether his/her students can identify writing mistakes made by the others and therefore determine their level of mastery of the English language (Perullo 2003).\n\nIn this grade, the students also learn how to write for different audiences and purposes. The teachers should teach them how to develop communications like blogs, emails, and flyers, among others. They also need to develop skills for reflective and descriptive types of writing.\n\nFourth grade students also need to learn how to create writings like narratives, biographies, songs, plays, poems, reports, among others. Students can improve their skills in writing different types of sentences through interesting activities and games that enable them to identify and differentiate between interrogative, imperative, declarative and exclamatory sentences. Games and activities can also be used to teach transitions to the students in order to improve their essay writing skills (Flood 2003).\n\nSpeaking and listening skills are also polished in fourth grade. Students learn to verbally communicate with different people through engagement in conversations with their fellow students and teachers. Their speech should have appropriate pitch, phrasing and accent. They learn how to engage in effective group interactions by speaking one person at a time instead of every one speaking at the same time. They should also learn the appropriate manner of speaking to different audiences.\n\nHaving proper verbal skills enables the students to participate effectively in group discussions. This enables them to learn new ideas from others. The students with good speaking skills are also able to participate in class by asking well-formulated questions and responding appropriately to questions asked. They are also able to seek others’ opinions about various issues and give their own opinion with reasons to support it.\n\nThe students are also able to respond to questions asked by the teacher and give proper clarifications and illustrations when asked to do so. They should be able to explain points in class while using examples, details, and proper accent, gestures and phrasing to enhance the clarity of the message. In addition, they should have proper presentation skills in order to be able to introduce a concept, explain it and conclude appropriately.\n\nTeachers can improve their’ students speaking skills through giving them assignments that require them to do oral presentations and recitations in class. This will enhance their speaking skills as well as build their confidence. The students can also hold dialogues or debates on controversial issues. This will ensure that the students air their opinions and support them.\n\nDuring the presentations, the teacher should ensure that the students are able to articulate the ideas about a certain experience or event and be able to catch the attention of the listeners. Having proper speaking skills enables the students to express themselves and share ideas with others, which is essential for successful learning (Eggen and Kauchak 2008).\n\nFourth grade students also learn how to access and use information for different purposes. They learn to access information from other sources like books, newspapers, magazines, dictionaries, atlases, thesauruses, encyclopedias and other materials. They paraphrase the information gathered from these sources and use it in their writing. They also learn to support the ideas in their writing through the use of charts, pictures, or diagrams.\n\nMoreover, they learn strategies for organizing their information such as categorization and classification. The students learn information gathering skills like using the internet to search for information and interviewing skills. They are able to correctly reference their work by listing the sources of their information.\n\nAt this grade students should be taught how to write from other sources of information by paraphrasing and providing references in order to distinguish between their ideas and those from other sources. They learn how to use other sources and technology to seek information (Flood 2003).\n\nPreparing for the New York State English Language Arts test\n\nThe English Language Arts test is done every year by students in fourth grade in New York. The purpose of this test is to determine how well the students have mastered the New York State Learning Standards of English and Language Arts at fourth grade.\n\nThe test also reviews the class level of the students and establishes whether it meets the standards of the No Child Left behind Act. This test consists of short fiction and non-fiction stories from which multiple-choice questions are derived. The students’ mastery of grammar, spelling, punctuation and reading comprehension are tested (Flood 2003).\n\nThere are four New York State English learning standards. In standard one, the students write, read, listen and speak in order to acquire, understand and transmit information, while in standard two they learn in order to be able to express themselves and respond to literary texts. In standard three, students read, write, listen and speak in order to be able to analyze and evaluate information, ideas and information critically. In standard for, the students learn in order to be able to interact effectively with different people (Whiting 2003).\n\nIn order for fourth grade students to meet the New York State English Learning Standards on the English Language Arts test and perform well, the teachers need to use several educational strategies and instructional methods. To effectively prepare students for this test, the teachers need to ensure that they read frequently to enhance their skills in fluency and reading comprehension. Teachers should provide entertaining books to the students to practice with.\n\nThe teachers can also give sample practice tests to the students in preparation for the English Language Arts test. These sample tests can be acquired from the New York State Department of Education. Doing sample tests enables the student to get an idea on the type of questions that will be asked and will therefore feel comfortable and well prepared for the test.\n\nThe teacher can also guide the students to explore websites that offer a variety of educational activities, games, worksheets, homework, reading help and puzzles to enhance the students’ mastery of the English language Arts in a fun way. This helps to catch their attention and also enhance their understanding. The students can also visit learning centers and libraries for additional knowledge on English Language Arts (Perullo 2003).\n\nIn order to efficiently prepare for the English Language Arts test, the students should polish their writing skills through thorough practice on correct spelling of words, correct use of punctuation marks and proper use of grammar. Writing activities and games can help the students to improve their writing skills in preparation for the test. Students should practice writing compositions on different events and experiences in order to have excellent writing skills by the time they sit for the English Language Arts test (Whiting 2003).\n\nText comprehension is important for the students to perform well in the English Language Arts test. Therefore, the students need to use various strategies in order to enhance their comprehension of texts. They should practice comparing and combining information from different sources.\n\nAs they read texts, they should use strategies like questioning, summarizing, supporting or disagreeing with the author’s opinion and clarifying ambiguities for further understanding of the text that they are reading or listening to. They should also practice rereading, cross-checking, and confirming to check their progress in comprehension of the text.\n\nThe students should also read various texts as they try to understand the deeper meaning and try to distinguish between the different techniques of writing used in various information sources. Teachers should ensure that the students are grasping the English language arts by administering tests that evaluate their mastery of various concepts.\n\nThey should test their vocabularies, administer comparison tests and excerpt questions to measure their reading comprehension, grammar, among others. Through these tests, the teacher will be able to find out the areas in which the students are experiencing difficulties, and therefore spend more time teaching them (Flood 2003).\n\nIn order to enhance their literary response and analysis, teachers should ensure that the students practice reading fourth grade level literature and answer questions that are derived from it. They should respond to the literary text through dramatizing, writing and oral presentations. They should try to understand the author’s purpose for writing the text and the main message being transmitted. After reading the text, the students should have a personal point of view and use evidence to support it (Moore and Moore 2004)\n\nOther strategies that teachers can use to ensure that their fourth grade students are well prepared for the English Language Arts test include using flash cards, question exchange and mock testing.\n\nFlash cards can be used to broaden the vocabulary mastery. Vocabularies relevant to fourth grade level students are written on the cards together with their definitions and students will engage in a group activity of trying to tell the meanings of the words. This activity will keep the students actively engaged and will enable them to retain the vocabularies learnt in their memory (Whiting 2003).\n\nQuestion exchange strategy is important in helping the students to understand the test questions. In this strategy, the students and the teacher will go through sample tests questions and learn how to interpret them correctly by paying attention to sentence structure, formatting and punctuation.\n\nThey should practice altering the questions to derive a different meaning and then try answering it. This exercise will enable the students to learn how to correctly interpret questions so that they can give the required answers. Failure to pay attention to the structure of the question might lead to misinterpretation and therefore giving the wrong answer (Whiting 2003).\n\nThe teachers should also use a mock testing strategy. This will ensure that the students get to understand the nature of the English language arts test and what is required of them to score good marks. The teacher should administer a mock test and mark it. Then he/she should review it with the students. This enables the students to gain confidence and get acquainted with the English Language Arts test setting (Whiting 2003).\n\nIn preparation for the English Language Arts test, fourth grade students should be taught lessons to help them identify suffixes and prefixes and learn the correct word meanings. Their vocabulary lessons should include antonyms, synonyms and homonyms. They should also be taught literature-based topics to broaden their vocabulary.\n\nThey also need to learn different nouns. Various games and activities can be incorporated in lesson plans to enable the students to learn in an enjoyable and engaging environment. For instance, activities in which a teacher reads out a text and asks the students to write a list of nouns that they hear. The student who writes the longest list of nouns wins. This enables the students to grasp concepts more easily and remember them during the test (Eggen and Kauchak 2008).\n\nFor students to be fluent readers they need to be able to automatically recognize words, read with expression, break up the sentence into meaningful parts, change the emphasis and tone where required and incorporate pauses at the middle and end of sentences.\n\nTo ensure the students master fluency, teachers should engage them in activities that expose them to words, letters and letter combinations. These activities and games, such as tracing, writing and copying words should help them form a connection between auditory and visual representations (Whiting 2003).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe English language Arts test is very important for fourth graders and therefore, they should be well prepared for it. This test evaluates the mastery of the English language at this level.\n\nTeachers should therefore use appropriate strategies and methods of instruction in teaching this course in order to ensure that the fourth graders understand the content and are able to apply it in their English Language Arts test. Several teaching strategies and instructional methods such as incorporating games and fun activities in the lesson plan can go along way in catching the attention of the students as well as enhancing their comprehension of the content.\n\nReference List\n\nEggen, P., and Kauchak, D.

      "Health Information Technology Adoption Annotated Bibliography\n\nKijsanayotin, B., Pannarunothai, S., & Speedie, S. (2008). Factors influencing health information technology adoption in Thailand’s community health centers: Applying the UTAUT model. International Journal of Medical Informatics, 78 (2009), 404–416.\n\nIn this article, authors reported findings of a research conducted in Thailand. The study sought to explain factors that influence adoption and use of health information technology (IT) in Thailand’s community health centers. The research used UTAUT theoretical model to test the relationship between data variables.\n\nThe investigators used observational study design. A stratified random sample representing all the provinces was selected (1607 community health centers). Data was collected using self-administered questionnaires. Each respondent was expected to fill a questionnaire and either mail it back to the researchers or hand it in through field research assistants.\n\nThe authors did an extensive literature review. Majority of the articles cited by the researchers had already been published in developed countries. However, the articles were relevant to this research which was conducted in a developing country.\n\nResults showed that adoption and use of information technology in the Health sector was influenced by utility of information technology (performance expectancy), level of difficulty, influence by others, and liberty to choose. Performance expectancy was the best predictor as compared to other variables.\n\nOther factors that influenced use of IT in community health centers included past experience, intention to use the system, and institutional support system. Past experience exerted the strongest effect.\n\nPersonnel who had used an IT system before were likely to accept and use information technology to manage health information. Facilitating factors exerted a significant effect. The researchers concluded by stating that the study would influence adoption of IT in developing countries.\n\nThe article relates to concepts in the course in various ways. Adoption and utilization of technology depend on factors similar to those identified in the article. The concepts include perception of usefulness, level of difficulty, opinion of others, and additional support.\n\nPeople are likely to adopt and utilize technology if they can attach some value to it. Level of difficulty and additional support are by far the greatest predictors of adoption and use. Additional support may involve retraining personnel.\n\nUTAUT theoretical framework has been used extensively by commercial organizations to predict adoption and use of information technology. This survey was the first to apply UTAUT model in the health sector. However, the methodology had to be modified. Previous predictions were restricted to organizations.\n\nThe study targeted individual respondents. Factors influencing acceptance and use of information technology were studied. The results showed no variation in the manner in which people and organizations utilize technology. The methodology employed in this research was appropriate. Random sampling ensured that all health personnel had an equal chance of being selected to take part in the study.\n\nThe authors did not point out limitations they encountered. Limitations could have affected the quality of data. When limitations are not reported, it creates an impression that the information is not credible. The researchers concluded by suggesting that UTAUT is an appropriate model for the developing world.\n\nA single study is not enough to make such a conclusion. In addition, the aim of the study was to identify factors that influenced acceptance and adoption of information technology. The researchers should have concluded by recommending further research to test their assumptions.\n\nReference\n\nKijsanayotin, B., Pannarunothai, S., & Speedie, S. (2008).

      "Service organisation: Duke Children’s Hospital Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe reason for conducting this research is to understand how service organisations embrace Customer Service Management (CSM). My research topic is customer service management in service organisations. CSM covers customer satisfaction, service quality, brand loyalty, relationship management, process, people and physical evidence. The service organisation which is under study in this research is Duke Children’s Hospital.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nRelationships Management\n\nAn organisation is a group of people who work together with coordinated efforts to achieve certain objectives or goals. Organisational goals and objectives are of various categories and it is this variation of the goals and objectives which classify organisations into three main categories namely profit making; service based and social responsibility based organisations.\n\nManagement is about planning, coordinating and controlling organisational resources so as to facilitate the achievement of organisational goals and objectives in an efficient and effective manner.\n\nThe nature of management therefore only allows for the top leadership of an organisation to act as the drivers of the organisation in a way which facilitates the organisation to achieve its goals and objectives, including the management of organisational change (Murray, Poole & Jones, 2006, pp.45-69).\n\nRelationship management is the coordination of the interactions which take place within an organisational setting. The aim of relationship management is to foster excellent communication based on mutual understanding.\n\nRelationship management also aims at ensuring that employees of an organisation relate with each other well. It aims at minimizing any friction between employees, which may lead to poor service delivery (Karimi, Somers & Gupta, 2001).\n\nOrganisations need to manage the relationships especially between the upper level management and the lower level or junior employees. Organisations which aspire to attain their objectives usually follow the human relations approach to relationship management as opposed to the scientific approach, which sees employees as tools to be managed to produce desired outcomes.\n\nThe human relations approach to relationship management on the other hand views employees as social beings with feelings, and therefore the need of handling them with courtesy (David,1989),\n\nCustomer Satisfaction\n\nThis entails providing goods and services which match customers’ needs and purchasing power. Customer satisfaction is also the ability of an organisation to meet the needs of the customers. Customer satisfaction involves providing goods and services of high quality in an efficient manner.\n\nIt also involves the pricing of the goods and services in a manner which is friendly to the customers. Customers derive their satisfaction from a product or a service of if the product or service is worth the amount of money the customers pays for the same (Cheung & Lee, 2003).\n\nBrand Loyalty\n\nA brand is a qualifying aspect of a product or service. Organisations brand their products and services with a view of capturing the attention of potential customers. Brand loyalty refers to the extent to which customers have passion and interest in a particular product or service due to the way the product or service is branded (Tompkins, 1998).\n\nHigh brand loyalty means that the customers prefer that product or service over all the others. Low brand loyalty means that the passion of customers in a particular product or service is not guaranteed and the customers may be easily swayed to purchasing other products or services.\n\nService Quality\n\nThis is the provision of high quality services by an organisation. Focusing on quality aims at ensuring that customers get the value of their money in any service provided to them.\n\nService quality is related to an organisational overall strategy in that high quality goods and services would enables an organisation increase its customer satisfaction. This leads to increase in sales and enables the organisation to meet its financial objective of expanding to new markets (Carraher, 2005).\n\nProcess\n\nThis refers to the activities which take place in the provision of services. Good processes are the ones which focus on quality as well as those which allow for the efficient utilization of resources by an organisation. Good processes are not complex but are easy to adopt and change depending on the situation (Carraher, 2005).\n\nProcesses include things like administration, type of resources used either manual or technological, monitoring and evaluation and feedback analysis. Good processes enable organisations to not only satisfy the customers but also create a good working environment for the employees, thus maximizing their productivity (Michael & Ferrell, 1996).\n\nPeople\n\nIn an organisational context, people are taken to mean employees and the stakeholders of an organisation. An organisation must ensure that it puts in place a good public relations strategy so that it can gain good reputation both among the employees and the stakeholders.\n\nOrganisations should labour to ensure fair employee practice as well as corporate social responsibility to foster its relationship with its external environment (Parasuraman & valerie, 1985).\n\nPhysical Evidence\n\nThis refers to verifiable indicators of an organisational functions and processes. Organisations operate in real world not in virtual space and to this regard; there must be an evidence of the success of the organisations.\n\nSome of indicators of organisational success include growth and expansion, customer satisfaction, increased customer base, good reputation of an organisation as well as other indicators such as mergers and acquisition, and internationalization of an organisation (Lee, 1996).\n\nMethodology\n\nResearch involves collection of data, facts and information for various social, political and economic purposes. In collection of data, various research designs are utilised. Qualitative method uses samples of the population to represent the whole. Data collected is non-numerical and descriptive in nature.\n\nQuantitative research method on the other hand is concerned with quantification of social phenomena, and usually deals with large or whole populations. Data is collected in statistical or numerical form. Qualitative and quantitative research designs are sometimes used as a continuum in that they complement each other (Newman & Benz, 1998).\n\nIn this research, the methodology used was that of interviewing. Apart from interviewing, I also read about the organisation’s customer service management practices in its website.\n\nInterviews involved the mailing of questionnaires to the Dukes’ Children’s Hospital managers through their email addresses. The questionnaires were designed so as to get the views of the managers in regards to the issues of customer service management in their organisation.\n\nThe interview comprised ten heads of operations, either current or former employees of the hospital located in various locations or branches of the hospital. Their names and contacts were obtained from the company’s employee’s data base. After getting the names and their contacts, they were requested to participate in the interview at their will, which they consented to.\n\nThey were explained about the purpose of the interview and assured that the information was to remain confidential, and would not be used to accord or deny them any privileges as employees or former employees of the organisation. They were also guaranteed anonymity in the analysis of the information which they gave.\n\nThis was done so as to ensure that they participated in the interview without any form of biases. A copy of the questionnaire attached as an appendix.\n\nLimitations of the methodology\n\nOne limitation of the method was that some questions were retuned unanswered, especially because the participants did not understand them. This was because there was nobody to give clarifications on the questions and also to probe to get the meaning of the participants.\n\nThe other limitation was that some of the participants did not receive the interview because it went to the spam instead of the inbox. Due to this, three out of ten participants did not actually participate in the interview. This compromised the validity and reliability of the survey.\n\nHow Dukes children’s hospital has implemented CSM\n\nFrom the data obtained from the interviews, it emerged that the internal business process which Duke Children’s hospital focused on in the development of the balanced scorecard was quality improvement.\n\nThis was aimed at ensuring that the hospital improved its quality of performance; so as to improve the stakeholder relationship. One of the measures taken was to introduce the use of technology in its services, especially in data and information management in the organisation.\n\nThe organisation introduced a system which linked the payers and the other staff who dealt with the clients directly. The system involved the generation of an automated data base for all the clients. This data base comprised of information for all the clients including their date of birth, type of service they received, their diagnosis, policy number and the physician who attended them.\n\nThe system was designed in a manner that after the processing of client’s details, they were faxed directly to the payers, who faxed them back immediately together with the notification number. The aim was to increase the number of notifications per hour and reduce the time for each notification.\n\nAnother process was the alignment of the clinicians and the administrators, to enable them work on a single platform of enabling the organisation attain its mission and vision.\n\nTheir alignment however led to a gap in communication between them, especially in regards to the issue of how to implement the balanced scorecard whereby the administrators felt that they still had a bigger say in its implementation than the other staff; but with time, the gap was eventually bridged through sharing information on how best to implement the balanced scorecard and the role to be played by each and every employee of the organisation.\n\nIn order to improve on quality, the organisation introduced a training system, which was employee tailored. There were training for the nurses, the clinicians and the administrators on how to improve on quality.\n\nEach of them was trained on service delivery as well as on team work and how to relate well with others in the workplace. The overall objective was to create an organisational culture which enhanced learning from each other so as to improve the quality of services offered by the organisation.\n\nThe research also discovered that the organisation was using an automated system which enhanced the efficiency of the organisation by reducing the rate of denial by the payer from 15% to 1% or less. By so doing, the organisation increased its efficiency. The patients were also happy with the idea because it reduced the time they spend before being attended to.\n\nThis led to an increase in customer satisfaction of 4.7, up from 4.3 on a 5.0 scale. The hospital also reduced its cost per case form $14, 889 in 1996 to $ 10,500 in the year 2000. The alignment of the administrators and the clinicians also led to the increase in the net margin from -$11 million in 1996 to+$4 million in the year 2000.\n\nThe training of the staff (the nursing unit) improved their performance from 71% in 1996 to 100% in the year 2000. The creation of an organisational culture which enhanced learning improved the staff satisfaction from 1.5 in 1996 to 4.0 on a scale of 5.0 in the year 2000.\n\nThis staff satisfaction was accompanied by improved staff performance, which led to a decline in the rate of readmission of patients from 7% in 1996 to 3% in 2000 (Niven, 2006).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe paper was a research based on the topic of customer service management in service organisations. The organisation which the research was based on is Dukes children hospital. Some of the customer service management concepts discussed include relationship management, service quality, people, and process among others. The research used electronic questionnaires emailed to the staff of the hospital.\n\nThe analysis of the information indicates that the hospital has managed to effectively enhance customer service management, especially in the area of efficiency and quality improvement. However, the organisation needs to do a lot to boost its relationship with the social environment because nothing it has done as far as corporate social responsibility is concerned.\n\nReference List\n\nCarraher, S.

      "Business Ethics: Fleming Companies, Inc. Essay\n\nThe customer is the most important stakeholder of any company. Companies exist to serve the needs of their customers. Therefore, it is vital for a company to ensure that it does not damage its relationship with the customers. Disregarding the wishes of customers would result in the collapse of a company (Thompson, et al. 2011).\n\nThis is what happened to Fleming Companies, which was the largest distributor of consumer-packaged goods in the US. The company habitually provided wrong billing to its customers. The company did not stop the malpractice despite regular complaints from customers.\n\nFleming habitually engaged in accounting malpractice to boost its margin and restore its financial profitability. Senior executives of the company supported the company’s engagement in unethical conduct.\n\nAs an executive of the company during that period when it engaged in unethical conduct, I would have claimed that problems in the accounting systems were the major reasons why the company provided wrong billing to its customers. I would have claimed that the company was not defrauding its customers since it was willing to repay money that it owed customers due to wrong billing.\n\nFleming used its muscle unfairly to engage in unethical activities. The company realized that it was a vital component in the supply chain of its customers. It was the major link between the suppliers and their customers. Therefore, damaging the relationship between the company and the suppliers would have limited the ability of the suppliers to access their customers.\n\nFleming jeopardized the activities of its suppliers by engaging in unethical conduct. Fleming’s malpractices limited the ability of its suppliers to keep accurate financial records. Keeping accurate financial records enables companies to know their real financial position (Nikolai, Bazley & Jones, 2009).\n\nAs a manufacturer who sold its products through Fleming during the period when the company was engaging in unethical conduct, I would have looked for another distributor to handle my products. This was the main reason why Fleming engaged in unethical activities regularly.\n\nIn addition, the company was unwilling to stop engaging in unethical activities despite complaints from customers. By doing so, Fleming disregarded the wishes of its customers. Fleming’s unethical conduct made it difficult for manufacturers to determine the integrity of Fleming’s billings.\n\nThe unethical conduct necessitated suppliers to countercheck billings from Fleming. This was an expensive and time-consuming activity. Therefore, looking for an alternative distributor was the best option for manufacturers who distributed their products through Fleming.\n\nAs a Fleming shareholder during the period when the company engaged in unethical conduct, I would not have been pleased with the turnaround strategy that the company was employing. This is due to the fact that the strategy breached the trust that customers had on the company. Fleming disregarded the fact that customer loyalty was the main factor that led to the prosperity of the company.\n\nThe unethical behavior of the company tarnished the image and reputation of the company (Thomson, et al., 2011). Therefore, I would have sold my shares before the discovery of this unethical practice. Discovery of the unethical practice threatened the existence of the company. Loss of the trust that customers had on the company would have resulted in massive exodus of customers from the company.\n\nUnfortunately, this is what happened after the Wall Street Journal reported the company’s unethical conduct. Therefore, selling my shares before this happend would enable me to safeguard my investment.\n\nUnethical practice led to the ultimate collapse of the Fleming companies. This is despite having acquired more than 100 new customers. Fleming’s case highlights the importance of customer loyalty in the competitiveness of a company. A company should not take advantage of its size to violate the wishes of its customers.\n\nReferences\n\nNikolai, L. A., Bazley, J.D. & Jones, J.P. (2009). Intermediate accounting .

      "What are Some of the Ways in which Modern Culture is “Fatalistic?” Essay\n\nThere are numerous ways through which the modern culture is ‘fatalistic’. Observably, Greeks had a unique perception on gods. For example, they viewed them to be unpredictable in their roles.\n\nAn analytical examination of these ancient Greeks together with their beliefs indicates a notable disparity with the present day practices. Humanistic perception, predominantly present within the globalized world, resembles the Greeks’ convictions on man’s role within the cosmos.\n\nWithin the current society, several individuals have replaced the ancient Greek’s beliefs and gods with politicians. Particularly, the waves approach has played a critical role in the transformation and disregard of the ancient Greeks’ critical perception of events and actions.\n\nPoliticians have presently deviated from the ancient norms of the Greek. Thus, most of them assume risky and fallacious initiatives or ideological opinions. These have misled the general society and even the rule of law.\n\nConcurrently, fatalities are observable in the gross mistakes eminent within the political arena and governance systems. For instance, most politicians have accented to and passed legal bills that are potentially detrimental.\n\nPresently, such undertakings have been conducted without thorough examination or scrutiny. As a result, a lot of fatalities have been committed.\n\nSimilarly, in comparison to the Zeus’ potential to transform the lives of several individuals through his daily choices in the rule of the ancient Greek, the bills passed fallaciously have this capacity also.\n\nObservably, the competency of Zeus to make choices depending on his mood is an action that immensely manipulated the lives of the normal Greeks. This is similar to any present bill.\n\nFor instance, in America, whenever the Congress’s mood rests on passing any bill and welcome the aftermaths minus thorough initial research, it remains a fatalistic occurrence. In such contexts, even their point of view becomes largely fatalistic.\n\nThe present general society conducts its elections with utmost good faith and objective. In such actions, the ambition and chief objectives of the general populace is to trust the elected leaders.\n\nLeaders are disallowed to alter state laws in order to fulfill their individual interests. Conversely, most of these leaders operate capriciously; opting to fulfill their personal interests as well as those their mates within the general authority.\n\nThis situation remains observably similar to the practices within the ancient Greek. For instance, Zeus tried to please personal interests and those of other colleagues within the authority. The general society presently lives in the state of complacency.\n\nAs observed, most persons disregard the rule of law reputed from the government. Evidently, this disregard of the government’s supremacy in the exercise of authority is depicted within the ancient Greeks’ culture.\n\nThe presence and acceptance of several gods within the ancient Greek is also remarkably depicted in the present society. This is because the present society welcomes and embodies all kinds of religions and worships.\n\nHowever, the general acceptance of these diverse religions provides the present society with credence. Consequently, this subjects Christians to fatalistic lives.\n\nChristians’ study of distinct types of religion within the present society enables them to comprehend various belief systems. It is notable that such endeavors never transform their minds, souls, or beliefs.\n\nHowever, the present general society has condemned Christians’ convictions. For many Christians, the perception that the general community condemns their convictions is their subjection to fatalistic mentality deeply rooted within their culture.\n",
      "InBev and Anheuser-Busch Case Case Study\n\nCompany Description\n\nInBev NV was formed after a merger between AmBev, the world’s fifth largest brewer, and Interbrew, the world’s third largest brewer, in 2004 (Inkpen 121). InBev has its headquarters in Leuven, Belgium. It has a strong presence in Europe, Latin America, North America and Asia.\n\nIt employed about 94,000 people and operated in more than 30 countries across Europe, Americas as well as Asia Pacific in 2008 (Inkpen 121). The company had 112 plants worldwide (Inkpen 123). In 2007, the company earned €14.43 billion revenues registering a net profit of €3.048 billion.\n\nInBev had over 200 brands which were categorized into different market segments. It categorized its segmented brands into; global brands, which were distributed in 80-100 countries; Multicountry brands, distributed in 30-60 countries; and local brands, which were distributed in their countries of production.\n\nIt also segmented its market into seven zones; North America, Latin America North and Latin South America, Western Europe, Central and Eastern Europe, Asia Pacific, and lastly, the Global Export and Holdings.\n\nInBev has a unique corporate culture that is based on minimizing costs while modernizing production in addition to streamlining its extensive product line. Inkpen (123) reports that InBev’s corporate culture involves cutting travel budgets, using zero-based budgeting as well as eliminating executive dining rooms by setting up open-plan offices. As a result, it does not own corporate jets. Again, compensation to its staff is tied to performance rather than rank (Inkpen 123).\n\nProblem definition\n\nInBev’s aim is to increase its growth and market presence through mergers and acquisitions as it upholds its competitive strategy to achieving sustainability; however, the question remains as to whether InBev its proposed synergies would enhance the merger integration so as to benefit the two companies owing to their different corporate culture.\n\nWho are the actors?\n\nCarlos Brito, InBev’s President and Chief Executive, together with other board members at InBev have agreed on a merger with the Anheuser-Busch board members so as to establish a stronger as well as more competitive global company (Inkpen 128).\n\nAnheuser-Busch’s board is headed by August Busch IV, who is the company’s President and Chief Executive. Other actors involved in the merger process include the management teams of both companies, independent financial advisers for both companies as well as financial institutions providing financing required in sealing the deal.\n\nWhat is the strategy choice?\n\nInBev’s expansion strategy in this case is to form a merger with Anheuser-Busch through a tender offer acquisition. In the deal, InBev plans to make an acquisition by buying Anheuser-Bush’s voting stock. In a tender offer, the bidding company (in this case InBev) makes a direct offer to the company’s shareholders to purchase their shares, and as a result, acquires their voting rights.\n\nStrategic rationale for the acquisition\n\nUnder this merger, InBev aims to become a global leader in the brewery industry. The merger would allow it achieve a stronger as well as more competitive international company. It would enable it expand its Budwiser globally and to use Anheuser-Busch established marketing channels to expand its brands internationally.\n\nInkpen (128) reports that InBev will be able to exploit Anheuser-Busch’s wholesalers as well as its three-tier distribution system. In addition, it will also be able to operate in the communities/countries where Anheuser-Busch operates.\n\nWhat is Anheuser-Busch worth?\n\nThe last annual financial statement to be presented to the public at the end of the 2007 fiscal year, Anheuser-Busch had an asset value of $17.155 having achieved retained earnings of $18.715 billion. The price of its closing stock at the end of the financial period was $52.34 per share.\n\nThe sources of synergies\n\nInkpen (127) reports that the acquisition Anheuser-Busch would lead to an estimated yearly net sales of about $36 billion. In the 2007 fiscal year, Anheuser-Busch collected $18.989 billion from sales while InBev had pre-takeover sales of $22.5 billion, and this was expected to increase due to improved operating efficiencies resulting from cost reductions.\n\nInkpen (129) reports that synergies will come from the sale of the company’s non-core assets as well from adoption of more efficient supply chain management.\n\nAgain, InBev’s value price would increase since the net current value of future cash flows expected to be generated by Anheuser-Busch under its old management team (since Anheuser-Busch had maintained its management team and board); and again, the cost of the bid is higher than the bid price.\n\nUsing Black-Scholes model, the hostile bid premium was found to be $11.254/share meaning that the cost of the estimates exceeded $11.25/share (Hancock 5). This meant that InBev had to increase its bid price to above $69.6/per share to promote an increase in its value (Hancock 6).\n\nThus, by buying the voting stock at $70/share, InBev’s shareholders would benefit from the increase in the company’s value. Again, the variance of both companies’ stock returns are low, with Anheuser-Busch having a variance of 0.000204 while that of InBev was estimated to be 0.0005853 (Hancock 7).\n\nThe correlation of their stock returns is also 0.101736 which is lower than the projected value since they both operate in the same industry (Hancock 7). The figures suggest that InBev’s shareholders will benefit from diversification benefits (Hancock 7).\n\nWhat constraint(s) are present?\n\nAnheuser-Busch-InBev faces several merger integration issues.\n\nThe two companies have different corporate cultures which may threaten the smooth integration into one company. While InBev’s corporate culture is based on cost cutting as well as incentive-based compensation programs (Inkpen 124), Anheuser-Busch’s corporate culture emphasizes on high salaries, bonuses and gifts, participation in community activities, as well as, executive transport to employees, and offices.\n\nDuring the acquisition, it was agreed that the board members and the management team of Anheuser-Busch-InBev are to come from both companies. This means that developing a common business strategy could be a major challenge since Anheuser-Busch is not used to the extreme cost cutting strategies that InBev applies.\n\nPossible solutions\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev has to focus on cutting costs by adopting a more efficient supply chain management without laying off employees at Anheuser-Busch. Supplier innovation will be its key strength to penetrating the markets. Again, it should also implement the sale of its non-core assets.\n\nIt should strategize on how to reduce a certain level of its non-material as well as non-product costs per year so as to ensure continued success. These would help achieve operating efficiencies which will in turn help in achieving cost reductions.\n\nIn addition, bonuses should be maintained, but they should be tied to meeting targets. The company can also strengthen its products diversification to gain more competitive advantage in its regions of operation. Finally, the company may also consider reducing costs by engaging in mass production of its global and multicountry products by designating specific plants for mass production.\n\nConclusion\n\nInBev adopted a tender offer acquisition to merge with Anheuser-Busch. Despite their different corporate cultures, including members from the two organizations into the board as well as the management team would help steer the company to greater success.\n\nMembers from each side have a better understanding of the industry and how the different corporate cultures affect the integration process. This means that they can always find a common way forward that benefits both companies.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nHancock, David. How Much Is Too Much? The Case of the Anheuser-Busch INBEV Takeover.

      "The Individual and Game Theory Criticisms and the Evolutionary Theory Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe individual choice/game theory uses a very strict definition of individual rationality. On the contrary, the evolutionary game theory does not make any rationality assumptions. In this paper, the focus is going to be on commenting on whether the evolutionary approach is successful in addressing the criticism that, in neoclassical economics, the profile of the rational individual is not very realistic.\n\nEvolutionary Theory Provides a Satisfactory Answer to the Criticism\n\nIn my view, the evolutionary game theory, which is a dynamic process, possibly offers the coordination mechanism which aligns beliefs with behaviour. It brings the game theory closer to economics by looking at economics as the product of an adjustment process instead of being looked at as a thing that simply springs in to existence.\n\nThe classical game theory, which was a standard theory until the 1980s, is set up on the assumptions of ideal rationality as well as common knowledge (Hodgson 2007). However, it is without a doubt that not only an assumption is made that each individual makes an effort to maximize utility, there is also need to make an assumption of common knowledge of rationality and consistently aligned beliefs (Griine-Yanoff and Lehtinen 2010).\n\nAccording to my judgement, the evolutionary theory has offered some sort of solution to problems that are associated with the classical game theory. By making the relaxation of the perfect rationality assumption legitimate, the revolutionary turn overcame the hurdle which the refinement programme could not overcome.\n\nThe issue was in the fact that “classical game theory facilitated generation of predictions were disconfirmed by evidence” (Sugden 2001, p.116). Economists had interest in game theory for the reason that they had hopes of utilizing it in explaining the actions of the “real economic agents”. Therefore, in the setting, there was an assumption that ‘real economic agents’ like the perfectly rational players of the theory, must possess some explanatory strength.\n\nHowever, the evolutionary theory is not confined to prescribed actions of ‘ideal’ agents as it focuses on the agents’ behaviour which is predetermined by successful actions of other agents.\n\nIn other words, the evolutionary theory focuses on specific behavioural patterns which have already been checked and proved to be successful. Therefore, economists do not try to work out some patterns on the basis of certain assumptions. The economists can have more specific material. The evolutionary approach offers particular settings and particular examples to operate on.\n\nOne of the strengths of the evolutionary game theory is that it does not focus on individuals but on the strategies themselves. It is those strategies that are successful themselves which attract the agents and the individuals do not consciously make choices.\n\nIt is only that with time, in one way or the other, they learn to make choices of strategies which, in regard to expected utility, are better for them. This might come about for the reason that “individuals learn from past play, they copy the behaviours of other players that are successful, or they adapt” (Patokos 2011, p.3).\n\nTherefore, the evolutionary theory addresses limitations of the game theory which is too ‘theoretical’. The evolutionary theory leaves behind certain theoretical notions like rationality to focus on more specific points like strategies used by the agents.\n\nThe individual choice/game theory offers models which can hardly fit the modern (i.e. real) world, whereas the evolutionary theory provides in-depth analysis of behavioural patterns and various strategies developed by agents. In simple terms, instead of theorizing (which is the case with game theory), the evolutionary theory is more concerned with analysis of situations which are true to life.\n\nIt is possible to claim that the evolutionary theory addresses the criticism that the neoclassical approach is unrealistic. The evolutionary approach verifies that it is possible to work out specific strategies which can be used in real life settings. The evolutionary approach enables economists to work out new ways to analyse various processes which take place in the business world. Finally, the evolutionary approach addresses one of the weakest points of the individual choice/game theory.\n\nThe evolutionary theory does not try to suggest some sort of rationality. The approach suggests that agents’ actions can be justified by previous experiences of agents. In other words, the evolutionary theory is not confined to analysing rationalities which influence agents’ choices. The evolutionary approach suggests a simple answer to one of the major questions concerning motives and stimuli. The evolutionary theory focuses on successful strategies agents develop.\n\nUsefulness of the Evolutionary Approach\n\nThe evolutionary approach is very useful in addressing the problems associated with the individual choice/game theories that have been pointed out by critics.\n\nIn an interesting manner, it is not that the evolutionary game theory does not need to make any assumptions on rationality; in the actual sense, it can be proved that the individual rationality assumptions as they are known must not apply for evolutionary theory to take off. Therefore, I view this theory as being a response to the criticism that rationality in neoclassical economics is too restrictive and it offers a very strong answer by leaving out all the rationality assumptions.\n\nFurthermore, I assume that evolutionary approach is more applicable in the contemporary business world. Admittedly, game theory proved to be quite effective in analysing certain processes. However, it is too concerned with the concept of rationality. In the ideal world where agents are guided by ‘ideal’ rationality, this theory could be the best option.\n\nHowever, the modern competitive business world is more like the animal world where species try to adopt and simply survive. Likewise, evolutionary approach can explain many of the on-going processes. I assume that modern agents tend to strive for success which presupposes fitness to certain conditions. Thus, evolutionary approach is more concerned with agents’ actions and choices which lead to some kind of development, rather than tracing agents’ choices based on specific rationality.\n\nIn the evolutionary game, agents do not work out strategies based on their rationality. Agents “inherit” strategies which have already proved to be effective under certain conditions (Vincent & Brown 2005, p. 74). In other words, according to the evolutionary theory agents have specific patterns to use in this or that situation.\n\nWhat is more, every pattern undergoes certain ‘mutation’ which makes it applicable in other situations. Thus, agents work out successful behavioral patterns based on previous experiences, and, at the same time, prepare ground for the next generations of players. The evolutionary approach reveals one of the most important phenomena in the business world.\n\nIt is possible to claim that one of the advantages of the evolutionary game theory is that it has two layers. Thus, the evolutionary approach presents an outer and inner game (Vincent & Brown 2005). These two layers can enable economists to carry out in-depth analysis of various trends.\n\nThe first layer takes into account players, their activities and the ways they develop new strategies. The second layer is concerned with the strategies worked out. Advantages, disadvantages and overall fitness of this or that strategy is under analysis. Admittedly, such thoroughness can help economists find answers for many questions.\n\nFor instance, economists not only analyse successful strategies and behavioural patterns. They are able to analyse settings that make people come to this or that conclusion. Economists are also able to understand factors that influence agents’ decision making. Admittedly, this understanding can help to predict changes which can take place in the nearest future.\n\nIn fact, the evolutionary approach makes economists prepared to various changes as it provides specific solutions to particular problems. This is one of the most important advantages of the evolutionary approach over the neoclassical game theory.\n\nTherefore, I assume that the evolutionary approach is more complete as it suggests explanations which are more true to life. This approach enables the economist to analyse former experiences of the agents, and this, in its turn, can enable the researcher to predict behaviour of agents rather than contemplate (and seek for) ideal rationalities. This approach can be applicable for analysis of various processes taking place in the contemporary world.\n\nAnother advantage of the evolutionary approach is that it enables the researcher to work out (predict) certain behavioural patterns agents can follow in this or that situation. The approach suggests greater degree of certainty which is very important for such disciplines as economics.\n\nIt is also important to note that the evolutionary theory can help to trace changes that occur in the business world. Thus, agents develop specific behavioural patterns to fit the ‘environment’. Basically, agents evolve to successfully operate in specific settings. By tracing the changes in behaviours, the researchers can single out trends and principles that appear.\n\nTherefore, the evolutionary approach extends to the analysis of agents’ behaviours as well as analysis of the settings. This approach can help researchers to carry out in-depth analysis of the major principles existing in the business world. The evolutionary approach can help to predict changes that are about to occur, or to work out the most effective strategies to cope with up-coming issues. Basically, the evolutionary approach offers effective solutions applicable in the rapidly changing world.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe evolutionary theory has given some solutions to problems that are said to be associated with the individual choice and game theories. By bringing a dynamic process to the game theory, this has rationalized the existence of several equilibriums.\n\nThe evolutionary approach focuses on particular strategies which have been worked out by agents on the basis of successful experience of other agents. The evolutionary theory offers specific solutions which can be applicable in the contemporary world, which is one of the advantages of the approach.\n\nReference List\n\nGriine-Yanoff, T & Lehtinen, A 2010, Philosophy of game theory , Elsevier BV, New York.\n\nHodgson, MG 2007, ‘Evolutionary and institutional economics as the new mainstream’, Evolutionary and Institutional Economics Review, vol. 4 no. 1, pp.7–25.\n\nPatokos, T 2011, ‘Evolutionary game theory – an introduction: issues in applied economics, Lecture notes for session 4’ (University of Hertfordshire).\n\nSugden, R 2001, ‘The evolutionary turn in game theory’, Journal of Economic Methodology, vol. 8 no. 1, pp. 113–130.\n\nVincent, TL & Brown JS 2005, Evolutionary game theory, natural selection, and Darwinian dynamics , Cambridge University Press, New York.\n",

Coping with managing multi-chain stores\n 5. Should it start up or add more chains\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Reference\n\nInditex (Industria de Diseño Textil)\n\nInditex, a global retail specialty, manufactured and sold accessories, footwear and apparel for men, women and children. These products were distributed and sold through Zara and other five chains linked to it in other parts of the world. Inditex was located in Spain and was the owner of Zara and other five apparel retailing chains and was founded by Amancio Ortega Gaona.\n\nIn 2001, as it was coming to the end of its fiscal year, it had accomplished much. For instance, it had acquired a selling space around the world including Spain, an area of about 659,400 square meters and on it operated 1284 stores.\n\nIn addition, it generated 54% of total revenue of € 3,250 million in the 515 stores it had outside Spain and showed a continued trajectory of rapid and profitable growth from Zara and its other chains with a net income amounting to €340 million (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nInditex had many employers who worked both in Spain and in other retailing chains outside Spain. Its total number of employees was 26,784 and out this number, 10,919 employees worked in the retail chains located outside Spain.\n\nOver 76% of Inditex employees were women and put together with men, they had an average year of 26. Additionally, the company had split its employees to work in different departments and sections. For instance, 8.5% of the employees worked in the distribution, logistics, design and manufacturing departments while over 80% were doing retail sales in the stores.\n\nThe remaining activities were carried out by the small group that worked in the headquarters. To maintain its operations, Inditex split its capital expenditure giving 80% to new store openings, 10% on maintenance or logistics and another 10% on refurbishing (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nIts working capital was higher in some season in the year and lower in others. Therefore, to deal with these issues, it had to come up with plans to tightly manage its working capital and its capital expenditure which was €50-510 million.\n\nAlso, it ensured that it had opened 230-275 new stores with the capital across all chains. It is important to note that in 2001, Inditex operating economics had involved operating margins of 22%, operating expenses with a revenue equivalence of 30%, of which one half of the 30% were related to personnel, and a gross margin of 52% (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nMoreover, Inditex operated six retailing chains at the beginning of 2002. The retail chains were Zara, Oysho, Stradivarius, Bershka, Pull & Bear and Massimo Dutti. These retailing chains formed 60 companies consolidated into Inditex at the group level.\n\nThe remaining chains were involved in finance, real estates, logistics, manufacturing, and textile purchasing. The net income of Inditex generated 82% from internal transfer pricing and other policies. The six retailing chains were organized as separate business units together with six support areas dealing with raw materials, logistics, manufacturing plant, real estate and so on.\n\nIn addition to the separate business units, Inditex had nine corporate departments each operating independently with its own strategy personnel, financial results, image, distribution, and manufacturing system. The group management was to set strategic vision of the group, provide them with administrative services and coordinate the activities of the concept.\n\nInditex ensured that coordination had been increased particularly in the areas of expansion and real estate. Also, it formulated plans to open up other chain stores in other locations with Zara helping to accelerate the process of expansion of new chain stores in other areas.\n\nOysho, one of Inditex’s chain stores drew 75% of its resources from other chains and within 6 months it had come to operate stores in seven markets in different parts of Europe (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003). Also, top corporate managers of Inditex came up with strategic plan to control their performances, run the chains, approve business strategic of the individual chain and control the business.\n\nInditex had a major scope in production than the three retailers. However, the competitors of Inditex outsourced all their production. It is important to know the strength and the weaknesses of the three strong competitors of Inditex.\n\nTo begin with, The Gap’s level of apparel production was internationalized as it outsourced 90% of its production from outside the US. It was founded in 1969 and between 1980 and 1990 it had achieved great profitability from selling smart casual work clothes and collections of jeans and T-shirts.\n\nIts major operations were based in the United States. Secondly, Inditex faced stiff competition from Hennes and Mauritz (H&M). This was a high performing retailer in apparel founded in Sweden. It performed better than Zara in terms of industry standards.\n\nBy 1990, it had generated more than a half its sale outside Sweden through internationalizing its operations. In addition, H&M outsourced to the suppliers in Europe half the sale of all its production. It was strategic in its approach to business getting into one country at a time and starting a center that dealt with distribution focusing on the northern part of Europe.\n\nAnother competitor of Inditex was Benetton. Its outsourced activities to subcontractors were labour-intensive and these earned it prominence in the 1980’s. In addition, it used its investment to control many production activities.\n\nStrength of Inditex\n\nIn its operations, Inditex set up strategies to assist it in increasing its production and gain market for its products. Being a global specialty retailer, it widened its market scope by opening Zara and five other chains that sold accessories for men, women and children around the world.\n\nBasically, its ability to achieve this lied in the number of stores, the selling area, its employers and the division of labor among its workers. For instance, Inditex had 659,400 square meters of selling area around the world occupied by its 1,284 stores. In addition, these stores earned Inditex a huge amount of revenue of about €3,250 million (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003). A greater percentage of that revenue came from its 515 stores located in Spain.\n\nMoreover, it employed people to work in Spain as well as in the chain stores outside Spain. Its total number of works was 26,724 with about 78% being women. Among the total population of workers, Inditex used 8.5% of them to work in distribution, design, logistics and manufacturing while over 80% were to do sales in the retail stores (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nIn addition, it organized its expenditure and operating working capital to cover the plans of opening new stores across all chains and for refurbishing and maintenance.\n\nAlso, Inditex derived its strength from its structure. Its top corporate managers set out corporate and business strategies, and controlled the operations and performance of all the chain stores down to the local store level. This was to ensure that they have maintained a high standard in returns on capital employed, earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) margin and on sales growth. Additionally, performance metrics reports were monitored daily as well as being monitored personally by the CEO Castellano once a week.\n\nMoreover, Inditex had one of its six chains that was large, most internationalized and a source of most of its capital. This chain store was referred to as Zara. Zara operated 507 stores in Spain and in other countries around the world. Out of the total 659,400 square meters of working area, it occupied 74% and earned Inditex €2,477 million which was about 76% of the total earnings (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nBasically, Zara was the driver of the growth of Inditex through its international operations. In its operations, it had made quite tremendous achievements in terms of investments in manufacturing logistics and IT, constructing a warehouse of 130.000 square meters in Artexio close to the corporate headquarters and an advanced telecommunication system to connect production, supply and sales locations with the headquarters. Additionally, In the 1990’s Zara mandated internal development of information, merchandizing, financial, retail and logistical systems.\n\nThrough Zara, Inditex was able to attract more customers’ preferences and placed with both internal and external suppliers. Compared to the 2000-4000 items produced by its key competitors like The Gap and the H&M, production in Zara increased to 11,000 to several hundred thousand with variation in sizes, color and fabric putting consideration in time-sensitive items.\n\nAdditionally, it was able to stock goods in stores within a very short time. This facilitated continuous manufacturing of new merchandise and reduced the intensity of working capital. This gave Zara and the whole of Inditex an advantage over its competitors as it could much later than its competitors commit to the bulk of its product line.\n\nThis was in sharp contrast to the traditional industries that took up to three months for manufacturing and six months for cycling of new designs.\n\nTherefore, Inditex through Zara alone was able to overcome traditional retailers who restocked and designed only 0%-20% compared to Zara’s 40%-50% of the purchases of finished products from suppliers, 35% of purchase of raw material and product design and during the period when seasons started, it undertook 85% of the in-house production (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nAlso, Zara offered its customers garments and accessories like bags, jewelry, scarves, shoes and even cosmetics and toiletries that were fresh. The garments were of designer style and were being sold at relatively low prices. This was a strategy that drew fashion conscious customers and devout shoppers visited the chain 17 times a year compared to their competitors who only received such visitations three to four times a year.\n\nWeaknesses and challenges\n\nIn its course of business, Inditex has faced a number of challenges and setbacks in Spain and in its other chains all over the world. The positioning of the company’s headquarters in Galacia posed a major problem to it in terms of communication links with the rest of the country.\n\nEven though Spain had a strong history of Galacians being tailors to aristocracy, their apparel workshops lacked a strong foundation upstream in textiles, demand, universities and technical institutes to facilitate training and specialized initiatives.\n\nFurthermore, they lacked association in the industries to underpin other activities that were potentially cooperative. Also, most of the citizens of Spain depended on fishing and agriculture. As consumers they demanded low prices on goods.\n\nInditex faced a challenge of stiff competition from its competitors like The Gap, H&M and Benetton. For instance, The Gap had its production internationalized and so was competing with Inditex for international markets. It outsourced 90% of its production from the United States (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nIts products like Inditex’s fresh and designer wear garments were considered to be unpretentious and fashionable in the 1980’s and 1990’s. it also had high stellar profits. These pose a great challenge to the business of Inditex as at such a time the attention of most of its customers were The Gaps products that had dominated most of the markets in and outside Spain.\n\nIn addition, Hennes and Mauritz (H&M) dominated most parts of the market outsourcing all of its production. Half of all its outsourced production was taken to European suppliers. Due to this, H&M significantly led in the market ahead of Zara for a long time.\n\nWhile Indited maintained its many chains style of operation, H&M adopted a more focused single format approach and entering one country at a time. It had become internationalized faster than Zara by a decade and by 19190, had generated most of its sales outside Sweden, used several label in marketing its clothes and built distribution centers in each nothern Europe country it entered.\n\nIts decade of business ahead of Inditex gave it a solid foundation, popularity and dominance in some markets that would have otherwise been dominated by Inditex. Moreover, Inditex faced another competition from Benetton. It had become prominent in the 1980’s and the 1990’s.\n\nThe news about its outsourced activities that were scale insensitive and labour-intensive to sub contractors that made it popular was due to its controversial advertising as a networked organization. In addition, it made heavy investments on production.\n\nCoping with managing multi-chain stores\n\nInditex could have managed to cope with the complexity of managing multiple chain stores because it had a well established market all over the world. Its growth in terms of profit had reached €340. In addition, in the year 2001, it had an oversubscribed Initial Public Offering and a 50% increase in stock price (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003).\n\nAlso its market valuation had rose to €13.4 billion. Its market projections were higher in terms of expectation and growth. Additionally, Inditex was a Global apparel retailing business system with chain stores spread all over major markets in the world.\n\nGlobal apparel chains are normally characterized by a unique combination of high value research, marketing, sales and financial services that allow retailers, branded manufacturers, branded marketers to act as strategic brokers.\n\nThese strategic brokers link market with the overseas factories. Therefore global apparel chain becomes a prototypical example of a buyer driven global chain. The attribute displayed by the strategic brokers distinguish other labor intensive industries from the vertical structure of the commodity chain in apparel stores.\n\nLabor intensive industries such as Toys and Footwear Chain stores, are dominated by upstream manufacturers rather than down stream intermediaries. Through the brokers, Inditex could manage to link its other chain stores with the market and even the overseas factories.\n\nBesides, Inditex was able to manage other retail chain stores because of its increased concentration of apparel retailing throughout the major markets. Having multiple chain stores would increase its dominance in shaping imports in the countries that have developed. In the 1990’s half of the apparel sales in the USA were done by the top chain stores.\n\nTherefore operating multi chain stores gives Inditex the opportunity to increase its concentration everywhere and to dominate the markets by displacing other independent stores. This does not compromise the excellence of individual stores because it had been the trend in the 1990’s.\n\nThis trend had helped many chain stores to increase their sales and store sizes over time. Additionally, Inditex could have managed to control multi chain stores because of the set of policies and practices promoted by quick response (QR). These sets of policies and practices coordinated the roles of the manufacturers and the retailers for the purpose of increasing flexibility and speed of responses to a shift in market trends.\n\nThrough QR, Inditex was likely to be able to control all the functions of its existing chain stores or others regardless of the geographic or organizational boundaries. In addition, QR would help retailers reduce inventory risks and forecast errors by planning, placing smaller initial orders and reordering more frequently, probing the market and planning assortments closer to the selling season.\n\nIt is important to note that QR offered the global apparel chain stores many advantages. For instance, it led to improvement of information technology and significant compression of cycle times. It also changed the style of women dressing.\n\nThis type of business strategy would have placed Inditex in a better competitive position as a way of coping with its larger number of chain stores. Managing multi chain stores would have been easy and like the individual chain, Inditex would have maintained excellence because of the availability of market and customers.\n\nIn 2000, worldwide spending on apparel or clothing reached approximately €900 billion. According to the estimates, Asia accounted for 23%, United States for 29% and Europe for 34% (Ghemawat & Nueno, 2003). The difference in per capita spending on the population level and on clothing was reflected by the differences in market size. However, an increase in per capita income tended to lower per capita spending which was also affected by price level.\n\nAnother coping strategy was that Inditex had a variety of customers who had different tastes and preferences. Therefore it was important to have more chain stores in other countries to meet the demands of their customers.\n\nFor instance, more shops in Britain would ensure that the needs of people in Britain were met. These individuals sought went to stores based on social affinity. Other chains would serve the needs of those in France and Italy who were fashion forward focused on quality and variety of the apparels.\n\nAdditional multi chain stores would have catered for the ever growing needs of many nations to buy apparels. The British, other than seeking stores out of social affinity, bought apparels nine times a year. The French and the Spaniards also brought clothing at different times of the year.\n\nThese time differences in places and by different nations reflected the great need for additional multi chain stores. In addition, both within the regions and between regions demands for apparel increased. In japan, teenage market segment was making most demand for apparel.\n\nTherefore, managing the operations of multi chain stores would have required Inditex to arbitrage international factor price difference, minimize tangible investments, and invest in brands. Also, there was the need to emphasize partnering.\n\nShould it start up or add more chains\n\nFrom the perspective of meeting the growing market demands and its ability to make more products, Inditex should add more chains. The sourcing and manufacturing levels of Inditex had over the years expanded substantially.\n\nThrough the help of its headquarter personnel and its purchasing office in Hong Kong and Barcelona, Inditex through Zara outsourced finished products, fabric and other inputs from the external suppliers, manufactured 40% of the finished products internally and sourced from Europe and North Africa approximately two-thirds of the items while one-third came from Asia. Zara, by itself, had enough factories to carry out this process and it also had its own centralized distribution system.\n\nMore chains are needed to cater for the growing market needs. The plans that Inditex had for the year 2002 were to increase stores for Zara with 55 to 66 new stores. These stores were to be in Spain and outside Spain. Those outside Spain were to be 80% of the total added stores.\n\nThese decisions to add more stores across the world would ensure more consumers are reached since Zara had accounted for a greater selling area due to such expansions. There was a need to do more significant investments in other areas North America, South America and Asia.\n\nIn addition, other areas like the Middle East were profitable and worth having stores and products for consumers. In this region, expansion efforts could be made because of the higher than expected demand that would be able to cater for operating costs and it would offer the brightest prospects for a significant and sustained growth.\n\nAlso, Inditex could have added more chains through joint ventures in areas where it was difficult to obtain licenses to open a new store. Some of the difficulties in opening more stores that Inditex competitors face were solved through joint ventures.\n\nFor instance, 1998 Benetton formed a joint venture to help it secure a location and obtain multiple licenses required to open a new store. Also, inditex had formed a joint venture with Percassi, an italan group specializing infashion retail and property in the year 2001 to enable it expand its stores in Italy.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo sum up, the growth and performance of Inditex was attributed to its good management team, strategies, policies and other chain stores that were performing well in Spain and in other countries around the world. Additionally, Inditex had well established international expansion strategies, a committed workforce, a good market for its products and a well established distribution system.\n\nAlso, Inditex ensured that it made progress towards implementing a social strategy that involved a dialogue with local communities, non-governmental organizations, subcontractors, suppliers and employees.\n\nReference\n\nGhemawat, P. & Nueno, L.J.

      "McDonald’s and It’s Critics: 1973- 2009 Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nIntroduction\n\nMarketing entails offering quality products at reasonable prices. The research focuses on the marketing strategy of McDonald’s Company and its critics. The research includes the history of McDonald’s Company from its humble birth in California to its current worldwide acceptance as the best seller in the food and beverage market segment.\n\nSpecifically, the research includes a SWOT analysis. The research ends with a recommendation as to what McDonald’s should venture into in the years to come. McDonald’s implements textbook-based marketing strategies to catapult it to its present stature in the restaurant, food, and beverage world.\n\nHistory\n\nGilbert Sara (4) emphasized McDonald’s was founded by Ray Kroc. Dick and Mac McDonald’s had opened its McDonald’s Restaurant on 14 th and E streets in San Bernardino state, California in 1940. The original store included a drive-in environment with a corresponding large menu and car hop services. In 1949, Dick and Mac had reduced their menu. The new menu item list included hamburger, cheeseburger, soft drinks, coffee, milk, potato chips, and pie. The most popular menu during this time period is the 15c hamburger.\n\nIn 1954, Ray Kroc accidentally enters the McDonald’s scene by selling a multimixer product to both Dick and Mac McDonald’s. Ray Kroc learns that both owners of McDonald’s were interested to set up franchises of their McDonald’s restaurant in many cities across the United States. Ray Kroc decides to enter the McDonald’s franchising business. Consequently, Ray Kroc opens his first McDonald’s store in Des Moines Plaines, Illinois on April 15, 1955.\n\nStanley Meston created the Golden Arches logo of McDonald’s. The company’s first day sale catapulted to $366. This was a large sum of money when comparing the value of $366 during that time period and today’s $366 value. The cost of food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities were cheaper back then compared to the prices of food, clothing, shelter, and other necessities of today, April 20, 2011. In 1965, the company was able to franchise 700 McDonald’s restaurants across the United States.\n\nThe new recipes included the “Big Mac” which was introduced to the public in 1968 and the replacement of potato chips with French fries. McDonald’s celebrates its 25 years of business operations. In addition, the company reached its 50 th anniversary in 2005. In 2008, McDonald’s came up with a global design of the company’s products.\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nStrengths\n\nAnja Bohm (12) opined McDonald’s company has its strengths. First, the company has distinctive competencies. The competencies include its strategic advantages. Competencies include low prices, high quality goods, excellent service and.\n\nSecond, the company gains a competitive advantage, people will enthusiastically flock to a new McDonald’s branch because the McDonalds name is a name that can be trusted and admired. Third, the company has a strong marketing strategy. The company spends lots of money for advertising the different McDonalds products in the television, radio, and newspapers.\n\nFourth, the company has strength in research and development. The company continues to experiment with new ingredients and menu to pamper the current and future McDonalds clients. Fifth, the company has strengths in human resource management. The crew are well trained to serve each client the same high quality way; serving the same high quality products at low prices.\n\nSixth, the company has strengths in information system. Clients and log on to the online McDonald’s website and make an order for hamburgers, French fries and the like. Seventh, the company has strengths in infrastructure. The company sets up the standard McDonald’s restaurant format. The people from different countries have grown to love the same store fast food style infrastructure, especially the busy working person.\n\nAnja Bohm (12) reiterated the McDonald’s Company has its strengths. The strengths represent the McDonald’s development and growth of the company over time which is identified as the company’s “competitive advantage” and “distinctive competency” that is responsible for the company’s growth to be one of the top restaurants, food, and beverage companies of the world.\n\nThe company has the most critical components of a company’s financial resources. The company’s high revenues allow the company to have ready cash on hand to pay for its maturing obligations as well as daily operating expenses.\n\nThere are other strengths not discussed above. First, the McDonald’s Company has distinctive competencies that include a strong worldwide presence. The company is recognized the leader in the fast food chain market segment around the world, especially within the United States.\n\nEveryone within the United States and major cities around the world has come across the name McDonald’s. People from all walks of life have visited a McDonald’s store. Everyone will comfortable that they can easily munch the same McDonald’s quality and taste whether one is in Los Angeles, California, Upstate New York, Virginia, London, China, Saudi Arabia, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, India, and other countries.\n\nSecond, the McDonald’s Company has under its worldwide fast food market segment more than 30,995 restaurants. The restaurants are strategically located in many places around the world. More importantly, more than 13,998 of the McDonald’s Company’s own stores are strategically located in many major cities within the local United States territory.\n\nThe establishment of the McDonald’s Company restaurants in different parts of the world indicates that there is strong demand for the McDonald’s Company’s products and services. The increase in the number of McDonald’s Company restaurants around the world proves that there is a strong demand for McDonald’s Company products and services.\n\nThird, the McDonald’s Company introduces the important economies of scale principles in assigning costs and prices on its McDonald’s products. With the implementation of the economies of scale principle, the company continues to lessen its restaurant operating costs to more realizable levels.\n\nSpecifically, the implementation of the scale greatly lessens the expenses of its overall charting of new paths into uncharted fast food market segments around the world. The economies of scale theory states that some countries are composed of a majority of poor people.\n\nThe economies of scale theory states that some countries are composed of a majority of poor people. The economies of scale theory states that some countries are composed of a majority of very rich people. The economies of scale theory states that some countries are composed of a majority of average income people. McDonald’s offers it products at low prices. The company targets the general masses of the community.\n\nSince there are poorer and average income people in the community compared to the community of rich and very rich persons, McDonald’s targets the average income and low income groups of people. The company is satisfied to generate a small income because there will be more clients visiting the McDonald’s stores compared to restaurants and food and beverages stores that offer its food and service products at very high prices.\n\nFourth, the McDonald’s Company maintains a string of children’s charities around many of its branches around the world. The name of the charity is The Ronald McDonald House. The McDonald’s Company spends lots of cash to feed the children entering its charity outlets. By engaging in children’s charities the image of the McDonald’s Company will improve in the eyes of the current and future customers. The amount allocated for the care of the children\n\nFifth, the McDonald’s Company focuses on the clients’ health and overall well-being. The company only uses ingredients that have passed its strict high standards. The McDonald’s Company complies with all the policies of the United States Department of Agriculture in terms of healthiness of the food ingredients and the food itself.\n\nThe company ensures that ingredients used in the production of goods and services are not spoiled or expired. The use of expired or spoiled food ingredients may cause the customers to suffer from food poisoning. Consequently, the customers can file a case in court for the food poisoning incidents. Such cases will cause a huge dent the image of the McDonald’s Company.\n\nThe company goes out of its way to protect its image. A damaged image will translate to a decline in the demand for the company’s products and services. A decline in the demand for the company’s products and services will cause a drop in the company’s revenues. A reduction in the company’s revenues will translate to a reduction in the company’s net profits.\n\nSixth, Anja Bohm (12) reiterated the McDonald’s Company invests in properties around the world and offers franchises. The establishment of McDonald’s Company restaurants around the world shows that many investors believe that the infusion of their hard-earned cash into the McDonald’s Company will be a profitable decision. The spread of McDonald’s Company restaurants indicate the investors are comfortable with their capital investment decision to have one or more franchises of the McDonald’s Company restaurant.\n\nSeventh, the McDonald’s Company has a long list of real estate portfolios. The company is willing and able to purchase properties in different countries around the world. The purchase of such properties would be useful in terms of improving the company’s balance sheet presentation. The investors would be happy to see that the McDonald’s Company’s properties have increased through the years. An increase in the McDonald’s Company’s properties shows there is also an increase in the company’s stockholders’ equity accounts.\n\nEight, the McDonald’s Company has patents over very popular food items. The food items include Big Mc, Chicken McNuggets. Patents are defined as the government’s right given to an inventor or new product developer to craft the McDonald’s Company products. The copyright prevents the competitors and new entrants to the restaurant, food, and beverage competitors to produce the same products or even use the same product name such as “Big Mac”.\n\nNinth, the McDonald’s Company has one of the world’s most recognized logos. The Company’s logo is a huge “M” sign. Any person seeing the “M” logo can easily state that it means a McDonald’s restaurant is located nearby where the “M” sign can be easily seen from afar.\n\nTenth, the McDonald’s Company focuses its unwavering attention on its corporate social responsibility. The company implements community-caring programs. The programs are aimed at giving back to the community what the community has given to each McDonald’s restaurant located in major cities around the world in terms of food and beverage revenues.\n\nEleventh, the McDonald’s Company incorporates the local culture in all its branches in the United States, Europe, Asia, Africa, and other parts of the world. The McDonald’s Company hires the local residents to manage each McDonald’s restaurant. With the locally-hired McDonald’s employees, the company can be classified as a diversity-based company.\n\nThe Chinese employees bring a touch of the local Chinese culture to the McDonald’s China branches. Likewise, the Korean employees bring a touch of the local Korean culture to McDonald’s Korean branches. The United Kingdom employees bring a touch of the local United Kingdom culture to the McDonald’s United Kingdom branches.\n\nTwelfth, the McDonald’s Company is strategically located in major airports, cities, highways, tourist attractions, and parks. Consequently, the large number of people passing through each McDonald’s branch easily accepts the sumptuous menu items displayed in each McDonald’s establishment.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nMike Meldrum (27) reiterated the McDonald’s Company has its weaknesses. First, the McDonald’s Company uses advertising strategies focused on inviting the children to visit the nearest McDonald’s restaurant.\n\nSecond, the McDonald’s Company implements a low pricing strategy to capture the competitors’ current clients. Clients would easily transfer their preference to McDonald’s products because the prices of their food items are low. Consequently, the competitors are forced to reduce their prices to levels matching or even nearing the McDonald’s food pricing levels.\n\nThird, the McDonald’s Company lacks the penchant to innovate its products. The company continues to sell the same old McDonald’s products. The products include hamburgers, French fries, coffee, chocolate, beverage, Big Mac, and others. The people will generally prefer a change in the food menu to avoid boredom.\n\nOpportunities\n\nMike Meldrum (27) theorized the company’s superior performance is the result of a successful fit between strategy and the environment. The community needs low priced food to fill their hunger fangs. In response, McDonalds creates high quality products to fill the community’s needs, wants, and caprices.\n\nIn addition, the company’s main technique is to analyze the competitors. The McDonalds Company does not fear the entry of new competitors because it is difficult to outmatch the McDonalds Company’s established high quality products sold at low prices. The suppliers are willing to supply McDonalds with highest quality ingredients and other company needs at reasonable prices.\n\nThe McDonalds Company does not fear product substitution because the substitutes are sold at higher prices; the clients will prefer lower priced goods and services. Realistically other traditional restaurant competitors offer their products higher prices than McDonalds.\n\nNadine Pahl (73) proposed The McDonald’s Company has its set of opportunities. First, the McDonald’s Company can effortlessly adapt to the food needs of the community where the company has established its strategically located branches. The company can introduce products that are very popular in the competitors’ restaurants. For example, the China branch of McDonald’s can introduce the popular food menus being sold to the competing Chinese restaurants or food outlets.\n\nSecond, Mike Meldrum (27) theorized the McDonald’s Company can introduce new marketing strategies to increase its revenues. The company can set up websites in each city, community, or state. With the McDonald’s website, the clients can easily order a hamburger or coffee with just the click of the mouse.\n\nIn addition, the company can distribute leaflets or promotional brochures to communities indicating the cell phone text numbers. The clients can easily order a McDonald’s Big Mac just by sending a cell phone text message to the local community’s McDonald’s branch.\n\nThreats\n\nIn terms of threats, Mike Meldrum (27) insists the company can easily hurdle the encroaching new competitors because the new entrants cannot easily win the away the established client base of the McDonalds brand.\n\nFurther, the supplier threats can easily be resolved by contacting other suppliers to offer reasonably priced ingredients and other products. Likewise, the threat of substitute products can be easily answered by offering different product choices within the McDonald’s restaurant. For example, the Starbucks coffee is price three times higher than a cup of McDonald’s coffee.\n\nEconomics tells us the as prices go up, the demand for the products decreases. Thus, McDonald’s will always better alternative compared to Starbucks coffee because there are more middle income and low income people than rich people. The restaurant and food industry is composed of strategic groups. McDonald’s countless branches around the world are one strategic group that constantly wins most of the current and prospective client’s food preference.\n\nThe members of McDonald’s Company’s strategic group can easily resolve its immediate competitor situation. The company has been successful in implementing one universal marketing strategy to capture the new clients and communities food preferences. Currently, the company is at its maturity stage in the product life cycle environment.\n\nThe people from around the world have accepted McDonald’s as a mature company that serves their quality food needs at low prices for more than 50 years. Likewise, the macroeconomic environment, political environment, global environment, legal environment and social environment continues to be very favorable to the setting up of a new McDonald’s branch as well as the continued profitability of each currently established McDonald’s brand.\n\nThe McDonald’s Company has to contend with its threats. First, the McDonald’s Company has to overcome the current economic depression or recession. The recession covers much of the United States and Europe. The recession has reduced the current clients’ penchant to spend quality time gobbling a McDonald’s hamburger or sipping coffee while reading the newspaper’s headline stories.\n\nSecond, the McDonald’s Company has to resolve the currency exchange rate fluctuations. The McDonald’s Company will be happy if the currency exchange rate between the United States dollar and the Chinese currency, Yuan, will remain on the same level. A change in the currency exchange rate between the two currencies may spell an increase in revenues and profits or a decrease in revenues and profits.\n\nThird, many of the competitors are coming up with new food items that can rival the taste, price, and quality of the McDonald’s products. Many local restaurants can easily implement new marketing strategies to please the ever-changing needs, wants, and caprices of its current and future food customers. On the other hand, the McDonald’s Company continues to steadfastly hold on to its popular brands throughout the years.\n\nFourth, the McDonald’s Company has to finally settle the health issues relating to the company’s food products. Everyone knows that eating too much hamburger is hazardous to a person’s health. Too much indulgence in the McDonald’s products may trigger hypertension, diabetes, and other ailments, especially for the “older” generation of restaurant clients.\n\nFourth, the McDonald’s Company focuses a major part of its capital investment on advertising. People often see McDonald’s advertisements in television shows. Likewise, McDonald’s advertisements are found in newspapers. In addition, McDonald’s advertisements are found in radio stories.\n\nFifth, many of the parents detest the McDonald’s Company’s marketing strategy. The strategy focuses on enticing the children to visit the nearest McDonald’s restaurant. The children are easy prey to the continuous advertising of the McDonald’s products and services. Consequently, the growing child will bring the McDonald’s food craze into their adulthood and elderly stages of life.\n\nSixth, the McDonald’s Company has been sued in courts for the effects of the unhealthy McDonald’s products on the health of its current and future restaurant customers. The lawsuits include charges that the food items are injected with addictive additives. The additives will create a craving among the current and future McDonald’s Company clients to return back to the nearest McDonald’s fast food restaurant to buy another set of McDonald’s addictive products to satisfying their addiction to the McDonald’s food items.\n\nSeventh, major competitors are slowly, but surely, creeping into McDonald’s market segment and literally grabbing major markets. The popular Starbucks coffee is gaining a continuing increase in coffee lovers.\n\nLikewise, Burger King has been able increase its food and beverage market share by chopping away and pirating many of the clients of McDonald’s. In addition, Wendy’s has successfully increased the number of its worldwide branches. The increase in Wendy’s branches translates a decline in the McDonald’s clients.\n\nEight, the McDonald’s Company’s setting up of new branches in other countries has been unfavorable in many instances. Some countries have slow economies which translate to slow sales. Slow sales statistical figures translate to slow profits. On the other hand, a fast economy translates to fast revenue generating activity. It is common knowledge that some countries have slow economies while other countries have fast economies.\n\nConsequently, a fast economy will generate more revenues and profits compared to companies with slow economic inputs. Normally, communities or countries with few people having purchasing money will translate to lesser revenues and profits when compared to communities or countries having more people with higher purchasing power or having more money to spend for McDonald’s products.\n\nThe company’s control systems\n\nKarl Moore (83) emphasized the company’s control systems focus is very realistic. The store officers and staff ensure that all the company’s ingredients are fresh and healthy. The store officers have implemented one strict production process in all the McDonald’s Company branches around the world. The company’s food preparation manual indicates the step by step process of preparing, cooking, and serving each McDonald’s around the world.\n\nThe food preparation process in the California McDonald’s Company branch is similar to the food preparation of the McDonald’s Company branch in Florida. Likewise, the food preparation process in the United Kingdom McDonald’s Company branch is similar to the food preparation of the McDonald’s Company branch in France. The food preparation process in the Saudi McDonald’s Company branch is similar to the food preparation of the McDonald’s Company branch in India.\n\nThe implementation of only one standard tried and tested ingredient choosing, and food cooking, and food preparation in all the McDonald’s Company branches around the world ensures that the outcome of each McDonald’s Company food and beverage activity complies with the company’s preset quality standards.\n\nThe company implements preset standards as a measure of quality performance. All branches must adhere to the standards for the sake of maintaining the company’s top spot in the world’s fast food market segment. The McDonald’s Company officers compare the employees’ actual job performance with established standards with the aim of improving any lackluster service performed by the company’s crew.\n\nThe McDonald’s Company officers do not waste any time in correcting or alleviation any customer complaints. The McDonald’s Company food crew is a human being, sometimes one commits unintentional errors. The new greenhorn employees are apt to commit mistakes fulfilling the needs, wants, and caprices of the clients.\n\nThe McDonald’s Company must be quick to remedy such errors to ensure the company will continue to patronize the company’s products and services. It is also customary to post the picture of the best employee of the month in each McDonald’s Company branch as a reward for enthusiastic and hardworking employees.\n\nRecommendations\n\nBased on the above discussion, it is highly recommended that the company continue its present course in terms of ingredient choosing, food cooking, food preparation, and pricing of the regularly sold McDonald’s Company products that include the “Big Mac”, Chicken McNuggets, the Frappes, and the standard hamburger, coffee, egg McMuffins, chicken, and other McDonald’s mainstay products being sold in its more than 50 years of existence.\n\nThe company should continue to expand its horizons by setting up more branches in other communities and countries to ensure that the world’s craving for the favorite McDonald’s Company products will be filled to overflowing status.\n\nThe Company does not have to retrench its employees because the company’s food and beverage market segment continues to generate huge revenues and profits. The company can use a combination of online (internet website) ordering, cell phone texting, and phone calls as a means for current and future clients to fill their need for the mouth-watering McDonald’s Company products.\n\nIn terms of the future, the horizon is crystal clear. Crystal clear means the company sees an increase in the number of McDonald’s Company branches sprouting like mushrooms in other cities that do not have a McDonald’s Company branch within the reach of the hamburger-loving, French fry-loving, and chicken McNuggets-craving residents.\n\nUsing trend analysis, since the current trend of setting up new McDonald’s Company branches in the past has spelled financial success, the company should continue in its unwavering stand to set up new branches in other parts of the world.\n\nIn terms of rationalizing, the company has been able to generate profits from each branch set up in major places where a huge volume of people congregate, the company should continue its present course to set up new McDonald’s Company branches, in malls, groceries, busy street corners, airports, train stations, and other busy intersections around the world.\n\nConclusion\n\nMarketing includes offering quality products at reasonable prices. The history of McDonald’s Company from its humble birth in California to its current worldwide acceptance as the best seller in the food and beverage market segment shows the company deserves the accolades for striving to be the best in terms of product quality and quality service.\n\nSpecifically, the SWOT analysis scrutinizes the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats of McDonald’s. The recommendations show that McDonald’s continue its present course because the company will continue to generate more revenues and profits. Indeed, McDonald’s Company continues to successfully implement textbook-based marketing strategies to retain its catapulted stature as one of the best in the restaurant, food, and beverage world.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBohm, Anja M.

      "Financial Statement Fraud-Detection, Prevention, Related Regulations Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Fraud Detection\n 3. Fraud Prevention\n 4. Legal Implication\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Case Example: Enron\n 7. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere has been increased demand for authentic audit function for services beyond the mere attestation of responsibility. This is because stakeholders have been wondering why fraud could not be detected by auditors. There are a number of major accounting scandals that instill this kind of fear, among them the WorldCom, Famie Mac and, Enron.\n\nConsequently, the reputation of financial reporting has greatly been tarnished, effectively inspiring a renewed concern on the cases and exposure of corporate scandal in finance. There have been broad legislation and Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation restructuring to address corporate governance and as well as establish internal controls.\n\nIn the current context, fraud is the intentional act of a misrepresentation of the financial statements which basically amounts to deliberate dishonesty, cheating and stealing. The public company accounting oversight boards definition is that fraud is deliberate misstatement of financial reports liable for audit. The result of the fraud is suffering financial damages or monetary loss.\n\nFraud Detection\n\nThere has been a very serious concern among stakeholders that they do not understand why auditors cannot be able to detect certain financial frauds before it is too late (Alleyne & Howard 284). Basically, it has traditionally been known that, it is the role of auditors to detect fraud.\n\nExternal auditors provide crucial service in assuring the stakeholders that the financial; statement provided by the company are true and correct. For this reason, independent parties like shareholders, employees, creditors and other people who are interested in the company depend on the audit report to draw conclusions or make decision (Alleyne & Howard 284).\n\nBy and large, stakeholders look for two key characteristics- the independence of the business, and its competence (James 315). However, the problem has been that since its inception, the role of auditors was never clearly defined but the responsibility to detect fraud just developed over years of practices (Chowdhury 895).\n\nAccording to Boynton, auditors are required to be more proactive in their search for fraud as they do their auditing job as claimed under Revised ISA 240 (Boynton 75). They have to seek incentives and opportunities that can attract fraudulent acts and rationalizing whether fraud is justified. Auditors are also required to interrogate errors of accounting, unusual transactions and reluctance to correct mistakes in financial reports (Alleyne & Howard 287).\n\nSince the fall of Enron, there have been serious changes in auditing standards with increased emphasis on the role of auditors as detection of fraud and not mere verification of financial accounts (Boynton 75). These assertions are founded on the ISA 315 dealing with risk management and ISA 240 addressing responsibilities of auditors (Boynton 76).\n\nFraud Prevention\n\nThere are generally three strategies that can be used in prevention of fraud. First is the dependence on the internal controls of the company to detect and prevent fraud (Chowdhury 895). This is a passive means of deterrence. The second and reactive method is to employ investigators after a fraud has taken place. The third method is proactive and it utilizes the instruments and processes routinely used for detecting fraud (James 315).\n\nHowever a good plan to prevent fraud includes the three elements though many firms would typify themselves are one method of the three. In this new millennium, the parties interested in company financial statements are more informed than ever (Chowdhury 898). However, those who prepare these statements are even more sophisticated and can make crucial mistakes or intentional errors that would take time before detection.\n\nAuditors are also important in prevention as they are with detection of fraud (Romas 28). Even though their primary role would be to detect by verification of the financial statements whether they depict true and correct financial situation of the company, their secondary responsibility is to prevent fraud from happening (Chowdhury 899).\n\nThe primary responsibility of prevention is the duty of the agencies responsible for governance and management despite the fact that the financial reports represent management efficiency (Romas 30). Failing to detect financial fraud by auditors is basically the responsibility of professional legislators, regulators and accountants’ efforts to necessitate that the accounting unit take on more responsibilities of assessing and reporting on internal controls (Romas 32).\n\nPrevention of fraud is vested in individual responsible for governing an entity and managing the entity according to NSA 5 and ISA 240 regulations (Rezaee 67a). Under these provisions, the managers and those doing the governing job should emphasize fraud prevention tactics to alleviate chances of fraud and also apply fraud deterrence by convincing people not to commit fraud (Boynton 77). This can be accomplished by increasing possibility of detection and setting up severe punitive measures for culprits.\n\nAnother approach to prevention of fraud is not to consider it as an accounting problem but as a social issue (Rezaee 67a). When financial crimes are striped of the multitudinous differences, then a victim can be separated from money through three unlawful ways; by force, stealth or deception. The first two are more wane but the third one is persistent (Rezaee 67a). This is because there has been strict regulation and deterrence of the first two and people are becoming more educated, informed and crafty.\n\nLegal Implication\n\nFraud is commonly identified as deception aimed at benefiting an individual of group of people and causing the victim to lose money. A dishonest individual under the US legal system can be regarded as a fraudster and fraud has certain features that identify it (Rezaee 278b).\n\nIt’s both a state and federal offense to engage in any type fraudulent activity though they are criminality at different levels (Rezaee 69a). In order to prove fraud, the prosecutor have to prove that the alleged fraudster act included the following five elements; 1. There was a false financial statement of fact, 2. The perpetrator knew the statement to be false, 3. The perpetrator intentionally deceived the alleged victim, 4. The victim depended on the statement for information and, 5. The victims suffered a lost as a result of the trickery (James 317).\n\nFraud is a criminal offense and because it entails a lot of premeditation and planning, its punishment is always severe. Federal and state statutes prescribe harsh punishment for individuals who are convicted of fraud (Rezaee 69a). The sentencing guidelines have recommendation to the way fraud criminals should be charged and sentenced. The guidelines have upward reprimand from standard sentences particularly when the targeted victims were very vulnerable (Rezaee 278b).\n\nThe largely publicized fraudulent act is the corporate fraud which is controlled by the securities exchange act that was established in 1934 as well as other provisions that have been instituted by the Securities and Exchange Commission (Rezaee 279b). These rules were set in reaction to serious corporate crimes in the 1930s. These laws govern the sale of securities in stock, activities that range from manipulating stock prices to insider trade. The provisions also state the civil and criminal penalties that the perpetrators would face upon conviction.\n\nDespite these laws and the SEC, fraud has been endemic in the wake of 21 st century with WorldCom and Enron being the main culprits (Rezaee 69a). It’s in light of these incidences that the US Congress thought it wise to employ stringent rules to govern fraud cases by passing the Sarbanes Oxley Act in 2002 (Rezaee 281b).\n\nBesides other requirements, the Sarbanes-Oxley demanded that public companies should make frequent disclosure of their financial positions to alleviate possibilities of fraud (Ribstein 57). A public company oversight board was established to control accounting companies.\n\nThese companies are required to register with this board so as to enhance the powers of monitoring by SEC and even to do investigations into scandals (Ribstein 57). This measure has enhanced compliance with the regulations of SEC because of the harsh penalties that were introduced. A company must create annual financial reports with proper internal controls of preventing and detecting fraud in the financial reports (Ribstein 58). Deficient antifraud programs are serious and imply weak internal control over the financial report.\n\nConclusion\n\nA good program to deter, prevent and detect fraud is that which will include fraud risk assessment tools, strategy to implement antifraud control activities, allow open communication and information flow and proper monitoring instruments. Lack of reporting should be faced with dire consequences.\n\nAccording to the US federal organization sentence guide, adherence to ethical code and compliance to internal programs and efficient internal control can adequately mitigate eventual punishment of the company even when found culpable of the fraud contravening federal laws.\n\nCase Example: Enron\n\nThe Enron case is one famous example and a landmark case because of the impact it had on all of its stakeholders and the US economy. It’s a case the common people can easily recall. Because of its reputation in 2001, Enron used its stock and assets to acquire loans but somehow they were mismanagement and it’s started suffering losses (Healy & Palepu 5).\n\nSince is its CEO, Kenneth Lay was a respected man for his achievement, he was able to continue securing loans through his connections. The company excluded debts from its financial reports and profits were consequently inflated. Arthur Anderson, the accounts manager hid and shredded financial documents. CEO’s Jeffery Skilling and Lay Kenneth were convicted were charged with fraud and insider trading and securities (Healy & Palepu 5).\n\nEnron was closed because of breaching federal laws (the federal rules). The underpinning principle of the laws is that public companies must report all their information to the potential investor (or investing public) to ensure that any citizen can access the correct company position which can lead to their decision to invest (Healy & Palepu 7). In regard to this principle, there are two basic security laws that were violated; Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933.\n\nThe Securities Act of 1933 declared it unlawful for a firm to sell securities to the public if the securities are not registered by the securities Exchange Commission (SEC). The company’s financial statements must be certified by an independent auditor before being allowed to sell bonds or stocks to the public. Enron’s case violated this and SEC revised its rules in that an auditing firm would not offer any other services to companies they have audited (Healy & Palepu 9).\n\nThe impact of the scandal was that it filed for bankruptcy and closes, workers lost their pension benefits in stock, investors (public and some workers) lost over $ 60 billion (Healy & Palepu 4).\n\nReference List\n\nAlleyne, Philmore and Howard, Michael.

      "Importance of Acting Stylistics Theatre and Film Essay\n\nActing stylistics is an important aspect in the study of theatre and film. Choosing the right acting style is imperative for representation of a character in any sort of acting performance. Acting stylistics involves studying the body language, vocal quality, expressions etc. Successful acting includes the exercise of proper techniques and knowledge about the character which is going to be sketch through acting performance.\n\nIn order to illustrate the necessity of acting stylistics, we shall discuss acting style of Jake Gyllenhaal and Russell Ira Crowe from the movies the prince of Persia and Robin Hood respectively. The paper aims to compare and contrast the two positions to evaluate acting styles.\n\nExpressions are considered as the most important aspect of the acting style without which performance cannot succeed. Active acting depends upon the quality of expressions. The significance of expression can be understood by considering an animated movie without sounds. In such a movie, expressions will be the only way to portray the desired message (Butler). Similarly, body language, style of dialogue delivery, psychological complexity, simplicity, physicality and vocal quality are also important aspects of an acting style (Rauch and Carr).\n\nThe Oscar award winner and renowned Hollywood actor, Russell Ira Crowe successfully portrayed a lion hearted peasant masquerading as a nobleman in his recent movie Robin Hood. His performance was praised by many but on the whole disliked by critics. Despite the fact, that he looks quite bored, burly, grizzly, and has a public image similar to that of Ernest Hemingway, Crowe is known for his ability to portray complex emotions using his body language however this subtle physicality is missing in the movie.\n\nThe main thing that pleases critics regarding Crowe is his body language. Crowe is renowned due his body language, especially in films such as: L.A. Confidential, The Insider, A Beautiful Mind, Master & Commander . This aspect of his acting abilities has been overwhelmed by the action content of this film (Crowe).\n\nRobin as envisaged by Ridley Scott is a complex character; Robin is an ordinary archer in King Richard’s army who steals the armor of a dead knight and escapes to England pretending to be him after an attack on a French castle goes awry.\n\nIt is obvious from this that Robin is not the simplistic hero of the legends and the earlier film portrayals; despite his heroism he is in fact something of a devious opportunist and a knave. Crowe attempts to portray this aspect of the character with a voice that is gruff and grumbling at times, sometimes he speaks out the side of his mouth and at other times has a shifty eyed look about him (Crowe).\n\nPrince Dastan, the eponymous prince of the movie The Prince of Persia is a brave, handsome and charismatic prince though he is somewhat reckless and boorish. He has difficulty expressing his feeling which leads to tension with the love interest Princess Tamina. Gyllenhaal has portrayed his stereotypical role in a suitable camp fashion with a lot of chest baring and somewhat over the top and dramatic movements.\n\nGyllenhaal has obviously worked a lot to convey the physicality required from his character in action scenes such as the one where he recues the princes. Although Gyllenhaal is not a fit choice for portraying a Persian prince but his enthusiasm satisfies the soul of action. No doubt, there is a definite magic cast by the graphics and 3D animation but we cannot ignore his hard work in portraying the role (Gyllenhaal).\n\nAs stated above, expression is the most important element of acting style. This element is the soul of the acting style (Butler). If expressions are not there, there would be no charm left in acting. Russell Crowe is not only dull and boring but also seemed to be expressionless to some extent, in the movie Robin Hood.\n\nAt some scenes where he should be more expressive for example, in beginning when they were going to attack the castle, whereas, in prince of Persia, Jake Gyllenhaal is in his form of action. Jake has delivered the desired message with the help of facial expressions as well as body language (Crowe; Gyllenhaal).\n\nThe actor can draw the attention of his audiences by communication skill. If we move towards the communication skills or dialogue delivery, Russell Crowe is master in it. His gloomy, smoke-burnished voice captures the heart and minds of his fans. Moreover, no doubt that he is a perfect dialogue deliverer as compared to Jake Gyllenhaal.\n\nHis conveyances of message of the movie had been done through the use of perfect dialogue deliverance. He dims his tone when he plays the role of a lover and then his voice becomes shrill and strong when he becomes an action hero (Crowe; Gyllenhaal).\n\nBelievability in a film refers to the extent to which an element in that film faithfully follows the rules of the world portrayed in the film. A miraculous or magical event presented in a film does not necessarily make it unbelievable as long as the event is depicted as happening in the context of a magical or miraculous world.\n\nWith respect to believability, Robin Hood, the archer who is tired of mindless killings and destruction of the Crusades and becomes an advocate for civil liberty in the 13th century is perhaps less believable than a swashbuckling hero in a mystical and magical ancient Persia.\n\nCrowe’s acting style makes the film less believable, he behaves like a modern man rather than a man of 13 th century when lives were nasty, brutish and short. The Prince of Persia does not set any high standards for itself with regards to historical accuracy or believability so Gyllenhaal’s performance as what is essentially a video game character is adequate for his role (Crowe; Gyllenhaal).\n\nIn Robin Hood Crowe attempts to portray a complex, more ‘real’ character and does not fulfill his potential. In The Prince of Persia Gyllenhaal portrays a cartoonish character and his performance is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of the role.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nButler, J.

      "Microsoft Corporation Organizational Design Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nFounded by Gates, Microsoft Corporation is renowned as a global company specialized in the manufacture and improvement of software and computer appliances (Business day). It not only produces various software packages but also offer a wide range of computer services. Video games, operating system, personal computers and other computer applications are some of Microsoft’s products. As part of its services, the corporation educates and endorses software developer and also offers consultancy services.\n\n1. Based in Washington, Microsoft is divided into different subdivision i.e. customer, Microsoft commerce, server and tools, online, entertainment and devices (Microsoft Corporation). Matters pertaining to consumers such as complain or comments are handled by the consumer division. Client division ensures that consumers are well handled by carefully addressing their concerns thus maintaining satisfaction.\n\nIt is responsible for making deliveries of Microsoft products to customers all over the globe. Online division plays a significant role in advertising and providing basic information about the company’s goods and processes. In addition, it links the corporation to its customers, partners and the outside world i.e. by email and web messages.\n\nThe construction and marketing of hardware and entertainment devices such as video games and zune digital music is produced under entertainment and devices division (Microsoft Corporation).\n\nServer and tools sector is specifically responsible for manufacture and endorsement of products and processes. The handling of the overall business problems i.e. by providing overall business elucidation, whether financial or company’s productivity are handled by the business division.\n\n2. In as much as the company is divided in different organizational segments, it also has different parts with their own structures. The parts include manufacture, marketing, finance/accounting and HR. Marketing as part of the company, has different offices to begin with marketing manager followed by three underlying offices i.e. Sales manager, marketing research manager and product manager.\n\nThe above three offices work alongside committed teams that ensure effectiveness and efficiency of these offices. Finance/accounting as a component of Microsoft, is headed by a finance manager followed by two offices i.e. management accountant and finance accountant in conjunction with a strong workforce.\n\nHR and production elements of Microsoft are headed by a HR manger and production manager respectively. The overall company’s structure takes a tree shape thus making it a hierarchical configuration. This is indicated by many level of administration with different offices working under each level.\n\n3. The ultimate decision makers of the company are the directors. The board is made of ten members, approved by shareholders in the company’s yearly common assembly. The team is responsible for making every final approval on actions that impact on the general company. Approvals are divided among different board committees in relation to the kind of activity i.e. auditing committee handles matters pertaining accounting, finance committee handles matters pertaining finances of the company and so on.\n\nFor the management of global activities a team of sixteen bureaucrats that include persons who are responsible for sales, marketing and HR in the global perspective. Additionally, there is a staff council that handles all affairs of the company at corporate level. Management of Microsoft also includes heads of each department who are responsible for different activities at departmental level (production department, marketing department and so on).\n\nProduction departments are specialized in the production of software and other hard ware computer products while marketing in charge of advertising Microsoft products. Finance/ accounting offices maintain records of transactions performed by the business and ensure that they are updated and safely kept.\n\nConscription and vetting of employees are managed by the HR department which ensure that the company’s workforce meet the required standard. Microsoft uses both centralized and decentralized methods of production. This is because production of some products requires technical skills and advanced technology that can only be available in certain specific regions. On the other hand, products which do not demand technical skills and technology are produced in different locations.\n\n4. The organization has a structure in the form of a tree commonly known as a hierarchical structure (John Dunning and Sarianna, Lundan, 238).\n\nThis is because of its different management levels that spread through from a global level to corporate level. It adopts a hierarchical structure due to the various factors surrounding the business i.e. size, complexity, diverse products and geographical coverage. The company has many levels of management ranging from board level to corporate level i.e. management runs from the global level to continental and finally corporate level.\n\n5. Vital decisions that affect the whole company, are decided by the board of directors in Washington based headquarter. The company has centralized staffs that perform different types of functions that affect the overall functioning of the company.\n\nCentralized staffs decide on strategy to be used in future expansion of the company i.e. introductions of new branches, new products and services. Centralized staffs dictate on the company’s income expenditure i.e. they decide on the amount of dividend for shareholders and the amount ploughed back to the company.\n\nAdditionally, they decide on the overall budget of the company; they influence the amount to be distributed in the running of their branches and the amount used in running different activities of the company. Centralized staffs manipulate and also draft rules that govern the company and also have the capacity to impose penalties on indiscipline employees. In as much as running the branches is left to branch managers, centralized staffs do approve crucial activities that directly affect the company of which I consider a fair deal.\n\n6. Some of the decisions made by the entity are centralized while some decentralized. Decisions that affect the overall company such as budget expenditure are centrally made while the ones with fewer effects are decentralized. Decisions regarding management of the company’s branches are mostly decentralized i.e. decisions are made by branch managers.\n\nManagers and their teams can set a meeting and discuss matters concerning their branches with final decisions made. Less important decisions such as recruitment of new subordinate staffs are decentralized at corporate level. On the other hand, important decisions such as how to spend revenues, expansion of the corporation, decisions on how to raise finances and decisions on rules that govern the company is centrally made.\n\nCentrally made decisions are always carefully made since they directly influence the company’s performance either in the short run or long run. Even though, most of decentralized decisions may not be made carefully, some decisions prove to be important and should be carefully handled such as recruitment of new staff whether unskilled or skilled. Whether in the line of work or at field (companies activities), the same rules in applies in decision making.\n\n7. Various factors including technology, strategy, environment, life cycle and company size have profoundly influenced the company’s organizational structure (Cliffsnotes). Microsoft is an exceptionally large organization, in fact, among the world greatest companies thus making it a complex organization that can only perform under a hierarchical structure. This is because hierarchical structure subdivides a complex company to a manageable level.\n\nConsidering life cycle, Microsoft just like people, evolves and undergoes various life cycle before maturity i.e. birth, youth, middle-life and adulthood (Cliffsnotes). Microsoft like any other company was also given birth i.e. the time it was founded (1975). The second stage of growth is the youth stage, a stage where a company (Microsoft) begins to grow by expanding its operations. At this point, a company operates in a flat structure since the company’s simplicity.\n\nYouth stage is followed by middle-life, a stage where company experiences changes in its operations i.e. from a small company to a larger and more complex company. Additionally, the company experiences a change in its organizational structure by switching from a flat structure to hierarchical structure. The company also realizes a significant increase in revenue which is as a result of increased sales from an expanded business. At maturity, the final stage of growth, a company becomes less innovative with minimal expansion.\n\nThis is because of the company’s exhaustion of its industry and the only remaining activity is to maintain the status in the market. At this point, a company is expected to operate in a hierarchical structure due to its complexity and. Environment, as a contingency factor, is the surroundings in which a company/organization operates (Cliffsnotes).\n\nIt can either be stable or unstable/dynamic. A stable environment is considered free from environmental factors such as politics, natural calamities, socio-cultural concepts and technology. A company or organization operating in a stable environment will experience be very much productive which will influence its organizational structure from flat to hierarchical. However in an unstable environment, the business surrounding is occupied by natural calamities and politics thus rendering it unfavorable to organization.\n\nMicrosoft operated in a stable environment that made it experience rapid growth in its productions and operations making forcing it to change its organizational structure from flat to hierarchical (Snellen, Wim and Donk, 264). Another contingency factor that affects an organization’s structure is technology. A company operating in an advanced technological environment will experience efficiency and effectiveness in its operations thus increasing its production and sales.\n\nOn the contrary, an organization in a poor technological environment will be ineffective thus experience minimal production and sales. By the fact that Microsoft began its operation in United States, a country with advance technology, provided a suitable technological environment. This made Microsoft grow rapidly creating a shift of its organizational structure from flat to hierarchical.\n\n8. For smooth running of an organization, there must be rules that govern the institution. Microsoft is a large organization, operates under legislations that should be obeyed by employees and management. The lengthiness of Procedures in Microsoft organization depends on the nature of activities in place. Activities such as investments, expansion may undergo many procedures as opposed to ones which are less vital that undergo less procedure before approval.\n\nFor example, for a merger or acquisition to be approved, it must undergo many procedures to check the viability project. Programmed robots are some of the devices that are use in the coordination of different activities of the company especially in production of computer devices. Telephones also provide a better means of communication in the company, thus maintaining the smooth running of the business.\n\n9. Microsoft organization carries out different activities either within or without their area of operation. Although, most of its activities are specialized, it also performs other different activities such as conserving the environment. This came in handy after being rated poor in environmental conservation.\n\nSome of its environmental driven activities are to pioneer for tree planting and also minimize the use of plastic package. Whether the use of teams or an individual in the running of any activity will all depend on the nature of the work involved. This is for the reason that some activities are involving and demands a team for their effective running as opposed to the less involving activities.\n\n10. Most organizations or companies under software industry operate internationally with their branches and outlets in different countries. This is because of increase in the use of computers thus leading to an increase in enterprises operating under this industry. In developed countries, enterprises operating under this industry are nationally distributed because of equal development in all regions of the country.\n\nIn such countries electricity, infrastructure, technology and skill that are required in the use of computers are evenly distributed thus creating ready market for software; however, in underdeveloped countries enterprises are regionally located since most the software markets are restricted to only developed areas. This goes by the fact that development in such countries are unequally distributed rendering some areas incapable of using computers i.e. by lack of electricity, infrastructure and skill that limits software markets.\n\nConclusion\n\nCredit must be attributed to Bill Gates as the founder of this incredible company that developed the world technologically. It is fortunate that Microsoft was formed in a suitable environment that facilitated its growth.\n\nAs a result, it experienced rapid changes in its production, organization structures and operations. Though faced some criticism of not being competitive and also by being insensitive to environment, Microsoft established itself to become the greatest software producer around the globe by outshining its competitors such as apple.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBusiness day .

      "Summarizing of “Unpredictable Tides” from The Economist Essay (Article)\n\nUnpredictable Tides is the article from The Economist , the weekly publication, where news and internationals affairs are concerned. This article was published July 23, 2009 for the first time. The main idea of this article is all about world trade and the challenges, current economics faces because of the crisis.\n\nGlobal economic still cannot overcome the Depression, this is why the dollar value of trade continues decreasing and the World Bank bothers how to improve the situation and help the others countries to overcome the crisis and stabilize international trade. In general, the information, presented in this article, prove the ideas that economics and international trade in particular are under a certain threat that has to be analyzed as soon as possible in order not to be upset with unfavorable results.\n\nThe article under consideration does not actually presents rather new concepts, which will play a considerable role in further development of economics and world trade, however, several issues, offered by bank representatives still have to be mentioned and analyzed. First of all, Bernard Hoekman, as the significant figure in the international trade department of the bank, admits that “hints of an uptick” ( Unpredictable Tides, 2009) allow to predict that trade is far from considerable booming.\n\nIn this article, also one more adjective is offered to drop in trade – now, it is the “precipitate drop in trade” ( Unpredictable Tides, 2009) that is caused by the situation with global GDP. Rapid contraction of trade is another reason for fast slowdown in economic growth; this is why many firms have to draw down all their accumulated inventories very sharply. These are the main issues, which have a certain impact on further development of international and global trade.\n\nThe authors of this article use many facts to support the main idea of this article that is about trade and the challenges it faces. However, I want to underline three the most significant for economic points. First, it is the two reasons of why modern trade undergoes so many changes and challenges. One of the reasons is closely connected to the turn of the year.\n\nMany economists still believe that if demand picks up in a short period of time, it will be possible to recover international trade. The second reason lies in the idea of global trade politics. The pressure that takes place among the trade barriers is still cramping, this is why unemployment bothers so many people, who deal with international trade. Another important fact that has to be considered right now is the analyses of the trade state nowadays.\n\nThe information, provided by the World Bank, proves that dollar’s value is lower in comparison to the other years. This is why the condition of trade till this period of time cannot be called stable and has to be investigated in order to find out the ideas to improve the situation.\n\nThe last point that makes this article really interesting and informative is the forecasts concerning international trade considering all those changes, which take place now: some countries like China or Australia should change their directions to liberal ones, and these changes may lead to reducing these countries’ import duties.\n\nTo my mind, one of the strengths of this article is referencing to the information, offered by the World Bank. This source of information is always considered as one of the most reliable ones, this is why the authors make the right decision to ground this article on the facts from the World Bank International Trade Department.\n\nThis article is also regarded as powerful, because the impact of crisis on international trade is also taken into consideration. Two quite clear illustrative tables also provide the reader with a chance to evaluate and compare the conditions of export and import, and get a clear understanding that current results are not that successful as should be or were not long time ago.\n\nThe weak side of the article under consideration is lack of attention to the countries themselves, which suffer from economic business and have the problems with international trade. Of course, it is impossible to list all the countries with its problems within one article, but still, the examples could make it more powerful and interesting for people of different nations.\n\nAs a future business owner, I find this article reliable and rather helpful. The example of the World Bank and their intentions to increase the value of dollar and improve international trade give me a kind of hope that even too complicated situations on the global level may be solved, and deep analysis is one of the best decisions in this case. Nowadays, lots of firms, organizations, and other participants of international trade suffer from the outcomes of economic crisis.\n\nOne powerful means, used in this article, is division of the organization into those who are the members of WTO (World Trade Organization) and who are not in this organization. Taking into account this point, I get a chance to evaluate the chances, which are offered by WTO, and comprehend that joining this organization may be rather beneficial, this is why I, as future entrepreneur should learn more about the conditions, under which it is possible to enter WTO.\n\nThe significant idea that I remember from this article is that “changes in trade policy have not all gone one way” ( Unpredictable Tides, 2009). I think that any smart entrepreneur should realize the significance of changes and its unpredictable outcomes, especially in national and international trade.\n\nReference List\n\nUnpredictable Tides .

      "Why Julius Caesar Was Assassinated Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Why Assassination\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Bibliography\n\nIntroduction\n\nGaius Julius Caesar remains one of the most important figures for his prolific conquests that he made during his life as an emperor and probably his untimely-preplanned death. This was a genius in making, combating with not only the minute Egypt but also with world giants like Germany, Gaul, and Britain (Appian 1949, 115).\n\nNevertheless, his ingenuity did not save him from death in the hands of his enemies in disguise as friends, Marcus Junius Brutus and Gaius Cassius Longinu, when they descended on him on Ides of March. These two men, in company of a pack of others, carefully designed the death of Caesar behind his back. However, why would they want to kill their friend?\n\nIt is important to note that, Caesar’s leadership or tyrannical rule policies had nothing to do with his death. Despite his leadership skills, all seemed to be well with Romans. All the indicators of a thriving economy were prevalent in Rome.\n\nFrom creation of thousands of employment opportunities to economic stimulation through export and import, confidence levels amongst Romans were rising by the day and every one seemed to be happy save for some leadership flaws here and there, which are common in any leadership. These leadership flaws could not move anyone to rebel against and plot assassination of the emperor.\n\nEven though there are many schools of thought giving different reasons as to why Caesar was assassinated, the most compelling school of thought is the one stating that, Caesar was assassinated because his assassins wanted power. All other malicious claims directed to Caesar were only to cover the truth. Brutus and Cassius were formerly enemies to Caesar and after he defeated Pompey, they swore allegiance to him but their initial rebellion did not go away and this is evident from the assassination they carried out.\n\nWhy Assassination\n\nThe fact that the men that assassinated Caesar wanted some grounds to accuse him and justify their assassination, implies that they had to plot how to win other people’s hearts and allegiance. Unfortunately, Caesar made many gullible mistakes exposing him to the wiles of these assassins. Many a times he failed to read signs that would signify impeding danger. In the opinion of the writer of this paper, nothing Caesar would say or do that would avert his inevitable death.\n\nBrutus and Cicero were very much aware of the damage they would cause to Caesar once they managed to brand him a tyrant (Yavetz 1983, 186). Therefore, the only thing that these two men needed was to come up with a strategy that would subject Caesar to public ridicule and then attack him after gaining enough support. To do this, they had to convince other senators to get into their scheme; fortunately, they got huge backing from senators, who joined them for different reasons.\n\nAccording to Nicholas of Damascus (1964), the chief principals of this plot were men who knew for sure that if Caesar were dead, then they would gain power to run the nation. This persuaded many senators to consent to the plot of killing their emperor. Other people agreed to the plot because they were still angry because of losing their relatives and friends in the civil war. Therefore, to end such impunity, they wanted to be led through democracy, not despotism.\n\nHowever, Nicholas of Damascus (1964) notes that these were mere cover-ups, the fact is that these people were hypnotized by the promise of ascending to power and they would find any excuse to assent to the plot. Moreover, some people joined the plot not because they had anything against Caesar, but because they loved the pioneers of the plot. Interestingly, men who had been genuine friends to Caesar also took part in the plot. How did this happen?\n\nAfter Caesar forgave the likes of Brutus and Cassius who had been his enemies and gave them powers in his authority, the men who had remained loyal felt betrayed. They could not understand this form of kindness. When Cassius approached them to take part in the plot, they gave in easily for they wanted to revenge what Caesar had done to them.\n\nIt is unfortunate that these loyal Caesar friends could not enjoy the good reaps from the war and by joining the plot; they knew they would access power and finally enjoy what they had labored for all that long. Finally, after spurring people from all lifestyles into rebellion, Brutus and Cassius had to fool Caesar into stupid acts that would leave him exposed (Taylor 1949, 173). This opens up the next element of this conspiracy; that is, the plot.\n\nIn the Greek culture, no man was to become a king as long as he lived (Yavetz 1983, 193). Wittingly, these assassins painted Caesar as a king by offering him several honors. Unfortunately, Caesar gave in to the ill plans of these brutes and as time went on, he started acting against the law, something that would cost him life.\n\nThe disregard for the law would give the assassins a foothold to censure him. The conspirators started by voting on how Caesar would appear in public. According to the vote passed, Caesar was to appear in all public places wearing exultant attire and sit in the chair of state. The aim of this vote was to make bring him close to people who would easily fault him as he mingled with them often.\n\nAdditionally, they bestowed on him the power and right to “offer the so-called spolia opima at the temple of Jupiter Feretrius, as if he had slain some hostile general with his own hand. To have lectors that always carried the laurel and after the Feriae Latinae, to ride from Albanum to the city mounted on a charger” (Cassius Dio 1949, 12). This meant that his status was elevated almost to a state of a king. This was just but the beginning of the honors Caesar received.\n\nTo hypnotize Caesar completely, the conspirators named him the father of the nation. This was followed by inscribing his image in all the coins used in Rome around that time. Additionally, they passed a vote that Caesar’s birthday was to be celebrated by offering public sacrifice and his statue was to stand in all cities.\n\nTwo of Caesar’s statues were to stand in all temples one signifying him as a savior of people and the other as a savoir of the city under siege. A temple was to be built in his honor to symbolize peace. To cap it all, they appointed him the high priest and conferred powers to censure life to him alone.\n\nMistakenly, Caesar accepted all these accolades with unfathomed gullibility. This saw the passing of the law that required prayers be made to him and he accepted the garbs worn by kings. Finally, after a series of honors that Caesar accepted readily, they “addressed him outright as Julian Jupiter and ordered a temple to be consecrated to him and to his Clemency” (Cassius Dio 1949, 16).\n\nThe motive behind all these awards was to paint Caesar as a king or a god, something that would attract disapproval readily, hence justifying their assassination.\n\nActions of these people spoke loudly and it was evident that they did not have any good faith in what they were doing. “Others, and the majority, followed the courses mentioned because they wished to make him envied and disliked as quickly as possible, that he might the sooner perish” (Renard 1987, 568). This explains clearly the motive behind these accolades. However, this was not the only reason why these senators gave Caesar all these honors.\n\nGoing back to Caesar’s life as an emperor, he was always under the watch of a guard. This meant that the senators could not meet him whatsoever; hence, they would not get chance to carry out the assassination. After receiving many honors, Caesar was convinced that these people would never try to eliminate him (Taylor 1949, 175).\n\nTherefore, he let his guard leave for he was now comfortable in the presence of the senators, who had apparently become his friends. As time went by, he dismissed all other guards and now he would remain under the watch of knights and senators. Caesar’s gullibility continued to portray itself as he consistently became mesmerized by the “kindness” of his subjects. However, it did not take long for these power-hungry assassinators to find a loophole in what they would easily exploit at the expense of this gullible emperor.\n\nOne evening these conspirators approached Caesar to explain why they would carry some of the house businesses in his absence to show that they worked involuntarily as opposed to compulsory duty (Suetonius 1913, 77). However, Caesar did not wake up from his seat and this dismayed many of them. Sympathizers of Caesar tried to explain that he could not walk because he had a bout of diarrhea; nevertheless, they could not justify these claims because he eventually stood up and walked without support.\n\nThese assassins pretended to be dismayed by this act of pride; however, this is all they wanted from the beginning; a foothold to accuse Caesar. Well, they got it fully later when Caesar accepted to be made a dictator for life. Nevertheless, the end was yet to come. Some of the people still supported Caesar and the conspirators had to look for a way to embitter them. The next course of action was well plotted.\n\nAs aforementioned, among the Romans, there could not be a king for this was outright scorn to the tribunes. Then the time came, and the senators tried to brand Caesar a king but he refused vehemently. However, after scrutinizing the events, it appears that Caesar wanted the title. Firstly, it would be expected of him to rebuke such people, put them into prison, or worse kill them (Adcock 1951, 693). However, he did not do anything to them.\n\nThis showed that he was pleased by the title; something that caused many people to disdain him. To cover up his behavior, Caesar told people that he was not a king but only a Caesar. Even though he took some actions against the first people to call him a king, the measures were not severe as expected for he only relieved them of their duties as tribunes and banned them from public speaking. He went ahead to rub their names from tribune-ship; however, this did not quell the mounting disapproval among citizens. Did he really dissent the title?\n\nThe answer to this question is no! If Caesar were totally, against the title, he would come out clearly and refuse it. However;\n\nAntony with his fellow priests saluted him as king and surrounding his brows with a diadem said: “The people give this to you through my hands.” He answered that Jupiter alone was king of the Romans and sent the diadem to him to the Capitol, yet he was not angry and caused it to be inscribed in the records that the royalty presented to him by the people through the consul he had refused to receive.\n\nIt was accordingly suspected that this had been done by some prearranged plan and that he was anxious for the name but wished to be somehow compelled to take it, and the consequent hatred against him was intense (Cassius Dio 1949, 17).\n\nThis shows that he somehow accepted the title “king”; hence, making him a tyrant. Thus, the assassination would not be branded as such, but it would be called tyrannicide. However, Caesar was still popular amongst middle and lower classes and they vowed to fight Brutus and his team. The fact that Brutus went to organize troops in Greece to topple Antony is a clear indication that all he wanted was power.\n\nConclusion\n\nDespite his ingenuity in conquering his enemies, Caesar could not deal with his closest enemies who disguised as friends. They led him into believing that they liked and honored him by awarding him with several accolades until they won his trust. First, they had to win his trust to a point of him letting go of his guards.\n\nThis would ensure that the senators gained access to Caesar and have the opportunity to kill him. Luckily, this worked well for them as they accomplished it. Secondly, they had to paint Caesar as a tyrant in the eyes of the citizens to justify their assassination, which in effect it would be termed as tyrannicide. They also accomplished this by branding him a ‘king”, a title that he was not supposed to hold. Their craftiness was aided in part by Caesar’s gullibility and failure to read the two sided of the coin.\n\nThere is clear indication that Caesar wanted to be called a king and this was the biggest mistake that he made. However, this assassination was inevitable and nothing he would have done to prevent it. It was a political attack where the assassinators were power hungry and the only way they could gain it was through assassination. However, they failed in their bid to rule Rome as opposition mounted against them leading to a series of wars.\n\nBibliography\n\nAdcock, F. 1951. Caesar’s Dictatorship. Cook, S. & Charlesworth, P.

      "The Advertisement to Attract Organizational Leaders Essay\n\nAutomobile industry is one of the most developed economic sectors in the world, thus, any innovations in the field can contribute to the growth of your profits if you focus on expanding to a country which can be discussed as a right choice.\n\nFollow the successful experience of such giants of the automobile industry as Renault, Volkswagen, and Nissan and provide your organizations with a chance to achieve the similar successes. If your company is growth-minded and it is focused on expansion globally, Spain is the effective choice to complete your goals. Pay attention to many advantages of the Spanish market to start your organizational expansion successfully:\n\n1) Spanish economy is traditionally discussed as rather mature because of the progress in the spheres of transportation and infrastructure and because of the high health and educational status of the country’s population. Being the member of the European Union, the economy of Spain can be discussed as protected from significant negative changes and extreme consequences of the global economic crisis.\n\n2) The situation in Spain can be characterized with references to the positive macro-economic environment appropriate to stimulate the organizational expansion to the country. The economic growth rates demonstrate positive changes dependent on the general progress of the country in relation to its economic and social stability and progress.\n\nWealth of society increases along with the people’s positive attitude toward free enterprises ( Spain: Index of Economic Freedom 2013, 2013). Thus, you will be provided with an opportunity to establish strong business relations with new partners within the industry because of the positive impact of the macro-economic factors on the automobile industry’s development.\n\n3) It is important to focus on the increased profitability of the automobile industry in Spain because of the prolonged tradition to develop this industry and to contribute to investing.\n\nThe automobile industry in Spain develops according to the principles of the controlled public spendings and investment freedom associated with business freedom in order to provide the companies with the opportunities to work to gain profits. While gaining profits in Spain, the company’s leaders can speak about the successful organizational expansion which is usually not the final goal, but the effective method to achieve it.\n\n4) The legal nature of the country is also important. The rule of law is the main requirement to expand business activities to Spain. The country is open to intensive investment and associated trade relations, thus, the economy of the country and the development of industries should be based on the rule of law. Spanish judiciary can be evaluated as rather independent and contributing to the economic development of many industries ( Spain: Index of Economic Freedom 2013, 2013).\n\nIn order to receive the opportunity to use extensive economic advantages associated with the organizational expansion, it is necessary to evaluate all the strengths and weaknesses of the process and to concentrate on the appropriate choice (Tarn & Wen, 2002). To realize the goals based on the idea of the organizational expansion into the automobile industry abroad, it is important to choose Spain because of the benefits and advantages connected with the company’s growth in this country.\n\nThus, the economy of Spain is open to rather aggressive growth strategies used by organizations within the automobile industry. Furthermore, the economic environment of Spain provides the space for using such approaches as consolidation and complementation as the key methods to achieve the highest goals in relation to the organizational expansion and company’s development.\n\nReferences\n\nSpain: Index of Economic Freedom 2013 .

      "Tule Lake Japanese Internment Camp: Life and Afterlife Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Life in the camp\n 3. Mental life of the internees\n 4. Post internment life\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nDiverse populations have experienced different forms of harrying and deferral of civil rights throughout the course of American history. Each one of these communities has a story to tell and one from which to learn. Tule Lake Segregation Center is one of the most protuberant camps in the history of civilization. As a matter of fact, people believe it to be the biggest of the camps. It is in the Tule lake segregation center that more than 20,000 individuals of Japanese origin got confined without evidence of a lawful trial.\n\nToday, people regard Tule lake segregation, alongside other neighboring camps like the California’s Tule lake camp, as a national monument, which commemorates the price paid for freedom (Nakamura).\n\nPeople held here lost all their civic rights as well as their material property despite them being legitimate citizens of the U.S. Most of those people had to work in the military against their will (about 30,000 individuals) (Todd, Natasha, & Karen 12). It is for this reason that we find it worth understanding the camp, as well as the nature and the nature of life in the camp. Moreover, this paper also tries to look at the life after confinement in the camps.\n\nLife in the camp\n\nCamp was like a typical American town with almost all facilities required. The camp had six subdivided blocks. Each block within the camp had a recreation facility which comprised of stores, canteens, parlor barber shops, beauty and judo halls among others (Gruenewald 2). There were churches, schools, beauty salons, police departments and sporting leagues. These departments depended on each other and had individual roles but equal responsibilities to perform.\n\nThe selection of people was random (in terms of professional qualification) each one of these individuals brought along their personal skills to the camp mostly to be used for personal development in the camp. There was some level of self governance within the camp whereby different authorities and individuals assumed self responsibility against the other individuals (Todd, Natasha, & Karen 19). Moreover, the United States military was in control of the entire camp.\n\nDuring the time between 1942 and 1946, the Japanese Americans had the military facilities as their places of residence. Considering the facilities lacked basic amenities, owing to their hasty build and any other form of comfort anyone could imagine. For these reasons, the houses were extremely cold during winter and exceedingly hot during the summer. Most of these houses did not meet the minimum standards for any military housing facilities.\n\nIn as much as the living conditions were below average, the internees still afforded a little luxury. They engaged in sporting activities against one another in their own organized teams. Among others, basketball and baseball were the most popular of all sporting activities.\n\nThe teams organized themselves so that they would purchase uniforms to play in their own established leagues. The games helped the internees tremendously as they allowed them to go astray. Having spent a lot of time in such activities, it would be less likely for them to think of any ill-motivated plans.\n\nMost of these people relocated from their homes, which were much more comfortable than their new accommodations. Consequently, these people especially those in Tule Lake camp frequently involved themselves in demonstrations and strikes while pushing for their civil rights. It was later that Tule lake camp became converted to a maximum security facility and consequently referred to as a ‘trouble spot’.\n\nMental life of the internees\n\nLife in the camp was not just for the people within the camp. To start with, all the detainees lost their civic rights and most of them lost their American citizenship against their will. Moreover, all their efforts to challenge the decision failed as the court turned down all their petitions.\n\nIn simple terms, all the people not only in Tule Lake camp, were confined in the camps against their will and also for no justifiable reason. Most of them suffered emotionally, financially and even psychologically. The agony became even worse when the court turned down their petition against the government.\n\nLake Tule always considered to be a trouble spot. In the beginning, the internees participated in numerous strikes and boycotts. This is more than enough justification that the people, in fact, did not fancy the conditions in the camp. They, therefore, participated in the strike activities. In 1943 for instance, members of the camp participated in a demonstration against the overcrowded living condition.\n\nThe timely demonstration at a time which found Dillon Myer taking a tour in the camp brought about a lot of controversy (Inada 31). Nevertheless, the demonstration ended peacefully although there were rumors of a possible massacre. Most of the people who caused problems got deported to Hawaii against their will. All this could be interpreted as injustice against the right to freedom. Nobody contents when his/her rights become infringed and more so when being detained ‘illegally’.\n\nDuring their stay in the camp, I would say that the people were happy but not content. Having discovered that there was not much of an option, they decided to make out the most from the situation. They involved themselves in various activities to pass time such as sporting and scouting. By getting involved in such activities, they became able to reduce their agony.\n\nAt first, all these people suffered psychologically and physically as a result of deprivation of their civil rights, but with time, they got used to living with it (Turner 22). A significant number of them also renounced their American citizenship due to the level of injustice that they endured. It is also worth noting that most of those men and women who served in the military did not serve out of personal pleasure but out of slavery. To them, this seemed to be the only way out of an extremely difficult situation.\n\nPost internment life\n\nAfter the detainees set free the Japanese, most of them returned to their original homes. Most of these people rejoiced at the prospect of returning home. However, during the time of detention, a lot had changed in the outside world. Moreover, the Second World War changed the surroundings a lot. Some of the local citizens welcomed them back in as much as others felt that that was not the place for them. For this reasons, they could not go to certain places.\n\nThe main problem was the money. Most of the people had to sell their belongings. Their savings, on the other hand, were not enough to last through the detention time (Fusao 25). It was challenging for them to get new jobs or even secure loans. Their professional skills became obsolete and considered being old fashioned, having spent so much time in the facilities. In addition, no one was readily willing to employ them due to racial discrimination.\n\nThe tragic incident had left many dead and thousands injured physically and emotionally. For most of them, psychological recovery was difficult especially because of them lacked any form of moral support from neither the government nor the local community. As opposed to this, the local community mistreated them and also viewed them as less human.\n\nIt was challenging for them to live with such conditions. Nevertheless, most of them rejoiced that they had attained freedom. Most of these people could have done anything else except living in the camp again.\n\nPeople tried to recover what was rightfully for their own. Land and houses were some of the most precious commodities that the people tried to recover. Some of them felt that moving to their old home would bring them nostalgic memories and, therefore, prefer moving into new houses.\n\nLater on in 1948, congress decided to compensate the Japanese some of the property. Many writers have described this as a form of saying “sorry”. They also started a civil liberties act to recognize the end of injustice. The Japanese now lived a normal life. To this day, some of the internees’ family members are still pushing for compensation from the government that their families incurred during the Tule lake Internment camp.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGruenewald, Mary M.

      "Creation: Truth and Myth Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Genesis creation narrative\n 3. Genesis story as a myth\n 4. The truths in the creation myth\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere have been a lot of contention in regard to how life came into being. Christians and other religious groups have maintained that creation was done by God as described by the Bible and other holy books. Christians have stuck to the genesis account of creation with some modifying it to suit their respective doctrines and disciplinary influences.\n\nMany conservative Christian groups regard the myths of creation that appear in the initial parts of genesis to be literally correct (Frigge, 2009). They do not doubt that it was conducted by God in six days. Many believe that creation was actually done by God exactly as it is described in the Bible and this actually took place circa 4004 BCE as worked out by Bishop Ussher (Frigge, 2009).\n\nOther groups of conservative Christians have tried to bring together the genesis creation version with findings in science. They, therefore, believe that God created the Earth and all that is in it; in addition, they believe that the Earth is billions of years old (Frigge, 2009).\n\nMost liberal Christian groups simply reject the inerrancy described by the Bible (Halbur, 2007). They point out the fact the individuals who wrote genesis existed in pre-scientific times. Even elementary geology, cosmology, astronomy and biology were far much beyond their knowledge (Frigge, 2009).\n\nThis group of Christians tends to accept the creation stories described in genesis as imaginative creative works that have no bearing on reality or myths derived from earlier Mesopotamian creation stories that were re-worked by the ancient Israelites (Halbur, 2007).\n\nThis paper seeks to describe creation truths and myths as described in different written Christian interpretations. The paper will greatly refer to two written works, the Saint Mary’s Press College Study Bible and the Frigge’s textbook, The Beginning Biblical Studies. References will also be made from the “book of Genesis” (Frigge, 2009).\n\nGenesis creation narrative\n\nThe creation myth is found in the beginning of the book, in the first chapters. The first chapter describes how God created the whole world within six days through divine speech. The creation included mankind on the sixth day and rested on the seventh day (Frigge, 2009). The second chapter of genesis describes the identity of God as the “God of Israel” creating the first man named Adam, placing him in the Garden of Eden and making the first woman Eve from his rib (Halbur, 2007).\n\nBasically, the creation narrative is composed of these two parts that form the initial two chapters of the Bible. While the second part of genesis is a simple narrative that picks from the formation of the first man in the Garden of Eden to the creation of the first woman and the establishment of the institution of marriage, the first part of genesis stands out due to its organization (Halbur, 2007).\n\nThe chapter is organized in eight instances of creation that supposedly took place over a six day period. In the first three days of the creation, according to the first chapter of Genesis, God conducted three important divisions.\n\nDuring the first day, he separated darkness from light, on the second day, he separated the waters below from the waters above and, on the third day, he separated the sea from land (Frigge, 2009). According to Frigge, in the next three days, God creates the stars and the sun, creates fish and fowl in the seas and skies respectively (2009). On the last day, he creates land animals which include mankind.\n\nGenesis story as a myth\n\nIt is important to note that myths have varied origins. Many of them are usually fictional but there are some that are based on events that actually took place. Myths, whether fictional or based on actual events are used for different purposes such as explaining things that cannot be explained, to convey religious messages or to keep a group together (Frigge, 2009).\n\nSeveral texts give an explanation of how a myth develops from a historical event that actually took place. They state that major events that took place in the history of a community are retold and retold to different generations. Eventually, the stories take a deeper level giving rise to a myth. One such myth is the story of exodus (Frigge, 2009).\n\nThere have been a lot of controversy surrounding the issue of whether creation is a myth or the truth or whether what is written in genesis is what really took place or it was engineered to suit the needs of the time.\n\nIndeed, many contemporary biblical scholars have asserted that the first major comprehensive draft of the Pentateuch (five books beginning with Genesis to Deuteronomy) were written in the late 7 th or 6 th century BC by the Jahwist source and they were later expanded to incorporate additional narratives and laws from the Priestly source to create the work we have today (Halbur, 2007).\n\nIn the view of these contemporary scholars, the purpose was to come up with a monotheistic creation version in opposition to the polytheistic myth that was being advanced Babylon (Frigge, 2009).\n\nIn the Frigge’s text book “Beginning Bible Studies”, the challenges faced by the priestly group are clearly outlined. The priestly was at pains to create a writing that would sound well for reestablished but struggling Jews who were just returning after spending more than a century in exile. These people had gone through enough trouble with their creator (Frigge, 2009).\n\nIn setting out to do their work, the priestly had to put into consideration the kind of people they were writing for, their questions and their needs at that time.\n\nThe priestly group had to devise a writing that would resonate well with them and lead them back to the ways of God. The priestly redactor decided to create a chronological account of the salvation history that would teach the present and future generations the fundamental beliefs about their God (Halbur, 2007). The chronological account had to have a beginning and, thus, the need for a creation myth. This was important in order to address the people of Israel particularly in regard to the situation they were in at that time.\n\nThus, the creation myth in Genesis was purely designed to deal with questions that could have been raised by the people (Frigge, 2009).\n\nThe truths in the creation myth\n\nThe book of Genesis has two creation stories that fit into one narrative (Halbur, 2007). It is said that the words translated in English do capture the full meaning that was in the Hebrew language. This is due to the fact that the Hebrew language uses verb tenses that cannot be found in the English language.\n\nOther words in the Hebrew language are only used in conversations or writings that are related to God. For instance, the bara refers to creation that is done only by God but English does not have such word that describes creations done by God alone. This implies that the myth of creation contained in Genesis has a deeper meaning when described in Hebrew (Frigge, 2009).\n\nIndeed, the myth of creation contains hidden truths that apply to the everyday life. It is also important to note that the translation of the Bible from Hebrew to English led to a significant lose in the meaning.\n\nFor instance, creation is popularly associated with the creation of Adam and Eve but a closer analysis of the Bible reveals that it does not feature prominently in the first three chapters of the book of Genesis. Another major misconstruction can be seen by carefully reading chapter 1:27 which states that “God created man in his image, in the divine image he created him; male and female he created them” (Frigge, 2009).\n\nThis verse seems to be grammatically wrong it was wrongly translated from the Hebrew language. For English, the word “man” can stand for the male sex or whole human race (Halbur, 2007). In Hebrew, there are two distinct words . Ish refers to a male person while Adam i s more commonly used to refer to humankind. Thus, the use of Adam in the book of Genesis simply implies that God created and continues to create the Human race.\n\nThere is evidence that in ancient Hebrew, the word Adam was used to symbolize all human beings. Thus, in saying that “God created Adam”, the statement refers to the creation of all human kind (Frigge, 2009). On the other hand, the symbolic meaning of the name “Eve” can be found in Genesis 3:20. It refers to the mother of all (Halbur, 2007).\n\nThe story of Adam and Eve is usually introduced to people from an early age. The story usually remains ever present in one’s mind through to adulthood. Scholars have pointed out that this wonderful story can have very serious consequences on a person’s spiritual health.\n\nThey warn that the story should not be taken for its literal meaning. For instance, in the first chapter of Genesis, man and woman are created simultaneously but, in the second chapter, the woman is created later (Frigge, 2009). Indeed, the two versions cannot be taken to be literally true. They are simply used to reflect on the human condition.\n\nThe story of Adam and Eve in the book of Genesis has been taken literally by many putting people in an awkward relationship with God. Many people who take the story literally think that the story proclaims subservience of women to man (Halbur, 2007). The story seeks to establish the fact that no human being can exist on his/her own.\n\nAnother controversial issue that comes up in the creation myth is the statement that humankind, male and female, is created in the divine image of God (Frigge, 2009). Christianity forbids humans from comparing anything o God. It is, thus, not always accepted that humans were created in the same way as God.\n\nBiblical scholars are still debating to identify the precise meaning of this statement. Many have sought assistance from the book of psalms. In psalms 8:6, God is praised for creating humans a bit less than God, crowned with glory and honor (Frigge, 2009). It is important to note that in Hebrew language, an equivalent of the word glory ( kabod ) is often used to refer to God. But, in this verse, it is applied to humans too.\n\nThe word kabod or “glory” refers to the manifestation of God that is visible (Frigge, 2009). The book of psalms indicates that in a way God shares his divine nature with humankind. Thus, the statement that humans were created in the image of God implies that there is a part of God that is shared with humankind. According to the scriptures, the main purpose that humans serve on Earth is to manifest the presence of God.\n\nThe statement that humans were created in the image of God was evidently applied by the Priestly redactor to contrast the Israel religious beliefs from that of Babylon (Frigge, 2009). In the Babylon creation myth, human beings are created in order to serve Gods just the same way as slaves serve their masters (Halbur, 2007).\n\nThe myth of creation also talks of human beings giving care to other humans and all other living things. An in-depth analysis of this finding shows that God involves human beings in his creation work. Thus, man acts as a co-creator with God and also with other humans. These studies show that woman and man corporate to give the breath from God the creator to new life.\n\nThe creation of a woman out of the man’s ribs has long been held as implying that women are subordinate to men. However, the careful study of the book of Genesis with apparent reference to the Hebrew language show that this belief falls (Halbur, 2007).\n\nIn the first book of Genesis, God instructs humankind to have dominion over all plants and animals. Many Christians have taken this to mean that human beings can exercise power over plants and animals in any way they feel necessary. When this call to human beings to exercise dominion is analyzed in Hebrew, it means something quite different.\n\nIn ancient Israel, the human king was like God’s representative on Earth and, therefore, he was required to rule in the same way as God. In regard to this, the call to “have dominion” implies that the ruler should direct all living things to exist in a peaceful, harmonious and justified manner. Therefore, God’s call to Adam to have dominion over plants and animals did not imply that human beings should manipulate other creatures in whatever way they deem necessary (Halbur, 2007).\n\nThe call was intended to mean that human beings should act as God’s representatives on Earth and ensure that everything is moving in the right direction. Thus, in as much as humans are required to depend on God at any given moment, they have the power to rule over other animals. They are simply created to assist God and represent him on Earth.\n\nThis description of the creation of human beings and their purpose is seen in the first story of creation. The first story is often thought to have been sourced from Priestly own writing tradition. Priestly must have seen this account of creation to be incomplete (Frigge, 2009).\n\nThey must have taken a look at how the relationship between God and Israel had changed over the years. Priestly saw that the relationship described in the first chapter of Genesis had not materialized. The initial plan that God for humanity had failed and so Priestly had to create another myth.\n\nAccording to Frigge, the second story or myth was sourced from the Jewish tradition and it told of how God had made man out of clay from the ground then blew into his nostrils the breath of life (2009). In genesis 2:7, the Bible describes how God formed humans out of Earth. In Hebrew, the word used to represent the wind that God blew into Adams nostrils can be used to mean wind, breath or spirit. Thus, Adam only becomes a living human after he has been infused with the spirit/breath (Frigge, 2009).\n\nThe symbolic meaning of this is to portray human beings as being complex combinations of very different things. The divine part of humans can be regarded to be God’s own spirit. Human beings can also be described as weak earthly creatures. But human beings forget that they should depend on God for life and more often they put themselves at the same level as God (Halbur, 2007).\n\nConclusion\n\nThis paper sought to describe creation truths and myths as described in different written Christian interpretations. It has been established that the two first chapters of the book of Genesis are made of two contrasting myths that describe how God created man kind and all other things. However, things accounts are only contrasting when the literal meaning is taken. Deeper analysis, with a lot of support from the original Hebrew language, establishes the real meaning of these creation myths.\n\nReferences\n\nFrigge, M. (2009). Beginning Biblical Studies.

      "Fly Dubai Company’s Profile and Its Position in the Industry Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Fly Dubai’s Short History and Profile\n 3. Fly Dubai’s presence in the Industry\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nFly Dubai was named as a low cost airline of the year in Year 2011 Business Awards just two years after it opened its wings to the air space of United Arab Emirates among other surrounding regions. It is the newest airlines in UAE flying to about 48 destinations found in the, GCC, Subcontinent, Middle East Belt, Africa, Central and East Europe.\n\nThe Airliner offers services to connect to the passengers destinations through Dubai with no extra issues or charges. This paper will therefore concentrate on explaining about the company in holistic approach starting from company profile to its position in the industry.\n\nFly Dubai’s Short History and Profile\n\nFlyDubai was formed in the year 2009 on May as a limited liability company. The major shareholder is the Government of UAE and the Chairman of the Board of Directors is Ahmad Bin Saeed Al Maktoum.\n\nIn the management position, the CEO is Ghaith Saeed Khalaf Al Gaith, Hamad Obaidallah as the Chief Commercial Officer and Neil Mills is the Chief Financial Officer among others. The carrier has positioned itself as a low cost airliner that combines quality, efficiency, high standards as well as innovations in the aerospace industry in Middle East.\n\nThis is clearly illustrated by the awards Low Cost Airliner of the Year, Technology Implementation of the Year award and Personal Achievement of the Year for the CEO Ghaith Al Ghaith. It has been recognized as one of the new airliners in the industry that has championed high standards of quality service as well as amenities that serve to maintain the region’s standards. This is particularly impressive on the fact that the services offered are convenient and affordable for travel whether on business or economic class.\n\nIn a survey conducted by You Gov Siraj, (Attwood, 2010) it was noted that an increased number of business personality have turned to Low Cost Carriers, 64 percent as compared to 48 percent in 2009. Fly Dubai has thus positioned itself together with other LCCs like Sharjah’s Air Arabia, Fly Dubai, Nasair and Bahrain as the leading champion. It therefore stands to benefit with the increased growth towards low cost flights by the business world especially for connecting to India.\n\nFly Dubai’s presence in the Industry\n\nFly Dubai offers about 46 destinations flights services to the Middle East, Europe and Parts of Africa. The booking offers three types of fare that offers flexibility. The three fares include ‘No Change’, ‘Pay Change’ and ‘Free Change’ categories which include the price of the seat, all taxes and one handbag that weighs up to 7 kg as well as a small laptop bag or handbag.\n\nThis probably explains its attraction to many business experts as well as its rising role as leader in Low Cost Carrier category of the aerospace industry in UAE. FlyDubai has outlined four ways for booking namely, the fly dubai.com website as the most convenient, cheap and easy way. Secondly, a client can use the fly Dubai’s call centre, fly Dubai travel shop and travel patterns to book a flight all at a small fee for the services.\n\nIn addition, the booking system of Fly Dubai allows clients to choose on option extras that require small fees and can allow seat selection as well as legroom determination. The airline keeps the checking-in time strict and efficient with stipulated hours followed as expected. For the traveling with checked baggage a client is not supposed to arrive later than 60 minutes before take off while for traveling without checked baggage arriving less than 60 minutes before take off means no traveling and no refund (Fly Dubai, 2012).\n\nIn the bagging policy besides an allowance of the 7 kg baggage plus a laptop of small handbag, there is the option of pre-purchasing a 20, 30 or 40 kg checked baggage. The 7 kg baggage must not be more than 56 cm x 45 cm x 25cm and no other single piece of the three pieces allowed should weigh more than 32 kg as well as exceed 75 cm x 55 cm x 35 cm. A client can acquire pre-purchased baggage at an airport using the applicable per kilo rate. This forms the baggage policy.\n\nFly Dubai does not offer refunds to its clients instead fly Dubai vouchers are used. The ‘No change’ fare means absolutely there is no change of fare once paid hence no refund if flight is cancelled. Clients benefit from the pay to change program by choosing a flight at only AED 100 or by just loosing AED 150 if they cancel the flight (Fly Dubai, 2012).\n\nWith the ‘Free to change’ fare program flexibility is maintained by a minimum cost. A 100AED charge is dropped when changes are done in 24 hours before take off. If the flight is changed in less than 24 hours time before departure each person is charged AED 365 per flight and payment of the higher difference must occur while on the lower side fly Dubai voucher is issued.\n\nSince there are no refunds, fly vouchers are given to clients who must have valid PINs, be person named on the voucher and be named travelers. Other promotions offered include refreshments vouchers issued in three hours interval schedules incase of delayed flights. FlyDubai allows it clients to choose their options for return travel after cancellation or rescheduling of flight as it informs the client on the new developments. These form some of the promotion mechanisms that FlyDubai has exercised to one of the best in the industry.\n\nIn terms of paying FlyDubai offers Master Card or visa as the two ways that clients can use to pay. FlyDubai holds the booking for 24 hours to allow payment through its partners. The use of credit card to pay for someone else allows also for flexibility as a way to market FlyDubai.\n\nNonetheless the photocopy of the credit card and passport are needed at the airport where failure to produce them leads to denied permission to travel. This is a measure to enhance security for its clients. To make payments easier, FlyDubai has partnered with a number of partners in the most efficient system that incorporates the factors of flexibility, distance, geography and choice.\n\nA client can pay through a FlyDubai travel shop using cash, use UAE exchange, Emirates Post, Emirates NBD, Dubai Islamic Bank, ADCB among others. These partners offer unique, fresh and different ways of accessing the FlyDubai payment services for purposes of convenience. Other partners like UAE visas help in acquisition of visas, Bus services allows connection to ground terminals like Abu Dhabi just like the great services of Car rental (Fly Dubai, 2012).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe airliner is one of the most promising carriers in Middle East and surrounding regions. With its clear usage of technology, efficiency, use of high standards, Fly Dubai proves the leading LCC enjoying a large market share in its short life span. Although a number of employee capacities are still under application review the company has proved its capability thus when the full team comes on board then it will grab attentions in the world class airliners.\n\nReferences\n\nAttwod, E., (2010).

      "Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children – An Eternal Creation of the Twentieth Century Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nBrecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children is an eternal creation\n\nBertolt Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children is one of the greatest plays of the 20 th century. It raises essential issues which any person should try to respond. Being written during the most horrible war in the history of humanity it cannot but maintain its importance throughout times.\n\nOf course, this play was played by many performers and interpreted by many play writers and theatre directors. One of the most remarkable interpretations of Brecht’s masterpiece is George C. Wolf’s play which forces people to think about the eternal values and the horrors of war which should be stopped on the Earth and in each person’s heart. The purpose of the present paper is to reveal the great power of the play which is aimed at revealing the filthy nature of war.\n\nThe theme of the play\n\nThe Brecht’s play depicts several episodes of the main heroine’s life during the Thirty Years’ War. The play’s structure is linear since there is always a definite time reference in each scene. For instance the play opens up with certain year identification: Spring, 1624 (Brecht 23).\n\nThe main character of the play is Mother Courage, a canteen woman who tries to trade to survive during the war. She has three children, two sons Eilif and Swiss Cheese, and a daughter, Kattrin. Mother Courage is a strong woman who has to live in a very difficult time. She loses her children because of the war but still tries to move on.\n\nThe play’s main idea and the way it is revealed\n\nBrecht reveals cruelty of death and senselessness of war depicting the poor woman losing her children. In this play he reflects the events of the real life which he could witness since so many women were wailing over their children. Brecht’s main idea, the horror and foolishness of war is especially vivid in the scene where Mother Courage is singing over her daughter’s body.\n\nThe sorrow of one mother reveals the tragedy of many countries. Of course, not only the plot makes it one of the greatest plays. Any detail of this work is thoughtful and meaningful, even silence is always an emphasis of a feeing or a certain atmosphere.\n\nEvery word is very precise and serves to create the necessary effect. For instance, Mother Courage always uses really simple language and describes really terrible events as if it was not a big deal. Thus, she speaks about her going through bombardment as if it is absolutely logical and simple to save her products (bread) under bombs: “They were going moldy, what else could I do?”(Brecht 25).\n\nSo, every word or pause drives a deep image of horrible war into viewers mind. The canteen wagon itself impacts greatly the viewers since it creates an image of unsettled life of ordinary people facing danger every minute of their lives. There is no much setting but it is as precise as the verbal means. Thus, the wagon speaks louder than even performers can.\n\nThe Public Theatre interpretation of Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children\n\nAs far as the stage interpretations of the play are concerned it is necessary to point out that the play is quite easy to put on stage. Brecht though everything over to every tiny detail: the plot, the themes, characters. It may seem that it is not so easy to perform such epic play, especially it is very hard for the cast. However, the emotions evoked by the play inspire everyone to perform in the best possible way and reveal the main idea of the play.\n\nA good example of such great work is the Public Theatre (New York 2006) interpretation of Brecht’s Mother Courage and Her Children . George C. Wolf made a really great play managing to feel Brecht ideas and create the necessary atmosphere. The context of the modern life, where the war is still present, the contemporary society shares Brecht’s beliefs about the war. Meryl Streep who performed in the play (Mother Courage) was inspired by the play and agreed to participate in the project at once.\n\nIn the film, Theatre of War, she said that she thought of those women who were still losing their children and she had no hesitations as for the participation. Her performance proves that she was totally committed to performance since she succeeded to create unforgettable vital image of Mother Courage. Her song over Kattrin is really heartfelt and touching.\n\nThe value of the interpretation of 2006\n\nPerhaps, such dedication made this interpretation not only a very successful play but a genuine masterpiece. To my mind, George C. Wolf created the interpretation which could flatter the author. First of all, Wolf managed to reveal the atmosphere of Brecht’s work and the main idea of the play.\n\nThe performance in the Public Theatre was a precise reflection of the main purpose of Brecht’s work since every detail was thought over. Thus, the precision of both Brecht and Wolf reminds people about the eternal values of humanity and the horrors of the war in peoples’ hearts.\n\nWork Cited\n\nBrecht, B.

      "Protestant Music: A Sociological Perspective of the Relationship between Reggae and Moral Decadence Essay\n\nToday, more than ever before, the role played by music in shaping our thought systems and our interactions with others can never be underestimated. It is safe to argue that music has not only been able to transcend cultural and racial boundaries to find appeal universally, but has also assisted civilizations across the world to find their own exclusive social niche, bringing them together with other individuals and societies that collectively share the same interest (Durant, 2010).\n\nThe reggae music genre has particularly been instrumental in communicating the message of resistance against political and social systems that appear biased to the interests of the blacks not only in Jamaica where the genre originated, but also across the world (Alvalez, 2008).\n\nThrough sampling some of lyrics of Bob Marley, the proclaimed founder of the Rasta movement, this paper will purpose to show how the musical messages of resistance to political and social systems have served to fuel social decadence and crime in contemporary world.\n\nIt is a well known fact that music is a communicative apparatus that is used and shared by individuals around the world to emphasize their values and articulate new notions. Reggae music is no exception. Bob Marley brought into the world revolutionary ideologies of love, peace, unity, and independence, all wrapped together in a message of political revolution to free the blacks from the colonial masters that had invaded Africa and other parts of the world (Alvarez, 2008).\n\nHis Redemption Song in particular rallied the blacks to be strong in the face of white domination using the following lyrics: “Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery, none but ourselves can free our minds, have no fear of atomic energy, cause none of them can stop the time. How long shall they kill our prophets, while we stand aside and look? Ooh! Some say it’s a part of it: we’ve got to fulfill the book” (Elyrics.Net, 2010, para. 2).\n\nMarley may have had very valid reasons for singing against the system especially with the realization that racism and subjugation of blacks was at its peak during his era. His lyrics together with contributions of other black civil rights activists such as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King greatly assisted Africans and black Americans to nurture their own identity and demand for recognition as human beings rather than slave subjects (Alvarez, 2008).\n\nBob in particular was able to question authority while vividly portraying the agony and suffering of the black community through music. It is therefore sad to note how his legacy has been used to cause social decadence and acts of crime in the name of Rastafarian movement (Rommen, 2006).\n\nRoots reggae and its teachings have become deeply entrenched in the lifestyles of many people across the world. The real value of the music, however, has undergone great transformations mostly to the negative. In the U.S., for example, “reggae has tended to be the soundtrack for college kid’s ganja smoking rather than spiritual or political struggle” (Miner, 2003, para. 2).\n\nThis scenario is replicated around the world, where reggae music is increasingly becoming identified with drug-taking behavior more than the ideals it represented some few decades ago mainly due to personal habits and drug life of a few musicians. This problem can be traced back to the issues of self and identity.\n\nAccording to Stets & Burke (n.d.), “…by taking the role of the other and seeing ourselves for others’ perspectives, our responses come to be like other’s responses, and the meaning of the self becomes a shared meaning” (p. 4). In equal measure, the kids internalize the images of marijuana-puffing musicians and carry them as their own, hence falling into the bottomless pit of drugs.\n\nReggae music has also enhanced moral decadence through the misconception of its lovers that it advocates gangbanging, violent political and social revolutions, and degradation of life (Alvarez, 2008). In sociological perspectives, this problem can be attributed to the issue of self-concept.\n\nAs individuals’ attempts to cut an image of who they are to their own selves and other members of society, they inexorably develop a vivid perception of their own personality (Stets & Burke, n.d.).\n\nThe problem lies in the fact that individuals who have a negative identity are more likely to develop a negative self-concept of their own personalities. Going back to reggae music, it is evidently clear that the message was directed to the poor black masses in society to put their acts together and rise above the challenges presented to them by the wealthy people.\n\nBut due to negative identity and negative self-concept ingrained upon the youths by a few busybodies, we have reached situations where the youths are taking other people’s property by force in the name of equal rights and justice (Shorter, 2004). This scenario has been experienced in Zimbabwe and South Africa, where blacks forcefully seize property belonging to the whites in an attempt to redeem their own status.\n\nAccording to Alvarez (2008), “…reggae has emerged as one vehicle for indigenous and other marginalized populations to articulate their struggles against incursions of transnational capital into the local communities” (p. 576).\n\nThis is a good struggle, but in the modern world, it is been carried in ways that often deny the rights and dignity of others. In some African communities, members subscribing to this movement maim and kill other blacks who do not subscribe to their ideals not mentioning the fact that they forcefully circumcise their women (Shorter, 2004).\n\nThis only helps to increase moral decadence in society. Alvarez (2008) further postulates that “…it is particularly evident that the deeply gendered nature of indigenous reggae often replicates much of the male-dominated and hyper-masculine character of the larger music industry, indigenous communities, and national societies in which these artists and their fans reside” (p. 593).\n\nMany contemporary reggae artists have deviated from the ideals of the 1960s and 1970s reggae to bring their own world views. For example, many modern reggae artists equate resistance as presented in Bob Marley’s songs to some form of warrior-like clandestine activity (Alvarez).\n\nThis has had a negative impact on the lifestyles of the youth who learn and imitate what they hear or see in the environment. In sociological perspectives, it is evidently clear that much of the learning and socialization is facilitated by the environment (Rommen, 2006). In this case, it can be argued that negative socialization occurs to the youth who listen to such messages, further necessitating moral decadence.\n\nTo conclude, it can be firmly stated that reggae continues to cause social decadence and acts of crime in mainstream society, not because of what it is or what it stand for, but because of issues of negative self-concept, negative identity, and negative socialization processes.\n\nBob Marley, the founder of the music genre, had very good intentions in rallying the black population in resisting against racism, subjugation, mistreatment, and poor living conditions that were prevalent among the blacks due to overbearing political and social systems. Nevertheless, individual and societal factors have come into play to change that message into a platform of engaging in crime and drugs under the banner of resistance to the system (Rommen, 2006). Certainly, this is the wrong approach.\n\nReference List\n\nAlvarez, L. (2008). Reggae rhythms in dignity’s Diaspora: Globalization, indigenous identity, and the circulation of cultural struggle.

      "The U.S. Capitol Building Report (Assessment)\n\nThe U.S. Capitol Building is located in Washington, D.C., at the opposite end of the National Mall. To its west are the Capitol Reflecting Pool and the Washington Monument. The building covers a ground area of 4 acres and its length of roughly 750 feet. The Capitol is a majestic building with a height of 87.8 meters (288 ft), catering to its five floors and approximately 540 rooms.\n\nIt also has a dome with a diameter of 75 feet that has a 15 feet tall statue called the Statue of Freedom. Situated under the dome is a vast circular room, referred to as the Rotunda, which serves as a gallery for works of art of Americas’ important people and events in the country’s history.\n\nConstruction of the Capitol begun in 1793 after the United States Congress passed the Residence Act which paved way for Washington D.C. to be the permanent capital. In 1792, US Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and President George Washington had commissioned a design competition that would award $500 and a lot in the city to anyone who would produce the most approved plan for the building.\n\nA Scottish trained physician won the competition although he had submitted a late entry. The word capitol has its roots in Latin, which means city on a hill. Throughout its 200 year history, the Capitol has housed the Senate, the House of Representatives, the Supreme Court and the Library of Congress.\n\nThe Senate and the House wings were completed in the years 1800 and 1811 respectively. While still in construction, the building was partially burned by British troops in 1814 during a war that lasted till 1815. Repairs and reconstruction of the building begun in the following year and were completed four years later, under Benjamin Henry Latrobe, a British-born American architect. The building was finished in 1826 under Charles Bulfinch, a Bostonian architect. (Reed, 45)\n\nThe architecture of the building portrays Greco-Roman influence as the Capitol was meant to symbolize the idea of democracy, which is connected with Greece, and the idea of power, which is associated with the Roman Empire. The front of the Capitol is supported by six Corinthian columns, a major component of Roman architecture.\n\nColumns were originally used by the Greek but Romans adopted and modified them to commemorate their civilization and military success. A typical Roman Corinthian column is tall, straight and slim, topped with acanthus leaves and several scrolls. The scrolls were symbolic of civilization, and together with the acanthus leaves, were features cherished by Greco-Roman artists.\n\nThe other entrances also used the Greek Parthenon and the Roman Pantheon for inspiration for its design. The facades are made of marble and features figures of prominent people in the ancient world and the writings on both the eastern and western facade. Writings and sculptures were dominant features in Roman Pantheons.\n\nThe dome of the Capitol also resembles the Pantheon dome. The architects of the dome, paid close attention to St. Peter’s Basilica in Rome, the Pantheon in Paris and St. Paul’s Cathedral in London. The interior of the dome, the Rotunda, features murals (artwork painted directly on walls and ceilings) done by Constantino Brumidi, a Greek/Italian American artist. The artwork illustrates historical events and people in the United States.\n\nThe most outstanding artwork is The Apotheosis of Washington, which depicts Washington surrounded by 13 maidens and many Greek and Roman gods and goddesses. The relief sculptures in the Rotunda as well as the art in the Brumidi Corridors bear similarities with paintings and sculptures found in most European churches built during the reign of the Roman Empire.\n\nThe Capital also features a crypt beneath the Rotunda. The crypt was originally meant to be the final resting place of the first American President, George Washington. Unlike the exterior of the building, the columns in the crypt are Doric, the original Greek design. Crypts were dominant in ancient Greece and later adopted by Romans to be used as a chapel or burial vault.\n\nThe purpose of building the US Capitol crypt clearly illustrates that the architects relied a lot on Greek-Roman architecture. Furthermore, the statue on the dome (Statue of Freedom) is a female figure wearing robes holding a wreath of victory on one hand and resting her hand on a sheathed sword with her right hand. The Statue of Freedom thus bears similarity with the Justitia, the Roman goddess of justice who symbolized the fair and equal administration of law. (Silate 56)\n\nThe Capitol continues to serve its purpose as the symbol of freedom and democracy whereby every four years, a president is inaugurated at the grounds of the Capitol. It also hosts other major events such as the National Memorial Day concert and Independence Day celebrations. It still serves as the meeting point of the Senate, in the north wing, and the House of Representatives, in the south wing.\n\nThe Capitol no longer serves the Supreme Court and the chamber, referred to as the Old Supreme Court, is currently used as a meeting room, law library and storage room. The Capitol receives an estimated 4-5 million visitors from around the world per year. A Visitor Center has been set up in the underground of the east side of the complex to serve as a gathering point for tourists. The Capitol strives to preserve American history while at the same time aiming to meet modern standards. It truly is the home of American democracy.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nReed, Henry H.

      "Being a College Student Reflective Essay\n\nIt is quite impossible to provide a universally accepted definition as to what does it mean being a college student. The reason for this is simple – there are as many points of view, in this respect, as there are students. Nevertheless, it is possible to reflect upon how I believe college students should be positioning themselves in life, which in turn would allow them to live up to the title. In this essay, I will aim to do just that.\n\nFirst, I think that being a college student means being a responsible individual, who believes that the studying represents its foremost priority. Therefore, under no circumstances may college students neglect taking care of academic assignments, provided by their teachers.\n\nMoreover, in order for just about any college student to be able to succeed academically, he or she must never cease striving to expand its intellectual horizons. Unfortunately, many students adopt a rather light approach towards pursuing a degree, which in turn undermines their chances of obtaining a diploma. In its turn, this also implies that, in order for college students to excel in their studies, they must be willing to act in a thoroughly self-disciplined manner.\n\nSecond, being a college student suggests one’s willingness to not only memorize the taught material but to reflect upon it critically. What it means is that, every time when teachers present students with their own views on the significance of what they teach, students should be able to challenge these views.\n\nBeing the representatives of younger generations, college students have all the right to have their opinions heard. After all, it will be up to them to define the ways of the future. Therefore, ever since their early years, young people who expect to become college students should strive to form their own opinions about the actual meaning of life.\n\nThird, even though that, in order for people to qualify to become college students, they must be thoroughly comfortable with the notion of responsibility, this however does not imply that they should only be concerned with the studying. Quite on the contrary – trying to have fun, whenever is possible, is the important part of students’ life.\n\nTherefore, there is nothing wrong about college students attending parties in their spare time, for example. By doing that, students are able to improve their communicational skills, which in turn should help them to grow into socially responsible individuals in the future.\n\nFourth, being a college student means being willing to lead a physically healthy lifestyle. After all, it would prove quite impossible to imagine a drug-addict, for example, being in a position to qualify to enroll in a particular college, in the first place. It is understood, of course, that many college students simply lack time to be actively engaging with sports.\n\nThis, however, should not prevent them from doing basic physical workouts on a daily basis. By leading healthy lifestyles, college students will not only able to benefit from it physically but also mentally. As the famous saying goes – healthy bodies contain healthy spirits.\n\nFifth, being a college student means being able to take an active stance in life. College students are expected to take part in social and political discussions, because by doing it they can well contribute to the well-being of a society in which they live.\n\nMoreover, students’ willingness to do so is being consistent with the overall purpose of their studies, as such that are supposed to turn them into socially productive citizens. Therefore, it is crucially important for college students to never skip an opportunity to make their voice heard, when it comes to discussing particularly controversial issues.\n\nSixth, being a college student means being willing to work on projects, relevant to the chosen career. For example, students that specialize in engineering are being often required to come up with their own designs for bridges, whereas, students that specialize in architecture are being encouraged to work on inventing new architectural styles.\n\nApparently, it represents a matter of crucial importance for college students to not only strive to attain a professional excellence in the chosen professional field, but also to derive an emotional satisfaction out of pursuing a degree. And, one of the ways how students can go about deriving such a satisfaction, is applying their theoretical knowledge in practice.\n\nSeventh, being a college student means being willing to assist its underachieving classmates in coping with academic assignments. As we are being well aware of, whereas, some students do not experience any problems with the studying, others do.\n\nVery often, it comes because of these students’ exposure to poverty in their private lives. Yet, for as long as underachieving students get to experience the sensation that, despite their inability to score high, while tested, they nevertheless continue being appreciated by their peers, they will be more inclined to apply an additional effort into trying to catch up.\n\nEighth, being a college student implies that the concerned individual should never cease referring to its teachers in a respectful way. Nowadays, it became a common practice among many students to blame teachers for receiving low grades. This situation, however, cannot be considered thoroughly normal.\n\nThis is because, even though many teachers do seem to act in a rather intolerant manner towards some students, they are far from trying to cause these students any intentional harm. Quite on the contrary – such teachers’ behavior simply reflects their willingness to help the concerned students with obtaining diplomas. After all, it is only those students that pass final exams, who are able to graduate.\n\nHowever, sometimes is it particularly the lack of self-discipline, on the part of underachieving students, which hampers their chances to obtain a diploma. Therefore, before blaming teachers on the account of their assumed intolerance, responsible students should consider the possibility that their positioning, in this respect, may not be fully justified.\n\nI believe that the provided earlier definition of what it means being a college student is thoroughly appropriate. Even though it is being concerned with reflecting my personal opinions, I consider them perfectly valid.\n",
      "“No Name Woman”. Maxine Hong Kingston’s Short Story Essay\n\n“No Name Woman” is a short story written by Maxine Hong Kingston and was included in her book The Woman Warrior, with the first publication date in 1975. Kingston commences the novel by arguing that all myths and tales are contingent on specific cultural necessities. This story provides an ambiguous and complex talk-story; the role of the female in Chinese traditions and the difficulty of been raised as a Chinese American girl. The “No name Woman” essay shall provide an analysis of the gender aspects in the short story.\n\nThe Plot of the Story\n\nThe story tells of Kingston’s aunt, who was abandoned by the other members of the family. The aunt was pregnant and was raided on the night she was supposed to give birth; the raiders stole and destroyed family property, and the aunt gave birth in a pigsty while in exile. The aunt took away her life and her newborn baby by plunging into a well in China.\n\nThis story sounds like a cautionary tale. Kingston’s mother cautions her to keep silence and not tell anyone about the aunt’s story, and this story came at the time she had begun menstruating and was warning her or else she would end up like the aunt. As is clear from “No Name Woman” summary, Kingston as the narrator reflects this with the kind of life she was brought up in – an invisible world of spirits migrating from Chinese rural life to the exile home in America.\n\nSince Kingston cannot inquire about the aunt’s name, she refers to her as “no name woman” and comes up with reasons as to why her aunt was tempted into her outlawed urges. In one instance, she describes the aunt as a shy lady who is lured into giving in by a rapist. While in another, the aunt harbors a gradually growing intimate, attempting to seduce men by making up herself neatly.\n\nKingston’s fantasies may have been sympathetic about her own life. For instance, she denies the view that the aunt was a vicious woman with weak principles and had committed a crime, which Kingston argues she was acting in her passions, although she had broken the Chinese values and traditions.\n\nTo reveal the difficulties in society, Maxine Hong Kingston in “No Name Woman” uses numerous dichotomies and conflicts: between the private and public, merriment and essentials, the person’s wants for expression and society’s desire for organizing. She pictures how old Chinese culture was like; repressiveness, strictly controlled community in which one did not have a private life. Society’s sake or well-being dictated one’s actions.\n\nIn this case, Kingston’s aunt’s character represents the worst extent of aggression, her private passions (publicized by her unwanted child) interfered with the social order and threatened the continuity of the society. Kingston argues that in situations of plenty, adultery could have been only a mistake when members of the village expected everyone to cooperate in providing food, although it was criminalized.\n\nThe author introduces many views on her aunt’s motives and reasons, together with the experiences she had encountered in her life. She quotes that “Any man within visiting distance would have been neutralized as a lover—‘brother,’ ‘younger brother,’ ‘older brother’-one hundred and fifteen relationship titles.”\n\nFeminism and Its Dependance on Cultures in the Story\n\nKingston highlights the differences between Chinese and American cultures. The narration of Kingston’s shows that the cultural values that one adopts depend on oneself. Kingston relates her ideas and beliefs around this story she heard of her aunt. Kingston tries to delve deeper into the intentions of her aunt and intends to tie the whole narrative about her aunt to her personal experience.\n\nKingston tries to study and analyze more her Chinese culture and to discover her identity. Kingston quotes, “I have pursued to convert myself to Chinese-feminine. If I make myself American-pretty, so that the five or six Chinese boys in the class fell in love with me, everyone else (the Caucasian, Negro, and Japanese boys) would too.”\n\nKingston tries to be conspicuous. She does not want to be associated with the Chinese American girl. This shows her relationship with the aunt, who was not conventional with social values and expectations. She is to be engaged, raise her own family, although she never reveals the issue of any sexual intimacy. This highlights her enduring struggle between her traditional Chinese social values and Americanisation.\n\n“No Name Woman” short story is a mixture of creative detail and personal musing. The story describes how important it was for the villagers to do away with sexual attraction among tribesmen and how Kingston disobeys this and makes herself attracted to men. Kingston uses metaphors such as round cakes and doorways to describe the roundness of the patriarchal Chinese culture, that is, the perception that all members of the society are interdependent and responsible for each other’s deeds.\n\nThe story ends in a mimic of its format; her mother warns her again not to tell anyone about her aunt. Kingston is amazed by the reason why her aunt was left out the way she was.\n\nIn American society, the idea of adultery is not reason enough to leave and outfit individuals in their family, even when they are pregnant. Kingston highlights how there is logical dubiousness of her mother witnessing the raid when her mother and the aunt were living in the same house, although such improbability gives her the freedom to progress in reconstructing the tale. Thus, it is clear that, along with the feminist subject, one can identify some postmodernism elements in her story.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe story told by Kingston’s mother centered on the agony of the raid and the accusation without providing any details about the kind of a woman her aunt was like or what her motivation was.\n\nThe “No Name Woman” essay shows that the story is two two-fold, Kingston was afraid of being attracted to boys and discovered that being more sisterly was more critical as she realizes the only punishment for the aunt was being abandoned, as the backing of the village was vital not only in life but also in death. Although the story did not define whether the no-name aunt was her aunt, it impacted greatly on her development as a woman.\n",

      "Background\n\nBernard Herrmann is one of the great modern composers. His work for TV and film is nothing short of iconic, and is truly synonymous with mid-20th Century cinema. Collaborating with Orson Welles on Citizen Kane, Martin Scorsese on Taxi Driver, and in long-term partnership with Alfred Hitchcock for scores such as Vertigo, Psycho, The Birds, Marnie and beyond, the sheer magnitude of critical works produced is breathtaking. Not only did his work cause significant impact on culture at the time, but more recently those works have been used to invigorate contemporary scores, for example the use of the Twisted Nerve theme in Quentin Tarantino's Kill Bill - an eerie whistle which is now instantly recognisable worldwide.\n\n\nHerrmann had a unique and trailblazing compositional style. His orchestrations were entirely original, daring and inventive; always appropriate for the context and subsequently incredibly influential in film scoring (Psycho is an obvious example of a totally new way to score a thriller). The bold selection of specific instrumental ensembles (his Psycho score was famed for being strings-only, and the infamous Torn Curtain featured 12 flutes) and choice of interesting combinations (harp and vibraphone in Vertigo, stopped horns and pizzicato strings in North by Northwest) challenged the status quo. Equally his experimentation of electronic instruments in scores was pioneering - the ondes Martenot in The Day The Earth Stood Still and amplified Moog synths in Sisters/Endless Nights brought sounds previously unheard to cinemas. He also went as far as to effect change in the performance style of players, requesting that players not play in the traditional, somewhat overblown nature that other Hollywood composers would traditionally employ.\n\n\nHe had a limitless curiosity and love of new music, championing the careers of several composers who became household names as a result of his hard work. His work as conductor of the CBS Symphony Orchestra, and the many radio broadcasts he made with them, helped to bring a huge and often little heard variety of music to a wide audience.\n\n\nHis was a truly individual voice and he stood firm against what he saw as the dilution of the art form and he continues to be massively respected and influential among film composers today.\n\n\nSo, of course, when the opportunity arose for Spitfire Audio to collaborate with his estate, we crumbled with excitement. We hope to have developed a unique library that provides working composers with a broad variety of new sounds and possibilities, albeit rooted in the genius of Herrmann and his approach to film scoring.",

      "Osasuna Sporting Director Petar Vasiljevic in a statement on future signings has stated the club wants to try and keep Mikel Merino another year by signing him on-loan from BVB.\n\nMerino was crucial to Osasuna in their promotion campaign this year, scoring multiple goals and assists in the Liga Adelante playoffs. With some major contributors leaving BVB this offseason, it;s possible Dortmund will not be willing to loan out Merino back to his former club.\n\nWith a lack of depth, it would be risky to send the impressive Spanish midfielder away from Dortmund.

      "The Trans-Pacific Partnership: Undermining Human Rights\n\nThe controversial Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) was a massive, controversial, pro-corporate \"free trade\" agreement that was defeated by thousands of diverse organizations representing working people united across borders — fighting against corporate power and for the environment, health, human rights and democracy. It would have granted Malaysia, one of the world's worst human trafficking offenders, privileged access to the U.S. market. The Obama administration concluded TPP negotiations with Malaysia in October 2015, despite the discovery of mass graves for human trafficking victims in Malaysia. The TPP also included Vietnam, despite Vietnam's jailing of political dissidents, systematic anti-union repression and widespread use of child labor. The deal would have forged closer ties between the United States and Brunei, which has enacted a new Sharia-based penal code that criminalizes homosexuality and threatens to punish single mothers by stoning to death.\n\nThe TPP's inclusion of such notorious human rights abusers shocked and angered many members of Congress and leading human rights, labor, LGBT, women's and religious organizations.

      "The NFL stands for \"National Football League\" however, for many in the game, it is also known to mean \"not for long.\" Not only is it difficult to make it to the NFL, but to last more than a few seasons and be successful is rare and few and far between. Case in point, Ben Leber, played 10 seasons in the NFL as a linebacker for the San Diego Chargers, Minnesota Vikings and St. Louis Rams from 2002 to 2011. During his career, Ben was considered a versatile and cerebral player who carved out his niche as a leader both on and off the field. He finished his career with 496 tackles, 24 sacks, five interceptions, 12 forced fumbles in 143 games played (source: NFL.com). Since retiring from pro football in 2012, Ben has made the transition to broadcasting and currently works as a color commentator/analyst for FOX College Sports. He also does assorted NFL analyst work for a variety of radio and media outlets including KFAN FM 100.3 in Minneapolis/St. Paul, Minnesota. We were able to catch up with Ben last month (April 2014) to discuss his background, football and post-football endeavors and are pleased to present this interview. Please note that HalfKorean.com comments/questions are in BOLD. Background: The Basics on Ben Where and when were you born, raised and currently reside?\n\nI was born in Council Bluffs, Iowa and when I was about two we moved to a small town in southern Iowa called Albia. I lived there until I finished 5th grade and then we moved to Vermillion, South Dakota. That is where I went to high school and graduated from. My dad was a high school principal so that was why we kind of jumped around when he had better opportunities. He was in fact my high school principal. I currently live in Minneapolis, Minnesota. I played my last year of football in St. Louis but we had set our roots here in Minneapolis. So after that one year, we came back here and have been living here ever since. How did your parents meet?\n\nThe great mystery. You know, I don't know. So basically, my dad during the Vietnam War was stationed at an officer's R&R camp in Pusan, Korea. He worked there and – this is where it gets kind of foggy – I don't really know how they met. I don't know if they had met at a bar or if he was just around town. I don't know how they met but somehow they met and they started a relationship. Funny thing now and kind of gross to think about, my mom couldn't speak English and my dad spoke very little Korean so I can only imagine what the attraction was. So, then my dad goes back to the States and they continued their relationship via letters. She had to have a translator and vice versa. I'm not sure how much longer it was but eventually my dad sent a letter of proposal and she accepted and he flew her over to the States and they got married in Council Bluffs. We don't have a ton of details and I don't know why they won't answer and it's like they don't want to talk about the fine details. At this point, it don't really care because I kind of already know what happened in the back of my mind. You were an American GI who was partying with your friends and then you met some Korean girl and you hooked up. Do you have any siblings?\n\nYes, I have two older brothers and an adopted Korean sister that is a year and a half younger than me. How much Korean can you speak and understand?\n\nNot at all. That was one of the things that when I got older I was kind of upset with myself about. We were kids and I think we pushed back and wondered why do we need to speak Korean. I think we thought people were going to make fun of us and not know what we were saying. I wish my parents would have pushed it more because, now as an adult, it would have been awesome to know a second language and especially Korean. It would have been really cool. We can pick up some words from my mom when she talks with her friends. And, of course, we would get the cuss words in Korean from our mom as she would be yelling at us and she would just switch it over because she would get frustrated trying to find the right word in English and then would just go off on us in Korean. We would know that she was really pissed when should would yell at us in Korean! What is your favorite Korean food?\n\nI love it all and my mom is a fantastic cook. I haven't been to any place that has better kimchi than my mom's. That's probably one of the staple things that most Korean households would say, that they love their mom's kimchi. That's my favorite. She also makes the rice cake things that have hot pepper sauce with beef. If she puts",

      "PAIA — Saying \"nobody here wants this,\" angry residents voiced overwhelming opposition to TEACH, the group that plans to turn Old Maui High School into a center for agriculture, housing and education.\n\nHundreds of residents packed the Paia Community Center Monday evening, eager to speak out against a project that's been billed as a sustainable renovation of a campus that closed nearly 50 years ago.\n\n\"The whole purpose for doing this is not to make money, but to show that we can actually live differently and be much more conscious about how we live on the land . . . and to teach kids new skills that will hopefully make a big difference for their future,\" said Mark Chasan, chief executive officer of the for-profit TEACH.\n\nBut many thought the group used \"buzzwords\" to make the project seem more environmentally friendly. Makawao resident Mary Ann Pahukoa called it \"greenwashing.\"\n\n\"It would be really meaningful if TEACH would pack up and leave,\" Pahukoa said to loud cheers. \"Don't get fooled by sustainability and their vision. Hawaiians have been sustainable for centuries. . . . With or without TEACH, we will always remain sustainable.\"\n\nTEACH stands for technology, education, agriculture, community and health. In 2014, the county started looking for groups to repurpose the 23-acre campus in Hama-kuapoko and eventually selected TEACH. Owners and officers are residents of Maui, Oahu and the Mainland, according to Jason Hobson, chief development officer.\n\nOld Maui High School opened in 1913 but folded after students and faculty moved to the new Maui High campus in Kahului in 1972, according to the nonprofit Friends of Old Maui High School. Various groups have used the campus over the years, including the Maui Dance Council and the University of Hawaii. The Friends of Old Maui High School formed in 2004 to preserve the deteriorating campus.\n\nIn 2010, the state turned the land over to Maui County, which now gives the Friends of Old Maui High School between $65,000 to $100,000 annually in grants to do repairs on the campus.\n\nNow, TEACH hopes to turn the campus into a community hub. About half of the available acreage would be used for regenerative agriculture and permaculture, according to its website. The rest of the space would be converted into campus housing, an education center, a conference facility, youth programs and camp, a museum, amphitheater, restaurant and centers for wellness, culture, technology and food innovation.\n\nThe project is estimated to cost around $50 million. TEACH officials have said in the past that they would not ask the county for funding.\n\nBut many residents thought that TEACH was long on ideas and short on specifics. They repeated concerns from past meetings — that the project would attract more development to north shore green spaces and increase traffic in an area already notorious for it.\n\n\"We feel that this is a lynchpin that's going to open up a whole new set of development,\" Haiku resident Wangdu Hovey said. \"We don't know if that's going to be the center and then it's going to spread out from there. . . . I think a lot of people are really just pissed off because they don't know what's going to happen.\"\n\nResidents also were upset that the county was considering a low-priced, $1-a-year lease for 60 years, especially for a for-profit organization like TEACH.\n\nBut the county had offered the $1-a-year deal before it chose TEACH, \"in return for the campus to be used for a higher and better purpose than currently exists,\" according to the request for proposals in 2014. The county chose the low lease terms \"because of the millions it's going to take to fix the infrastructure,\" Office of Economic Development Director Teena Rasmussen said during a council committee meeting in November.\n\nChasan said TEACH's intention was \"not to build a Makawao or Paia.\"\n\n\"I don't think that this development will be the stimulus for more development,\" he said after the meeting. \"I think it might be the stimulus for the Paia bypass, hopefully. Hopefully that as development happens, which it will, at least the development will be (environmentally) conscious.\"\n\nSen. Kalani English said after the meeting that he was still unsure about what the project would offer. He too was concerned about the traffic.\n\n\"We are beyond capacity right now for this area,\" said English, whose district includes Hana, East and Upcountry Maui, Molokai and Lanai. \"I'm actually leaving with a lot more questions than I came in with. To sum it all up, the real question is, what are they doing? I still don't know.\"\n\nThe project is still awaiting",

Irish Mission and Dixie Strike top the morning line choices in this year's POW and both are fillies.\n\nWith the Queen's Plate winner, Strait of Dover, choosing not to make the trip back to the dirt course, which is probably smart seeing as he has had zero success so far, leaves a wide-open race. Inconsistent horses and the two favorites being fillies lead me to believe that we could have a good payout.\n\nMy long-shot pick in here is going to be dead on – I hope. Conveniently the horse I am going with is the aptly-named Dead On. Seems fitting, no? Dead On, trained by Malcolm Pierce, wintered in Florida where he ran a nice second in an Allowance race, which was obviously not for Ontario breds. The Fairgrounds is a dirt race course similar to Fort Erie that has very stiff competition for American Bred horses, which makes me believe he is able to run against tougher competition on the dirt than the Polytrack.\n\nRounding out my top three picks are Irish Mission, who has been blazing a storm on the dirt training track in morning, and Quaesitor, which I'm hoping Stein comes down to ride.\n\nIt will be an exciting day at the races with fancy hats, lots of people, big purses and as always that dream of hitting big at the mutuals. Best of luck to those who decide to make the races \"interesting\".\n\n…and that is the last word",

      "On the First Sunday of Advent 2011, Catholics in the United States who attend the Ordinary Form of Mass (commonly called the Novus Ordo, or sometimes the Mass of Paul VI) experienced the first major new translation of the Mass since the Novus Ordo was introduced on the First Sunday of Advent in 1969. This new translation was prepared by the International Commission on English in the Liturgy (ICEL) and approved by the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB).\n\nCompared with the previous translation used in the United States, the new translation is a much more faithful rendering in English of the third edition of the Missale Romanum (the definitive Latin text of the Mass and its associated prayers), promulgated by Pope Saint John Paul II in 2001.\n\nThe New Translation: Foreign Yet Familiar\n\nThe new translation of the text of the Mass may sound a little foreign to ears that had grown accustomed to the older, looser translation in use, with only minor changes, for over 40 years. On the other hand, for those who are familiar with English translations of the Extraordinary Form of the Mass (the Traditional Latin Mass that was used before Pope Paul VI promulgated the Novus Ordo Missae, the new order of the Mass), the new translation of the Ordinary Form of the Mass highlights the continuities between the Extraordinary and Ordinary Forms of the Roman Rite.\n\nWhy a New Translation?\n\nThis reassertion of tradition is one of the primary purposes of the new translation. In releasing Summorum Pontificum, his 2007 encyclical restoring the Traditional Latin Mass as one of the two approved forms of the Mass, Pope Benedict XVI made clear his desire to see the new Mass informed by the \"venerable and ancient usage\" of the Mass of Pope St.\n\nPius V (the Traditional Latin Mass). In a similar way, the Traditional Latin Mass will eventually gain new prayers and feast days added to the Roman calendar since the last revision of the Roman Missal for the Traditional Latin Mass in 1962.\n\nThe New Mass: Continuities and Changes\n\nThe changes (and their continuities with the older form of the Mass) are obvious from the first time the priest says, \"The Lord be with you.\" In place of the familiar \"And also with you,\" the congregation responds, \"And with your spirit\"—a literal translation of the Latin \"Et cum spiritu tuo,\" found in both forms of the Mass. The Confiteor (the penitential rite), the Gloria (\"Glory to God in the highest\"), the Nicene Creed, and the dialogue between the priest and the congregation after the Agnus Dei (\"The Lamb of God\") and immediately before Communion all hark back to the older form of Mass—as well they should, because both forms of the Mass share the same Latin text for these parts.\n\nStill, it would be a mistake to think that the new translation significantly alters the Novus Ordo. The changes put in place by Pope Paul VI in 1969 remain, as do all of the major differences between the Traditional Latin Mass and the Novus Ordo.\n\nAll the new translation does is to tighten up some very loose translations of the Latin text, restore a certain dignity to the English text of the Mass, and reinstate a few lines at various points in the Mass that had simply been dropped in the earlier translation from Latin to English.\n\nThe table below summarizes all of the changes in the parts of Mass recited by the congregation.\n\nChanges in the Parts of the People in the Order of Mass (Roman Missal, 3rd Ed.)\n\nPART OF THE MASS OLD TRANSLATION NEW TRANSLATION Greeting Priest: The Lord be with you.\n\nPeople: And also with you.

      "Russian Defense Ministry Months into Russia's campaign of air strikes in Syria, it's become clear that ISIS isn't the Russian military's true target.\n\nPentagon spokesman Col. Steve Warren said at a briefing on Wednesday that at most, only 10% of Russian strikes are hitting the terrorist group ISIS (also known as the Islamic State, ISIL, and Daesh) in Syria.\n\nThe vast majority of the strikes hit other groups fighting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad, who has be known to drop barrel bombs on civilian areas.\n\n\"The Russians at this point have made it very clear that their offensive operations … are in support of Bashar al-Assad and his regime,\" Warren said. \"So when the regime is fighting, whoever the regime is fighting, that's who gets struck.\"\n\nRussia only seems to hit ISIS when ISIS comes into contact with Syrian forces.\n\n\"Occasionally, the Syrian regime forces will find themselves in contact with ISIL,\" Warren said. \"And in those cases, we see the Russians striking ISIL. But it's very limited. A fraction.\"\n\nWhile ISIS and Assad are on opposite sides of the fight for control in Syria, they've largely avoided each other on the battlefield so far.\n\nAssad has something to gain from allowing ISIS to operate in certain areas because he's portrayed those who are opposed to his regime as \"terrorists.\" ISIS' strong presence in Syria bolsters Assad's argument, and assisting ISIS in its fight against rebel forces helps get rid of the more moderate opposition fighters who threaten Assad's power.\n\nAnd Assad's fight against non-terrorist rebel forces has had severe consequences for the people of Syria. Russia now appears to be aiding that fight.\n\nDozens of people starved to death in Madaya, Syria, after the government enacted a blockade in July to cut off access to nearby Damascus. Russia has supported Syrian denials of the humanitarian crisis in Madaya, saying that reports from the town contain \"fake pictures\" and \"phony news,\" according to the website Syria Deeply. The siege is ongoing.\n\nRussian airstrikes have also reportedly hit hospitals, according to aid groups. Russia denies the claims.",

      "Outside the Morgan County fair in McConnelsville, in a rural swath of Ohio that fervently backed US President Donald Trump in last year's election, ticket seller John Wilson quietly counts off a handful of disappointments with the man he helped elect.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nVisit Here for Cool Anti-Trumph T shirt,Hodies,Mug !\n\nThe 70-year-old retired banker said he is unhappy with infighting and turnover in the White House. He does not like Trump's penchant for traveling to his personal golf resorts. He wishes the president would do more to fix the healthcare system, and he worries that Trump might back down from his promise to force illegal immigrants out of the country.\n\n\"Every president makes mistakes,\" Wilson said. \"But if you add one on top of one, on top of another one, on top of another, there's just a limit.\"\n\nTrump, who inspired millions of supporters last year in places like Morgan County, has been losing his grip on rural America.\n\nAccording to the Reuters/Ipsos daily tracking poll, the Republican president's popularity is eroding in small towns and rural communities where 15% of the country's population lives. The poll of more than 15,000 adults in \"non-metro\" areas shows that they are now as likely to disapprove of Trump as they are to approve of him.\n\nThis slideshow requires JavaScript.\n\nVisit Here for Cool Anti-Trumph T shirt,Hodies,Mug !\n\nIn September, 47% of people in non-metro areas approved of Trump while 47% disapproved. That is down from Trump's first four weeks in office, when 55% said they approved of the president while 39% disapproved.\n\nThe poll found that Trump has lost support in rural areas among men, whites and people who never went to college. He lost support with rural Republicans and rural voters who supported him on Election Day.\n\nAnd while Trump still gets relatively high marks in the poll for his handling of the economy and national security, rural Americans are increasingly unhappy with Trump's record on immigration, a central part of his presidential campaign.\n\nOnly 47% of rural Americans said in September they approved of the president's handling of immigration, down from 56% during his first month in office.\n\nPoll respondents who were interviewed by Reuters gave different reasons for their dissatisfaction with the president on immigration.\n\nA few said they are tired of waiting for Trump to make good on his promise to build a wall along America's southern border, while others said they were uncomfortable with his administration's efforts to restrict travel into the US.\n\n\"There should be some sort of compromise between a free flow of people over the border and something that's more controlled,\" said Drew Carlson, 19, of Warrensburg, Missouri, who took the poll.\n\nBut Trump's \"constant fixation on deportation is a little bit unsettling to me.\"\n\nThe Trump administration would not comment about the Reuters/Ipsos poll.\n\nTo be sure, Trump is still much more popular in rural America than he is elsewhere.\n\nSince he took office, \"I like him less, but I support him more,\" said Robert Cody, 87, a retired chemical engineer from Bartlesville, Oklahoma who took the poll.\n\nCody said that Trump may rankle some people with the way he talks and tweets, but it is a small price to pay for a president who will fight to strip away government regulations and strengthen the border.\n\nVisit Here for Cool Anti-Trumph Mug !Visit Here for Cool Anti-Trumph Mug ! Dropping off the screen\n\nWhen Trump called the election a \"last shot\" for the struggling coal industry and when he called for protecting the nation's southern border with a \"big, fat, beautiful wall\", he was speaking directly to rural America, said David Swenson, an economist at Iowa State University.\n\n\"Feelings of resentment and deprivation have pervaded a lot of these places,\" Swenson said. \"And here comes a candidate (Trump) who's offering simplistic answers\" to issues that concern them.\n\nRural Americans responded by supporting Trump over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton by 26 points during the election, an advantage that helped tip the balance in battleground states, such as Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, where Trump won by less than 1 point.\n\nBut after 10 months, many are still waiting to see concrete changes that could make life easier in rural America, said Karl Stauber, who runs a private economic development agency serving a patchwork of manufacturing communities in south central Virginia.\n\n\"Rural people are more cynical about the federal government than people in general are,\" Stauber said. \"They've heard so many promises, and they've not seen much done.\"\n\nDespite all the talk of bringing manufacturing jobs back, Stauber said he has not seen any companies which have relocated to his region",
      "Women With A Berry-Snacking Habit May Have Healthier Hearts\n\ntoggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR\n\nWhen it comes to supernutritious foods, the blueberry has long had a health halo floating over it.\n\nGoing back to Colonial times when Native Americans and English settlers ground up blueberries and added them to porridge, in both dried and fresh forms, there have been hints of health-promoting effects.\n\nIn recent years, regular consumption of berries has been linked to better brain health and a decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes.\n\nNow, a new study published in the American Heart Association's journal Circulation suggests eating three servings per week of blueberries and strawberries helps cut the risk of heart attacks among some women.\n\n\"We showed for the first time that a regular intake of substances that are naturally present in red-, blue-colored fruits and vegetables can reduce the risk of a heart attack by about 32 percent in young and middle-aged women [ages mid-40s to 60],\" compared with women who ate berries once a month or less, says study author Aedin Cassidy of the University of East Anglia. The researchers found other fruits such as apples and pears were not associated with a decreased risk.\n\nTo study the relationship between berry consumption and heart disease, Cassidy and her collaborators at the Harvard School of Public Health analyzed findings from the Nurses Health Study 2 which includes more than 90,000 nurses in the U.S. Periodically over the past 18 years the nurses have reported details about their diets and lifestyles to researchers. At the same time, researchers have monitored the nurses' health to see which diseases they go on to develop, or not.\n\nIt's certainly not a perfect way to detect how certain foods may influence health, but it identifies important associations. Cassidy says the association between berry consumption and heart disease was strengthened when she and her collaborators controlled for other reasons that could have explained the finding.\n\n\"Even when we adjusted for things like fat intake, fiber intake, medication use, or body size, and for example, exercise, we still got these strong reductions in risk,\" Cassidy says.\n\nSo what's in blueberries that makes them so good for us? Researchers have pinpointed a class of plant compounds known as anthocyanins. These compounds give the red and blue color to everything from berries to eggplants to cherries. And when you eat a steady diet of them, they seem to have a number of positive health effects.\n\n\"They have effects on blood pressure in animal models,\" says Cassidy. And in lab experiments they're shown to exert anti-inflammatory effects, as well as help modulate nitric oxide in the body, which could help arteries stay more elastic and flexible.\n\nAll of these effects could be beneficial, explains Robert Eckel, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Colorado. But he says it's important to point out that the women in this study weren't prime candidates for heart attacks anyway.\n\n\"Having a heart attack when you're a woman between ages of 45 and 60 is distinctly unusual,\" says Eckel.\n\nWould the protective effect hold up for older women? Eckel says it's not clear.\n\n\"But nonetheless, for the first time I think we have some evidence that the intake of theses anthocyanins may have a protective effect.\"\n\nSo, go ahead. Load up on berries. And if they're out of season, like now, studies show frozen berries have similar levels of beneficial compounds.",

      "Posted\n\nJeff\n\nI had a Logitech G930 for about 6-7 years but was looking to upgrade after the microphone starting intermittently shorting out and the ears cups began to flake a bit over the last year. I chose the G533 for its cleaner design, feel and sound and have found it to be a nice improvement over the G930. It feels lighter, sits a bit more comfortably on my head and the cloth ear cups allow your ears to cool better than the 930's faux leather. With the newer 7.1 drivers in the G533 music has a more orchestral/auditorium feel to it compared to closer \"room\" sound I was getting with the G930, but you can tweak the equalizer to whatever sensitivity you want in the options menus. I have noticed that you are not able to tweak the treble and bass as much in the options now, but check youtube for some tutorials to get the settings that are preferable. Surround sound has improved well and I have noticed the directional noises (like footsteps, gunshots and vehicles in games like PUBG) are more precise and definitive to aid in gaming. Overall, the G533 headset has some nice improvements my previous G930 and I would say if your trying to decide between between the G533 or the G933, go with the style of headset you like. I looked at lots of reviews for both before deciding and ultimately chose the cleaner, more traditional styling of of the G533. I have been very happy with my purchase of the G533 so far and will likely have this set for a long time. It's comfortable, durable, has a 15-16 hour battery life and has a great sound.",
      "The misimpression that the liberals have taken the reins of the party has become widespread. To take just one representative example: \"The mainstream of the party has now veered back toward its more populist and pacifist instincts,\" Yahoo News' Matt Bai wrote Thursday, characterized by \"outright contempt for the wealthy and for conservatives generally.\" Like others who embrace this analysis, Bai draws the conclusion that this will be an obstacle to the presidential prospects of Hillary Clinton, who is perceived as hawkish, establishmentarian, and friendly to corporate interests.\n\nMany Democratic insiders minimize the party's divide. They note that there's broad ideological agreement on social and cultural issues, from abortion and gay marriage to gun control and immigration. National-security and foreign-policy questions have the power to divide but are no longer litmus tests. Even on economic issues, the party generally speaks with one voice: in favor of universal healthcare, against reducing safety-net programs, for progressive taxation and government-driven economic stimulus. Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress, told me in an email that the Democratic Party just doesn't get hung up on internecine battles these days. \"I believe that it's a big-tent party that can and should accommodate centrists and liberals,\" Tanden said. \"That ideological purity has not been a winning strategy for the other side.\"\n\nBut this high-altitude view elides real differences, such as disagreement over how much to raise taxes and on whom, how much to regulate industry, and whether to press not just to preserve but to expand those safety-net programs. (In addition to the Cuomo-de Blasio feud, Warren's signature proposal would increase Social Security benefits, and Obama's push for new free-trade agreements has run into resistance from Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid.) And the divide isn't so much about issues as tone and tactics. The Warrenites harp on the gap between rich and poor and inveigh against big business; the centrists assure their big corporate donors that Democrats can be business-friendly.\n\nThe comparison to Republicans is inevitable and instructive. No one seriously doubts anymore that the GOP is badly divided, with a right-wing faction that has virtually declared war on the more moderate establishment. But few of the party's politicians disagree on social or cultural issues (immigration is a notable exception), and the view that taxes should be lower and government smaller is virtually unanimous. What the Ted Cruz faction and the John Boehner faction disagree on is whether the party's rhetoric ought to be conciliatory or scorched-earth, and how far to go—shutting down the government? refusing to raise the debt ceiling?—in pursuit of agreed-upon goals like getting rid of Obamacare. The GOP's divide, like the Democrats', is more about tone than about issues.",
      "As if the shame and hassle of a drunk driving arrest and conviction aren't bad enough, a DUI comes with a hefty price tag, too. Your first DUI can cost upwards of $20,000 – and more – even without property damage or anyone harmed. The Alaska Department of Motor Vehicles estimates that the total expense of an initial DUI or DWI arrest and conviction costs the equivalent of a taxi ride half-way around the world.\n\nThe purpose of financial penalties for DUI offenses is to deter drunk driving, and little wonder why. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, 28 people die as a result of drunk driving crashes every day, and roughly one in three people will be involved in a drunk driving crash during their lifetimes.\n\nDon't become a statistic. Maker smarter decisions while drinking with a BACtrack Breathalyzer.\n\nThe High Price of Driving Under the Influence\n\nA myriad of expenses typically associated with a DUI conviction include bail, car towing or impound costs, court costs, legal fees, DUI education programs, higher insurance premiums, probation fees, drug and alcohol assessment and counseling, license reinstatement fees, and loss of work income. And that's the short list.\n\nIn addition, many states now require DUI offenders to install pricey ignition interlock devices, which connect to a car's ignition and monitor drivers' BAC levels. If alcohol is detected, the car will not start and may even trigger security alarms.\n\nIn addition, many states now require DUI offenders to install pricey ignition interlock devices, which connect to a car's ignition and monitor drivers' BAC levels. If alcohol is detected, the car will not start and may even trigger security alarms. (For those who have been convicted of DUI, this is a great reason to get a BACtrack--in order to test yourself before using the interlock ignition system). Some states also require DUI offenders to wear ankle bracelets that measure BAC – at the offenders' expense.\n\nHidden DUI Costs\n\nOther DUI costs are not as obvious. In all 50 states, DUI offenders temporarily lose their driving privileges. As a result, they must rely on alternate methods of transportation, which can quickly run up the DUI tab. Driver's license reinstatement fees must also be paid before full driving privileges are restored. A DUI conviction can also lead to the loss of a job, especially if the job requires driving a motor vehicle. The conviction may remain on the offender's record for 10 years. During the years following a drunk driving conviction, a DUI offender's car insurance can double, triple, or even quadruple. Some insurance companies move DUI offenders to higher-risk, higher-cost policies, and may even cancel coverage.\n\nDUI Costs Vary by State\n\nThe cost of a DUI conviction varies by state, but in every state the cost runs into the thousands of dollars. In New York, for example, the estimated minimum cost for a first DUI conviction is $9,500. The state of Illinois estimates the average DUI cost at $14,660.\n\nA DUI conviction can also lead to the loss of a job, especially if the job requires driving a motor vehicle. The conviction may remain on the offender's record for 10 years.\n\nA survey by the Texas Department of Transportation found that the average cost for a DWI arrest and conviction ranges from $9,000 to $24,000.\n\nMore Expensive for Teens\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drivers aged 15 to 19 are four times more likely to get into auto accidents than drivers in any other age category. As a result, the financial impact of a teen's first DUI is staggering. According to StopteenDUI.com, the total cost of annual auto insurance increases due to a DUI conviction for a teen driver could amount to $40,000 over a 13-year period.\n\nAverage Costs of a DUI or DWI Arrest and Conviction\n\nShown below is a list of typical expenses associated with first-time DUI offenses, and average costs and penalties. The fees and fines can be significantly higher for repeat DUI offenders, drunk drivers with extreme BAC levels, or drivers who are charged with any number of \"aggravating\" factors, such as an auto accident in which property damage or injuries to human life occurred.",
      "The Noob Guide to Online Marketing is arguably the greatest single post of all time. If you don't agree, well, it's at least my favorite. Oli Gardner (of Unbounce) displayed a playful writing style mixed with pixel perfect graphic design, and a GPS of a roadmap to take your site from mile marker zero to one hundred in six months. It's nothing short of amazing.\n\nWhile savvy content marketers realize that many of Oli's tactics will naturally attract links, fledgling link builders got to the 63rd page and were still wondering what to do. With this companion piece, it is my goal to grab the baton from Oli and outline a six-month link building action plan for your brand or client's new web property. Even if the website isn't brand spanking new, that's fine, what I really mean is that this is the link building plan for the less savvy looking to do dive into off page optimization. Marketers with long existing sites and more link building experience will be better served downloading the Complete Six-month Off Page SEO Gameplan from iAcquire.\n\nFollowing this guide in concert with Oli's you will identify your audience, build a list of prospects, plan and execute four successful pieces of content and convince influencers to create content for your site.\n\nSince we last spoke I left Publicis Modem to become the Director of Inbound Marketing at iAcquire which is a technology-focused off page seo agency. I encourage you to read the \"Quantifying Outreach\" study that I released at LinkLove London wherein I examined nearly 300k outreach emails from both our own iRank platform and Buzzstream's CRM software. The study will help you optimize your outreach emailing tactics and understand why treating people like people rather than prospects is a far more effective tactic than sending form letters.\n\nFor those keeping score at home this falls under both the Content Strategy/Development and Social Strategy phases of the New SEO Process.\n\nFor many, link building is a numbers game and it quickly becomes clear why those people would rather put their resources into black hat tactics. Those marketers are too impatient to properly build links because link building is a process wherein you are convincing people who don't know you to take a real world action that benefits you. To do that at scale requires a budget, great understanding of people, a large outreach team and a commitment to creating content that people will actually be compelled to link to or embed into their sites. In other words, you either have to make friends or make news.\n\nIn this age of 2pac Holograms, stop motion action figure videos, and augmented reality utilities how do you compete? While that type of content is awesome, it represents the type of big swings that may not be in your wheelhouse or relevant to your brand/client so often people wonder how to build links in their otherwise boring niche.\n\nNaturally, there are ways to manually submit your site to millions of forums, blog comments, and directories, but those links are generally very low quality and have been the focus of algorithm updates such as Penguin. That is not to say that these tactics don't work, but just as you should diversify your traffic sources beyond just Search, you will want to diversify your link building tactics to build a varied and natural link portfolio.\n\nSites with unnatural link profiles create a footprint that is easy to identify from a 10,000 foot view and of course Google has that perspective. Don't put yourself on their radar by engaging in spammy tactics.\n\nAnchor Text Distribution\n\nThis metric, which is the number of times an anchor in your backlink profile occurs, is best measured using tools like Open Site Explorer, MajesticSEO, Ahrefs, etc., is very important. An ex-Googler told me at SMX Australia to always be sure the highest occurring anchor text for a site is branded otherwise you may trigger an algorithmic filter or penalty.\n\nLink Equity\n\nThe value of the links you build to your site is not a trivial thing. Links are the lifeblood of Search campaigns and therefore the foundation on which every site that is visible in the Search Engine Results Pages (SERPs) must be built.\n\nThese numbers will not be an exact determination of what you will need to accomplish as there is a sliding scale of worth for links, but this crude explanation will make it clear to higher ups what needs to be done and why.\n\nUse the aforementioned backlink profiling tools to determine how many links your competitors have and how many links you have. Whether you only use one tool or all tools, make sure that you stay consistent. Backlink profile tools all measure a different portion of the web and none of them are as comprehensive as Google so it's important to use the same source(s) to capture a snapshot for every site.\n\nCalculate Share of Voice.\n\nShare of voice is a traditional advertising term that basically means of the percentage",

      "Donald Trump Changes His Tune And Begins To Court Wealthy Donors\n\nGOP presidential candidate Donald Trump touts his ability to finance his own campaign and avoid answering to donors. But now he's started fundraising for his campaign and a superPAC.\n\nSTEVE INSKEEP, HOST:\n\nDonald Trump's view of campaign finance may be evolving, as people sometimes say when a politician's views shift a little bit. The billionaire has said he can't be bought. He has questioned the role of money in politics and even highlighted his own past contributions to some of his critics and rivals. Trump had been talking of paying for his presidential campaign himself but has now signaled an openness to donations. NPR's Peter Overby reports.\n\nPETER OVERBY, BYLINE: Donald Trump puts his net worth somewhere north of $10 billion. Other estimates are less than half that much. When Trump announced he was running in mid-June, he drew a sharp line between other candidates - needy candidates - and himself.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nDONALD TRUMP: I'm really rich. I'll show you that in a second. And by the way, I'm not even saying that in a bragging - that's the kind of mindset - that's the kind of thinking you need for this country.\n\nUNIDENTIFIED WOMAN: Absolutely.\n\nOVERBY: Trump's first campaign finance report, filed a few weeks later, showed that outside donors put in 5 percent of the money so far - $92,000 versus 1.8 million from Trump himself. But Trump's organization had already spent nearly $22,000 on fundraising. It contracted with Newsmax, a conservative website, to raise money by email. The organization also prepared to solicit wealthy donors through a new superPAC. It's called Make America Great Again, just like the motto of Trump's campaign. The phrase is actually trademarked by Donald Trump. Meanwhile, Trump has derided other candidates for chasing after wealthy donors. Last week, he was in Derry, N. H.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nTRUMP: All of that money that's going to Hillary and Jeb and Scott and Marco and all of them - the people that are putting up that money, it's like puppets.\n\nOVERBY: But this weekend, according to a family friend, the mother-in-law of Trump's daughter Ivanka gave $100,000 to Make America Great Again. Sunday, on CBS's \"Face The Nation,\" Trump allowed that he wants donors. He mentioned a woman who contributed $7.23, then this...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")\n\nTRUMP: I would even take big contributors, as long as they don't expect anything.\n\nOVERBY: And to explain the no-strings rule...\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF TV SHOW, \"FACE THE NATION\")\n\nTRUMP: I actually like the idea of investing in a campaign, but it has to be no strings attached. I don't want any strings attached.\n\nOVERBY: Tom Reynolds is a Republican strategist and former congressman from New York. He sees this as a logical progression from a candidate willing to put himself out there to a candidate getting a huge response. And now...\n\nTOM REYNOLDS: The next move he's looking at is I don't want to or I can't fund all this myself. I'm, therefore, looking to fundraise to help me do that.\n\nOVERBY: Another veteran of New York politics, Democratic consultant Hank Sheinkopf, says the real question now is how Trump's grassroots supporters will react if he starts raising big money.\n\nHANK SHEINKOPF: The truth is the rhetoric he's used is much more important to them than whether he raises money or not, so long as he keeps using the same rhetoric. If the rhetoric changes though and he appears to be softer, he'll likely lose a significant amount of support.\n\nOVERBY: In other words, the campaign can evolve, but the message should not.

      "Justice League\n\nJames Mottram\n\n15 November 2017\n\nThe DC gang assemble for a watchable adventure, but the villain problem persists\n\nThose who endured Zack Snyder's lumbering Batman v Superman will already be well prepped for Justice League. It's the DC answer to Marvel's Avengers Assemble, as a team of superheroes band together to fight an alien invasion led by chief antagonist Steppenwolf. Doing the gathering is Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), the billionaire behind Batman last seen duking it out with Henry Cavill's Superman – who is now being mourned in Metropolis and beyond.\n\nAlso on the team is Gal Gadot's Wonder Woman, back in the present day after her WWI-set standalone adventure, perhaps the first of the DC Extended Universe movies to really get it right. Newcomers include the hitherto-only-glimpsed underwater king Aquaman (Jason Momoa), adolescent speedster The Flash (Ezra Miller) and Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a part-machine whose father works at STAR Labs. After Batman rounds them up, the real business of taking down the bad guy begins.\n\nAs so often with mega-budget comic book movies, the villain isn't half as interesting as the heroes. Flanked by his insect-like army of Parademons, Steppenwolf (voiced by Ciarán Hinds, employing his distinct rumble) spends his time collecting a series of boxes to form the Unity, described as 'the mother of horrors'. But, drenched in soulless CGI, there's no definition to the character.\n\nThere's also a stranded Eastern European family – presumably supposed to represent humanity in peril – that really flops as an idea. Yet, in truth, Justice League is more watchable than its direct predecessor Batman v Superman. The presence of Joss Whedon – initially brought in for rewrites, he handled post-production and reshoots when director Snyder bowed out due to the tragic death of his daughter – can certainly be felt.\n\nConsequently it's lighter in places, even if half of comic relief Miller's jokes drop like stones. Momoa's Aquaman is wasted, but the returning actors – like Affleck and Gadot – are beginning to grow into their roles. Gradually DC are getting there, yet this remains leagues behind their rival Marvel.\n\nGeneral release from Fri 17 Nov.",
      "In the universe of serious, meaningful photography, the chance to honor the lives and careers of peers, colleagues and, occasionally, heroes in an end-of-year \"those we lost\" tribute comes with a grim, one-time-only satisfaction: namely, the opportunity to see, in one place, the work of photographers who would otherwise never, ever be shown together.\n\nLike politics, death can sometimes make for strange bedfellows.\n\nWhere else would, say, Cornel Lucas' glamorous Hollywood portraits feel so right alongside LIFE staffer Lee Balterman's edgy depictions of Sixties' unrest? In what other context would a black-and-white image of Nehru by India's first woman photojournalist , Homai Vyarawalla (a.k.a, \"Dalda 13\"), not seem out of place beside Jim McCrary's famous 1971 Tapestry portrait of Carole King?\n\nOf course, it's hardly just the variety of photographers we lost in 2012 that's so striking, but the cumulative power and excellence of their work.\n\nDody Weston Thompson, for example, who died in October at 89, not only worked as an assistant with titans like Edward Weston and Ansel Adams, but collaborated for years with her husband, Brett Weston. Over a five-plus-decade career, from the 1940s into the early 2000s, she forged friendships with many of the signature artists of the century (Minor White, Imogen Cunningham, Georgia O'Keeffe and others) while always doggedly — and joyfully — pursuing her own creative vision.\n\nAnother formidable woman, Eve Arnold, died early in 2012 at the age of 99. The Philadelphia native joined Magnum in 1957 and for decades produced indelible portraits of celebrities (Marlene Dietrich, Marilyn Monroe), political and cultural figures (Malcolm X, Jackie Kennedy, James Cagney) and the disenfranchised (migrant workers, prostitutes). Named a \"Master of Photography\" by ICP in 1995, Arnold lived in England until her death in January.\n\nOn staff at LIFE for 24 years, Michael Rougier was, according to magazine lore, the only unknown photographer who ever walked into the LIFE offices and was hired then and there. (He had smuggled pictures of a then-camera shy Eva Peron out of Argentina.) Rougier — who has a peak in Antarctica named after him; he tumbled down its side while on assignment for LIFE in the 1960s — died in January at the age of 86. Another LIFE photographer, Lee Balterman, whose work chronicled some of the signature events of the roiling Sixties (the '68 Chicago convention, the Detroit riots) as well as the beauty and rigor of the arts, died in January at age 91. Ken Regan, who died in late November (nobody seems to have known his real age), made striking portraits of most of the biggest names of the 1960s and '70s, including Dylan, the Stones, Hendrix and Muhammad Ali.\n\nPrize-winning combat photographer Horst Faas, whose work across almost a half-century with the Associated Press helped redefine what war photography could (and perhaps should) look like, died in May. He was 79. In February, another award-winning war photographer, Rémi Ochlik, was killed by Syrian artillery fire while covering the siege of Homs in that country's civil war . Ochlik, a World Press Photo honoree in 2012, was just 28.\n\nThe man who won both the Pulitzer Prize and the World Press Photo of the Year in 1963 for his image of a self-immolating monk in Saigon, Malcolm Browne, died in May at 81.\n\n( Read Patrick Witty's interview with Browne, \"Behind the Burning Monk.\" )\n\nMore than a few fine-art photographers passed away in 2012. Among them: New Jersey native Jan Groover, whose work has been shown at MoMa in New York, the Cleveland Museum of Art, ICP, the Corcoran Gallery and many other places; the self-taught, Kolkata-born Prabuddha Dasgupta, whose fashion work spanned more than three decades; and Arnaud Maggs, whose conceptual work — and especially his portraits of famous subjects, presented in grid-like formats — earned him acclaim in his native Canada and internationally.\n\nMartine Franck, who died of cancer in Paris at 74, was a Magnum photographer for more than three decades who began her career in the early 1960s, assisting the great LIFE photographers Eliot Elisofon and Gjon Mili. Magnum's president, Alex Majoli, eulogized his friend and colleague with the simple and moving observation that the agency had \"lost a point of reference, a lighthouse, and one of our most influential and beloved members.\"\n\nIn September, Pedro Guerrero died in Arizona at the age of",
      "\"Erica, Erica…have you read this book?\"\n\n\"uh, no. been kinda busy lately actually…last four years or so, really.\"\n\n\"But it's about this trans girl in high school and this guy who falls in love with her…\"\n\n(Erica lets out a long, drawn-out sigh) \"…so how bad was it?\"\n\nthis review contains SPOILERS for the above book. if you want to know what happens, keep reading. if not, here's a bunch of pictures of wombats. wombats are adorable!\n\nokay so let me put it out there: while i did not dislike this book, it ends on a very conflicted note, and the author definitely wraps up the story arc way too fast and the end result is a little clumsy. i don't like how the book ended because while i am not SO picky that you have to end up going into the sunset together and happy, the reality is that the book ends on an unclear note as to whether or not a person who is clearly happier and better off as a girl has purged, and that's kind of creepypants. i know it happens but do books always have to end with \"trans antagonist/protagonist gets screwed?\" it's kind of a theme in YA fiction, as a lot of early queer YA books that dealt with teenage same-gender lovers did. people remember Annie On My Mind for a reason, and believe you me as a gay teenager that book was not exactly holding up hope.\n\nanyways, the book comes from the POV of Logan, a cis straight kid from a small town in Missouri…so small that Columbia, not far afield, is the Big City. Logan is getting over a bad breakup with Brenda, and in a small town breakups kind of are tricky…it's had to avoid each other in a small beehive. not too far into the book, enter Sage Hendricks, a tall, large-handed, husky-voiced girl who he falls in love with. and, well, since you already know why i'm reviewing this book, you probably have figured out that there's something about Sage: she's trans.\n\nSage generally isn't a caricature, and you can tell Katcher really tried to keep her as humanized as possible. her family is not too happy that she's trans, and she is definitely portrayed much more sympathetically than her emotionally dead mother or abusive, engendering father. for example, Katcher gets it right that when you haven't changed your ID, or if you can't change your ID, getting carded really can be the end of the world, and his sensitivity to issues of documentation is pretty neat. that said, this is Logan's book, and Logan screws up pretty bad in terms of how he takes Sage coming out, but i've seen/heard of guys doing stuff like that exactly and then come around, as Dylan does. this is where i point something out: i'd have an easier time reviewing this book had it come from Sage's POV, rather than Sage being this mysterious person with the double-whammy of being mysterious as both trans AND a girl in Logan's eyes. and you know what? i'm okay with how this book was written, but i know a lot more about being like Sage than i do about Logan. i know the reality of pass-or-die life in school, i know about how weird it feels to be the exception, and i definitely know about doing the move far away to get rid of everyone who knew you before thing, as my family totally did that, and i know something about parental shame…most of my mother's was over my appearance and sexuality, not my transness, but it still makes me feel so vulnerable about these things to this day.\n\nat least one other review bitched about how Sage came out to Logan, and i really want to stick up for this because i think when i was a teenager i did exactly this a couple of times: \"I…\" She swallowed, took a deep breath, and closed her eyes. \"I'm a boy.\" alright, not exactly perfect in terms of how we present ourselves as adults but this is a book about teenagers and i know damn well i told my first few girlfriends what i was pretty much like this. let's talk about the book's good and bad and not seize on this, mmmkay? it's not exactly easy to explain something you barely have words for when you're a teenager…add in being trans and there's often not even words that the other person would explain, and you say things like that.\n\nthe bad parts: Katcher goes a little too close to stereotype and lurid detail in dealing with Sage. the latter, well, the book was told from the POV of a teenage boy. i've never been a teenage boy, but i'm gonna assume that they're probably into lurid detail since after all",

      "Fermented Tofu!? It's not as weird as it sounds. Especially when it comes to Chinese stir fried water spinach.\n\nStir-Fried green leaf vegetables are an essential part of the Chinese menu, whether back home in the US or here in China. These days, all kinds of Chinese vegetables are readily available in Asian markets scattered around American suburbs. A favorite, often served in restaurants, is water spinach. They're hollow-stemmed vegetables, with different varieties that grow in water. The most common variety found in markets, however, are grown in regular soil.\n\nThe most common way to cook these green leafy vegetables is with oil, garlic and salt. But for a change of pace, another traditional way to cook these is with fermented tofu and stir fried water spinach is one of those dishes. Fermented tofu is a condiment, often compared to cheese, that's made by fermenting soy bean curd. It has a great savory flavor. It's actually not all that exotic when it really comes down to it, so don't be afraid to try it! Find out more about it in our Chinese ingredients glossary.\n\nYou'll need:\n\nRemove the larger, tough stems from the vegetables. You can leave the thinner, tender stems.\n\nWash the vegetables thoroughly in water (a couple soaks and rinses should work) and transfer to a colander to let the excess water drain.\n\nPrepare the other ingredients, so that they're ready to go when you're cooking.\n\nHeat oil in a wok over high heat and add the ginger.\n\nStir for about 10 seconds and then add the dried chilies, garlic, fermented tofu, sugar, salt, and white pepper.\n\nStir fry the mixture, keeping the heat on high…\n\n…And add the greens.\n\nStir-fry, moving the vegetables around the bottom of the wok so nothing burns. Use a folding motion, stir fry the mixture so all of the vegetables get seared evenly. After about a minute of this, move the vegetables into a mound in the middle of the wok. This technique is to allow the sides of the wok to reheat to get the \"wok hay\" flavor in there.\n\nAfter about 30 seconds of high heat, add the wine around the perimeter of the wok and quickly spread your vegetable mound in a circular motion around the wok to get that searing \"wok hay\" effect for another 15-30 seconds.\n\nPlate and serve your stir fried water spinach right away!",
      "Do you know about the universe-saving efforts of John-117?\n\nFor 20-something men and women, he is a returning savior. Known more commonly as Master Chief, he is the hero of the multibillion dollar Halo video game franchise, and at 12:01 a.m. Nov. 6 he embarked on his newest mission to save the universe in the game Halo 4.\n\nCoincidentally, the mission coincides with another important event: the presidential election.\n\nMicrosoft insists the Halo 4 release date is a happy coincidence, but some experts wonder whether the franchise is an unwelcome distraction for both parties, especially with the Halo fanboys.\n\n\"I'm not voting this year,\" says Mark LoCastro, a public relations manager. \"And if I look at the guys I game with and guess whether or not they'll vote, [only] about three out of eight will vote.\"\n\n'The idiots who can't get a date ... will definitely find Halo 4 more interesting than something that requires thinking.' - Jon Peddie, a gaming analyst\n\nLoCastro says his reasons for not voting have nothing to do with the game. But for many gamers who have pre-ordered the game and will be checking the driveway for FedEx rather than hitting the local polling facility, Tuesday means more than just a new president. The game's battle cry \"forward unto dawn\" means more to gamers than any election catchphrase, and a certain sidekick named Cortana who features in the game as a major plot point means more to them than any VP candidate.\n\n\"There will always be that percentage who are too cool, too cynical, and too ignorant to be bothered. I would guess that's between 10 and 15 percent of the kids of voting age,\" says Jon Peddie, a gaming analyst.\n\n\"The idiots who can't get a date and look at the women's breasts in the games will definitely find Halo 4 more interesting than something that requires thinking,\" he said. But Peddie cautioned that most younger adults are likely to make the right choice.\n\n\"The majority of young adults, especially the ones voting for the first time, will go to the polls,\" Peddie told FoxNews.com.\n\nIve been waiting for months! Im so excited to go vote & let my voice be heard! Wait...WHAT?HALO 4 is out today? Well...F%# voting then!!! — carlito (@Bodyguylito) November 6, 2012\n\nGame publisher Microsoft said the danger to the universe shouldn't prevent anyone from spending a few minutes driving to the voting booth.\n\n\"Halo 4 has supported a get-out-the-vote campaign for several months that began with voter recruitment efforts at major consumer events like New York Comic-Con, as well as a voter registration program on Xbox LIVE,\" a spokesperson for Microsoft and developer 343 Industries told FoxNews.com. \"Microsoft also partnered with Rock the Vote to encourage and facilitate voter registration. We're continuing the message at major launch events this evening and more than 100 college campuses nationwide.\"\n\nThe company added that those who watched the debates through Xbox Live received a free gold Spartan armor for their in-game avatar. And when gamers boot up today, they will see a reminder to vote.\n\nWhile no one has hard data on whether Halo 4 gamers will influence the election, there is a logical argument that suggests Halo 4 could have some effect. Tech analyst Charles King says recent polling data suggests that younger voters are already less interested in this election cycle than they were in 2008, and that gamers might decide to buy the game and skip the vote all together.\n\nIn a quick Facebook poll of younger gamers who can vote, many said they had mailed in a ballot so they could focus on the campaign. (Meaning, the one involving Master Chief.) A few gamers said they will make the time, but as more of a duty than because of any particular interest in the election.",
      "Wolf Pack Pull out OT Win in Springfield\n\n(Photo by Chris Marion)\n\nOscar Lindberg's second goal of the game 33 seconds into overtime gave the Wolf Pack a 3-2 win over the Springfield Falcons Friday night at the MassMutual Center in Springfield.\n\nThe Wolf Pack trailed 1-0 and 2-1 in the game, but Lindberg tied the score at two early in the third period, and then bagged the winner on the opening shift of OT. The victory lifted the Wolf Pack (29-16-4-3, 65 points) one point ahead of the Falcons in the Northeast Division and Eastern Conference standings.\n\nOn the winning goal, Chris Bourque and Mat Bodie exchanged passes on the left-wing side in the Springfield zone, and Bodie sent a cross-slot feed to Lindberg, who one-timed it from just inside the right faceoff dot past Falcon goaltender Oscar Dansk.\n\n\"It was a real nice exchange between [Bourque] and [Bodie] coming down the back wall,\" Wolf Pack coach Ken Gernander said of the winning play, \"and then Bodie coming back-side on his forehand, great vision, and found [Lindberg] through the seam. And 'Lindy' (Lindberg), rather than stickhandling or taking any time with it, he just one-timed it. I thought it was, all around, a real good offensive-zone play.\"\n\nTyler Brown had the other Wolf Pack goal, and Jeff Malcolm made 29 saves to improve his AHL record on the year to 4-0-0. Sean Collins and Domenic Monardo scored for Springfield, and Dansk made 24 saves.\n\nThe Wolf Pack were outshot 9-4 in the first period, and gave up the session's only goal on the game's first shot.\n\nHartford lost track of Collins, and T.J. Tynan was able to feed him a pass along the goal line on the right-wing side. Collins cut toward the front of the net, and lost the puck once but got it back, and put a close-range shot past Malcolm on the stick side.\n\nThe two teams traded goals in the second period, with Brown connecting for his third goal in four games for the Wolf Pack, and Monardo responding late for Springfield.\n\nBrown and Danny Kristo hooked up at 7:49 to tie the game, with Kristo moving below the goal line and centering to Brown, who slammed the puck into the net high on the stick side of Dansk.\n\nThat tie lasted until Monardo put the Falcons back in front with 37.1 seconds remaining in the period. Springfield scoring leader Luke Adam carried the puck into the Wolf Pack zone down the left-wing side and passed in front to Monardo, who got inside position on the Hartford defense and jammed the puck past Malcolm.\n\nThe Wolf Pack responded at 4:44 of the third session, though, on Lindberg's first of the game and 14th of the season. Dallas Jackson's slap shot from the left point hit traffic in front of the net, and Lindberg tracked down the carom and lifted it over Dansk's left shoulder, from along the goal line on the left-wing side.\n\nThe Wolf Pack are back in road action Saturday night, traveling to Allentown, PA to take on the Lehigh Valley Phantoms. Faceoff is 7:05 PM, and all of the action can be heard live on Fox Sports Radio 1410, and on-line at www.foxsportsradio1410.com and iHeartRadio.

Psalm 37:3, 5 ).); Vulgate,; followed by, like, with which it is very similar in meaning., not used in kal, in hiph. signifies \"to lean upon, rest upon,\" just as man rests upon a spear for support. Its metaphorical use,, is derived from the practice of kings who were accustomed to appear in public leaning on their friends and ministers; cf. 2 Kings 5:18 2 Kings 7:2, 17 (Gesenius). The admonition does not mean that we are not toour own understanding (),form plans with discretion, and employ legitimate means in the pursuit of our ends; but that, when we use it, we are to depend upon God and his directing and overruling providence (Wardlaw); cf. Jeremiah 9:23, 24 . \"Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,\" etc. The teacher points out not only where we are to rely, but also where we are not to rely.Trust in the Lord with all thine heart,.... Not in a creature, the best, the holiest, and the highest; not in any creature enjoyment, as riches, strength, and wisdom; nor in any outward privilege, arising from natural descent and education; not in a man's self, in his own heart, which is deceitful; nor in any works of righteousness done by him; not in a profession of religion, or the duties of it, ever so well performed; not in frames, nor in graces, and the exercise of them; no, not in faith or trust itself: but in the Lord, the object of all grace, and in him only; in Jehovah the Father, as the God of nature and providence, for all temporal blessings; and as the God of all grace, for all spiritual blessings, and all the needful supplies of grace; and for eternal happiness, which he has provided, promised, and freely gives. Trust in him at all times; in times of affliction, temptation, and darkness: there is a great deal of reason for it; all power and strength are in him to help; his love, grace, and mercy, move him to it, and are always the same: the consideration of what he has done for others that have trusted in him, and for ourselves in times past, should induce and encourage to it; as also the happiness of those that trust in him, who enjoy peace and safety; and his displeasure at those that show any diffidence of him, or distrust him. Trust in Jehovah the Son; in his person for acceptance; in his righteousness for justification; in his blood for pardon; in his fulness for supply; in his power for protection and preservation; and in him alone for salvation and eternal life. Trust in Jehovah the Spirit, to carry on and finish the work of grace upon the heart; of which a saint may be confident that where it is begun it will be completed. And this trust in Father, Son, and Spirit, should be \"with all the heart\", cordial and sincere. The phrase denotes not so much the strength of faith as the sincerity of it; it signifies a faith unfeigned; it is not saying, or professing, that a man believes and trusts in the Lord; but it is with the heart, and with his whole heart, that he believes unto righteousness, if he believes aright; see Romans 10:10 and lean not unto thine own understanding; or trust not to that; for it stands opposed to trusting in the Lord.

      "LEXINGTON, Ky. — A Kentucky Human Rights Commission has sided with organizers of the Lexington Pride Festival in its discrimination complaint against T-shirt printer Hands On Originals, after the owner refused to print t-shirts for the city's annual pride event, and said it was because his is \"a Christian organization.\"\n\nThe Lexington-Fayette Urban County Human Rights Commission found that the company violated the city's fairness ordinance, part of which prohibits businesses open to the public from discriminating against people based on sexual orientation, reported the Lexington Herald-Leader.\n\nThe commission also noted the company should stop \"discriminating because of sexual orientation.\"\n\nEarlier this year, the Gay and Lesbian Service Organization (GLSO) of Lexington gathered quotes to have their t-shirts printed. Hands On Originals (HOO) provided the best quote for the needs of the committee, but when the committee contacted the vendor to accept the quote, Hands On Originals refused to do the work under the grounds that they were a Christian organization.\n\nIn its complaint, the GLSO argued that printing t-shirts is a general service and therefore, HOO cannot discriminate against GLSO by refusing to print t-shirts on Christian grounds after providing a quote.\n\n\"We are happy to finally have a declaration from the Human Rights Commission that Hands On Originals did discriminate and they should refrain from discriminating in the future,\" said Aaron Baker, the GLSO's president. \"In some sense, I feel like we've gotten what we were looking for since the Human Rights Commission has agreed with us.\"\n\nHands On Originals is represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF, formerly known as the Alliance Defense Fund), a conservative Christian group of lawyers who oppose same-sex marriage and civil unions, and adoption by same-sex couples.\n\n\"Americans in the marketplace should not be subject to legal attacks simply for abiding by their beliefs,\" said ADF attorney Jim Campbell, in a statement. \"The Constitution prohibits the government from forcing business owners to promote messages they disagree with.\"\n\nA public hearing in the case appears likely, as attorneys for Hands On Originals said in a statement that \"the process will continue.\"\n\nWhile the fairness ordinance does not allow for punitive damages, the GLSO could seek compensatory damages for the cost of time spent researching other T-shirt printers or other costs associated with ordering from a different company.\n\n\nThis Story Filed Under",

He said that despite how well-meaning many undocumented immigrants may be, they are still taking the wrong path to the United States.\n\nHe proudly noted that illegal crossings at the southern U.S. border are down significantly since Trump took office, but he also said there's much to do in terms of securing the U.S. from malign intruders.\n\nFor instance, the administration plans to move ahead with efforts to require that other countries use more technically advanced passports, he said. And people seeking a visa to the United States are in many cases likely to see more intense scrutiny, including longer interviews, he added.\n\nKelly showed good humor throughout the discussion Wednesday, despite fielding intense questions on everything from dealing with tracking when visitors exit the United States to why he makes sure to always praise his workforce.\n\nWhen he met with Trump about joining his administration, the president said he believed the job he'd be offering Kelly was the hardest in the government, Kelly recalled.\n\n\"I panicked,\" Kelly said, adding that he thought Trump was going to offer him the helm of the State Department.\n\nAt one point on stage, Kelly's phone rang, but he ignored it, joking: \"It might be the president, so I do want to miss the call.\"\n\nThis article tagged under: States\n\nJohn Kelly",

      "This column is going to be a little personal for me because I'm writing about the team that I played for six out of my seven years in the NFL. The one thing I can assure you of is you will never have to wonder about whether I am biased in favor of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers.\n\nI wholeheartedly am with every fiber of my being.\n\nI understand that's a turnoff for some people, but frankly I don't give a shit. You see, I am not a Bucs \"fan;\" I am a Buccaneer and I always will be. I invested blood, sweat and, yes, tears in that team as a player from 1996 to 2001. I put everything into being the best player I could be for them. I also met some lifelong friends in that locker room, and we created memories together that will live on forever. I still live in Tampa, and I have no problem telling you that I want the team I played for most of my career to win every single game on its schedule. It is what it is.\n\nIn the interest of full disclosure, I interned for three weeks this spring with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers during their OTAs, and it was a fantastic experience for me, personally.\n\nThe good news for anybody wanting a serious critique of the Bucs is this: Nobody is going to be a sharper critic when it comes to how they play because I want to see them do well. I don't sugar coat anything, and I am always going to be fair with my praise and criticism. I also want Bucs fans to know exactly what is going on with their team without the generic hyperbole in either direction, because an informed fan is a better fan, in my opinion.\n\nHappy talk and silver lining bullshitting isn't going to do anybody any good, so you aren't ever going to catch me trying to convince you that the Bucs played well after they shit the bed on Sunday. What I will do is try to get to the bottom of their bowel malfunctions and call out the guys who were the biggest contributors to the brown stain. My hope would be that those guys can get their act together and put a better product on the field.\n\nWhich brings me to the topic at hand, the embarrassing ass kicking the Bucs suffered on Sunday at the hands of the Baltimore Ravens. Being that it was the second time in six games that they got their doors blown off, I figured it was time to take a look under the hood and break down exactly how they allowed a team to come onto their home field and score 28 unanswered points in the first quarter alone. This is also going to be cathartic for me to a certain extent, because I hadn't been that disgusted after a Bucs loss in a long long while.\n\nSo come along with me on this (not so) quick journey as I point out what went wrong and who screwed up in the first quarter of that game.\n\nI can't break down every single play in the first quarter, so instead I will point out some of the bigger, most obvious errors on the part of a player or players. I am not cherry picking, just trying to shed light on what and who were the problems on Sunday. My major motivation is that I know this team can and should be better than it is. I watch film every week and what I don't see is the team getting out-schemed. What I do see is guys not doing the simple stuff consistently, and the Bucs end up losing a lot because of it.\n\nLet's get on to the finger pointing.\n\nTo keep it simple, the guy who is most at fault on any given play will have a red circle around him. At times, other guys also contributed, and they will have yellow circles around them.\n\nRight from the start ...\n\n1-15-BLT 15 (15:00) J. Flacco pass short left to K. Juszczyk to BLT 33 for 18 yards (C. Butler)\n\nThat guy in the circle is linebacker Danny Lansanah. He has a flair for making big plays, but he also makes a lot of simple mistakes.\n\nThe Bucs are playing cover 3. Lansanah is supposed to have the flat zone wide toward the sideline. He isn't there because the Ravens ran a play action fake right at him, and he bit on it hook, line and sinker. Instead of taking on the fullback up high, he tried to submarine him and cut his legs. He fell on the ground, and the nearest Bucs defender was covering the deep third on that side. The fullback caught the ball and ran 17 yards.\n\nTalk about a harbinger of things to come.\n\n1-10-BLT 33 (14:27) J. Forsett right guard pushed ob at TB 15 for 52 yards (M.

Todd Griffin said. Investigators said Gomes likely died as a result of an accident or suicide.\n\nAn off-duty California Highway Patrol officer saw Gomes on fire Friday night in the dirt lot near 5200 Pacific Highway and called firefighters and police, Griffin said. He was pronounced dead at the scene.\n\nGomes, a teacher from Boston, Massachusetts, made international headlines in January 2010 when he was detained in North Korea for illegally entering the country from China.He was sentenced to eight years of hard labor and fined $700,000.\n\nIn July of that year, Gomes attempted suicide while in custody, according to North Korean news accounts.\n\nOn August 27, 2010, Carter negotiated his release and escorted him back to the United States, where he was reunited with family.\n\n\"At the request of President Carter, and for humanitarian purposes, Mr. Gomes was granted amnesty by the chairman of the National Defense Commission, Kim Jong-Il,\" the Carter Center said in a statement.\n\nGomes wrote about his ordeal in a 2015 autobiography titled \"Violence and Humanity.\"\n\nOn Tuesday, a member of the Gomes' family told FOX 25 they are making funeral arrangements.

      "Morning News Brief: Jared Kushner Rising, Bill O'Reilly's Future, YouTube Ads\n\nJared Kushner's star appears to be rising inside the Trump administration. Also, Fox News star Bill O'Reilly is under fire and going on vacation, and YouTube is dealing with concerns from advertisers.\n\nDAVID GREENE, HOST:\n\nYeah. So up first, Rachel, Donald Trump's 36-year-old son-in-law Jared Kushner - he is wearing so many different hats in the White House these days. Officially, now his title is senior adviser to the president, but what does that mean? Well, he's been leading a new White House initiative on innovation. He also flew to Iraq with the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Here is White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nSEAN SPICER: Jared's going to specifically express the commitment of U.S. of the United States to the government of Iraq, meet with U.S. personnel engaged in the campaign, and it's not like this is a one-shot deal. In the course of conversation and extensive meetings, that invitation was extended, and they took it up.\n\nGREENE: And so, by the way, Kushner is also the guy that President Trump has tapped to come up with a plan for peace in the Middle East. He's doing a lot.\n\nRACHEL MARTIN, HOST:\n\nYeah. A little busy. OK. So with us this morning Domenico Montanaro of NPR's Politics team is here with us. Hi, Domenico.\n\nDOMENICO MONTANARO, BYLINE: Good morning, Rachel.\n\nMARTIN: And we have David Folkenflik. He covers media for NPR. He's joining us on the line from New York. Hi, Folkenflik.\n\nDAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Hey, guys.\n\nMARTIN: And you will be Folkenflik in this conversation because we have two Davids. It's too confusing.\n\nFOLKENFLIK: (Laughter) Proud of it.\n\nGREENE: Please, please.\n\nMARTIN: We're just going to do it that way. But we're going to start with Domenico. So let's talk about Jared Kushner here. The Washington establishment has thrown a lot of barbs at this guy, criticizing his lack of experience on foreign policy in particular. But he's not a Cabinet secretary. He's a senior aide to the president. And as far as I understand, the only real job requirement for those people is to have the trust of the president, right?\n\nMONTANARO: Yeah. I mean, that's true except for the fact that at least Cabinet secretaries have to go through these long confirmation hearings where you do get to learn about what they believe and what their experiences, and, you know, the thing is when somebody has that much influence. There are a lot of legitimate questions about the kind of advice the president is getting.\n\nYou know, nothing against 30-somethings - just saying - but Kushner has a wealthy dad, is married to Trump's daughter, has no policy diplomatic or government experience and now looks like the most powerful person in the White House who's not the president.\n\nMARTIN: Do we have any sense at this point - I mean, we see him in a lot of photos. But do we know what his imprint has been on policy yet?\n\nMONTANARO: We don't really because he doesn't have a ton of policy experience. We know that he's of what's the so-called New York wing of the White House warring factions, if there are that many. But he's, you know, more moderate on a lot of different positions. We've heard that he and Ivanka have pushed this president on things like LGBT rights, a little bit more than the Steve Bannon wing, for example, which is much more nationalist, populist.\n\nMARTIN: And we'll get to that, but, Folkenflik, you've reported on Kushner's time in New York as a real estate mogul himself. How could his experience there influence how he is advising the president?\n\nFOLKENFLIK: Well, there are a couple of things. You know, in some ways his greatest success has been to be taken seriously in New York itself. He comes from a New Jersey family. His son, a very wealthy New Jersey real estate developer, who groomed him in politics and who, you know, was a huge fundraiser for major Democratic politicians that used to come through his New Jersey home and give talks and, you know, to figures who would give money there. Benjamin Netanyahu did that. He comes from a",
      "In his syndicated column, Pat Buchanan likened illegal immigrants to the Goths, a group of Germanic tribes who ravaged the Roman Empire in the centuries preceding the collapse of its western half. Buchanan suggested an analogy between the eastern Roman emperor Valens's admission of Gothic refugees into the Empire and the influx of illegal immigrants into the United States.\n\nIn his August 25 syndicated column, conservative pundit, MSNBC political analyst, and former presidential candidate Pat Buchanan likened illegal immigrants to the Goths, a group of Germanic tribes who ravaged the Roman Empire in the centuries preceding the collapse of its western half. Buchanan's column -- titled \"Will America Survive to 2050?\" -- suggested an analogy between the eastern Roman emperor Valens's admission of Gothic refugees into the Empire and the influx of illegal immigrants into the United States, an analogy he said allows Americans to \"see ... how America ends.\"\n\nBuchanan based his comparison of illegal immigrants to the Goths on his reading of Oxford University history lecturer Peter Heather's book The Fall of the Roman Empire: A New History of Rome and the Barbarians (Oxford University Press USA, December 2005), quoting from the introduction of Heather's book in his column:\n\n\"In 376 a large band of Gothic refugees arrived at the Empire's Danube frontier, asking for asylum. In a complete break with established Roman policy, they were allowed in, unsubdued. They revolted, and within two years had defeated and killed the emperor Valens -- the one who had received them -- along with two-thirds of his army, at the battle of Hadrianople.\"\n\nBuchanan stated that Heather \"is convinced that Valens' welcoming of the Goths was the decision that sealed the fate of the empire.\" Citing \"recent headlines\" that \"tell us of 5 million more immigrants having arrived in America in the last five years,\" Buchanan then asserted that \"we see now, no longer as through a glass darkly, how America ends.\"\n\nAs he has in recent media appearances (documented by Media Matters for America here, here, and here ) Buchanan touted his new book State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America (Thomas Dunne Books), stating: \"As I write in my new book ... George Bush may go down in history as the man who not only lost the magnificent lands won for America [in the Mexican-American War] by [President] James Polk, but, by refusing to do his duty and halt this invasion, ensured the Balkanization and dissolution of his country.\"\n\nAdditionally, Buchanan apparently misrepresented Heather's assessment of Valens, whose admission of Gothic refugees into Roman territory Buchanan seemed to liken to Bush's failure to \"halt\" the \"invasion\" of the United States by illegal immigrants. Heather wrote that \"[t]he appearance of the Goths beside the [Danube] river in 376 was the first link in a chain of events that would lead directly from the rise of Hunnic power on the fringes of Europe to the deposition of the last western emperor [p.146].\" But Heather did not assert, as Buchanan claimed, that Valens's admission of the Goths was \"the decision that sealed the fate of the empire,\" which finally dissolved a hundred years after Valens allowed the Goths onto Roman lands. Rather, Heather wrote of the chaos following the Goths' arrival: \"Blaming Valens for his stupidity in agreeing to admit the Goths, the local Roman military for their greed [in exploiting the Gothic refugees], and the Goths -- just a bit -- for resorting to violence makes for a perfectly coherent account. Considered in all its details, however, it is not the whole truth\" [p.159].\n\nAs Media Matters has noted, Buchanan's book is filled with controversial statements about the threat of immigration, and criticizes The Washington Times for \"summarily fir[ing]\" columnist Sam Francis, now deceased, for claiming that, in Buchanan's words, \"Western civilization was superior and that only Europeans could have created it.\" Referring to Francis's claim that race is \"the Great Taboo,\" Buchanan wrote that \"to submit to the Great Taboo is like not telling one's doctor of a recurring pain that could kill you.\" As Media Matters documented, Buchanan's book also includes the following claims about the purported threat of immigration:\n\n\"This [immigration] is an invasion, the greatest invasion in history.\" [p. 5]\n\n\"We are witnessing how nations perish. We are entered upon the final act of our civilization. The last scene is the deconstruction of the nations. The penultimate scene, now well underway, is the invasion unresisted.\" [p. 6]\n\n\"Chicano chauvinists and Mexican agents have made clear their intent to take back through demography and culture what their ancestors lost through war.\" [p. 12]\n\n\"[W]e are in the midst of a savage culture war in which traditionalist",

      "Nokton 42.5mm f/0.95 Micro Four Thirds Lens is rated 5.0 out of 5 by 19 .\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Filmmassa from The best lens for video in the micro 4/3 line up I am quite impressed at the cinematic quality of the image and how sharp the lens is even at maximum aperture of 0.95! It is also easily the best voigtlander in the m4/3 lineup. the voigtlanders are more contrast than I expected them to be, blacks are much punchier than a lot of vintage lenses, so I would say that the voigtlanders are an interesting mix of of modern and vintage lens aesthetics. This lens is also seems to resolve better than using vintage glass and a speed booster in my unscientific testing. It's heavy but feels good on a gh4' certainly less heavy than the speed booster and vintage lens combos, very well built.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by jbodmer from A special lens for special results This lens is special in many ways. It's tactile qualities as a solid hunk of smooth metal and exotic glass is matched by its optical qualities in the images it allows to produce in every way. This is a great addition to any m3/4 shooters bag but is not necessarily for everyone. One has to enjoy manual focus and the time required to reach perfect focus. This is not necessarily easy since the depth of field at f/0.95 is minimal and m4/3 cameras are not always well suited to assess precise focus. The lens is heavy, but you feel you are getting a serious piece of kit for your money, an investment that will last many years. For me, it is a sheer pleasure to work with the lens, to take the time to think about composition, point of focus and quality of light - highly recommended!\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by William P. from Best lens I have for the GH5. I really like this lens. I have the full set of Voigtlander f0.95 MFT lenses and I like them all. This one, however, is the best. Give me this one and the 17.5 and I could shoot a movie. The other lenses make it more convenient, but a person could be happy with only this one and a wider one. On all the Voigtlander lenses I often shoot wide open or nearly so when shooting people. I like the look of what they do to skin tones. The 42.5 seems sharp all the way, the others may get a big softer wide open. Not soft, just not as sharp as when stopped down a bit. I like that look on people shots, especially closeups. And the 10 bladed shutters make a nice bokeh, and with these lenses you can get whatever depth of field look you want.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Glamorous Director from Worth it! This is the newest lens in Voigtlander's MFT line. Very solid, seems to be really durable. Made in Japan. f/0.95 makes this lens super sharp (even in daylight, with ND filter), stunning DOF and great bokeh. Great for video, especially in low light, street lights. Although, working on edge of it's performance requires advanced, patient and know-why user, no Auto Focus, all Manual. In spite the price, i think this is the most affordable lens with f/0.95 on the market. If you're looking beyond f/1.4 then satisfaction guarantied. Best MFT portrait lens. Moreover it's a little bit macro as you can stay focused being closer to the object then with other lenses on the market. Definitely, you'll find something special about owning, using and shooting with this beautiful piece of glass..\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by J.F.R. from Amazing....... Recently had a chance to use this lens on the Panasonic GH4 and I simply cannot explain how beautiful the images look. At 0.95 it's a little soft but by F/2 it's razor sharp, I would stay in the 1.4-2.8 of this lens as it's the sweet spot. Great shallow DOF, buttery, so nice..... Only cons is lens is expensive and really heavy. Paying close to 1k is not easy, but this is a lens that will last you a lifetime. This just might be my favorite lens I've used on the system. second being Nokton 25mm and then Panasonic 12-35mm.\n\nRated 5 out of 5 by Tom Ierna from Fast as hell and sharp as a tack. The Nokton 42.5mm f/0.95 is a fantastic lens for MFT cameras. It pairs really well with the Black Magic Pocket Cinema Camera and the Panasonic GH2 and GH3. This lens is very fast, so even small-sensor cameras can have a cinematic shallow depth",
      "Quick show of hands: how many of you are currently wear a FitBit, FuelBand or another \"Wearable\" device? Keep your hand up if you've been wearing for more than a month.\n\nI suspect there aren't a lot of hands in the air. Why? Last year, all of my friends were wearing Nike+ FuelBands. Now I can only think of two friends who I see consistently wear them. I suspect this is one of the reasons of why Nike laid off members of the FuelBand team.\n\nIt's not that the FuelBand — or any other wearable device — is inherently flawed. In fact, I think the FuelBand, FitBit and Jawbone Up are all excellent health devices. But despite their benefits, it seems like we fall out of the habit of wearing them. I know that after I broke my FuelBand, I never got motivated to replace it. And my FitBit, given to me by their PR team? I lost it, and never went out to buy a new one. I have other working wearables that I just don't use anymore.\n\nI've asked other investors and entrepreneurs about wearables, and they have all seen this trend. They've even mentioned a time frame: Three Weeks. That's about how long somebody keeps a wearable on their wrist or their face before they forget to put it back on.\n\nThe Three Weeks Problem boils down to this: consumers like the idea of wearables, but fail to get into the habit of wearing them. James Temple over at Re/Code points this out in his recent article on the FuelBand layoffs:\n\nWhile a surge of companies have hit the market with all manner of digital health trackers in recent months, it's still unclear how much demand there is on the part of mainstream consumers. Industry insiders, at least some and at least quietly, acknowledge that usage drops off steeply within a few weeks or months.\n\nThree weeks. Seriously.\n\nThe Three Weeks Problem is a serious one. For some reason, we're not motivated enough to keep wearing them, fix them when they break, or replace them when we lose them.\n\nIs it that they don't provide enough value? Do they no longer confer the social status they used to convey? Are they simply too bulky to be worn on a daily basis? Wearable companies need to answer these questions if they want to figure out the fundamental reasons behind the Three Weeks Problem.\n\nThese devices really do have the capability to improve our lives, yet until they can find a way to transform from wearable into habit, there will be trouble for the entire wearable device market. Let's not even get started with some of the more controversial wearables, like Google Glass.\n\nI absolutely believe that consumers want these devices. I absolutely believe that consumers can embrace devices. After all, many of us wear watches, necklaces and rings every single day. I suspect that's why Apple's focused on building a watch — it's something people are already in the habit of wearing.\n\nIf wearable makers like Nike and Google really believes these devices are the future (I do), the, they need to focus on turning these devices into habits first. Until that happens, wearables will remain in the niche.",
      "All-ages story in 52 pages following the life and times of a boy as he grows up, showing how reading comics helped him in his journey in life.\n\nWhat's the Story?\n\nPage 5 Chapter 1 - Art by Natisha Reid\n\nFor thirty years I have been a collector and reader of comics. In the Spring of 2008 I watched as a two year relationship came to an end and my current job was being eliminated at my office. Facing debt, unemployment and depression I decided to sell my comic book collection in order to help get myself back on my feet. When I was going through my various long boxes of comics I pulled out a comic of one of my favorite super heores and I remember when I first saw the character and how I fell in love with comics at the age of 3. It was then that an idea hit me, I ran to my desk drawer and pulled out notepad and pen and started writing. Within an hour I had written the outline for a story about what comics meant to me and how they inspired me to look ahead to brighter days. This is that story.\n\nThe book follows the life of Blaine, a young boy who lives with his recently divorced mother and his grandfather. Thanks to one amazing moment, Blaine learns about the world of comic books through his grandfather. The story follows Blaine through the course of the next thirty years as he reaches the various crossroads in his life and shows how reading comics helped him meet those challenges along the way. From growing up without a father to bullying in school. To watching as his mother remarried and how he became a big brother. Blaine faces all of his challenges head on with comic books as his inspiration in dealing with these problems. However, how can comics help you when you grow up? What happens when you face job lost? What happens when you become a father yourself? These questions and more are answered as Blaine's life unfolds in these 52 pages of a story that could be any one of us at any given time.\n\nWho we are...\n\nRyan Read (Writer/Creator): Ryan is a writer, technology teacher and supporter of community reading, My Life as a Comic Book Reader is his first graphic novel and he has been creating it for the last six years.

      "Robert Mueller. Alex Wong/Getty Images\n\nA legal memo recently unearthed by The New York Times argues that it is permissible to indict a sitting president.\n\nThe memo was written in 1998 by the office of special prosecutor Kenneth Starr, who spearheaded the Whitewater investigation that eventually led to former President Bill Clinton's impeachment in the House.\n\nStarr tapped conservative constitutional law and ethics professor Ronald Rotunda to write the memo, in which Rotunda cast doubt on the idea that sitting presidents are immune from prosecution.\n\nThat theory is rooted in several prior judgments, the Times said, including a September 1973 memo written by Robert Dixon, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel in President Richard Nixon's Department of Justice.\n\nDixon wrote that indicting a sitting president may hinder the executive branch from \"accomplishing its constitutional functions\" in a way that cannot \"be justified by an overriding need,\" according to the 1973 memo cited by the Times.\n\nNixon's solicitor general, Robert Bork, also submitted a court brief in October 1973 arguing that sitting presidents are immune to indictment and criminal proceedings. And in 2000, the head of the Office of Legal Counsel under Clinton reaffirmed Bork's and Dixon's judgments.\n\nBut Rotunda's memo significantly narrowed the premise that a president is immune to indictment by noting that it was not stipulated in the US Constitution. Rotunda wrote that the Constitution grants \"limited immunity\" to lawmakers in some contexts, but not to the president.\n\n\"If the framers of our Constitution wanted to create a special immunity for the President, they could have written the relevant clause,\" Rotunda wrote. \"They certainly knew how to write immunity clauses, for they wrote two immunity clauses that apply to Congress,\" he added, \"but they wrote nothing to immunize the President.\"\n\nIf the president is granted immunity from being indicted, Rotunda argued, \"if he cannot be prosecuted for violating the criminal laws, he will be above the law.\"\n\nPresident Donald Trump pauses while speaking during a \"Made in America,\" product showcase featuring items created in each of the U.S. 50 states, at the White House, Monday, July 17, 2017, in Washington. AP Photo/Alex Brandon\n\nThe Starr memo's public unveiling comes as special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating President Donald Trump's campaign and whether any of its associates colluded with Russian officials to influence the 2016 election.\n\nMueller has been granted broad authority by Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. When he appointed Mueller a little over a week after former FBI Director James Comey was fired, Rosenstein tasked him with investigating \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump,\" as well as \"any matters that arose or may arise directly from the investigation.\"\n\nThough Trump initially said in a statement that he was confident the investigation would clear his name and that he was \"[looking] forward to this matter concluding quickly,\" he has since soured on Mueller's probe and the two congressional intelligence committee investigations.\n\nTrump has since called the investigations a \"witch hunt\" led by Democrats, who he says are upset about their election loss. He has in recent days asked aloud why a special counsel hadn't been appointed to investigate what he called \"illegal acts\" by the Obama administration and Hillary Clinton's campaign.\n\nTrump also publicly warned Mueller last week against investigating the Trump family's finances, saying that Mueller would be crossing a \"red line\" if he did so.\n\n\"Look, this is about Russia,\" Trump said. \"So I think if he wants to go, my finances are extremely good, my company is an unbelievably successful company.\"\n\nTrump's comments came the day before a Bloomberg report that said Mueller had expanded his probe to look at Trump's past business dealings.\n\nFormer FBI Director James Comey Drew Angerer/Getty Images\n\nWhile Starr's memo does make the case that the president could be indicted while in office, legal experts say it's unlikely Mueller would take that path.\n\n\"I would be surprised if Mueller indicted the president for the same prudential reasons that swayed Starr,\" Renato Mariotti, a defense lawyer and former federal prosecutor, told the Times. \"But the specter that he might do that could have an impact on things.\"\n\n\"If I were on the president's team, I would say, 'I don't think it's likely that he would, but it's possible,' depending on what the facts are,\" Mariotti said.\n\nJon Michaels, a professor at the UCLA School of Law, said the argument outlined in Starr's memo was \"compelling and persuasive but not necessarily dispositive.\"\n\nHe said it's unlikely the investigation will proceed along a different path than it previously would have had the memo not been disclosed.\n\n\"Even if Mueller wanted to indict and seek criminal sanctions against Trump, there would be challenge by the president's defense team whether Trump, as sitting president, could be",
      "Fan projects based on existing games are always at risk from publishers and other trademark holders who might decide to take legal action, removing a piece of media from distribution, or taking other less punitive measures. There's a line of thought I see circulating among game journos whenever a decent fan project starts to receive attention: \"Writing about this is worthwhile because it is great, but we would be summoning the Eye of Sauron.\"\n\nDoomRL [official site], the Doom-themed roguelike, has had press attention for years now, but ZeniMax hadn't made any legal demands in relation to the Doom trademark until late last night. Now they have, but it doesn't look like the end of the world.\n\nBefore looking at the content of the letter, which the developer of DoomRL has shared online, it's important to mention Jupiter Hell. That's a \"modern, turn-based sci-fi roguelike\" inspired by the Doom roguelike and by Doom itself, and it's currently on Kickstarter. It's entirely possible that the existence of a commercial project with such direct ties to DoomRL is the reason for this attention from ZeniMax, and the release of a new DOOM this year might well have played a part as well.\n\nIf you visit the DoomRL page right now (and it may change sooner rather than later), the top post is a link to the Jupiter Hell Kickstarter and the graphic at the top of the page is a Doom logo in the traditional Doom colours. The source of inspiration is not and has never been hidden – \"a fast and furious coffee-break Roguelike game, that is heavily inspired by the popular FPS game Doom by ID Software\" – but the link to a commercial spiritual successor is relatively new.\n\nIn their letter, ZeniMax ask for the removal of \"all ZeniMax trademarks from meta tags, keywords, media, and other visible or concealed text that are connected to [the] website\". I'm no legal expert, but that certainly isn't the harshest warning shot I've ever seen. There's no demand to remove the game itself, which does use enemy names and other elements of the game, though not assets, and Jupiter Hell isn't directly mentioned. The name Doom is starred out (D**m) on the Kickstarter page already.\n\nYou can see the letter in full here. The key to ZeniMax's argument is that \"unauthorized use of ZeniMax's intellectual property falsely suggests ZeniMax's sponsorship or endorsement of your website\". The reason the company is involved in this is due to their ownership of Bethesda and many associated studios, including id Software. I don't expect corporate entities to sponsor or endorse anything unless they're getting something in return, but it's nice to see that at least one person closely connected to Doom does support Jupiter Hell, which looks fab.\n\nIt seems unlikely that DoomRL is about to be purged from the internet, and while changing the name isn't a case of simply applying some TipEx to the internet, DeimosRL might work in a pinch. And maybe TristramRL and LV-426RL (rolls off the tongue) for a couple of those other projects.",
      "The Great Liberal Freakout is under way, as we've noted below. Here's my haul.\n\nThe head of the Joint Center for Political Studies, which the Washington Post describes as a \"respected liberal think tank,\" reacted to Trump's landslide thus: \"When you consider that in the climate we're in—rising violence, the Ku Klux Klan—it is exceedingly frightening.\" Castro, still with us, said right before the election: \"We sometimes have the feeling that we are living in the time preceding the election of Adolf Hitler as Chancellor of Germany.\" Claremont College professor John Roth wrote: \"I could not help remembering how economic turmoil had conspired with Nazi nationalism and militarism—all intensified by Germany's defeat in World War I—to send the world reeling into catastrophe… It is not entirely mistaken to contemplate our post-election state with fear and trembling.\" Esquire writer Harry Stein says that the voters who supported Trump were like the \"good Germans\" in \"Hitler's Germany.\" Sociologist Alan Wolfe is up in the New Left Review: \"The worst nightmares of the American left appear to have come true.\" And he doubles down in The Nation: \"[T]he United States has embarked on a course so deeply reactionary, so negative and mean-spirited, so chauvinistic and self-deceptive that our times may soon rival the McCarthy era.\" The Bulletin of Atomic Scientists, keeper of the \"Doomsday Clock\" that purported to judge the risk of nuclear annihilation, has moved the hands on the clock from seven to four minutes before midnight.\n\nOh wait, did I say this was the reaction to Trump?? Sorry—these are what the left was saying the day after Ronald Reagan's election in 1980. Some things never change.",
      "If you want to start your foray into making traditional Indonesian desserts, it is safe to say that you won't go far before the recipes start calling for pandan leaves. Some would just use the leaves for their taste (we love the taste of pandan in everything, as ubiquitous as vanilla in western desserts :D), some would specify using pandan extract for both the taste and the color. Nowadays pandan extract can be bought from almost every grocery store, baking supply, and even traditional market, so why should you bother make your own extract? I'll tell you why. Because the real deal is a million times better than even the most expensive artificial pandan extract your money can buy, so if you have access to fresh (or even frozen) pandan leaves, try making your own extract. It is super easy, and your desserts are gonna taste and look super awesome. ♥\n\nPandan Extract\n\nStart making your pandan extract by acquiring some really fresh pandan leaves and carefully clean them under running water to remove dirt and sometimes even mud. Try to choose the ones with brightest green color with as little blemish as possible. If you grow your own pandan like my Mom, this will not be a problem at all. :)\n\n1. Carefully wash the pandan leaves.\n\nThen, with a pair of scissors, cut the leaves into thin strips. I use 18 leaves, but this is actually more of a rough guide to loosely fill my 6 cups blender with the pandan leave strips. If your blender has the same capacity as mine, you are probably gonna use about 15 to 20 leaves, the exact amount will depend on the size of the leaves.\n\n2. Use a pair of scissors to cut the leaves into strips.\n\nThen, add 1⁄ 2 a cup of drinking water to your blender and process until the leaves are all pulverize. Strain with a strainer (or a cheese cloth) to get the bright deep green extract. You can start using the pandan extract for your desserts, and the extra can be stored in a glass jar and will be fine for up to 1 week. Don't throw away the pulverized leaves since this is still useful to lend the pandan taste to your dishes :)",
      "A depot used to store pipes for TransCanada Corp's planned Keystone XL oil pipeline in Gascoyne, North Dakota Terray Sylvester/Reuters The Keystone XL oil pipeline won't use American steel in its construction, despite what President Donald Trump says.\n\nWhite House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Friday that's due to language in a presidential directive Trump issued in January. The directive applies to new pipelines or those under repair. Sanders said it would be hard to do an about-face on Keystone because it's already under construction and the steel has been acquired.\n\nTrump said as recently as last week that Keystone and the Dakota Access pipeline must use American steel \"or we're not building one.\"\n\nTrump used his executive powers shortly after taking office to greenlight the two pipeline projects that had been blocked by President Barack Obama.\n\nThe Keystone pipeline would run from Canada to refineries in the Gulf Coast.

      "67P compared to other comets, asteroids and Earth objects. Even the Death Star. Illustration by Judy Schmidt. We've seen a bunch of pictures comparing Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko with all kinds of cities and objects on Earth, but it's hard to put everything in perspective. Just how big is this thing? How big is it compared to other asteroids and comets we've imaged? What about more familiar objects, like the Burj Khalifa and Central Park?\n\nHow big is 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko compared to the Death Star?\n\nFortunately, our good friend Judy Schmidt @SpaceGeck took it upon herself to clear this all up. She created this wonderful infographic that shows 67/P surrounded by a bunch of other objects in the Solar System with a similar size. There's Siding Spring, the Mars moon Deimos, 19P/Borrelly, 103P/Hartley, and others.\n\nAnd then they're compared to the Burj Khalifa, a blue whale, the Great Pyramid of Giza, and much more.\n\nBut most importantly, at the bottom of the image, you can see the slight curvature of a fully operational Death Star. Yeah… those things are pretty big.\n\nAnyway, I highly recommend you check out Judy's post about the illustration over on Flickr and read her behind the scenes commentary.\n\nExplore further: Image: Comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko",

      "Why We Should Let Women Have Corporate America\nWomen's Take Over of Corporate America An Agent in the Field of mine, deeply seeded in a large multinational, sent me an e-mail he received from company's Office of Diversity.  It was heralding the \"great success\" of their \"initiative\" to employ and promote more women in the company.  They had an arbitrarily set goal of increasing female employment (in this predominantly IT/Tech male company) up to 30%, and even handed out awards to employees that came up with the \"top three ideas\" on how to get more women on board (this included a \"mother's contract,\" a blatantly sexist policy of hiring one woman for every man regardless of ability, and - the only sane one - to attract more women into STEM).  You couple this with the recent statement from SalesForce.com's new \"Chief Equality Officer\" Tony Prophet, \" At Ford, quality is job one.  At Salesforce, equality is job one. \" and it is painfully clear that corporate America has abandoned excellence as a means to profitability, replacing it instead with virtue signalling, rent seeking, politicking, and marketing/pandering to racial/sexual in-tribe biases. This, of course, is not only morally wrong, but blatantly sexist (and racist) as you consciously and purposely give preferential treatment to people based on the color of their skin, or their plumbing downstairs, over the content of their character.  And anybody with an ounce of self-respect, intellectual honesty, a work ethic, and an adherence to true fairness should be outraged at this cowardice and evil. But then the ole Captain's wheels started turning, and in a very Enjoy the Decline-esque way, he make a very important epiphany.  Yes, it may be unfair we are giving preferential treatment to women over men.  Yes, we are sacrificing a meritocracy for sexism.  And yes, this will lead to lower production, lower economic growth, genuine injustice, and a lessening of standards of living.  But so what?   If you really sit down and think about it Corporate America isn't worth it. Let the women have it. It's All Yours, Sweetheart! If it were the 1950's and corporations were booming and headed up by more fair and meritocratic WWII managerial class, I could see Corporate America being a place you'd want to be.  You'd be compensated for excellence and hard work.  You'd be promoted for innovation and creativity.  It would be a reasonably just system where loyalty was rewarded, stable employment was offered, and corporate corruption was at a minimum (at least compared to today). But it's not the 1950's any more.  It's \"the current year\" and corporations are a fraction of the equitable places of employment they once were. Gone are the managers from the WWII generation that led these corporations to their heights and their Jack Welshian logical, but fair management.  They are now replaced with legions of inept, MBA-laden Baby Boomer scum whose only accomplishment was halving US economic growth, getting the largest bank bail out in history, and sending the US into the largest financial crisis since the Great Depression . Gone is stable employment and the goodies that came with it.  You don't get pensions, you don't get health care, and you certainly don't get that 30 years of lifelong employment that once made a 30 year mortgage a relatively risk free proposition.  Now you can get outsourced, train in your own replacements , be perpetually employed as a contractor, and let go if your job can be done for a fraction of a cent cheaper in China. And let's not forget the wave of psychotic political BS these past 20 years that has infected Corporate America and just chides the morality and honor of good, honest workers, particularly of the male persuasion.  There's the HR lady epidemic where we put power hungry, inept, math-impaired 20 something ditzes at the helm of our hiring process.  There's \"Corporate Social Responsibility\" where we force unrelated and unnecessary political crusades on our employees be it donating to the United Way, mandating weekends be spent on charities, or wearing pink every year.  There's diversity, sexual harassment, and sensitivity training where we blatantly treat men like sexual predators, molesters, rapists, and racists, humiliating them to attend said trainings.  There's the eggshell environment men get to work in, one mere false sexual harassment accusation away from being fired.  There's the invasion of privacy into our personal lives where the politically correct Corporate Abwehr will fire you over a facebook post.  There's progressive credentialism where the HR Reichstag demands you have masters degrees for entry level jobs.  There's the blatant sexism against males as previously evidenced before with clearly sexist policies favoring less-qualified women for the sake of \"diversity.\"  And let's not forget this raw deal is topped off with the number one cause of divorce, marital strife,",
      "When a parking lot attendant dared to recycle trash he picked up outside an upstate New York Walmart, the store fired him. Now generous strangers are trying to help cushion his sudden fall.\n\nThomas Smith, 52, had been earning $9 an hour at an upstate New York Walmart for less than three months when his manager terminated him over the cans. Smith was in charge of rounding up shopping carts from the lot outside the store, and started collecting trash from the lot while making his rounds. After storing up cans for a couple months, he recycled them in the store's machines in early November. He got $5.10 for them.\n\nThen he got fired. His manager told Smith his actions were \"tantamount to theft of Walmart property,\" the Albany Times Union reports, and said he would have to repay the $5.10 or lose his job. Smith, who commuted an hour by bus from Albany for the job, returned to the store two days later with the cash. But he'd already been fired.\n\n\"I didn't know you couldn't take empties left behind. They were garbage. I didn't even get a chance to explain myself,\" Smith told the paper. He also said his manager told him that a coworker who'd been caught stealing cash from a store register was allowed to keep her job because she repaid the theft and \"because she has five kids.\"\n\nThat thief was white. Smith collected trash while black.\n\nThe store manager who made the decision refused to speak with the Times-Union, and a Walmart spokesman told the paper it does not comment on personnel matters. After the story got picked up by local TV news, a company representative claimed Smith had admitted to stealing from inside the store itself. \"They certainly didn't indicate that both when I talked to them and our attorney talked to them,\" Alice Green of the Center for Law and Justice said of that claim. Smith says he wrote out a statement for managers acknowledging he'd recycled the cans and no more.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSmith's story has prompted strangers to send money through the crowdfunding site GoFundMe. So far the effort has collected more than $2,200 — an amount Smith would've had to work more than six weeks at full-time hours to earn.\n\nWhile going viral for his sudden termination from a low-wage job has provided some short-term help, Smith will likely still have a hard time getting back on his feet. He was paroled in May after more than a dozen years in prison for armed robbery. He'd spent four months homeless after his release before finding housing through a charitable group. The Walmart job would have been one of his first, if not his very first, opportunities since his release for earning a living and achieving a degree of economic independence.\n\nFormerly incarcerated people face immense hurdles to re-entering society and the workforce. Trust is hard to come by. Many job applications feature a check-box requiring applicants to volunteer information about their criminal history, which generally ruins their chances of even getting an interview.\n\nThe rejection naturally encourages desperate people to return to criminal activity for an income, as Glenn Martin, who now runs a non-profit that works with the formerly incarcerated and was turned away from 50 different jobs in the month after his own release from prison, has described. Activists like Martin say efforts to reform the criminal justice and prison systems should include \"ban the box\" measures to restrict how hiring managers can ask about criminal histories — something President Obama recently did for federal hiring practices — and a revamp of education programs behind bars.\n\nSince being fired, Smith has gotten plugged in with a legal aid group in Albany that is helping him recover his footing and that may eventually help him sue Walmart over his treatment. For now, though, he's more worried about how he's going to buy Christmas presents for his two teenage children.",
      "Back in the headlines after his recent Celebrity Apprentice win, Arsenio Hall is mulling a return to the late-night syndicated talk show circuit. I hear Hall has been in talks with CBS TV Distribution about a project that also may involve Tribune. There are no deals in place but if conversations materialize, Hall will likely film a presentation. CBS TV Distribution declined comment. Immediately following his Celebrity Apprentice victory a week ago, Hall spoke publicly of his desire to return to television in a more permanent fashion. A deal with CBS TV Distribution would mark a reunion for the company and Hall. His syndicated late-night Arsenio Hall Show, which ran from 1989 to 1994, was produced by CBS TV Distribution predecessor Paramount Domestic TV.",

      "stress-ng 0.07.07 released\nstress-ng is a tool that I have been developing on-and-off for a few years. It is designed to stress kernels to force out bugs, stress CPU and memory and also contains some performance benchmarking metrics too. stress-ng is now entering the maturity part of the development phase, however, there is always scope to add new stressors and generally improve the tool.   I've just released version 0.07.07 for the Ubuntu Zesty 17.04 release and it contains a few additional features: SIGUSR2 sent to stress-ng will dump out the current system load and memory statistics Sched policy stress tests for different scheduler configurations Add a missing --sockfd-port option And various bug fixes: Fixed up some minor memory leaks Missing counter stats on bind-mount, fp-error, personality and resources stressors Fix the --fiemap-bytes option Fix up build warnings with various compilers and static analyzers The major change to stress-ng over the past month was an internal re-working of system call and GNU features to abstract these into a shim layer to reduce the number build conditional #ifdef paths around code. This simplifies portability, so the code now builds more easily across a range of systems and with various versions of gcc and clang and fixes some issues on older kernels too.   This makes the code also faster to statically analyze with cppcheck.

      "Joining the arrival of Visual Studio 2015, the Microsoft created functional language F# has made its 4th release. The changes to the language include a lengthy list of new features, bug fixes, and language additions combined with some performance improvements. Joining this are several changes that improve VS2015's handling of the language to ease debugging and editing.\n\nMicrosoft makes a point of noting that version 4 was developed publicly with strong community involvement. As previously noted, approximately a quarter of the contributors are affiliated with Microsoft—the rest are outsiders. As noted by the Visual F# team, there is a minor bug in VS2015 whereby F# 4.0 RTM is incorrectly labeled Visual F# 2015 RC. If VS2015 RTM is installed with F#, you are getting F# 4.0 RTM. The full release notes provide complete details on version 4, which corresponds to the changes made through commit dd8252e.\n\nExisting F# developers can watch a quick overview video provided by Microsoft's Lincoln Atkinson that describes some of the new F# 4.0 features. Those new to the language may want to start with the resources at the F# Software Foundation or TryF#.\n\nDevelopers looking to get involved with F# 4.0 have several routes to choose from. Windows developers will probably find that installing VS2015 RTM is the fastest route. Those on Windows who would like to contribute to F# development or use non-VS2015 tools can make use of the Visual F# repository. Interested developers on non-Windows platforms should direct their attention to the Open Edition of F# and its corresponding GitHub repository. Changes and additions flow from the Visual F# repository to the Open Edition repository, but care is taken so that the two projects do not diverge intentionally or otherwise.",
      "Washington, D.C. 1969 passenger issue. This undated, unstickered black and white baseplate was issued to all vehicles in D.C. at the end of 1968. It was valid without stickers through the end of 1969. This numbering sequence started at around 500-001, where the 1967-68 base had left off. This baseplate was used with stickers through the end of 1974.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1971 passenger issue. D.C. stopped issuing yearly dated plates after 1966, however registration numbers between 1 and 1250 continue to be issued yearly through the present. These plates are issued specially through the Mayor's office, so yearly reissues allowed the \"bigwigs\" to sport shiny new plates every year. The arrangement also allowed numbers to be shuffled if a registrant happened to fall in or out of favor with the Mayor or city council, if the administration changed, etc. Best stay on His Honor's good side if you want to remain in the Elite 1250 next year.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1971 passenger issue. Same series as above, this is the standard stickered version of the baseplate. This series proceeded to plate number 999-999, then some plates in the 400-000 series were issued as overflow in 1974 before the base was discontinued.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1976 passenger issue. In 1975, this \"Bicentennial\" issue plate was introduced. It featured an embossed image of the U.S. Capitol dome in the center of the plate, which carried over until 1985. These plates were issued from 1975 through 1977, but remained valid with stickers through 1985.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1977 passenger issue. Again, low-number plates (1250 or less) are reissued annually in D.C. Until 1974, new plates with embossed dates were issued each year. Starting in 1976, new stickered plates were issued each year, as opposed to the embossed date plates issued previously. Plates on the Bicentennial base started this format with the embossed Capitol dome offset to the left.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1980 passenger issue. Starting in 1978, the Bicentennial base was modified to change back to the \"Nation's Capital\" slogan. This change occurred around plate number 500-000. This base was issued through the end of 1984 and got to almost the end of the 949-000 series. Though this base dropped the embossed '3-31' expiration, a sticker was added to the plate during production - the one on this plate is underneath the clearcoat.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1983 passenger issue. Later issue on the Nation's Capital base, the 3-31 sticker was dropped after 1980 as the designation was added to the year sticker itself.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1983 passenger issue. Low number issue on the Nation's Capital base, using the same format as the low Bicentennial plates with the capitol dome offset to the left.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1987 passenger issue. All vehicles were issued these new \"A Capital City\" baseplates in 1986, and these plates were issued through the end of 1990. These plates feature the new slogan and a separator graphic consisting of the District's flag design. I'd heard that the numbering sequence started at 950-000, but have had reports of a '930' series plate on this base, so now I'm not sure. After 999-999, they switched to 010-000 through approximately 500-000. This base remains valid today with proper stickers. This particular plate looks as if the \"8\" die may have been placed upside-down.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1991 passenger issue. Again with this base, low-numbered plates were reissued with stickers each year. On this baseplate, the graphic was modified on these low-number plates so that there are two D.C. flag graphics with the serial centered in between.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1994 passenger issue. Starting in 1991, the slogan on these plates was changed to \"Celebrate & Discover\", in honor of the city's Bicentennial. The plate was otherwise unchanged from the 1986 baseplate. This series ran from around the 500-000 series through plate number 899-999.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1992 passenger issue. Low-numbered plates were again reissued yearly on this base, with registrants receiving the \"Celebrate & Discover\" slogan for the first time with their 1992 plates. The base is unchanged otherwise from the older \"A Capital City\" low-digit plates.\n\nWashington, D.C. 1998 passenger issue. In 1997, when plate number 899-999 was reached, this series changed to an AB-1234 format. \"Washington, D.C.\" and \"Celebrate & Discover\" were reversed as well on these plates, creating a significant base variation.",
      "The economy contracted at a 1.0% pace in the second quarter, according to the advance estimate from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. That's bad, of course, but much better than the 5.4% and 6.4% pace of declines in the two previous quarters.\n\nWhenever the GDP data come out, the first thing I look at is Table 2, which shows how much different sectors of the economy contributed to the growth (or, in this case, the decline). The most striking thing about Q2 is how broad the weakness was:\n\nAs the chart shows, Q2 witnessed declines in every major category of private demand: consumer spending, residential investment, business investment in equipment and software (E&S), business investment in structures, and exports. Wow. To find the last time that happened, you have to go all the way back to … the fourth quarter of last year, when it was even more severe. But before that, you have to go back five decades to the sharp downturn of the late 1950s.\n\nNot surprisingly, government spending helped offset the declines in private spending. Most of the boost came from defense spending, but state and local investment also helped (perhaps some glimmers of stimulus?).\n\nA sharp decline in imports, finally, was the biggest contributor to growth in Q2, at least in an accounting sense. It's important to choose your words carefully here, since declining imports are clearly not the path to prosperity. In a GDP accounting sense, however, import declines do boost measured growth. Why? Well consider the fall in consumer spending. That decline affected both domestic production and imports. GDP measures domestic production, so we need a way to net out the decline in consumer spending that was attributable to imports. That's one of the factors being captured in the imports figure.\n\nNote: If the idea of contributions to GDP growth is new to you, here's a quick primer on how to understand these figures. Consumer spending makes up about 70% of the economy. Consumer spending fell at a 1.2% pace in the second quarter. Putting those figures together, we say that consumer spending contributed about -0.9 percentage points (70% x -1.2%, allowing for some rounding) to second quarter growth.\n\nAs I mentioned a few weeks ago, today's GDP release is particularly important because the fine people at the BEA have gone back and made revisions to the entire history of GDP statistics. I will post again once I have a chance to review how history has changed.\n\nAdvertisements",

      "Supreme Court Justice Salim Joubran has the right not to sing the national anthem, \"Hatikva.\" The law doesn't oblige him to do so, and the song's lyrics don't enable him to do so. As a loyal citizen of his country, the justice did not want to betray his conscience during the new Supreme Court president's inauguration by singing a song whose words are alien to every Arab citizen of Israel. And the uproar that erupted following Joubran's refusal damaged the delicate fabric of Israeli democracy far more than his silence did.\n\nAgainst the background of the chorus of denunciations from the right, the position taken by Knesset Speaker Reuven Rivlin and Vice Prime Minister Moshe Ya'alon, both of whom came to Joubran's defense, was particularly noteworthy. They deserve high praise for this.\n\nSupreme Court Justice Salim Joubran. Tomer Appelbaum\n\nThe lyrics of Israel's anthem were written in 1878 by Naphtali Herz Imber as an expression of the national sentiments of the Jewish people, and the Jewish people only. No Arab citizen who had any self-respect, political awareness or national consciousness could sing these words without commiting the sins of hypocrisy and falsehood.\n\nAn Arab citizen cannot sing \"a Jewish soul yearns\" or \"the hope of 2,000 years,\" words that ignore the existence of an Arab minority in the State of Israel - a minority for whom this land is also their land.\n\nIn choosing not to join the choir singing \"Hatikva,\" the justice made an important contribution to our public discourse. He adroitly reminded Israeli society of the complex situation faced by Arab citizens in the Jewish state. The right to remain silent (his own and that of every Arab citizen ) is the flip side of the right to freedom of expression, and both must be held sacred.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

      "If you want to tempt fate, organize an expedition to one of the polar regions to call attention to the perils of global warming.

      "If the Queen's governess were still alive today, she may have noticed a few discordant notes in her charge's formerly crystal clear diction. OK, she ain' exactly droppin' her Ts and her Gs like Russell Brand, but linguists have nevertheless found that her enunciation today might have been considered a little, well, common in her youth.\n\nHer Majesty is by no means alone in this. The cut-glass accent of the upper class – the soundtrack to period dramas like Downton Abbey and Upstairs, Downstairs – has become a little rough around the edges over the last few decades, as more and more people adopt a kind of aristo-cockney hybrid.\n\nDecrying the fall of the aristocratic accent may seem like a symptom of the peculiarly British obsession with class, but the fact that even the Queen no longer speaks the \"Queen's English\" of days gone by offers us a fascinating insight into the forces that shape our voices.\n\nAdvertisement This media cannot be played on your device. Are you ready to unlock Britain's best-kept secrets? London and surrounds offer an irresistible cacophony of nightlife, food and drink, natural wonders and world-leading culture for you to check out. We've delved into London and its neighbouring cities of Brighton, Bristol, Liverpool and Manchester – all within approximately 2 hours – to unlock their best-kept secrets. Whether you're in town for a couple of hours, a few days or a week, allow yourself to be swept up by Britain's allure. Click here to find out more\n\nThe idea of a \"proper\" accent only emerged fairly recently in the history of the English language. As Jonnie Robinson, a sociolinguist at the British Library points out, Samuel Johnson chose not to suggest the pronunciation of words in his Dictionary of the English Language, as he felt there was little agreement about the correct way to articulate his terms. \"If you go back to the 18th Century, even the gentry, the educated and wealthy would have spoken with something like a local voice,\" Robinson says. Doctor Johnson himself was famous for having a Lichfield accent.\n\nIt is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished, since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better educated than anybody else – Nancy Mitford\n\nIt was the increasing popularity of boarding schools that began to change the way the elite spoke, Robinson says, as they began to promote an accent that more closely resembled the sounds of the South East of England (where many of the schools and universities were based). Soon, the accent itself became a marker of class and power, an association that only became exacerbated when the BBC adopted this so-called \"Received Pronunciation\" for its first broadcasts (you can watch an example below). \"It was a voice that everyone in the UK and across the world associated with authority,\" says Robinson.\n\nBy the middle of the 20th Century, the class system itself had become a little more fluid; now, accent was one of the few ways to mark out those who had inherited their wealth from those who had earned it. As the novelist, essayist (and aristocrat) Nancy Mitford ironically expressed in the book Noblesse Oblige: \"It is solely by their language that the upper classes nowadays are distinguished – since they are neither cleaner, richer, nor better-educated than anybody else.\"\n\nPerhaps it was only a matter of time before that linguistic divide would begin to close too. As more and more people of working class background have begun to occupy positions of power – some characteristics of more regional southern English accents have started to creep into the crystal tones of Received Pronunciation. \"There are now those who speak a more modern form that verges on 'estuary' English, which is a mixture of RP and cockney,\" says Jonathan Harrington at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich.\n\nIn the past, for instance, RP speakers may have said \"poor\" and \"moor\" with a diphthong – a combination of two vowel sounds – so that it sounds something like \"poo-uh\"; today, they are more likely to pronounce the words so that they sound identical to \"paw\" and \"maw\". Conversely, the Ys at the end of words like \"really\" and \"very\" have become longer, and less clipped than in the past (when they sounded closer to the E in \"pet\"). Similarly, the As in \"the cat sat on the mat\" were once produced with a smaller mouth opening on the vowel, so it was pronounced something like \"the ket set on the met\".\n\nSome younger speakers may even use glottal stops in place of the Ts in phrases such as \"it is\" or \"that is\", Robinson says. To Mitford's ears, these changes would have sounded like Pygmalion in reverse, as if Professor Higgins had taken the season's debutantes and turned them into cock",

The Kiev government called it a \"gross violation of Ukraine's sovereignty\".\n\nMr Putin praised Crimea for joining Russia, as he marked the Soviet victory over the Nazis in World War Two.\n\nAs he visited, there were deadly new clashes in south-eastern Ukraine.\n\nUkraine's Interior Minister Arsen Avakov said at least 20 pro-Russian activists and a Ukrainian security officer died in the clashes in the port of Mariupol.\n\nAt the scene Victory Day is supposed to be about remembering the sacrifices of World War Two, but today in Sevastopol it became a party. People brought picnics and reserved tables in the restaurants with the best views. Children cheered the soldiers, who marched past wearing their new orange and white ribbon medals, won for \"the return of Crimea\". The parade was small but the crowds were huge, and then, after lunch, the Kremlin security men arrived. Slowly the main square was cleared and anticipation grew. Then off a boat stepped President Putin, landing in a city that he says never stopped being Russian. The people of Sevastopol brought their white, blue and red flags and hailed him like a conquering hero. They were treated to a rare moment when he shook hands.

      "As Blockchain-based cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ether continue to progress in terms of development and popularity, the mass adoption dream begins to look more achievable.\n\nHowever, there is still much to do and even Bitcoin, the most popular, valuable and secure cryptocurrency is far from being consumer-ready.\n\nEven though Bitcoin couldn't handle mainstream adoption if it happened today, there are other key factors that must first be dealt with if we are to ever break out of the \"Blockchain sandbox\".\n\nWhile Blockchain technology has come a long way, there is still a lot to be done. The four problems analyzed are still major impediments and some continue to be problems in the traditional economy itself.\n\nThe Blockchain development sector is one where creativity and commitment never cease to amaze, and as so we think the future will continue to shine bright for cryptos.\n\nScalability\n\nThis is the first thing that comes to mind and the most incapacitating roadblock. Bitcoin's transactions throughput capacity were put to the test these recent months, and the results are well-known: delayed transactions, high fees, and a lot of name calling on Twitter.\n\nYes, scalability is a problem in and of itself, but the tension created by the discussions surrounding it can be just as bad, leading to panic sales in the market, competing protocol changes, and overall confusion for entrant users.\n\nLuckily, this has been a main focus in the developer community with no shortage of ideas and BIP (Bitcoin Improvement Proposals) being submitted to that effect.\n\nMany developers have also turned their sights to alternative Blockchains that are designed with the latest technology and mass adoption in mind.\n\nCustomer protection\n\nEarlier this month, the crypto community rejoiced as Bitcoin's market cap overtook PayPal's. This, however, can also be viewed as a problem.\n\nAlthough Bitcoin has overshadowed the PayPal stock, its user base is nowhere near the 210 mln users that own a PayPal account.\n\nWith this in mind, it's simple to conclude that crypto is still a highly speculative market.\n\nSo, what's stopping people from using Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies that offer far more advanced technology than that employed by PayPal?\n\nTwo words: consumer protection. There is simply no such thing in crypto.\n\nIf you want to buy something with Bitcoin, you either have to trust the merchant completely or you have to get an additional escrow agent that can mediate the transaction, making the whole process complicated and expensive.\n\nNuno Correia, CEO of Utrust says his team is building a simple, yet effective solution on a platform that will feature its own consumer protection system, allowing users to shop online with the same ease they do when using eBay or PayPal.\n\nCointelegraph asks Correia how the platform can help cryptocurrencies achieve mass adoption.\n\nHe states:\n\n\"UTRUST will bring confidence to crypto adopters. They will no longer feel that they are taking a risk when purchasing online!\"\n\nVolatility\n\nBitcoin is no stranger to volatility, the bipolar cousin of inflation. Although volatility is where traders make a living, it's not a desired property in any currency.\n\nThis problem ties in nicely with the consumer protection issue we just reviewed.\n\nMerchants and customers are the two basic components of any transaction and although there are many Bitcoiners out there ready to spend their BTC wherever they can, merchants may be reluctant to deal with the added risk.\n\nWhile the system employed in the Utrust platform allows merchants to deal with fiat only, this is not a complete solution to the volatility problem.\n\nHowever, projects like Bitshares, Waves and Tether are leveraging Blockchain technology to provide us with Blockchain-based fiat tokens like BitUSD, wUSD, and USDT, respectively.\n\nSecurity\n\nThis isn't a cryptocurrency-specific problem per se, but it's still something that must be addressed urgently if cryptocurrencies are to continue on their ascent towards the mainstream stage.\n\nWe're not even talking about the ridiculous numbers of scams, schemes and tricks designed to take your coins online. We're talking about exchanges.\n\nExchanges have become a gateway into the cryptocurrency world, providing a convenient and affordable service.\n\nHowever, these same exchanges have become centralized fail points to an otherwise decentralized economy.\n\nFrom the infamous Mt. Gox hack, to the latest problems found in Bitfinex and BTC-e, this problem doesn't seem to have got better with time.\n\nThe solution lies with decentralized exchanges (DEX). Open-source projects like Bitsquare, Waves DEX and the upcoming BarterDEX by SuperNet all put control back in the user's hand, allowing them to buy and sell cryptocurrencies without the need to trust a third-party entity, promoting security, privacy and efficiency.\n\nAudo, Community Leader of SuperNet, tells Cointelegraph:",

      "Last summer, Encopresis Expert, Nurse Shelly Dean, was invited to present information regarding encopresis to attendees of the Summer Institute for School Nursing sponsored by the Virginia Department of Education.\n\nInterestingly, one of the most pressing questions was, \"After how many bowel accidents should a school nurse be concerned about the possibility of encopresis and contact the child's parents or caregiver?\" According to medical guidelines, having at least one accident a month over a period of three months is one of the criteria for encopresis. Typically, children are fully potty-trained before coming to school and just one accident is enough to warrant concern about possible encopresis. Click here to view video excerpts from her presentation.\n\nDuring the presentation, the research article, Managing Encopresis in the Elementary School Setting: The School Nurses Role, was referenced. As stated in the article, school nurses play a vital role in assisting children and their families with managing encopresis. It is a school nurse's responsibility, according to the Individual's with Disabilities Act (IDEA) of 1975, to intervene when a health problem, such as encopresis, has been recognized. The Individual's with Disabilities Act dictates that all children, regardless of disabilities, are eligible for an individual education plan (IEP). This plan is developed to include nursing and other necessary services, based on an individual child's needs, to assist the child in reaching their educational goals. These other services can include special accommodations for bathroom access. School nurses are, as a result of these laws, responsible for assessing, planning and intervening on behalf of a child with a medical need, and developing individual health care plans that are specific to that child. Nurses in the school setting can play a vital role in the care of children with encopresis by helping them to establish an individualized health plan.\n\nRemember, proactive partnerships with school personnel, health care providers and scientifically proven tools, such as UCanPoopToo, can make a difference in reducing the length and severity of your child's encopresis.\n\nFor more information on this article and to understand how UCanPoopToo can help you both take action now and regularly monitor your child's progress, visit www.ucanpooptoo.com.",

      "Attendance in April isn't likely to make or break a team's season at the box office. Numbersgenerally trends upwards from the beginning to the end of a season. Nor is that surprising: the weather gets better, kids get out of school, and the games generally have greater playoff implications.\n\nApril's attendance numbers are more often based on a combination of expectations and tradition. Teams that are expected to be competitive — the Cardinals, the Dodgers, the Giants — are going to sell a lot of tickets. As the season progresses, of course, clubs that fall out of a playoff race can expect a decline in attendance relative to their more competitive seasons. Conversely, teams that have surprisingly good years can see increases. Nevertheless, in terms of predictive measures of yearly attendance, a club's April attendance is more significant than its April win-loss record. For teams like the Mets and Royals, that's bad news. For the Orioles and Phillies, however, the outlook is much better.\n\nEarly on in the season, here's what the average attendance per home game looks like for every team.\n\nThe Dodgers, just like they do every year, have the early lead and will likely continue to have one all year. That's not surprising: they play in a massive stadium and even bigger market. The Cardinals, Giants, and Chicago Cubs are up there, too, with the defending World Champions benefiting not only from a great team but a renovated ballpark. The Blue Jays were a middle-of-the-pack team just a few seasons ago, but have shot up the last few years following a string of successful seasons. The general lesson here? Be competitive and the people will come — especially in larger markets.\n\nAt the end of the list, we see MLB's problem children: a couple clubs (Oakland and Tampa Bay) with stadium issues, as well as a handful of smaller-markets and cold-weather teams of whom little is expected this year. Even after a World Series appearance, Cleveland isn't immune from some of the challenges inherent to drawing fans in Cleveland.\n\nOverall, attendance is up relative to this point last year — a good sign for the health of the league. Some of that increase has to do with the new stadium in Cobb County, as new stadiums tend to enjoy increases in attendance (although that increase hasn't been that great). Perhaps it has to do with the move away from the city or low expectations for the team this year, but the increase for the Braves isn't quite the highest in MLB this year, as the graph below shows.\n\nFrom just these numbers, one might suppose that Baltimore is benefiting from a big jump. The club's attendance has certainly improved over last April, but what we're actually seeing here is a return to the club's attendance numbers from April 2015. In 2016, Baltimore was coming off a disappointing 81-81 season after three consecutive winning seasons and two playoff berths. After another winning season last year, fans have returned. In Philadelphia, the rebuild has taken its toll on attendance over the last few seasons, but it looks like fans are beginning to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and attendance is back over 30,000 this season. The team still isn't anywhere near the 40,000-plus days when they won five straight division titles half a dozen years ago, but they appear to have seen the bottom.\n\nIn Cleveland and Washington, fans appear to be reacting to good 2016 seasons along with high expectations for the year. Cleveland still ranks near the bottom for attendance overall in April, but that should increase as the season goes on and the big jump in attendance so far is a very good sign for Cleveland. As mentioned, Atlanta has the new stadium. Seattle has seen a slow increase in attendance over the last several years, although a poor season and 16th consecutive year without the playoffs could flatten that growth.\n\nOn the negative side, the Royals have seen a major downturn in attendance in the early going, and their poor record isn't likely to help matters, especially if they sell off their best players this summer. The good news for the Royals is that they still haven't sunk to the attendance levels that marked the seasons before their consecutive World Series runs. Royals attendance in 2016 was roughly 10,000 fans per game higher than it was in 2013, the year before they made their first World Series trip. A drop of 6,500 is bad, but enthusiasm at the beginning of last season was high coming off a championship, and they should still remain above 2013 and even 2014 levels the rest of the season.\n\nApril attendance does matter and generally signals how many fans are going to be there come summertime. The scatter plot below shows the attendance differences in April from 2015 to 2016 and the attendance differences at the end of the season from 2015 to 2016.\n\nThere's a pretty strong relationship between attendance changes in April and attendance changes at the end of the season. Last year, we saw Toronto on the positive side, benefiting from big jumps in",

From left, Jason Alexander, Jerry Seinfeld, Julia Louis-Dreyfus and Michael Richards. (Featureflash Photo Agency/Shutterstock.com)\n\nA North Dakota judge has denied a prosecution request for a new judge in a murder conspiracy trial in an opinion that took the lawyers to task for their heated arguments.\n\nJudge Thomas Merrick lamented a lack of civility and cited a lesson from Seinfeld in his opinion, the Minot Daily News reports. A story was also published in the Bismarck Tribune.\n\n\"There was a time, and not too long ago, when lawyers in North Dakota were collegial to one another and respectful towards the bench,\" Merrick wrote.\n\n\"Perhaps that was because they knew, as the 'Seinfeld' characters discovered, that a $20 bill lost may soon be counterbalanced by a $20 bill found. Perhaps they realized that while their present client is holding aces, their next might not. In the small universe of the courthouse, civility and doing the right thing was once as important as winning. No more. Now, any adverse ruling is taken as an affront.\"\n\nProsecutors had asked Merrick to oust Judge Stacy Louser from presiding in the trial of former schoolteacher Cynthia Wilder, accused of helping her husband plan the murder of his first wife.\n\nIn a July 5 hearing, Ward County Deputy State's Attorney Kelly Dillon asserted a general concern over Louser's ability to control a courtroom and said her office had disagreed with Louser's rulings in previous cases. Defense lawyer Patrick Waters countered that the prosecution was \"judge shopping\" and said the state was \"throwing a tantrum\" because it didn't like Louser's past rulings.\n\nMerrick agreed with the judge-shopping argument. \"I can only conclude that they are not seeking impartiality but favor,\" he wrote.\n\nMerrick said he doubted that any other judge would do a better job controlling a courtroom \"if lawyers continue choosing unrelenting argument over zealous advocacy.\"",

      "The City of Phoenix is warning bus passengers that bus drivers could vote to strike this week.\n\nPhoenix Public Transit Department spokesman Matthew Heil tells New Times that the contracted bus service, First Transit Inc., informed the city that it gave a \"best and final offer\" to the Amalgamated Transit Union Local 1433.\n\nSee also: -East Valley Buses Back on the Road, Compromise Ends 4-Day Strike\n\nThe members of ATU Local 1433 are expected to vote today and tomorrow on the contract offer, and perhaps a subsequent strike.\n\nATU Local 1433's president didn't immediately respond to New Times' request for comment, but the union's website includes a snippet to members, urging them not to accept the contract:\n\n\"The Union does not recommend that you accept this offer as it is clearly designed to increase corporate profits (from Phoenix taxpayers) out of your pockets. The offer does not [address] major language issues and work rule issues that the Union has raised, it does not better your work, your income or your lives. Your raises will continue to be eaten up by the ever increasing cost of the Company 'self-insured' insurance plan. The Union recommends a huge rejection of this poor deal and that you authorize the President to call a strike if we cannot fix the issues after we meet again with management.\"\n\nThe collective bargaining agreement between the union and First Transit Inc. actually expired on June 30.\n\nIt's unknown how many people would be affected by a strike, although the city does keep track of ridership, and provided us with those statistics. In the average month, there are about 1.2 million rides taken on the 14 bus routes operated by First Transit. According to the city, the routes down Thomas Road and Indian School road are two of the city's busiest.\n\nA map of the First Transit routes can be seen below:\n\nThis same union and transit operator couldn't come to terms on a CBA for drivers in some East Valley cities last year, leading to a four-day strike for drivers in some parts of Tempe, Mesa, Chandler, Gilbert, Scottsdale, and Phoenix. Another company contracted for bus routes in Phoenix, Veolia Transportation, has also had recent battles with the ATU.\n\nUPDATE 5:17 p.m.: From ATU Local 1433 president Bob Bean: \"The ATU will not have any comments until after the completion of the vote Tuesday night at 6 p.m.\"\n\nUPDATE December 31: ATU Local 1433 members rejected the CBA, but there's no immediate strike.\n\n\"Public Transit staff was informed this evening that the offer was rejected, but that the parties will discuss returning to the bargaining table in the coming days,\" a city statement says. \"Currently, there are no immediate impacts to bus service. Interruptions to transit service could occur if the two parties do not return to negotiations or agree to extensions.\"\n\nIf you rely on bus service in Phoenix, the city says to check phoenix.gov/publictransit for any updates.\n\nGot a tip?

      "I purchased the Timber Rattler Fury Bowie knife after the purchase of such a knife was suggested to me by a reliable source. Purchased through Kennesaw Cutlery located in Georgia – it was only $9.99.\n\nWith that said – let me go ahead and say it – I know, I know – it is a cheap knife made in a foreign country. It is not a Buck, a Gerber, a Cold Steel nor a Reeves. I knew this going in and I also knew I would get some flak for even holding such a knife. So – why take a gander at such a piece of steel? It is called budget survival. If someone can purchase a knife for $20.00 that will work for them rather than $100 – that is $80 that can be spent on other beans, bullets and band-aides. I am not at all suggesting that a $10 or $20 knife will last through a lifetime of daily hard use.\n\nAbove – you can see the Timber Rattler bowie ready to be put to work. This is not a small knife. The blade alone is 10.5″ and came to be very sharp. Initial impressions with the knife was positive. Handle is hardwood and felt comfortable. The pommel and guard are both brass. Everything was secure and nothing wobbled. The knife is big and heavy- felt rather sturdy. The sheath not so much. It is pretty thin and flimsy.\n\nTo conduct some testing I figured I would try to accelerate usage of the knife.\n\nAbove is a tree which sits at approx 5 inches in diameter. Chopping my way through this tree should expose the Rattler Jungle Fury to some decent amount of stress.\n\nOnce I started chopping away – the sharp edge took some decent chunks out of the tree.\n\nNo easy task – at this point I am most of the way through and worked my way around the perimeter. About 5 minutes worth of sweat.\n\nChecking the knife – the edge is decent – certainly not as sharp as it came out of the box.\n\nAbove – finally all the way through. Was not as difficult as I expected – took about 7-8 minutes.\n\nNext up for the Timber is to split the log pictured below.\n\nI placed the Timber Rattler across the top of the log and pounded the back side of the knife across the entire length to drive it into the log. I used a large stick like a club. Within no time the log split. Initially – I really \"walloped\" on the knife with some decent force.\n\nAs can be seen above – success!! I went ahead and split the pieces again – great for the fire pit.\n\nFinal Report: I am pretty impressed. I really expected this knife to fall apart while I was chopping on the tree. Is it a good survival knife? It is a cheap knife that seems to be pretty sturdy. For those looking for what appears to be decent reliability and utility for a cheap price – go for it.\n\nMore tests to come……\n\nRourke\n\nLike what you read?\n\nThen you're gonna love my free PDF, 20 common survival items, 20 uncommon survival uses for each.

He smoked the rocks he didn't sell and often appeared as strung out as his customers.\n\nJevon Lawson pictured in 2008. (Erica Sciarretta)\n\nBut in 2008, he moved into a $400,000 house, started driving a champagne-colored Humvee, and made himself the star act of his own hip-hop label. He abandoned the crack business. Found something better, he told associates.\n\nWhat he found was OxyContin from Southern California, where organized drug rings were colluding with rogue doctors and pharmacies to obtain enormous quantities of the drug.\n\nJevon Lawson pictured in 2008. (Erica Sciarretta)\n\nIllicit OxyContin devastated the entire Everett region. At the height of the drug's popularity, it was a factor in more than half of the crimes in Snohomish County. Abuse of the drug touched off an epidemic of painkiller and heroin addiction, which continues to this day.\n\nThe crisis swept up many young people, such as Katie McKnight, the daughter of an Everett physician whose dependency outlasted seven trips to rehab, and Brandon Smith, who lost a promising career at Nintendo and, ultimately, his freedom to OxyContin.\n\nFollowing the pills An Inland Empire branch of the Crips trafficked pills out of L.A. and by plane. The destination was Everett, Wash. (Raoul Rañoa / Los Angeles Times Graphics)\n\nAuthorities in Everett knew much ofthe drug was coming from traffickers in the Los Angeles area, but they were unable to determine how pills were getting on the black market. A Times review of court records and law enforcement reports suggests that several people who sent OxyContin from Southern California to Lawson in Everett were buying pills from Lake Medical, a clinic near MacArthur Park that was a front for a drug ring.\n\nThe records, along with interviews of law enforcement officials, indicate that Inland Empire Crips gang members drove bags of OxyContin north on Interstate 5 to Washington State and sent couriers aboard planes to Seattle with pills strapped to their bodies.\n\nAt the time OxyContin was ravaging Everett, Purdue Pharma, the maker of OxyContin, was tracking the voluminous prescriptions written by Lake Medical's doctors as well as the extraordinary quantities of pills ordered by corrupt pharmacies filling those prescriptions. It did not track Lake Medical pills to their final destinations, however.\n\nIt wasn't until years later, after authorities brought down the ring, that Purdue shared the information with law enforcement. By then, 1.1 million pills had spilled onto the black market.\n\nEverett, Washington\n\nAbuse of OxyContin devastated Washington state's Snohomish County. (Liz O.

      "Greetings! Today I am bringing you something that I have been wanting to make for a while now. If you look at the render you might say that \"wow that looks like Penumbra but GMK....\" and you would be right. I am not going to lie and say that I made this colorway myself.Penumbra has had a long standing history of being a simple, elegant and gorgeous set. The set is highly desired by a ton of collectors. I am not going to re-make the set in SA due to the fact that it would be highly controversial as well as rude to the creator of the set. I am not proposing this because I want to stir up trouble in the community. I love this community and I respect the creators who spend time and make sets. However, this colorway has been gone for a very long time. I think revitalizing it with a twist will be good for the community. A lot of people can get their hands on an incredible colorway but the owners of the SA version won't be subject to having their rare set be commonplace.I love the colorway, I love the set, I respect the creator of the set but I would like to see another round of this set. I am trying to make that happen with GMK Solarized. If you are interested in this set please let me know via this Strawpoll As a note, the alphas on the render should be a little bit more yellow. Better renders will come, that will be further down the line if there is enough interest.",
      "Jake, for my contributions to the designs, I just made small changes to the design Jamie showed me. My changes were in creating the hood shape and the order that I sewed things together. In my case, I think it made the process a bit easier, but Jamie's way of doing it was much more professional. If you are interested in making it, you should get in contact with Jamie about the design. He's been very helpful on a couple of projects of mine. If you are curious about the changes I made, I'm sure Jamie has them and can explain them better than I could, but you can PM me with questions as well.\n\nI've had a chance to use it a couple of nights, and I have found that the bug netting is a little low on my body. Instead of over my eyes and mouth, it is over my mouth and neck. So it still works fine, and I would now agree the amount of mesh is correct. I would also say that the positioning is more because of my sewing than the design. Other than that, I have actually been able to sleep in the bivy without needing any way to pull it off my face like shock cord. It is very comfortable and perfectly roomy for me at 5'10\" about 145 (side sleeper) and my Golite Ultra 20.

      "In between are the conservatives who will tip the balance. Unlike Breitbart and company, they generally opposed Trump during the campaign. Unlike Brooks and company, they serve a conservative audience that now overwhelmingly backs him. More than Sean Hannity, they care about the principles that Trump threatens: free trade, America's alliances overseas, an independent judiciary, a free press and a basic respect for the truth. But they work for conservative publications and networks. Their business model is opposing the left. And that means opposing the people who oppose Trump.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal editorial page falls into this category, which is part of the reason it is now in such turmoil. So does Glenn Beck, who loathes Trump but works in talk radio. And so does National Review.\n\nNational Review is the most illustrative. During the campaign, it called Trump \"a menace to American conservatism who would take the work of generations and trample it underfoot in behalf of a populism as heedless and crude as the Donald himself.\" But now Trump is a Republican president, popular with most conservatives, and under liberal attack. So National Review has developed a technique that could be called anti-anti-Trump. It goes like this.\n\nStep number one: Accuse Trump's opponents of hyperbole. Democrats, declared John Fund on February 5, are in a \"rush to portray Donald Trump as some kind of 'fascist in chief.'\" Liberals, argued Jonathan Tobin on February 6, believe \"Trump's intemperate language about a judge is an unprecedented step down the slippery slope to dictatorship.\" Liberal Jews, claimed Nachama Soloveichik that same day, \"are falling over one another to label President Trump the latest incarnation of Jew-haters from Pharaoh to Haman to Hitler.\" (Full disclosure: I'm one of the liberal Jews she cites, though I'm unaware of ever having made such an analogy).\n\nStep number two: Briefly acknowledge Trump's flaws while insisting they're being massively exaggerated. On December 16, David Harsanyi declared that, \"While I'm no fan of Trump, Democrats have been demanding that I panic over every Cabinet pick, every statement, and every event. It's not normal.\" On February 5, Fund acknowledged that, \"Donald Trump has a knack for alienating many voters and saying stupid things. But his biggest asset may be that his over-the-top adversaries are even better at painting themselves in negative terms.\" On February 6, Tobin insisted that, \"whatever one may think of Trump's [executive] orders — which were sloppily drawn and clumsily implemented but arguably well within the scope of presidential powers as authorized by relevant legislation — the claims that Trump's intemperate language about a judge is an unprecedented step down the slippery slope to dictatorship don't stand up to scrutiny.\"",
      "Ira Glass is not afraid to fail. In fact, he seems to relish the possibility of defeat.\n\nThe Baltimore-born creator and host of the weekly public radio show \"This American Life\" courts catastrophe. Where pundits see disaster looming, the 57-year-old Glass rushes in headfirst, if only because it potentially can take him to such interesting places.\n\nBut despite Glass' most determined efforts, abject ruin stubbornly continues to elude him. He will discuss these efforts Sunday night in a talk titled \"Reinventing Radio\" at Goucher College, where he picked up an honorary doctorate in 2012.\n\n\"Our show consciously tries to do things that radio doesn't normally do,\" Glass said recently over the phone.\n\n\"Everything we do is an experiment. It all comes from the same impulse of 'What would it amuse us to try to do?'\"\n\nFor the past 20 years, the same things that divert Glass have been attracting listeners to \"This American Life.\"\n\nThe weekly New York-based show reaches an audience of 2.2 million on more than 500 stations, while another 2.2 million download each new episode, making the show often the most popular podcast in the country.\n\n\"This American Life\" also has picked up journalism prizes, including five Peabody Awards for the radio show and a 2011 Polk Award for Glass.\n\nThe many obstacles that \"This American Life\" has, if not exactly overcome, then blithely ignored, begin with the host's voice. While not unpleasant, it doesn't beg to be broadcast. Nasal and slightly atonal, Glass rounds off consonants as if every articulated \"t\" and \"k\" were verbal speed bumps designed to slow him down.\n\nGlass grew up near Pikesville, the son of Barry Glass, an accountant and Shirley Glass, a psychologist. He got his start in radio as a student at Milford Mill Academy writing jokes for his idol, the legendary former WFBR DJ Johnny Walker.\n\nPerhaps no one ever born is less laid-back than Glass, a man in constant, almost frenetic motion. It's a tribute to his consummate mastery of radio that, on the air, he sounds relaxed, even spontaneous. The show moseys along as if the host and his producers were friends swapping stories around a campfire.\n\n\"When we went on the air, there was not a lot of long-form narrative journalism on the radio,\" Glass said. \"Now there's a whole movement of people trying to do what we do.\"\n\nThe hourlong show does none of the things deemed necessary for broadcast success. It features no celebrities, though it has made stars of some contributors, including the humorist David Sedaris. It doesn't tackle such timely topics as the presidential election or police-community relations.\n\nBut it gets at those issues by exploring the minutiae of daily life. Each show contains anecdotes organized around a theme, such as \"I Thought I Knew You,\" or \"The Heart Wants What It Wants.\"\n\nThe former episode features two people who incorrectly guess the race of the person they're talking to over the phone, while the latter showcases a protester at a \"Black Lives Matter\" rally who develops a crush on her arresting officer.\n\n\"When people think about journalism, there's sometimes a trade-off between doing something fun and something serious-minded,\" Glass said. \"But we thought we could do a show with characters and scenes and funny moments that's also doing the most ambitious things journalism can do.\"\n\nTwo years ago, Glass made a decision that media pundits feared could bring about his show's downfall.\n\n\"This American Life\" severed ties with its distributor, Public Radio International, announcing that it would market itself to stations and find its own corporate sponsors. Last summer, Glass went one step further and split from his longtime producer, Chicago Public Media.\n\nArtists and visionaries generally aren't known for their business acumen, and, in exchange for achieving his show's independence, the New York Times wrote, Glass was giving up seven-figure financial guarantees.\n\nInstead of floundering, \"This American Life\" became even more profitable. The show now is on firmer financial footing than it has been in the previous two decades.\n\n\"That really wasn't such a risky move,\" Glass said. \"We left thinking we could do as well or better ourselves, and we were right.\n\n\"We can do a level of intensive investigation and reporting once a month now, that in the early years of the show we could only do once a year. For instance, we sent three reporters for five months to document life at a Chicago high school where 29 current and recent students were shot.\"\n\nThink about that for a moment: Broadcast and print journalism are in crisis, with dwindling audiences and advertising revenue. \"This American Life\" has found a way to not merely",
      "This is a list of breeds that are considered \"good\" for apartment life. If you do not see a breed listed here, it does not mean that it cannot live in an apartment. This list only covers the breeds considered \"best\" for apartment life. Do not assume that just because a dog is small that it will get enough exercise running around your home. Your home is like a large cage. If you have a yard, it's a larger cage. The key to keeping any dog in an apartment is providing enough exercise. Dogs are canine animals that have retained the instinct to migrate. Therefore, even small dogs need to be taken out for daily walks. High-energy dogs can live in an apartment if the owner takes them out for long walks, bike rides or jogs. Enough daily exercise is the key to keeping any dog stable and happy. Be sure it is the right type of exercise, an exercise that drains both the dog's physical and mental energy. Only providing excited exercise (i.e. playing with other dogs or tossing a ball) does not drain the dog's mental energy. Find out more—read The Proper Way to Walk a Dog .\n\nNOTE: Almost any dog can live in an apartment, IF...and this is a Big IF...it gets enough of the right kind of exercise. If you plan on jogging with your dog, and as long as you can make the dog heel on the jog so the dog is not worrying about being your leader but rather relaxing as he is following you, you have a very wide range of dogs to choose from. Most dogs in the shelters are there because their owners ONE, did not provide proper leadership and TWO, did not exercise them properly. A big backyard is not going to cut it. So those people who live apartments who actually walk their dogs (assuming they make them heel on the lead) are often better off than those who are simply only let out into the fenced backyard for exercise. Dog park exercise is excited exercise and it is not recommended as the only source of exercise a dog receives. It keeps the dog in an excited state of mind.\n\nThere are SO MANY great jogging companions in shelters. If you plan to jog every day then you would even qualify for a higher energy dog even though you are in an apartment. But if you plan on only jogging two or three times a week and plan to only walk the dog the remaining days, I would go with a medium-energy dog.\n\nThe thing to remember is it is not necessarily the breed you are looking for but the energy level of that particular dog. There are pups born within every litter that are higher energy than other pups within the same litter, dogs within the same breed that are higher energy than others. That is why some folks will, for example, get a Lab as a pet and think it is wonderful and when that dog passes away, they get another Lab and find the next one to be a nightmare. Their first Lab was low energy and low dominancy and the second one is high and high. Sure, a Pointer is going to always be higher energy than a Clumber Spaniel, but they will still vary from dog to dog within the same breed.",
      "Food tastes more bland and boring to anorexics than it does to people without eating disorders, finds a new study.\n\nFurthermore, the inability to enjoy food might last even after people recover from the disease.\n\nOutwardly, anorexia nervosa manifests as a relentless pursuit of thinness and emaciation to a weight that's at least 15 percent below normal. In extreme cases, it can lead to death. But whether the disorder is also linked with inner changes, such as alterations to portions of the brain that regulate appetite, has been a mystery.\n\nNow, brain-scanning research, recently published online in advance of publication in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology, reveals that compared with individuals without an eating disorder, women with anorexia have distinct differences in the insula, a brain region important for recognizing taste.\n\nTasteless tests\n\nAngela Wagner of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and Walter Kaye, also of Pitt, and the University of California, San Diego School of Medicine, scanned the brains of 16 women who had recovered from anorexia nervosa and of 16 women without an eating disorder.\n\nThey measured brain activity in response to sucrose (considered a \"pleasant\" taste) and distilled water (considered \"neutral\").\n\nIn response to both water and sugars, women who had recovered from anorexia showed significantly less activity in the insula and related brain regions compared with the control group of women. These brain regions recognize taste and judge how rewarding that taste is to the person.\n\nFood aversion\n\nKaye says the results suggest individuals with anorexia might have trouble recognizing tastes or responding to the pleasure associated with food.\n\nIn addition, the insula contributes to a type of emotional regulation, referred to as interoception. This raises the possibility that anorexics might find food aversive rather than rewarding, the researchers suggest.\n\n\"We know that the insula and the connected regions are thought to play an important role in interoceptive information, which determines how the individual senses the physiological condition of the entire body,\" Kaye said. \"Interoception has long been thought to be critical for self-awareness because it provides the link between thinking and mood, and the current body state.\"\n\nThe results could shed light on why anorexics steer clear of \"pleasurable\" foods, and why they don't eat even when hungry, leading to the life-threatening plunge in weight. Other symptoms of anorexia nervosa, such as distorted body image and lack of desire to get better, could also be associated with these brain regions, they say.\n\nThe research was funded by the National Institute of Mental Health and the Price Foundation.",

      "Numerous Witnesses See or Hear Shooting\n\nKATY (Covering Katy) – A road rage incident ended in a shooting on Peek Road at Westheimer Parkway at about 12:30 p.m. Wednesday, and the person who was shot has now died, according to the Fort Bend County Sheriff's Office.\n\nJohn Somich, 51, is identified as the man who was killed.\n\nIt happened in front of the Villagio Town Center as numerous people were coming and going from restaurants and businesses.\n\n\"We were walking to a restaurant and we heard the gunshots,\" said Dustin Rozeboom. \"My friend went out to look and he saw the man lying on the ground and screamed to call 911,\" he added.\n\nThere were two vehicles involved. The driver of the dark colored sedan was following a yellow two seat convertible that had its roof down.\n\nAt the traffic light the driver of the dark colored car got out of his vehicle and approached the convertible. Witnesses say Somich punched the driver of the convertible in the head several times. The man who was being beaten had a gun and shot Somich in the chest.\n\n\"The shooter has a concealed handgun license, so he was legally in possession of a weapon,\" Sheriff Troy Nehls said.\n\nThe driver's side door of the convertible had a gunshot through it, evidence that the driver shot from inside the vehicle. It is not clear if the gun went off before he could take aim or if he intended to shoot through the door.\n\nWhen deputies arrived he put his hands up and surrendered according the Sheriff's office.\n\n\"There is a gunshot through the door. I don't' know how many shots were fired. We are still interviewing people. There are many witnesses,\" said Fort Bend County Sheriff Troy Nehls.\n\nA deputy on the scene described the shooter as being \"a young adult.\"\n\nWitnesses say there was an immediate effort to save the life of Somich while he was lying on the ground suffering from a gunshot wound to the chest. A bloody towel was still on the ground after Somich was transported to the hospital.\n\n\"The National Guard was working in the area and a soldier ran over and immediately started chest compressions,\" said Heather Rozeboom.\n\n\"The case will be referred to a Fort Bend County Grand Jury for review. The victim was detained and released,\" said the Sheriff's Office statement.\n\nSee photos below.",
      "Migrants are piling into New Zealand at nearly twice the rate than in Australia and more than three times the rate of the UK, figures suggest.\n\nParliamentary research, obtained by Labour, shows New Zealand took in, on average 14.7 people for every 1000 in our population during the year to June 30, 2016.\n\nOf the developed countries New Zealand most often compares itself to, Australia took in the next largest amount at a rate of 7.5 per 1000 population.\n\nDavid Unwin Labour leader Andrew Little and immigration spokesman Iain Lees-Galloway plan to cut immigration by up to 30,000 if in Government. New Zealand needed a \"breather\" to invest in infrastructure that could keep up with rapid population growth.\n\nThe United Kingdom - which was currently navigating post-Brexit negotiations arguably brought about by growing discontent over high rates of immigration - stood at a rate 5.1 per 100 population the year prior.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Labour unveils plans to stop foreign students' 'backdoor immigration' rort\n\n* Immigrants get a rude shock from crackdown\n\n* NZ's net migration gain still at record highs\n\nHAGEN HOPKINS/GETTY IMAGES Immigration Minister Michael Woodhouse did not comment, but his spokeswoman said he did not agree with the figures and biggest contributor was returning Kiwis.\n\nAt the end of the June 2016 year, New Zealand's total population was 4.7 million however - just a fraction of the other countries, the indicative comparisons were made with.\n\nLabour's immigration spokesman Iain Lees-Galloway said the figures showed New Zealand had to have a conversation about immigration.\n\n\"It's astonishing to see that our rate of migration is so far out of step with countries that we would ordinarily compare ourselves with.\n\n\"I think that shows that while immigration has always been important to New Zealand and always will be, we're experiencing a rate of population growth that our infrastructure cannot keep up with and it's time to take a breather.\"\n\n\"I think New Zealanders value migration and recognise the benefits that new migrants bring to New Zealand, both economically and socially,\" he said.\n\nBut it was not sustainable at current levels.\n\n\"Ask anyone stuck in traffic in Auckland, or who can't get into their nearest hospital, because of the strains being placed upon our public services.\n\n\"We do need to take a breather and we need to make the investment in infrastructure that National have failed to make for nine years,\" he said.\n\nThe data could only be seen as indicative, rather than a precise measure of comparison. This was due to limitations that included slight differences in the way countries recorded their data and differing time periods in data for the UK and France.\n\nLabour unveiled its policy earlier in the week, vowing to cut immigration by up to 30,000, mostly by targeting international students it said were targeting low-value training courses in New Zealand as a means of gaining an easier route to residency.\n\nEven with 30,000 taken off the figures, New Zealand's rate of migration would still outpace the others, Lees-Galloway said.\n\nImmigration Minister Michael Woodhouse would not comment, however a spokeswoman said on his behalf, he did not agree with the figures.\n\n\"When comparing countries like the UK for example, the number of people who are considered to be arriving as permanent residents is far greater than in New Zealand.\n\n\"New Zealand only grants 45,000 - 50,000 permanent residence each year – that number has not increased,\" she said.\n\nThe biggest contributor to net migration data in New Zealand is more Kiwis coming home and fewer Kiwis leaving.\n\n\"International students and working holiday makers also make up a significant proportion of our PLT figures – all of which are temporary migrants and eventually return home again,\" she said.\n\nIn an unscientific Stuff/Massey survey of more than 40,000 readers, most expressed reservations about foreigners and identified immigration as a top-five election issue.\n\nFifty-five per cent agreed the numbers of immigrants arriving was \"too high\", and nearly 53 per cent agreed new arrivals should be told \"do things the Kiwi way\".",
      "Circuit Info\n\nCircuit type: Temporary street course\n\nCircuit History\n\nThe Preluk street circuit at Opatija on the Adriatic Coast has the distinction of having been located in three separate countries during its lifetime, as much like its modern successor at Rijeka, geopolitical changes have played their part in its history. Now in Croatia, it has variously been in Italy and then, post-World War II, part of the former Yugoslavia.\n\nA hugely challenging and picturesque course which hugs the hillside above the coast, racing has been a part of the Kvarner area since the 1930s. The course offers a huge challenge whether on two wheels or four, with 85 metres of elevation change across its 6km run, weaving between houses, coastal walls with sheer drops below and unyielding rock faces. Add in long fast straights and it's not hard to see how it won its fearsome - and all too often deadly - reputation.\n\nLocal car races are recorded as being held on the course as far back as 1931 but it wasn't until 1939 when it achieved international prominence - almost by accident. The Adriatic Grand Prix likely would have attracted a relatively small field of racers from around the region until national politics came to play. The Italian dictator Benito Mussolini had forbidden the Maserati works team of taking part in the French Grand Prix at Rheims, so instead the team organised a consolation trip up the coast to Abbazia (as Opatija was then named).\n\nThe works team comprised two Maserati 4CL's for Gigi Villoresi and Franco Cortese and the 24 valve Maserati 6CM for Giovanni Rocco. Six other 6CMs were also on the grid. At the start Rocco's 6CM led Villoresi and Cortese but then fell back with engine problems, allowing Villoresi and Cortese to complete the 93 mile-race in an easy demonstration. For Villoresi it was a bittersweet victory, coming as it did just over a fortnight after his brother Emilio had been killed testing an Alfa Romeo at Monza.\n\nFurther opportunities to build on this international interest would be abruptly halted with the outbreak of World War II and it wasn't until 1946 that racing would resume - this time for competitors on two wheels. Local races were held that year, with little known about the winners save for them being from Zagreb. The following year the races counted as part of the first Yugoslavian national championships. Ivan Vukelić won both the 1000cc and 500cc classes, while there were also races for 350cc, 250cc, 125cc and sidecars.\n\nInitially the bike events were run under the Prix de l'Adriatique banner, before adopting the more fashionable Grand Prix moniker from 1960, while the following year the 50cc race formed the fifth round of the FIM European Championships, won by German rider Hans-Georg Anscheidt on a Kriedler.\n\nBy 1950 car racing also resumed as the emergence of sportscar racing - often fuelled by wealthy amatuer owners - meant the chance to race in the resort town became irresistible. The circuit hosted GT and sportscars throughout the 1950s, with Franco Cortese returning to win with a Ferrari in 1956.\n\nOrganisers switched the main race to Formula Junior single seaters in 1960, with Kurt Ahrens the most notable victor before a change again to the emerging Formula 3 category in 1964. The 1966 race almost didn't happen; heavy rains reduced the track to little more than a skating rink and the organisers wanted to cancel it altogether. A poll of the drivers produced deadlock, with as many wanting to race as sit it out. In the end a compromise was struck, with the race reduced from 12 laps to just five and, even then, there were many spins among the pack before Frenchman Patrick Dal Bo slithered to victory.\n\nBy the end of the decade, the circuit was coming under greater scrutiny from a safety perspective and car racing soon become untenable, with the last event being held in 1968. Bike racers seemed less concerned by the obvious dangers - or at least those organising the races took a more liberal view of safety. Indeed, in 1969 the Adriatic Grand Prix became a round of the FIM Motorcycle World Championships, launching a golden era in the circuit's history. Godfrey Nash rode a Norton Manx to victory in what was the last victory for a single-cylinder machine in a 500cc Grand Prix.\n\nRiders the calibre of Giacomo Agostini, Chas Mortimer and Angel Nieto all tasted success at Preluk, though the track had a similar reputation as the Isle of Man TT Course and was not universally popular with riders who generally felt it to be too dangerous. Things boiled over in 1973 when the race came immediately after fatalities at Monza and the Isle of Man TT and the Yamaha, Harley and MV",
      "WASHINGTON—Marking a new phase in the Trump administration's pressure on North Korea, the White House said it plans to cut off China's Bank of Dandong from the U.S. financial system, accusing it of facilitating financing for companies involved in Pyongyang's weapons program.\n\nThe move is an escalation in Washington's efforts to rein in North Korea's nuclear and missile programs, using a sanctions tool that proved effective under the George W. Bush administration in forcing the regime back to negotiations by cutting off Pyongyang's financial ties to the world.\n\nTreasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, announcing the new sanctions at the White House on Thursday, said the administration would \"continue to roll out sanctions\" against companies involved with Pyongyang's weapons programs. President Donald Trump will raise the issue with leaders from the Group of 20 largest economies at a summit next week as Washington seeks to coordinate international action against Pyongyang.\n\n\"We are committed to cutting off all illegal funds going to North Korea,\" Mr. Mnuchin said. \"North Korea's provocative, destabilizing and inhumane behavior will not be tolerated.\"\n\n\"We are committed to targeting North Korea's external enablers and maximizing economic pressure on the regime until it ceases its nuclear and ballistic missile programs,\" he said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMr. Mnuchin said Thursday's action, which will take at least two months to go into force, isn't intended as a message to China.\n\nStill, the move represents a second phase of the Trump administration's strategy to ratchet up pressure on North Korea and could escalate diplomatic tensions between the world's two largest economies, said Victor Cha, a former director for Asian affairs in the Bush administration's National Security Council.\n\n\"The first phase was to treat China as part of the solution, and if that didn't work, then treat them as part of the problem,\" Mr. Cha, now a senior adviser at the Washington-based Center for Strategic and International Studies, said.\n\nThe Trump administration had urged China to increase its leverage to roll back North Korea's nuclear weapons and missile programs. But Mr. Trump said in a Twitter message last week ahead of high-level U.S.-China talks that Beijing's effort \"has not worked out.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"While we will continue to seek international cooperation on North Korea, the United States is sending an emphatic message across the globe that we will not hesitate to take action against persons, companies, and financial institutions who enable this regime,\" Mr. Mnuchin said in a statement accompanying the action.\n\nChina has opposed unilateral U.S. sanctions, particularly against Chinese entities.\n\nUnder the proposed sanctions, the bank won't be able to access the U.S. financial system either directly or indirectly. Neither the Chinese embassy in Washington nor the Bank of Dandong immediately responded to a request for comment.\n\nThe move comes as North Korea steps up its ballistic missile tests and after the death ofOtto Warmbier, an American who had been held in a North Korean prison for more than a year before being released to U.S. officials when he was in a coma.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTreasury also added to its North Korea sanctions list two Chinese citizens accused of working in front companies designed to evade existing North Korea sanctions. A firm that primarily transports steel and coal between China and North Korea also was added, allegedly for violating a luxury-goods ban.\n\nSouth Korean President Moon Jae-in and Mr. Trump are scheduled to hold talks in Washington on Friday and meet for dinner Thursday night.\n\nTreasury's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network is using a tool the Bush administration applied in 2007 against a Macao-based bank, called Banco Delta Asia, that allows the administration to declare a bank a money-laundering institution. Even though that bank was tiny, the sanction clamped down on North Korea's financial ties to the world because other banks feared losing access to U.S. markets.\n\nSimilarly, Bank of Dandong is relatively small—in the bottom quintiles of China's official banking system—but the action could have a chilling effect on other banks providing financial services for North Korea or firms linked to the regime.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's a shot across the bow for other Chinese banks; they don't want to get listed also,\" Mr. Cha said.\n\nTreasury said the bank, based in a port city that borders North Korea, serves as a conduit for the regime to access the U.S. and international financial systems, evading existing U.S. and international sanctions. The institution facilitated millions of dollars of transactions for companies involved in Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs, the administration said, using a \"network of front companies and embassy personnel that support illicit activities through banking, bulk cash, and trade.\"\n\nThe Treasury secretary didn't elaborate on what other sanctions might be forthcoming. But according to administration documents accompanying the sanctions, North Korea also has been using bank accounts under false",

      "So excited to get to Loveland, CO to shoot the Mustang Heritage Foundations's Extreme Mustang Makeover in Loveland, CO at the end of May. Several friends were competing so it was personal as well. My mustang friend Amanda Wilson's work as ambassador for the Cañon City facility has helped many horses get adopted, in big part because of her tireless work photographing the horses in holding pens and disseminating information about individual animal's size and personality.\n\nIn the Extreme Mustang Makeover, each participant gets an untamed, raw mustang by luck of the draw, and then has 100 days to tame and train it.\n\nIn this EMM all the horses were mares, since they're tougher to adopt. Approximately twenty adults participated, and there is also a youth division for kids 12-18 who train young horses under two. In addition there were untouched BLM mustangs and burros available for adoption.\n\nThere are required objectives, such as ground manners, leading, grooming, picking up all four feet and loading in and out of a trailer.\n\nFor some horses things went well until they heard something new and frightening: applause!\n\nIn the trail class horse and rider negotiate obstacles they might encounter in daily life such as removing and replacing the bridle, stepping up and over obstacles, backing into a chute, opening and closing gates and dragging an item.\n\nThe sportsmanship was of the highest order, exceeded only by the showmanship of the youth group since the last part is a freestyle competition where certain objectives must be met, but the theme is wide open. The kids killed it.\n\nThey were beyond adorable, whether or not their horses were perfect, their joy was contagious.\n\nIt was a great few days, full of ups and downs. Since there were also a big rodeo, BBQ cook-off and concerts going on at the same time, the horses that did best were exposed to a lot of stimulation by the trainers who were able to take them on trail rides and to competitions. There was also a fabulous Missouri mule that walks a treadmill, that drives a cam, that churns ice cream!!!\n\nThe final night ten adult finalists competed with some theme based freestyle offerings. There definitely were some crowd favorites, including some repeat competitors.\n\n\nFill in the audio and imagine the Pharrell Williams song Happy playing here! (Plus respect a man who would come out in yellow tights!)\n\nAfter the freestyle events all horses are up for auction. Most of the trainers try to show their horses off to their best advantage. But it's heartbreaking for others who get extremely bonded to their horses and are determined to go home with them. Sometimes they do, sometimes the bidding goes beyond their budget. That's the deal.\n\nI had to be careful. I was taking photos but must have made some kind of secret bidding move and almost bought a horse!\n\nI could be wrong, but I think the highest bid horse went for about $7,000. Most were much less. One woman got the trained mustang of her dreams for 500 bucks! She wanted a small horse so she didn't have much competition and was thrilled to get just what she wanted.\n\nAn Extreme Mustang Makeover is a great place to get a proven, well started horse for very little money. Plus the trainers are extremely generous with their help and support to the new adoptive owners.\n\nLike all mustangs, BLM retains title for one year. One has to meet certain requirements and prove up before the title can be transferred after the year is up and the horse is officially yours.\n\nIf you haven't seen the film Wild Horse, Wild Ride, it does a terrific job of profiling the challenges faced by a half-dozen or so of the hundred participants in the big Ft. Worth EMM a few years back. You'll be rooting for each one of them.\n\nI saw this film about a year before I set out from LA. It moved me to tears, re-awakening my deep connection with horses. At the time I had no idea the path my life would take by deviating 15 minutes on my way to Jackson to visit the wild horses in Green River, WY.\n\nRotten Tomatoes actually gave this film a 4-1/2 star rating! It's available on Netflix and you can see the trailer here: Wild Horse Wild Ride. If it doesn't move you, have your pulse checked.\n\nBy the way, my friend Amanda was able to keep Dragon, the horse of her heart!",
      "Sen. Elizabeth Warren will join the Armed Services Committee in 2017, leading to speculation that she is preparing for a run at the presidency in 2020, The Hill reports.\n\nThe Massachusetts Democrat's three brothers all served in the military and a Pentagon report put her state in the top 10 states in military spending, the Hill report said.\n\nWarren, who joined the Senate in 2013, had been pressured to seek the presidency in 2016; instead she became a vocal opponent of Republican candidate Donald Trump and a supporter of Hillary Clinton.\n\nSpeculation about a 2020 run for her began before Clinton had conceded the race, The Hill said.\n\nThe senator would be 71 in 2020. She told a Massachusetts TV station, \"Oh, come on,\" when asked if she was considering a 2020 run.\n\nSome conservatives believe that her joining the committee is a political move.\n\n\"America's military men and women deserve better than Warren using the Armed Services Committee as yet another platform for her all-but-announced 2020 presidential campaign…Warren has fought to cut the U.S. military, weakening our nation's security,\" Jeremy Adler, a spokesman for America Rising Squared, an offshoot of conservative super-PAC America Rising, said.\n\nDemocracy for America spokesman Neil Sroka said he would be \"thrilled\" if Warren ran in 2020.\n\nHe said her being on the committee helps Democrats, regardless of her political aspirations.\n\n\"Seeing Elizabeth Warren on the Armed Services Committee and seeing her range of knowledge and experience grow is an unmitigated good thing for the Democratic Party,\" he said.\n\nSroka added that Warren's history of criticism against Trump and Wall Street is what Democrats are looking for: \"You're going to need someone making a forceful case against powerful business interests,\" he said.\n\nMassachusetts' senators have a history on the committee, including Warren's predecessor, the late Democrat Sen. Ted Kennedy, and Republican former Sen. Scott Brown, the Hill reported.\n\nA spot on the Armed Services Committee will allow Warren a forum to speak out against the Trump administration on security and military spending,\n\n\"We've already been worried about Donald Trump's ties to the Russians,\" she told WCVB, a local TV station.\n\nBack in June, when Clinton had not yet chosen a vice-presidential running mate, RealClearPolitics reported criticism of Warren by Clinton ally and former Pennsylvania Gov. Ed Rendell. He said she was not ready for the presidency. \"I think Elizabeth Warren is a wonderful, bright, passionate person, but with no experience in foreign affairs and not in any way, shape or form ready to be commander-in-chief.\"",
      "Karelia 3-10\n\nBattle Tier limit 1000×1000\n\nSize, m Summer\n\nMap type\n\nMap\n\nStandard battle\n\nAssault\n\n\nSwamps, rocks, and cliffs determine major avenues of approach on this map. This map, with sparse protection and no buildings, gives the combat advantage to artillery. Concentrate your attacks along the path of your main advance, while conducting delaying and defensive actions along the rest of your front lines.\n\nTactics\n\nKarelia offers both Standard Battles and an Assault mode, which play very differently.\n\nFor Standard Battles, the bases are as indicated in A0 and K1. For very low tier battles the middle is used, but otherwise the teams mainly split to the raised area in the north-west and around the mountain in the south-east, as the center tanks are too vulnerable to accurate fire from north-west. Generally light tanks will go to the north-west and heavy tanks will go to the south-east, but any tank type can be useful anywhere.\n\nThe hill in H6-G7 is extremely useful for winning the south-east, which generally requires fast tanks to be able to get around the corner and start going up their respective path up the hill before heavier firepower can arrive. Tanks going up the hill are shielded by a rock formation separating the paths up from each side. This hill is an important strategic location as not only does it allow flanking fire downwards into the tanks in H9 and J7, which prevents the enemy from holding these areas, it is also a location for shots across the map into the north-west flank. For the tanks that stay at the base of the mountain, there are lots of rock cover, small depressions to go hull-down in, corners to peek, and a few sniping positions in the far back. Having heavy here is critical to being able to push into the enemy.\n\nThe north-west has lots of open ground, broken by a few rock formations. Some TDs will typically hang in the back, while aggressive lights may take up positions in the mountain behind trees in B2-C2. Winning this flank usually requires superior spotting and better shot trading when popping out of cover behind the rock formations, if there isn't any extremely early spots while the enemies are still making their way to cover.\n\n\nFor the Assault Mode, the avenues and locations of clashes are much different. The attackers spawn in J7 and G9, while the defenders spawn around C3. The attackers generally split into two, with the SPGs and occasionally a few snipers climbing the hills. However, for the snipers to be effective, generally spots need to be made by a light tank or fast medium in the center, otherwise the snipers don't have any targets to shoot at, so usually such snipers are not very helpful to the team in random, uncoordinated battles. However, if the attacking team is able to get one or two tanks into the center under the hill, they can be very effective at spotting and/or destroying the soft TDs and SPGs in the base. To counter this, occasionally the defensive team will send a few lights and mediums into the center as well, underneath the attacking team's mountain. The attacking tanks on top of the mountain are very vulnerable to countersniping from all angles if they are spotted.\n\nOtherwise, if there isn't significant action in the center, the attacking team will usually progress to J1 and A9 depending on their spawns, while the defensive team will set some snipers in D1 and anywhere in A3-A5 and B3, while pushing heavy tanks up to spot the attackers, which include positions in F1, H1, A7, and A8. Generally speaking, D1 depend slightly more on accuracy than the other positions. Afterwards, the teams will trade some shots and generally look to outflank each other. In the south, the attackers can flank around G1 through H2 and G2 to get shots into the rear of the tanks while being partially protected from snipers by a rock formation in F2. If they then manage to get rid of most of the tanks in F1, they can then blitz into the gorge in F2 while killing the remaining tanks, then be able to hull-down and spot the defending snipers in D1 from E2. E2 can also be reached simply by going around through the center. The defenders are forced to play passively and don't have many flanking opportunities in the south unless they manage to hold H1 convincingly, then the defenders can flank around carefully to H2 and crush the remaining tanks. The north also holds the potential for a lot of flanking maneuvers. Both attackers and defenders can flank around through A7-B9, though attackers risk being shot from the center. If the attackers are able to destroy the tanks in A8, they must advance to A7 to be safe from snipers. It may then be worth pushing a few tanks through",
      "The FBI and Religion: Faith and National Security Before and After 9/11, edited by Sylvester A. Johnson and Steven Weitzman. University of California Press, 376 pages, $29.95\n\nEver since FBI Director James Comey staggered into the spotlight during last year's presidential campaign, critics have been comparing him to the most infamous man ever to hold Comey's job. \"I think this is sort of a flashback to the days of J. Edgar Hoover,\" the journalist turned academic Sanford Ungar told The New York Times last October. \"I don't mean to smear Comey, and it may be an unfair comparison. But Hoover would weigh in on issues without warning or expectation.\"\n\nComey's comments about the Hillary Clinton email investigation do highlight how a law enforcement agency can improperly influence public opinion. But there are some pretty big differences between his behavior and that of his predecessor. For one thing, his actions last year were public, a fact that triggered a national debate over their propriety and eventually led the Justice Department's inspector general to launch an investigation of how his agency handled its probe of Hillary Clinton's emails. For another, that probe was a legitimate criminal investigation.\n\nHoover's FBI, by contrast, secretly monitored the non-criminal personal and political conduct of U.S. citizens. Among them: first lady Eleanor Roosevelt, Presidents Dwight Eisenhower and John Kennedy, Democratic presidential nominee Adlai Stevenson, civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr., and syndicated columnist Joseph Alsop. Hoover even ordered his agents to conduct a content analysis of Walt Kelly's comic strip Pogo to ascertain whether one of the strip's animal characters, based on the FBI director, portrayed him in a positive or derogatory light.\n\nThe information acquired in these surveillance expeditions was maintained in closed FBI files, and much of it was used to advance Hoover's political agenda through leaks to favored reporters, governors, members of Congress, and the White House—on the strict condition that the recipient not disclose the FBI's assistance.\n\nThe scope of Hoover's abuses did not become widely known until the unprecedented hearings conducted by the so-called Church Committee in 1975–76. It has been advanced since then through a mixture of journalism, scholarship, and Freedom of Information Act requests. Now a new book, edited by Sylvester Johnson of Northwestern University and Steven Weitzman of the University of Pennsylvania, adds another dimension to our understanding by recounting the bureau's long history involving religious activists and institutions.\n\nThe FBI and Religion contains 15 essays written by theologians, historians, and political scientists; the ground it covers stretches from the bureau's birth during the Progressive Era through the current war on terror. It is based on extensive reading of the secondary literature on the FBI, supplemented at times by research of relevant and accessible FBI records. Most of the chapters focus on the government's surveillance of religious leaders and institutions, with bureau officials often equating moral advocacy of peace or racial justice with threats to the nation's security. Targets include the Church of God in Christ during World War I, the Moorish Science Temple of America from the 1920s through the 1960s, the Nation of Islam and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference during the 1950s and '60s, the Branch Davidians during the Waco siege of 1993, and militant Muslims following 9/11.\n\nOther essays assess how, during Hoover's tenure, FBI officials employed religious rhetoric to influence public attitudes about suspected subversives. (Hoover himself regularly used religious rhetoric in his public speeches and writings, impugning radical activists as \"immoral, Godless, and disloyal.\") In addition, FBI officials benefited from more conservative religious leaders, such as Carl McIntire, Edward Bundy, and Billy James Hargis—and conservative religious institutions, such as the Council of Christian Laymen and the Church League of America—both to promote that countersubversive rhetoric and to recruit fundamentalist Protestants, Catholics, and Mormons as agents.\n\nThe concluding essays in this collection chronicle a significant shift in FBI officials' conceptions of religious militants, in which the bureau came to appreciate the religious basis for millennial \"cults\" and militant Muslims. The book attributes this to two factors. The first was the more restrictive investigative guidelines instituted after the revelations of the 1970s, which temporarily endorsed a law enforcement standard for domestic security investigations. (These restrictions were loosened after the 9/11 attack.)\n\nThe second factor was criticism of the bureau's actions during the siege of the Branch Davidians. In the wake of the Waco controversy, FBI officials started soliciting input from scholars of religion to acquire a more nuanced understanding of both millennialists and Muslims. The agency then modified its conceptions of such groups, and it officially accepted that militant speech did not necessarily indicate an intent to violate the law or to engage in or promote violence. Nonetheless, it continued to monitor such religious groups, perceiving militancy as a possible indicator of future action.\n\nThis volume is particularly timely right now, given the",

      "Alright, so at this point you have been exposed to contours pretty heavily on the PyImageSearch blog.\n\nWe used contours to build a kick-ass mobile document scanner.\n\nContours enabled us detect barcodes in images.\n\nAnd we even leveraged the power of contours to find the distance from a camera to object or marker.\n\nBut there still remains a sticking question that we have not addressed: how in the world do we sort contours from left-to-right, top-to-bottom, etc.\n\nOddly enough OpenCV does not provide a built-in function or method to perform the actual sorting of contours.\n\nBut no worries.\n\nIn the rest of this blog you'll be sorting contours using Python and OpenCV like a pro.\n\nRead on to find out more…\n\nLooking for the source code to this post?\n\nJump right to the downloads section.\n\nOpenCV and Python versions:\n\nIn order to run this example, you'll need Python 2.7 and OpenCV 2.4.X.\n\nSorting Contours using Python and OpenCV\n\nBy the end of this blog article you'll be able to:\n\nSort contours according to their size/area, along with a template to follow to sort contours by any other arbitrary criteria. Sort contoured regions from left-to-right, right-to-left, top-to-bottom, and bottom-to-top using only a single function.\n\nSo let's go ahead and get started.

      "Q: I found a wedding venue I love that will let us start as early as we want, but the bad news is we have to stop the music by 10 with NO exceptions. I really wanted our wedding to go until midnight, but the venue is not budging! Should I find another venue or just start earlier?- Mary\n\nA: I hear this frustration A LOT from brides. You want the party to go late into the night, but you're restricted by how late the venue will allow your reception to go until. I was totally one of those brides. We were lucky enough to have a venue that let us go until 2 a.m. if we wanted, but the thing is, nobody wants to stay at a wedding that late. So, just how long should a wedding reception last? And what would your wedding timeline look like if it has to end by 10 p.m.?\n\nThe first thing you'll want to figure out is a total length of time for your wedding ceremony/reception. I think the magic number for a ceremony and reception is 6 hours total. That would be an hour (ideally 30 minutes or less) for the ceremony, an hour for cocktails immediately following the ceremony, then 4 hours for dinner/dancing. This will change a bit if you're having your ceremony and reception in different locations (if you're short on time this is another big plus to having them in the same place). However, assuming you are having your ceremony and reception at the venue and you have a hard stop of 10 p.m., here's how I would plan your wedding timeline:\n\n4:30 p.m.: Ceremony starts (however you would say 4 p.m. on your wedding invitation, as you always want to give 1/2 hour for guests to arrive).\n\n: Cocktail hour with passed hors d'oeuvres\n\n: Guests asked to take their seats\n\n: Introductions\n\n6:30-6:40 : First Dance/FOB/MOG dances\n\n: First course served\n\n7:00 : Toasts\n\n: Second course served\n\n: Dancing begins\n\n: Cake cutting\n\n: Parents of the Bride and/or Bride/Groom Speech\n\n: Cake served\n\n: Event ends\n\nNow, admittedly, at 10 p.m. most of your friends will want to keep the party going, and that's great! This is when you call Uber and take the party back to your hotel bar, or friend's house, or other favorite club or bar and keep dancing until 3 a.m. if you want! And even though a 10 p.m. cut-off means you'll have had to end the party earlier than you wanted, you'll still get the FULL 6 hours you would have had if your venue let you go until midnight. You're just starting a bit earlier! And honestly in hindsight, even though my wedding went until 1 a.m., I can tell you that there were like 10 of us left, and we could have easily taken the party to a bar a few hours earlier and had JUST as great of a time. So if I were you I would stick with the venue you love and don't worry about the time. You'll have an amazing wedding no matter what!\n\nHave a wedding question?

      "Late last month, President Barack Obama and Chinese President Xi Jingping announced that they had reached an agreement that the two countries would not conduct economic espionage or hack commercial targets. But just one day later, China-based hackers attempted to breach the network of a US technology company, according to a report published today by the security firm CrowdStrike.\n\n\"Over the last three weeks, the CrowdStrike Falcon platform has detected and prevented a number of intrusions into our customers' systems from actors we have affiliated with the Chinese government,\" Dimitri Alperovitch, the chief technology officer of CrowdStrike, wrote in a blog post today. \"Seven of the companies are firms in the Technology or Pharmaceuticals sectors, where the primary benefit of the intrusions seems clearly aligned to facilitate theft of intellectual property and trade secrets, rather than to conduct traditional national-security related intelligence collection, which the Cyber agreement does not prohibit.\"\n\nThe White House fact sheet on the summary of agreements made during President Xi's visit states, \"The United States and China agree that neither country's government will conduct or knowingly support cyber-enabled theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets or other confidential business information, with the intent of providing competitive advantages to companies or commercial sectors.\"\n\nCrowdStrike investigators linked the attempted intrusions—which did not succeed—to Deep Panda, the alleged hacking group tied to the vast data breach at the Office of Personnel Management earlier this year. The Chinese government has denied ties to the group in the past. But investigators at CrowdStrike, other security companies, and within the US government believe that Deep Panda works on behalf of the Chinese government—if not with its direct instruction or blessing.\n\nThe attacks presented in CrowdStrike's report are \"not an exhaustive list of all the intrusions from Chinese-government affiliated actors we have detected during this time period,\" Alperovitch noted, but \"is limited only to commercial entities that fit squarely within the hacking prohibitions covered under the Cyber agreement. The intrusion attempts are continuing to this day, with many of the China-affiliated actors persistently attempting to regain access to victim networks even in the face of repeated failures.\"\n\nAn unnamed White House official told The Wall Street Journal that the administration was aware of the report and would not comment on its findings, other than to note, \"We have and will continue to directly raise our concerns regarding cybersecurity with the Chinese.\"\n\nThe Chinese embassy did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIt's not clear how far the two governments have advanced implementation of the agreement, which includes the creation of a \"high-level joint dialogue mechanism on fighting cyber crime and related issues.\" China is to designate \"an official at the ministerial level\" to be the lead in the joint effort from the China side and communicate directly with the US Secretary of Homeland Security and the US Attorney General. That official has not yet been named.\n\nAlperovitch acknowledged that \"the fact that there is some time delay between agreement and execution is not entirely unexpected. But, we need to know the parameters for success, and whether the parties to the agreement discussed a timeframe for implementation or, instead, expected it to be immediate.\" He also praised the Obama administration for its efforts to curb the volume of Chinese attacks on corporate networks.",
      "UC Berkeley classifies each student as either a resident or a nonresident for purposes of tuition and fees.\n\nHere are some facts to know about residency, as it is applied at UC Berkeley:\n\nThe definition of residency varies between offices, such as for admissions or financial aid purposes. This means that information from the admissions office (or on your financial aid award letter) does not necessarily mean you are a resident for purposes of tuition.\n\nThe term \"California resident for purposes of tuition\" is different from other definitions of California residence. Here are some examples:\n\nA person who is a California resident for tax or voting purposes is not necessarily a resident for purposes of tuition at the University of California. A person who is considered a resident at another California postsecondary institution is not necessarily a resident at the University of California.\n\nThe process of obtaining California residency for tuition purposes is extremely difficult for undergraduates under the age of 24 with nonresident parents (this includes transfer students from community colleges and other postsecondary institutions within California). Virtually all nonresident undergraduates with nonresident parents remain nonresidents for the duration of their undergraduate career at UC Berkeley.\n\nIf you are classified as a resident for tuition purposes, you will most likely maintain that classification as long as you are continuously enrolled at UC Berkeley. There are a few cases in which this is not true, such as for immigration status changes or a residency classification based on an exemption. If you leave the University and are readmitted , your residency classification will be re-evaluated.

      "The Skin Gap: A Pervasive Gender Inequality You've Never Heard Of\n\nShare\n\n\n23 Shares\n\nForced modesty clearly subjugates, but what about the pressure to uncover? With summer nearly upon us, newsstands are replete with magazine covers instructing women on how to get the \"perfect beach bod,\" but this is not a seasonal phenomenon. In an age when gender equality is on everyone's mind, there is a discrepancy between the sexes that no one is talking about — call it \"the skin gap.\"\n\nThe skin gap is the difference in the amount of skin men and women are expected to show in the same social setting. Images of the nearly flawless, scantily-clad female form bombard girls and women year round via billboards, ads, TV shows, and movies, subliminally conveying how a woman ought to dress and how her body ought to look. Studies show that there is a direct correlation between girls and women viewing such pictures and female body dissatisfaction. As many as eight out of ten women (more than twice as many women than men) are unhappy with their figures, leading to depression, obsessive dieting, eating disorders and plastic surgery.\n\nThe skin gap begins in toddlerhood as mommy-blogger of BinkinesandBriefcases.com, Stephanie Giese, writes in her viral blog post: \"Do you see something wrong here? These are shorts for 4 year olds. Both size XS (4-5), Shorts on top – Cherokee Girls vs. Shorts on bottom – Shaun White Boys. Inseam on the girl's shorts was 1 inch, Inseam on same size (XS) shorts from the boys department was almost 7 times longer.\"\n\nGiese also discovers that the inseam on the (size 7) shorts found in the Women's section was not even 2 inches – less than 1 inch longer than the shorts intended for toddlers.\n\nWriter Bethany Mandel explores the not-so-simple task of finding shorts for herself where the crotch is NOT the longest part of the garment in her New York Post article Where does a girl have to go to find shorts that aren't obscene?\n\nThe skin gap only closes when a woman has exceeded a certain number in either age or pounds (remember when Carrie Fisher returned to \"Star Wars?\"). Once they no longer fit the Western Beauty Standard, our society encourages its \"plus-sized\" or women who are \"too old\" to cover up.\n\nFAQ's\n\n1. Aren't you slut shaming?\n\nWe are not trying to and hope we haven't offended anyone. We believe that everyone should live self-actualized lives and treat all people with dignity. In the Western world it is completely normal for a woman to wear more revealing clothes than a man. Our objective is to create awareness that this imbalance exists and to start a conversation about whether this is damaging to women. Everyone knows that forced modesty subjugates a woman, but there is rarely talk about how a cultural and psychological coercion encouraging women to expose themselves could be equally harmful. When women feel pressured to display their bodies more than men do, there is a danger of women being judged more by their appearance than by their character, personality and talents.\n\n\"As a secular American teen, I was so excited to get my first bikini and pair of Daisy Dukes, because it was a sign of being 'grown up,'\" said Allison Josephs, Founder of Jew in the City (and writer and director of 'The Skin Gap'). \"But something unexpected happened: I'd always feel gross when random men would give me the 'up down.' I never did anything or said anything because I had no language to express what I was feeling.\"\n\n\"A few years later, I became an Orthodox Jew and started covering up purely to follow 'the rules,' and I discovered something fascinating: covering up actually made me feel empowered. The first time I wore a long skirt and a random guy at the mall gave me the 'up down' but had nothing to see, inside I screamed, 'Yes!' No one can deny that the skin gap exists, and if this video helps one more woman feel more empowered about her body, then we'll consider it a success.\"\n\n2. Why did an Orthodox Jewish website make a video about gender equality? Don't you have some of your own gender equality issues?\n\nWhat most people don't realize (and what we publicize at Jew in the City) is that there are many super accomplished Orthodox women leading fulfilling, self-actualized lives and that there is an undeniable amount of respect and value given to women in most traditional Jewish sources. To name a few: the Jewish people were redeemed from Egypt and will merit the final redemption due to righteous women, Eve is last in Creation, as woman is considered to be at the pinnacle of creation (by the way, many Orthodox Jews also believe in science), Sarah was considered a greater prophet than her husband (Ab",
      "A few weeks ago, national reports came out about funding for research into UFOs that was pushed by then-Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and both Democrats and Republicans in 2007.\n\nThe program supposedly ended in 2012, though a man who says he was in charge of it says it is still happening.\n\nSenator Reid couldn't be on the program today.\n\nBut TV reporter George Knapp, who decades ago exposed the world to the top-secret base, Area 51--some 90 miles northwest of Las Vegas, has talked to the senator.\n\nAnd Knapp over the years has been ridiculed at times for his stalwart investigation into UFO and other strange phenomena.\n\nDoes he feel vindicated?\n\n\"I always thought I was doing my job anyway and catching flack over it came with the territory. I'm not sure this is vindication. It certainly is nice to have company in covering this story. I've always said if it could be proven – to any reasonable degree - it would be the biggest story ever. I couldn't image why there weren't more journalists taking it seriously because there is plenty of breadcrumbs to follow, plenty of clues to pursue. That's what I've tried to do all along. If people want to see it as vindication – okay – I'll take that,\" he told KNPR's State of Nevada.\n\nSupport comes from\n\nKnapp interviewed Harry Reid about the program, which was not actually the study of UFO's but of \"advanced aerial threats\" as they were called.\n\nKnapp says there is evidence that the Russian and Chinese governments are also conducting research on UFOs and Reid believes the U.S. should also be looking at them.\n\nCol. John B. Alexander (ret.), a Las Vegas resident who, while in the military and in retirement, investigated strange phenomena around the world.\n\n\"This is not new,\" he said, \"The characteristics [of UFOs] that George just described have been observed for at least 70 years. In fact, UFOs have been reported for millennia – globally. This is a global phenomenon that has run over time.\"\n\nHe said he ran a similar program 30 years ago sorting through the evidence gathered by the military and civilians. He said the evidence is overwhelming.\n\n\"The evidence is basically every sensor system we have picks them up. The [USS] Nimitz case that George has mentioned before at that time you had visual sightings. You had sightings from aircraft radar. You had sightings from aerial command posts and you had the most advanced sensors from the Navy surface fleet as well. This is not unusual. There are many cases where you have multi-sensory correlation so you cannot assume that it was some kind of fluke of radar or thermal inversions or whatever. The evidence is simply overwhelming.\"\n\nAlexander's latest book that came out in October is called \"Reality Denied: Firsthand Experiences With Things That Can't Happen—But Did\".\n\nWhile Knapp and Alexander say the evidence shows the objects exist and they can perform aerial maneuvering far beyond our technology, they are not sure where they came from or why.\n\nThey also agree that much more needs to be done to study UFOs and their impact on people. And they believe people shouldn't have to risk their careers to look into the phenomenon.\n\n(Editor's Note: This discussion originally aired December 2017)\n\nFrom NPR: 'I Don't Know Where It's From' Former UFO Program Head on Navy Jet Footage",

      "The loss of a baby due to stillbirth remains a sad reality for many families and takes a serious toll on families' health and well-being. Learn more about stillbirth below.\n\nWhat is stillbirth?\n\nA stillbirth is the death or loss of a baby before or during delivery. Both miscarriage and stillbirth describe pregnancy loss, but they differ according to when the loss occurs. In the United States, a miscarriage is usually defined as loss of a baby before the 20th week of pregnancy, and a stillbirth is loss of a baby after 20 weeks of pregnancy.\n\nStillbirth is further classified as either early, late, or term.\n\nAn early stillbirth is a fetal death occurring between 20 and 27 completed weeks of pregnancy.\n\nstillbirth is a fetal death occurring between 20 and 27 completed weeks of pregnancy. A late stillbirth occurs between 28 and 36 completed pregnancy weeks.\n\nstillbirth occurs between 28 and 36 completed pregnancy weeks. A term stillbirth occurs between 37 or more completed pregnancy weeks..\n\nStillbirth: A Healthcare Professional's Role View and print fact sheet »\n\nHow Many Babies Are Stillborn?\n\nStillbirth effects about 1% of all pregnancies, and each year about 24,000 babies are stillborn in the United States.1 That is about the same number of babies that die during the first year of life and it is more than 10 times as many deaths as the number that occur from Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).2\n\nBecause of advances in medical technology over the last 30 years, prenatal care (medical care during pregnancy) has improved, which has dramatically reduced the number of late and term stillbirth.3 However, the rate of early stillbirth has remained about the same over time.3\n\nWhat Increases the Risk of Stillbirth?\n\nThe causes of many stillbirths are unknown. Therefore, families are often left grieving without answers to their questions. Stillbirth is not a cause of death, but rather a term that means a baby's death during the pregnancy. Some women blame themselves, but rarely are these deaths caused by something a woman did or did not do. Known contributors to stillbirth generally fall into one of three broad categories:\n\nProblems with the baby (birth defects or genetic problems)\n\nProblems with the placenta or umbilical cord (this is where the mother and baby exchange oxygen and nutrients)\n\nCertain conditions in the mother (for example, uncontrolled diabetes, high blood pressure, or obesity)\n\nStillbirth with an unknown cause is called \"unexplained stillbirth.\" Having an unexplained stillbirth is more likely to occur the further along a woman is in her pregnancy.\n\nAlthough stillbirth occurs in families of all races, ethnicities, and income levels, and to women of all ages, some women are at higher risk for having a stillbirth. Some of the factors that increase the risk for a stillbirth include the mother:\n\nbeing of black race\n\nbeing a teenager\n\nbeing 35 years of age or older\n\nbeing unmarried\n\nbeing obese\n\nsmoking cigarettes during pregnancy\n\nhaving certain medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetes\n\nhaving multiple pregnancies\n\nhaving had a previous pregnancy loss\n\nThese factors are also associated with other poor pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth.\n\nState laws require the reporting of fetal deaths, and federal law supports national collection and publication of fetal death data. The National Vital Statistics System (NVSS) released the first ever report on cause of fetal death using national data in 2016.\n\nWhat can be done?\n\nCDC works to learn more about who might have a stillbirth and why. CDC does this by tracking how often stillbirth occurs and researching what causes stillbirth and how to prevent it. Knowledge about the potential causes of stillbirth can be used to develop recommendations, policies, and services to help prevent stillbirth. While we continue to learn more about stillbirth, much work remains. To learn more about CDC's activities, visit the Stillbirth CDC Activities page.\n\nReferences",

      "Last June, my daughter's wedding announcement graced the pages of the New York Times. Emily, 20, and Michael, 21, were the youngest couple announced that week, and most likely for the entire year. Confession: I wasn't thrilled.\n\nThis was not the milestone I had envisioned for my first-born during her sophomore year of college. But what do you do when you believe your child is making the wrong life decision? And if parenting is all about \"letting go,\" what happens when a mother is asked to do this earlier and faster than anticipated?\n\nIt's taken a year, a challenging year, but I've finally come to accept the decisions Emily made. Our Jewish journeys have taken us on divergent paths, and I had to let go before I was ready. But now, as we celebrate Emily and Michael's first anniversary, I think of this past year as just another step in my evolving relationship with my daughter and the beginning of a new stage of what being a mother means to me.\n\n***\n\n\"I think I'm going to start dating, Mom,\" Emily told me on the phone from college, when she was 19. \"Is that OK with you?\"\n\n\"Of course!\" I said. \"Just don't rush into anything, if you know what I mean.\"\n\nWhat I meant was marriage.\n\nUp until that point, Emily had never been on a date, kissed a boy, or even held hands. This choice reflected her beliefs as an Orthodox girl: Dating happens only when you are marriage-minded. I could see the advantages of this outlook on dating, but I had begun to wonder about its practicality. When it came to college students, I wondered if it was even healthy; I worried that it might unnecessarily push a young couple into early marriage, before they were truly ready. Many of Emily's friends had started dating, and a few of them were already engaged. I feared that it might be contagious.\n\n\"You're in a different place than a lot of your friends,\" I reminded her. \"So, don't follow someone else's timetable.\"\n\n\"Have I ever, Mom?\"\n\nRight.\n\nEmily entered the world with her own life plan. At age 4, she asked me to show her on the calendar when she would be a grown-up. When she was 7, she asked if she could skip being a teenager. At age 10, she drew pictures of her future life, which included writing a best-selling book and having 10 kids. She took the SAT at 12, and at 13 (using her Hebrew name, Leah), launched a national magazine for Jewish girls. She has been on the go ever since.\n\nIn Emily's religious circle, dating meant letting the right people know that she was looking and being specific about what she was looking for. Emily wanted to date men who shared her life views, were ready to commit, and weren't intimidated by an accomplished and ambitious woman with a mind for business (including the magazine she continued to run). Why, she would ask, waste his time or mine?\n\nI thought back to my own dating experience. When I was 16, my parents allowed me to date only Orthodox boys, and in our tiny Midwestern community that gave me a choice of about five candidates. By the time I entered college in New York City, I was a disgruntled yeshiva graduate—sheltered, immature, and somewhat reckless. I dated indiscriminately, going out with any guy who could make me laugh, which led mainly to heartache and poor decisions (although I did have quite a few adventures). I could see how Emily's choice to postpone dating thus far had eliminated distraction and romantic drama, allowing for a singular focus on developing her talents and female friendships.\n\nIn our family, the ultimate goal was to raise kids who loved being Jewish. My kids went to both public and day schools. They had friends and family members, Jewish and not, from all levels of observance. From an early age, Emily gravitated toward everything Jewish. She loved all the holidays. She loved reading Jewish books and visiting big Jewish communities. Over the years, our family grew in observance. Because our first community was so small, we relied on the services of the local Chabad Center. A few years at Camp Gan Israel proved inspirational for Emily, and she was gradually drawn toward the Chabad lifestyle, a path of Judaism that I, as a Modern Orthodox Jew, was on friendly terms with but did not embrace wholeheartedly.\n\n***\n\n\"You wouldn't believe how much background checking goes on before the first date,\" I explained to a non-Orthodox friend of mine as we talked about Emily's dating. \"It's like getting security clearance!\"\n\n\"I guess that's practical,\" my friend replied. \"But not very romantic.\"\n\n\"That comes later,\" I said.\n\n\"Later\" came in just two months, when Emily",

      "The case of Rohinie Bisesar, the woman who stands accused of killing Rosemarie Junor in a random knife attack in the PATH last month, is still in the \"embryonic\" stages, according to her lawyer. Calvin Barry cited a combination of factors, including a looming correction workers' strike, the recent holiday break, and Bisesar's ongoing incarceration for the current state of the case. Her Friday court appearance was delayed hours because Bisesar, who was being transported from jail, wasn't brought to court in time.\n\nRohinie Bisesar\n\n\"It's really frustrating on all fronts,\" Barry said Friday while waiting for her to arrive. Wearing an oversized green sweatsuit with her hair appearing unkempt, Bisesar stood her small frame up straight, at the front ledge of the prisoners' box. Her voice inaudible to the media filling the courtroom at Old City Hall, she appeared to have a slight smile on her face as she came up the stairs and as she returned to the cells in the old building's basement. A full afternoon schedule and a backlog of lawyers waiting in the court's basement cells meant Barry spoke with Bisesar only during her brief appearance in the prisoners' box.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\"It was difficult because I only had a few moments in court (to see her). She looks a little dishevelled and a little tired today, but it's probably part of this work-to-rule jail guard (situation) pending strike,\" Barry, told reporters outside court after the appearance. Up to 6,000 jail guards and probation workers represented by the Ontario Public Service Employees Union could walk off the job if a 12:01 a.m. Sunday strike deadline passes. Bisesar has been in custody since Dec. 15 when she was arrested after an extensive search for a suspect in the afternoon attack on Rosemarie Junor, 28, in a concourse Shoppers Drug Mart, which police described as a \"completely random act of violence.\" Barry couldn't comment on whether Bisesar would receive mental health supports, suggesting it was too early to say. Speaking in general terms, he told the Star: \"When somebody's out of custody on bail it makes it a lot easier to prepare for trial, to get whatever help they need, or if they need psychiatric evaluations and such.\"\n\nThe impending strike makes it \"all that much more difficult,\" he said. \"But it's difficult at the best of times even when these strike issues aren't occurring.\" \"You go and there's lockdowns, you go there's a strike. People that need certain help, especially the mentally disordered accused, it makes it all the more difficult,\" he said, citing issues like overcrowding.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nFriday's appearance was intended as a chance for the defence to receive an evidence disclosure from Toronto police, but the court heard that evidence would not be ready until later in the month. The matter was adjourned to Jan. 20. Bisesar will make that next appearance by video link, in part due to the fear that the potential job action could further delay prisoner transport and hold up the courts while they wait for people in custody to arrive, the court heard. Since her charges were upgraded, Barry will not be seeking bail at this time, he said, and could not comment on whether he will in the future, citing a lack of information at his disposal at the moment. Initially charged with attempted murder, aggravated assault and carrying a concealed weapon, charges against Bisesar were upgraded to second-degree murder after Junor, a newlywed, died of her injuries in hospital days after the Dec. 11 attack.",
      "Source: Chris Martenson for The Energy Report (10/31/11)\n\nExponential debt increases coupled with limited natural resources mean that we are in a predicament. This is the message The Crash Course Author Chris Martenson delivered at the Casey Research/Sprott Inc. summit, \"When Money Dies.\" As an economic researcher, Chris considers the \"Three E's\" that shape our future: Economy, Energy and the Environment. In the below presentation, \"Unfixable,\" Chris explains to Energy Report readers why these indicators suggest a global economic slowdown. Read on.\n\n\nThe next 20 years are going to be completely unlike the last two decades. How the world works, how stocks grow, the very nature of investing and how our economy functions—all of these are due for fundamental, earth-shaking change. As investors, we have to adjust the way we look at the world.We want growth. We need economic growth. It's all you hear about when the treasury secretary talks about how we are going to get the economy growing again or when the president talks about jobs. When our money system is growing, things are reasonably happy. When it is not growing, things are very unhappy. As long as everything is growing, our economy functions reasonably well. And when it stops growing, it throws giant fits and gets into trouble. That is why we are always chasing growth. And there is a reason for that: Money. But what is money?I don't care what color it is or whose picture is on it or what counterfeiting measures you have in place. All money in the world today shares one characteristic: it is loaned into existence. It seems like a simple enough statement, but this has enormous implications. Because it is borrowed, we pay interest on it. That interest drives a peculiar feature in our money system (by \"our\" I'm referring to all fiat currencies in the world because all of them operate by this same loaning principle). When you loan money into existence, you have to pay both the principal and the interest back. That means there is always more debt than money in the system.We are constantly growing our money supply because our population is growing. In the past, we had a seemingly endless supply of resources, energy and land to occupy—all of that has been OK. But we are coming to a point where it's not OK anymore.\n\nConsider a chart of total credit market debt. It tops out at about $52 trillion (T). Each of those big, blue, upside-down triangles mark a doubling of credit market debt. From 1970 to about 1977, total credit market debt doubled. It doubled again by 1983. Then it doubled again and again and again. Over four decades, we had five doublings of our credit market debt. In order for the next 20 years to look like the last 20 years, we would need two complete doublings of credit market debt. Let me put those numbers in: $52T to $104T to $208T. That is an absolutely obscene amount of credit growth. This is not how our economy is supposed to function. It was a result of the abandonment of the gold standard, and it is not sustainable.\n\n\nThe second thing I want to point out is the blue line. That is a curve fit. It is an attempt to mathematically model what is going on with that red credit market debt line. It shows that our money system, our credit system, has been growing nearly perfectly exponentially.\n\n\nDebt:GDP Explosion\n\n\nAnother way to evaluate the economy is by looking at the debt:GDP ratio, because if you have a lot of income, it is OK to have a lot of debt: GDP is our income. Something really unusual is happening: The ratio is skyrocketing in an unprecedented range, with the exception of a blip during the Great Depression when manufacturing dived. We are in the middle of a very interesting experiment in this country. We can't dig through the data series and say, \"Oh, the last time we did that, this is how it turned out.\" We don't have any historical examples of any country in history getting out from under a debt:GDP load this high without going through some kind of a massive currency adjustment. There is one example from 1815 to 1900 where England got out from under 260% debt:GDP load, and it did that by cutting war spending after the Napoleonic Wars with help from the Industrial Revolution. Nothing on our horizon indicates that we are going to cut spending or increase our overall economic output by huge amounts. So we have to ask the question: How do we get out from under that? This debt:GDP imbalance is a global phenomenon. It is not just a U.S. problem.\n\n\nThat is why the economy must grow. In order to be happy, in order to service those debt loads, it must grow. Exponential growth, the kind that starts out nice and easy in a linear",
      "\"Hunter Biden is a private citizen and a lawyer,\" she said. \"The vice president does not endorse any particular company and has no involvement with this company. The vice president has pushed aggressively for years, both publicly with groups like the U.S.-Ukraine Business Forum and privately in meetings with Ukrainian leaders, for Ukraine to make every effort to investigate and prosecute corruption in accordance with the rule of law. It will once again be a key focus during his trip this week.\"\n\nRyan F. Toohey, a Burisma spokesman, said that Hunter Biden would not comment for this article.\n\nIt is not known how Mr. Biden came to the attention of the company. Announcing his appointment to the board, Alan Apter, a former Morgan Stanley investment banker who is chairman of Burisma, said, \"The company's strategy is aimed at the strongest concentration of professional staff and the introduction of best corporate practices, and we're delighted that Mr. Biden is joining us to help us achieve these goals.\"\n\nJoining the board at the same time was one of Mr. Biden's American business partners, Devon Archer. Both are involved with Rosemont Seneca Partners, an American investment firm with offices in Washington.\n\nMr. Biden is the younger of the vice president's two sons. His brother, Beau, died of brain cancer in May. In the past, Hunter Biden attracted an unusual level of scrutiny and even controversy. In 2014, he was discharged from the Navy Reserve after testing positive for cocaine use. He received a commission as an ensign in 2013, and he served as a public affairs officer.\n\nBefore his father was vice president, Mr. Biden also briefly served as president of a hedge fund group, Paradigm Companies, in which he was involved with one of his uncles, James Biden, the vice president's brother. That deal went sour amid lawsuits in 2007 and 2008 involving the Bidens and an erstwhile business partner. Mr. Biden, a graduate of Georgetown University and Yale Law School, also worked as a lobbyist before his father became vice president.",
      "It's a tug of war... between a gleaming silver barramundi and me. The one I am trying toreel in weighs two kg. As a first-time angler, I did not expect the fish to fight back. I hold on to the fishing rod with all my might to keep it from flying out of my hand. \"Reel in, reel in. Grip the rod tighter,\" shouts Prithviraj Manivelu, sport fishing consultant, who is not ready to give up despite my many futile attempts. This time, the fish is finally hooked… as I reel it out, in my excitement on seeing it, I lose focus. Sensing it, the fish dives right back into water, wins the battle, and swims away.\n\nAt The Big Catch League (organised by Beach Wolves Adventures), one of Chennai's first fishing competitions, it turns out concentration is as important as patience. No wonder it's proving to be a great sport for children, says Prithviraj, who started the Thiruporur Game Fishing, a sport fishing training academy, and the venue for the event. \"With a lot of children constantly glued to the television, video games and the Internet, this is a unique way to get them outdoors and understand Nature. It helps in developing the child's EQ and IQ. And it is a great stress buster for everybody,\" he says.\n\nAbout 40 contestants position themselves around the water body waiting for fish to take a bite of their bait. Among them are kids - the youngest, seven-year-old Sanjay Saravanan, has been fishing with his father for a month-and-a-half. He's a picture of calm as long as the game is on. \"The contest is open to all age groups. Today we have participants between the ages of seven and 80,\" adds Prithviraj.\n\nMeanwhile, 60-year-old Robert Gagarin, winner of the biggest carp category, poses with his catch — a two-kilo mirgal. Biggest carp, biggest barramundi, and maximum number of fish caught are the three categories for the sport. Bait fishing and spinning are the techniques the competition follows. Apart from Chennai, contestants are from Bangalore, Kolkata, Vellore and Kancheepuram. Forty-year-old Dereck D'Souza from Bangalore has been angling for the last 15 years. \"I am here with a group to compete. Normally in Chennai, we fish by the sunken ship and the reef,\" he adds, while expertly handling a baby terrapin he's just discovered.\n\nFishing has grown from being a hobby to becoming a popular competitive sport. Just like Dereck and the other participants from all over the country, a lot of Chennaiites too head to other cities to take part in fishing competitions. Given the steep increase in the number of enthusiasts, The Big Catch League, an angling event, will take place thrice a year.\n\nBlue Waters, another sport fishing institute, plans to organise a competition shortly. \"Assam hosts perhaps one of the biggest fishing contests in the country. People go to the Himalayas, Mumbai, and Bangalore to participate in fishing camps and compete. I took part in a couple of contests in Malaysia. It's time for Chennai to host a few as well,\" says Santhosh Jagadeesh, who started Blue Waters in 2010 along with his brother Sangeeth and Prithviraj. Starting off from their centre at the RMYC, Santhosh takes his clients into the sea where they catch bluefin tuna, mahi mahi, wahoo, yellowfin tuna, king mackerel, and giant trevally. \"We recently conducted a summer camp for children and the response was amazing. There was an eight-year-old girl from Malaysia, who was very knowledgeable and knew just what bait to use when, and for what fish,\" he adds.\n\nEven though it's a sport for all age groups, its hardcore practitioners belong to the age group of 30 to 50. The harsh sun and choppy waters have hardly been a deterrent. \"I have noticed women are stronger than some of the men who come and can handle and adapt better to these situations,\" says Manoj Chacko of Barracuda Bay.\n\nAccording to Prithviraj, Chennai has about 2,000 keen anglers. And the increase in sales and availability of fishing equipment is an indicator of the rising popularity of the sport. Salt water spinning reels, surf spinning rods, poppers, sub surface divers and stick baits are now available in the city and often sell out within two days of their import.\n\nWhen Manoj started fishing in Chennai 25 years ago, he had to wait for people coming from abroad to get him his equipment. \"Now there are a lot of dealers in the city catering to the various demands of avid anglers",

The Tennessean\n\nThree bodies have been recovered from wreckage.\n\nFire crews work the scene of a plane that crashed near the YMCA in Bellevue, Tenn., on Monday, Feb. 3, 2014. (Photo: Sanford Myers, The Tennessean) Story Highlights Rescuers believe a fourth body is in the plane\n\nPlane was en route from Kansas to Nashville\n\nNo confirmation on plane's owner, but a Gulfstream 690C is registered to Mid-Kansas Agri Co.\n\nNASHVILLE — A small, twin-propeller plane slammed into the ground Monday afternoon, killing four on board just yards from where children played and swam at a busy YMCA in the community of Bellevue, Tenn.\n\n\"I was with the kids. They were swimming. I was down on the benches watching them swim,\" said Chastity Mitchell, who lives in Bellevue. \"I just heard a really horrible explosion and looked up (at) those glass windows and saw a wall of fire.\"\n\nAll four people on board died in the crash, authorities said, which spat flames 20 feet into the air along with a plume of smoke that could be seen for blocks and debris littered the ground 100 feet away in every direction.\n\nThe Federal Aviation Administration said the Gulfstream 690C had flown out of Great Bend Municipal Airport in Kansas and was headed to John C. Tune Airport in Nashville. It crashed about 10 miles southwest of its destination.\n\n\"We pretty quickly realized that there were no lives to save,\" said Nashville District Fire Chief George Hickey. \"It's the worst plane crash I've ever seen.\"\n\nRescue workers had recovered three bodies by Monday evening and were confident they would find the fourth.\n\nThe cause of the crash remained under investigation Monday and the identities of those on board were not released.\n\nThe FAA has not yet confirmed who owned the plane. However, only one Gulfstream 690C is registered in the state of Kansas, to a Pawnee Rock, Kan.-based company called Mid-Kansas Agri Co.\n\n<!--iframe-->\n\nData from flightaware.com, which tracks flights in real time, shows the plane taking off from Great Bend around 2:45 p.m. with an intended destination of John C. Tune Airport. The site shows the plane passing over John C. Tune before going down just before 5 p.m.\n\nMartin Miller, the manager at Great Bend Airport confirmed the plane was based at that airport. He said federal officials were en route to Nashville to begin an investigation.\n\nHe described Mid-Kansas as a privately owned company. He said he did not know the identities of the plane's passengers or pilot.\n\nNo one answered the phone at the Kansas company's office Monday evening. Jacob Roenbaugh, who is listed as the company's resident agent, declined to comment.\n\n\"I don't want to talk about it now,\" he said.\n\nThe dead are believed to have been a family headed to a convention at the Gaylord Opryland Resort & Convention Center.\n\nWitnesses heard struggling engine\n\nResidents who live on a hill overlooking the crash site, said the sound of the aircraft's struggling engine got their attention.\n\nPaula Tipps heard the aircraft puttering before it appeared through the clouds and circled once before nose diving. She heard the noise — like a car crash — before seeing the explosion and fire.\n\nSimilarly, Tim Dial was watching an old movie with his wife, Nancy, when they heard the buzzing of the plane overhead. The buzzing stopped. The silence was followed by a loud bang.\n\n\"As soon as I heard that I said, 'This is a plane crash,' \" he said.\n\nIn seconds, Dial and dozens of his neighbors took off running down the muddy hill outside his house. They were confronted with towering flames and a thick plume of black smoke.\n\n\"It was just thick all over this neighborhood for a long time,\" he said. \"It's a miracle it didn't hit anything.\n\n\"It was so fast,\" he said. \"You hardly had time to process it.\"\n\nNo one was hurt on the ground though the debris from the impact damaged several vehicles in the YMCA parking lot. The organization said that chaplains and counselors will be made available to those who witnessed the crash. The YMCA will be closed until police allow it to reopen.\n\n\"Our thoughts and prayers continue to be with the victims' families and all those affected by the crash,\" read a statement from the YMCA. \"While details of the crash are still emerging, the near-miss of our building surely saved dozens of people",
      "Two rounds of the British Open are in the books, but plenty of history remains unwritten. As we head toward the weekend, here are the five questions weighing most heavily on our minds.\n\n1. Will anything gum up his work?\n\nOnly seven golfers have won wire-to-wire at the British Open, most recently Rory McIlroy in 2014. Jordan Spieth can become the 8th. Will the gum-chewing youngster stay atop the leaderboard this weekend? And if so, how long until he inks a Wrigley's endorsement deal?\n\n2. Another Open for Koepka?\n\nSpeaking of short lists, only six golfers have captured both the U.S. Open and the British Open in the same year. And only Lee Trevino capped off that achievement at Royal Birkdale, where he claimed the Claret Jug in 1971. Brooks Koepka, who made it look so easy at Erin Hills last month, is right in the thick of it heading toward the weekend. Can he repeat Trevino's epic feat?\n\n3. A British win for an Englishman?\n\nIan Poulter is rightly known as a match play killer, but in stroke play, not so much. His best finish in a British Open is a tie for third in 2013, but he missed the cut in his last two Open appearances. History is also working against him. It's been 48 years since an Englishman won the claret jug on home soil (Tony Jacklin in 1969). Is the streaky Poulter the man to finally end that streak?\n\n4. The 'Best Player to Finally Win a Major?'\n\nThanks to the likes of Lee Westwood, Rickie Fowler and Hideki Matsuyama, Matt Kuchar has escaped the dreaded label of Best Player to Never Win a Major. Somehow, he always seems to be in the mix at majors without calling great attention to himself. This time, however, there's no avoiding the spotlight. Kuchar will tee off Saturday in the final group, in second place behind Jordan Spieth. Does Kuchar have the stuff to be a cold-eyed closer? Or is he more comfortable just hanging around?\n\n5. Has the worst blown through?\n\nWe all like to watch the world's best work hard for their money. We got that chance on Friday when foul weather got the measure of most of the field. The weekend forecast calls for rain but softer breezes, which should yield lower scoring, but forecasts can be fickle. Will the winds pick up? Or will the course lay down?",
      "As part of the Esc and Ctrl series, Jon Ronson recently published two videos on Comment is free in which he confronts a spambot version of himself and accuses it of stealing his identity.\n\nWe're two of the people in the second episode. Although we didn't create Ronson's bot, we provide research and consultancy for the company that did. Like Ronson, we're interested in bots, algorithms and issues of identity on the net. The bigger story that Ronson misses, but that we have been researching and to which we tried to alert him, is that it's not just Ronson who has bots manipulating his life. It's all of us.\n\n\nAutomated trades comprise 70% of the Wall Street stock market, whereas in the UK over 30% of equity trading is conducted by algorithms. The pressures of global capitalism led by and built upon this \"black box\" trading are forcing us to be economically reliant on the algorithm, prompting technologist Kevin Slavin to suggest that we are now \"living in an algo-world\" – or as novelist Daniel Suarez describes it, a \"bot-mediated reality\". Automated softwares perform the analysis of medical x-rays to find abnormalities, while risk-assessment algorithms decide a person's suitability for a credit card based on their financial history. Our lives are in their hands, if indeed they have anything resembling hands.\n\nBut increasingly it's getting personal. In the online environment of social media, Edgerank algorithms edit and remix our Facebook identities, determining which friends we interact with. Google's page-rank algorithm anticipates what we want to find, creating what Eli Pariser calls a filter bubble, where we see what Google thinks we want to see.\n\nBots create 24% of tweets. Half of the internet traffic clicking through our websites and profiles is not human. Even Wikipedia is not immune: 22 of the 30 most prolific Wikipedia editors are bots. And as increasing numbers of us use online resources and social media in connection with our jobs as well as our personal lives, we need to realise how many of our \"co-workers\" are in fact algorithms, because we will have to live up to their standards. Bots are becoming our peers.\n\nIt used to be an insult to speak of someone \"behaving mechanically\", but now such behaviour is becoming both economically and socially desirable. It pays for bloggers to write articles optimised for search engines and crawler bots rather than human readers. Twitter, on the other hand, asks us to reduce our social discourse to 140 characters of hashtags, links, and @ handles, in imitation of the code webpages are written in.\n\nWe're at a turning point in the development of the internet. Bots, like any other scientific innovation, can be used for benign or malign purposes. The identity issues that Ronson raises are only the thin end of the wedge.\n\nWe've started to see numbers of humans pretending to be bots, a strange development that signals a shift in the power and identity politics of the internet. Ronson had a bot pretending to be him, which is annoying. But following the release of Ronson's videos, we have been confronted by Twitter versions of ourselves – @dan_o_hara, @lookrobertmason – accounts that are humans, pretending to be bots, pretending to be us. In such an online environment, where your true identity is reduced to an algorithmically generated collage, and where humans – already an endangered species – are simulating machines, it's hard to say if being \"you\" online has any real meaning.\n\nAt least Ronson's bot could be killed, in theory. The other bots out there, beyond anyone's control or even understanding, are not so killable. When Ronson looks for the people trying to control the internet, he's looking in the right place, but at the wrong species. The internet is increasingly becoming a post-user environment, regulated by something much more uncontrollable than humans.\n\n• Follow Comment is free on Twitter @commentisfree",
      "John Rolfe\n\nBeef cattle contribute ~7% of anthropocentric greenhouse gas emissions in Australia through the release of methane into the atmosphere. Cattle in northern Australia produce more methane per unit of beef produced because tropical grasses are generally of poor quality and elicit slower average growth rates. In this paper the level of emissions from different herds and some strategies to reduce emissions are estimated with a daily time-step model. The results indicate that few options exist to reduce methane emissions from extensive grazing systems without reducing beef production. Options to improve production or feed conversion efficiencies can generate lower levels of emissions per kg of beef produced, but can be expected to lead to increased livestock numbers and higher overall methane emissions. A woodland grazing case study from central Queensland suggests the opportunity cost of reducing each kg of methane emissions by reducing stocking rates ranges from 1.0 to 1.2 kg of liveweight beef production. A price of $23 per t of carbon dioxide equivalent would indicate that opportunity costs (ignoring fixed costs of production) of reducing emissions by adjusting stocking rates would range between $0.39 and $0.49 per kg of beef produced.\n\nAcknowledgements Go To >> Top Introduction Methane emissions from li...

      "From now on Theresa May can ignore Parliament\n\nTheresa May has striven mightily at every stage to avoid Parliamentary restraint on her Brexit negotiations with the rest of the EU. She fought in the courts to the bitter end against the principle that the triggering of Article 50 required the prior approval from Parliament. A White Paper was extracted out of the government in a manner akin to that used by Lord Olivier in Marathon Man. The White Paper thus extracted was so anodyne that vanilla seemed tangy after reading it. The Article 50 Bill was pushed through Parliament with every attempt to place any restraint on the way in which the government negotiates Brexit stripped out. It received Royal Assent on Wednesday in pristine form. The only commitment that the Government has given is to allow a vote on the final deal on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Leaving it would mean that Britain left the EU without any deal at all. So from now on, Theresa May can ignore Parliament.\n\nThroughout all of this process, Theresa May has been aided and abetted by the ardent Leavers and their press supporters. Judges were vilified for issuing inconvenient judgments, to the point of being described as enemies of the people. The more hardcore Leavers contemplated the abolition of the House of Lords when it sought to impose conditions on the Article 50 Bill. They are no doubt surveying the outcome with great satisfaction.\n\nThose Leavers who are regarded on their own side as intellectuals have often stressed how Brexit would restore Parliamentary sovereignty. Yet they have fought tooth and nail to remove Parliament's role in the exit process. These are Augustinian Leavers – Lord give me Parliamentary sovereignty, but not yet.\n\nBut they do not seem to realise what they have done. Because this was never a battle between Leavers and Remainers. This was, as the courts explained in their judgments in the Article 50 case, a question of where power lay between the Government and Parliament. The courts concluded that Parliament held the power to initiate the triggering of Article 50.\n\nThroughout the Second World War, Parliament debated war aims, strategy and progress. Chamberlain fell over just such a debate. No matter how keen many Leavers are on analogies from the 1940s, even they would struggle to describe Brexit as operating on a higher plane than a global war. But the Leaver MPs have fallen far below their predecessors, acting as lobby fodder to abdicate their role to the Government. From now on, the executive has complete control. It is important to understand what that means. Between the triggering of Article 50 (A Day) and the day of Brexit (B Day), Theresa May's government can set whatever policy it thinks fit. It is far from clear that policy will be one of hard Brexit. The negotiations have not yet started. No one yet knows where they are going to finish. Unless there is no deal at all, the deal will involve compromise on the British side in some ways. And if the Government compromises in some ways, we can expect the ultra-orthodox Leavers to be outraged. But they will have no direct outlet for that outrage. The Government negotiations are not to be controlled by Parliament. Ministers may be brought before select committees, whose members may huff and puff, but ultimately if a deal is struck it will be put before Parliament on a take-it-or-leave-it basis. Given the balance of the House of Commons, that deal will be taken. The ultra-orthodox Leavers have voted for their own impotence. By B Day, their vision of a Britain with no ties to the EU of any kind might well have been flushed down the pan.\n\nNow imagine that the House of Commons had approached this differently, with a will to ensure that it kept a tight rein on the Government. Given the small majority of the Government in the House of Commons, a relatively small number of Conservative MPs on either side of the party (perhaps even working in concert) could have secured this. The Government could then have been required to explain its approach to MPs and win their support for approach on broad policy decisions. The Government would have been forced to do the hard thinking that David Davis freely admitted before the select committee this week had not yet been undertaken. It might even have helped build that consensus that the Prime Minister is set to tour the nation to build.\n\nSo when the Leaver MPs are betrayed, as in their own minds they most certainly will be, and Brexit is not negotiated to their complete satisfaction, they are going to be unable to express themselves through normal Parliamentary means. The newspaper front pages will no doubt scream, but they will do so largely impotently.\n\nHow will the hardline Leavers continue their campaign? They've just helped to close off the conventional route. But that frustration will find a vent somehow. But how?\n\nAlastair Meeks\n\nFollow @AlastairMeeks\n\n\nTweet",
      "Unlike the British reign, however, the memory of leftist rule in Yemen has largely been forgotten. How did religious militancy, through Al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula and now ISIS, come to define our perceptions of southern Yemen less than five decades after the National Liberation Front's victory?\n\nThe British left southern Yemen in defeat. They were unable to quell a major anti-imperial insurgency during the Aden Emergency , and in the fallout of their withdrawal, the Marxist-Leninist cadre outflanked their allies to create the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen.\n\nThe guns were British-made, and one of many reminders of \"Britain's century and a half in command of Aden, once the most strategic ports in the world.\" Others include military cemeteries, a scaled replica of Big Ben called \"Little Ben,\" postboxes, and the occasional pound banknote.\n\nIn May 2004, Guardian columnist Mark Seddon reported that while visiting a black market north of Sana'a, he found L1A1 Self-Loading Rifles among a selection of various other firearms.\n\nFrom Emergency to Unification\n\nThe Aden Emergency was a crystallization of the regional mood during the 1950s and 1960s, in which left-wing national liberation movements grew in popularity. These trends were especially dominant in North and South Yemen.\n\nYemenis lived in an underdeveloped country, even in comparison to their neighbors, and were deeply scarred from centuries of tribal conflict, colonial rule, and dynastic religious politics. A mixture of pan-Arabism, Marxist-Leninism, and clan revolt became the ideological manifestations of this exhaustion, leading to over a decade of turbulence.\n\nNorth Yemen became mired in civil war following an Egyptian-backed republican coup d'etat by Abdullah as-Sallal in 1962. Foreshadowing today's proxy violence, and notable for its apparent lack of religious sectarianism, the North Yemeni Civil War saw Saudi Arabia supporting a Zaydi Shi'a imamate against the pan-Arabist government. Riyadh was willing to overlook the Shi'ism of its monarchical ally in order to challenge secular republicanism on the Arabian Peninsula, which threatened to overtake the Saudi Royal Family as well.\n\nMeanwhile, tensions were extremely high in South Yemen due to a steady stream of anti-imperial propaganda from Nasserist Egypt, as well as the British Empire's plans to sponsor a federated monarchical state to replace its rule after independence. If the transition had succeeded, the Federation of South Arabia would have looked structurally similar to the United Arab Emirates.\n\nVarious anti-British political organizations and guerrilla fighters steadily coalesced into two rival camps: the National Liberation Front (NLF), which established ties with Egypt, and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY). FLOSY was composed heavily of Adenis, many of whom wanted to create a socialist republic upon independence. While the NLF shared many of these aspirations, it boasted a membership that was mainly rural, and espoused a far greater ideological affinity with Marxist-Leninist parties in China and the Soviet Union.\n\nThe NLF and FLOSY attacked each other as well as British troops (though in memoirs of the war, British officers have admitted to framing both groups for many of the attacks).\n\nThe war began when a state of emergency was declared following a grenade attack against High Commissioner Kennedy Travaskis. While rebels posted significant victories through hit-and-run attacks, particularly in the Crater District of Aden, the majority of deaths in the conflict were from infighting.\n\nThe British finally withdrew in 1967. Until the Iraq War, it was Britain's last major war in the region. After a brief reconciliation government, the NLF launched a coup against FLOSY and other South Yemeni revolutionaries, leading to the formation of the People's Democratic Republic of Yemen (PDRY). The PDRY aligned with the Soviet Union, and espoused various tenets of Marxist-Leninism, including state control of large swaths of the economy.\n\nBefore long, regional events would cause the Aden Politburo to reconsider its hardline stance. Key among them were the failure of the Dhofar Uprising in Oman, the repulsion of PDRY cadres after clashes on the Saudi Arabian border, and the inability of the National Democratic Front Rebellion to unseat Ali Abdullah Saleh in North Yemen (now known as the Yemen Arab Republic, following republican victory in the civil war, which ended in 1970).\n\nThe Dhofar Uprising was initially a tribal revolt that began in 1962 with the insurrection of Musallim bin Nafl, a tribal leader who obtained weapons and vehicles from Saudi Arabia, as well as additional support from exiled Imam Ghalib bin Ali. Dhofar was a severely marginalized province in southern Oman that suffered from social, economic, and linguistic disenfranchisement (while Sultan Taimur's court in Muscat spoke Arabic",
      "Christian Petersen/Getty Images\n\nRaffi Torres is on the end of another arbitrary suspension by NHL disciplinarian Brendan Shanahan as he was suspended for \"the remainder of the second round of the playoffs,\" according to the NHL's Department of Player Safety.\n\nTorres' questionable hit came against Jarret Stoll of the Los Angeles Kings in Game 1 of the Western Conference semifinals.\n\nShanahan's video explanation of the hit and suspension is below:\n\nThis is obviously not the first time that Torres has been suspended for three or more games. Indeed, it was Torres who received a 25-game ban (later reduced to 21) for his hit in last year's playoffs that knocked the Chicago Blackhawks' Marian Hossa out of the playoffs.\n\nWhile it is obvious that Torres has a tendency to overstep the boundaries sometimes, it is actually Shanahan who managed to circumvent the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement with his \"second-round\" suspension.\n\nRegardless of whether one views this hit as a \"clean\" or \"dirty\" hit, the fact remains that Torres might have gotten hoodwinked as far as this suspension goes. As the suspension occurred in Game 1 of the series with the Kings, Torres could be suspended up to six games, assuming the series went seven games.\n\nIf Shanahan is playing by the rules—as he seems to have a tendency to do in his suspension videos—then Torres could see his toes being stepped on by this ruling .\n\nThe new \"proposed\" Collective Bargaining Agreement (via NHL.com) specifies that \"a subsequent appeal right to a neutral arbitrator will be available for suspensions of six (6) or more games. The neutral arbitrator shall have full remedial authority in respect of the matter.\"\n\nAs Torres will not know the length of his suspension until the end of this series (whenever that may be), it is clear that there is a fair bit of ambiguity going on in this suspension length.\n\nEric Macramalla, TSN's legal analyst, had some interesting thoughts via his Twitter account on the Torres' suspension.\n\nIf there truly was an attempt by the NHL to remove Torres' opportunity to seek a ruling from an independent arbitrator, then he may have a case for a grievance against the NHL.\n\nAs the NHL has shifted away from the fixed-game suspension length for Torres' hit, the grievance that he could file would likely seek to put the game limit back in suspensions for other players.\n\nIf this does not become the case, the clause of the CBA that guarantees an arbitrator if a player is assessed more than a six-game suspension becomes null and void.\n\nThis is definitely something to keep an eye on going forward. Not just because it is Torres, but because it could be a growing theme in the playoffs for suspensions.\n\nIf players get injured and they miss more games than the player is suspended for, then the severity of the suspension can be undermined. This \"non-fixed number of games\" suspension seems like a good idea on paper for that reason.\n\nUnfortunately, as is the case with this current suspension of Torres, it can also potentially circumvent the prescribed measures in place, set out by the CBA.\n\nWith the Sharks now trailing in the series 2-0, Shanahan will be in the clear if the series fails to go seven games.\n\nIf it does go seven games, there could be some big-time contentious feedback from Torres and the NHLPA.",

      "10 Stages of Genocide\n\nIn 1996, Gregory H. Stanton, the president of Genocide Watch, presented the \"8 Stages of Genocide\" to the United States Department of State, citing that genocide develops in eight stages that are \"predictable, but not inexorable.\" At each stage, preventive measures can stop the genocide from exacerbating.\n\nIn 2013 Dr. Stanton expanded the stages to 10 Stages of Genocide to include Discrimination and Persecution.\n\nThe Genocide Report recognizes Dr. Stantons 10 Stages of Genocide as the model by which to evaluate the process of genocide.\n\n1st Stage: Classification\n\nAll cultures have categories to distinguish people into us and them; by ethnicity, race, religion, or nationality: German and Jew, Hutu and Tutsi. Bipolar societies that lack mixed categories, such as Rwanda and Burundi, are the most likely to have genocide. The main preventive measure at this early stage is to develop universalistic institutions that transcend ethnic or racial divisions, that actively promote tolerance and understanding, and that promote classifications that transcend the divisions. The Catholic Church could have played this role in Rwanda, had it not been torn apart by the same ethnic cleavages as Rwandan society. Promotion of a common language in countries like Tanzania has also promoted transcendent national identity. This search for common ground is vital to early prevention of genocide.\n\n2nd Stage: Symbolization\n\nWe give names or other symbols to the classifications. We name people;Jews or Gypsies;, or distinguish them by colors or dress; and apply the symbols to members of groups. Classification and symbolization are universally human and do not necessarily result in genocide unless they lead to dehumanization. When combined with hatred, symbols may be forced upon unwilling members of pariah groups: the yellow star for Jews under Nazi rule, the blue scarf for people from the Eastern Zone in Khmer Rouge Cambodia. To combat symbolization, hate symbols can be legally forbidden (swastikas) as can hate speech.\n\nGroup marking like gang clothing or tribal scarring can be outlawed, as well. The problem is that legal limitations will fail if unsupported by popular cultural enforcement. Though Hutu and Tutsi were forbidden words in Burundi until the 1980s, code-words replaced them. If widely supported, however, denial of symbolization can be powerful, as it was in Bulgaria, where the government refused to supply enough yellow badges and at least eighty percent of Jews did not wear them, depriving the yellow star of its significance as a Nazi symbol for Jews.\n\n3rd Stage: Discrimination\n\nA dominant group uses law, custom, and political power to deny the rights of other groups. The powerless group may not be accorded full civil rights, voting rights, or even citizenship. The dominant group is driven by an exclusionary ideology that would deprive less powerful groups of their rights. The ideology advocates monopolization or expansion of power by the dominant group.\n\nIt legitimizes the victimization of weaker groups. Advocates of exclusionary ideologies are often charismatic, expressing resentments of their followers, attracting support from the masses. Examples include the Nuremberg Laws of 1935 in Nazi Germany, which stripped Jews of their German citizenship, and prohibited their employment by the government and by universities.\n\nDenial of citizenship to the Rohingya Muslim minority in Burma is a current example. Prevention against discrimination means full political empowerment and citizenship rights for all groups in a society. Discrimination on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, race or religion should be outlawed. Individuals should have the right to sue the state, corporations, and other individuals if their rights are violated.\n\n4th Stage: Dehumanization\n\nOne group denies the humanity of the other group. Members of it are equated with animals, vermin, insects or diseases. Dehumanization overcomes the normal human revulsion against murder. At this stage, hate propaganda in print and on hate radios is used to vilify the victim group. The majority group is taught to regard the other group as less than human, and even alien to their society. They are indoctrinated to believe that. We are better off without them. The powerless group can become so depersonalized that they are actually given numbers rather than names, as Jews were in the death camps. They are equated with filth, impurity, and immorality. Hate speech fills the propaganda of official radio, newspapers, and speeches.\n\nTo combat dehumanization, incitement to genocide should not be confused with protected speech. Genocidal societies lack constitutional protection for countervailing speech, and should be treated differently than democracies. Local and international leaders should condemn the use of hate speech and make it culturally unacceptable. Leaders who incite genocide should be banned from international travel and have their foreign finances frozen. Hate radio stations should be shut down, and hate propaganda banned. Hate crimes and atrocities should be promptly punished.\n\n5th Stage: Organization\n\nGen",
      "At some point, most parents have to decide how to handle the bread crust issue.\n\nOne of my daughters rarely seems to mind eating it, while another always leaves it behind. I've always been more concerned with food waste than nutritional loss because I assumed it was a myth that there are more minerals and vitamins in the crust.\n\nTurns out there may not be more vitamins in the crust, but there could be health benefits from eating your bread crust! A study published in the American Chemical Society followed research from Germany on the topic.\n\nIn a study conducted at the German Research Center of Food Chemistry in Garching, Germany, Thomas Hofmann, Ph.D, the lead researcher of found that when the antioxidant content and activity of bread crust, bread crumbs, and bread flour were analyzed, bread crust came out on top.\n\nWhat they discovered was that the process of baking bread creates an antioxidant, pronyl-lysine, which is significantly higher in the crust. This antioxidant has been shown in other studies to play a role in cancer prevention. Is it possible that former studies showing possible cancer-fighting properties of bread wrongly linked that advantage to fiber?\n\nThe research team found that this antioxidant formed in both yeast based, and non-yeast based breads, and that it was higher in smaller loaves of bread because there is more surface area exposed to the baking process. Darker breads such as rye and whole wheat generally contain higher antioxidant content, but over browning reduces the antioxidant content.\n\nSo mom, you may have been right! Eating my bread crust just may have been good for me after all.\n\nYou can also find me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest. I'd love to see you there!\n\nRelated on MNN:\n\nAre bread crusts more nutritious?\n\nMy mom always made me eat my bread crust claiming it was good for me.

      "Financial Cost of Drinking and Driving\n\nFinancial Cost of Drinking and Driving\n\nIn the United States, the public cost of alcohol-induced traffic incidents is estimated to be around $114.3 billion. This includes $51.1 billion in monetary costs and roughly $62.3 billion in life losses. The driver is not the only one financially affected in these situations; people other than the drunk driver pay around $71.6 billion for alcohol-related crashes.\n\nThere are many factors related to drunk driving that people do not realize at the time of conviction. Some drunk driving-related fees include court costs, attorney fees, bail fees, driving under the influence education programs, and car towing or impounding. The aforementioned mandatory drunk driving education program can cost between $1,500 and $2,500.\n\nIn all 50 states, a driver temporarily loses his or her driver's license after violating drunk driving laws. This means the offender has to rely on other methods of transportation, which can take a toll financially. There is also a $250 reinstatement fee that must be paid before a driver can return to full driving privileges.\n\nMany states order offenders to have a car ignition interlock device installed inside their cars. An ignition lock is a machine that is connected to a car's ignition and checks the driver's blood alcohol content level. The driver has to blow into the machine to start the car and do so from time to time while the engine is running. If alcohol is detected, the car does not start. If a driver fails the test while the car is in motion, the vehicle's horn will honk, or the lights will flash to get the attention of nearby police on patrol. This device can cost as much as $200 to install and $80 per month to maintain, which is of course billed to the offender.\n\nOffenders continue to pay for their actions many years after a DUI incident. It is estimated that in the five years following a drunk driving conviction, an offender's car insurance bill can increase by $5,000 to $10,000. Such an offense can also lead to the loss of a job, especially if an offender's job revolves around driving a motor vehicle.\n\nThe costs associated with a DUI conviction vary from state to state, but they almost always run into the thousands of dollars. It is estimated that the minimum cost to a driver for his or her first DUI conviction in the state of New York is $9,500. A Texas Department of Transportation survey revealed that the total cost of a drunk driving arrest and conviction, even if there wasn't an auto accident, ranges from $9,000 to $24,000.",
      "Americans are fatter than they used to be ... Everyone knows the weight is causing sickness and early death. Government and industry say the pounds are costing us ... This generation will have shorter lives than their parents ... Studies show long-term weight loss elusive ... Doctors say to keep trying anyway ...\n\nDoes it ever seem like you're hearing the same things about weight over and over? Witnessing the depressing cycle of failed public initiatives and fruitless personal efforts to trim our waistlines, who wouldn't wish for a more hopeful angle or some alternative facts on the old story?\n\nFortunately, an alternative viewpoint is out there, and those facts are available, even if they can be hard to hear over the societal clamor of food fear and body bias. Getting to this information requires tuning out the loud \"everyone knows\" claims about obesity, shape and diet. It means questioning health \"experts\" who themselves have failed to question. It requires adopting a new, more skeptical mantra, like the one we use in the movement known as Health at Every Size (HAES). \"Show me the data,\" we demand, and you should, too.\n\nHAES advocates include scientists, doctors, therapists, dietitians, fitness professionals, and writers, among others. If more doctors, journalists and public officials were to seek their wisdom, they would do less harm, save tax dollars, and help people live longer, healthier and better.\n\nI see information every day that shows that our obsession over body fat is a costly, crippling threat to health and well-being. I routinely tally the costs -- medical, financial and psychological- - of the un-winnable War on Obesity and the commercial juggernaut it supports (Low-cal snacks! Diet pills! Weight-loss centers where customers always come back!). And I conduct research and write peer-reviewed articles supporting the HAES paradigm with facts, replacing knee-jerk everyone knows statements with what is truly known about the meaning of body weight.\n\nThe evidence demonstrates that fat isn't the bogeyman it's made out to be, and that a focus on health habits, rather than weight, accomplishes the very goals collective thinness is supposed to achieve (if it were possible in the first place). Compared to control groups of people on weight loss programs, people who accept themselves and their bodies as they are tend to exercise more and eat better. They do better medically, on blood pressure, cholesterol, insulin sensitivity and similar measures, and feel happier in the long run. They adopt longer-lasting exercise habits. And guess which group weighs less, two years out? Neither! In the HAES study I conducted, both groups ended up with weights where they started, albeit with the dieters having endured another wearying and health-damaging deprivation-loss-regain cycle.\n\nIn other words, as long as we're focused on changing our bodies -- which the data shows isn't going to happen for most people, anyway -- we are missing the real benefits that come from caring for our bodies.\n\nEvery week or month, another example emerges of knee-jerk assumptions about what everyone knows, rather than what we actually do know, shaping decisions in medicine and government. Despite all the talk about \"evidence-based\" policy, for instance, Medicare is now covering doctor-prescribed weight-loss efforts while the evidence clearly shows that they don't improve health or result in sustained weight loss. The First Lady is devoting herself to eradicating childhood obesity, when the latest meta-analysis of 55 interventions showed an approximate mean weight loss of... one pound. These \"health\" initiatives have not just failed, they've backfired, contributing to the rise in weight-based discrimination and bullying, among many other damaging side effects.\n\nWhat is known (even if everyone can't accept it yet) is that:\n\n• Stable fat is blown out of proportion as a health risk (even dreaded \"tummy fat\"), but yo-yoing weights common to dieters do harm health.\n\n• The \"ironclad\" notion that obesity leads to early death is wrong: Mortality data show \"overweight\" people, on average, live longest, and moderately \"obese\" people have similar longevity to those at weights deemed \"normal\" and advisable.\n\n• Life spans have lengthened almost in lockstep with waistlines over the last few decades, which should make you wonder about the supposed deadliness of fat.\n\nWhen you consider our cultural preoccupation with food and weight, the data on eating disorders and mental health (among thin people, too), and the social justice concerns that arise from waging a war against body types, fat stigma ranks as far more dangerous than rolls and rolls of fat. And when you see who earns what from the billions spent annually on weight-loss products, procedures, and pharmaceuticals, it becomes clear that commercial interests have tainted obesity beliefs, policy and research.

      "Living to 100 may be seen as a long life now, but according to a new review, it may be the norm for babies born today.\n\nThe article, appearing in the medical journal The Lancet, shows that based on current trajectories, more than half of all babies born in industrialized nations since the year 2000 can expect to live into the triple digits. The trends included in the article show that many Western nations will have most people living past 100, with half of all babies born in 2007 in the U.S. likely to live to age 104.\n\nPlay\n\n\"I guess it's good news for individuals and a challenge for societies,\" said Dr. Kaare Christensen, an epidemiologist with the Danish Aging Research Center at the University of Southern Denmark, the study's lead author.\n\n\"If this trajectory continues, half the babies will be 100 and I think that gives us a new perspective for how to plan your life, basically,\" he said. \"If you're going to retire when you are 60 or 65, it looks quite different when your life expectancy is 75 or 80 than when it's 100.\"\n\nChristensen said that while the progress in life span during the first part of the 20th century came by reducing infant mortality, increases in longevity since then have come from improving life at older ages, and that will need to persist for the projection to hold up.\n\n\"If we want to have a continuing increase in life expectancy, the progress has to occur at older ages,\" he said. \"I don't hear any concerns among the elderly that they are living too long.\"\n\nChristensen said that the aging population will also likely be a more vibrant population, with a higher quality of life than people of that age now.\n\n\"The good news is people will generally be functioning well -- it's more like they're postponing their aging process,\" he said.\n\nSome researchers backed the new report's hypothesis.\n\n\"Based upon the best possible approximations, I believe they are correct in their assessment of age projections,\" said Dr. Stephen Helfand, a professor in the division of biology and medicine at Brown University in an e-mail. \"Their evidence appears overwhelming in favor of their hypothesis.\n\nAt the same time, some question whether the full prediction -- that most babies born today will live past 100 -- is fully accurate.\n\n\"I think that's a very optimistic scenario; however, there may be chronic health problems that may not allow us to follow that best-case scenario, not yet,\" said Hector Gonzalez, an assistant professor of medicine and public health at Wayne State University.\n\n\"There's no reason to think more than half the population living today can't live until 100,\" said Dr. Harrison Bloom, senior associate at the International Longevity Center of New York. \"But that would assume better eating habits, a healthier lifestyle and continuing improvements in the environment. That lifestyle would definitely mean less obesity. The diabetes and obesity epidemic today is very real. A lot of people are going to die earlier than their projected life span would have been.\"\n\nChanges for an Aging Population\n\nRegardless of age, researchers agreed that we are seeing a change in population demographics that will alter how society functions.\n\n\"There are many significant consequences to an increase in longevity, which are obvious to most people,\" said Helfand. \"People living longer will change the entire demographics and, perhaps, needs of a nation. \"\n\n\"More older persons living longer and living better -- there will also be an absolute increase in persons with disability and requiring care,\" said Dr. Eric B. Larson, executive director of the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. \"This will cause us to need to rethink health care for all ages, but especially for seniors -- most likely this would mean a focus more on rehabilitation and pre-habilitation, health and functional maintenance and less focus on individual sickness and acute care.\"\n\nSome worry that changes that come may not be positive.\n\n\"Unfortunately, I think what we're seeing, especially with the obesity epidemic, is people are living longer, but they're not necessarily healthier, and that's where we really need to focus,\" said Gonzalez. \"That's a huge economic burden, to take care of a lot of sick people.\n\n\"I'm a little troubled, actually, that society is aging, and a large proportion of the older population will be made up of a lot of skilled workers. My chief concern is that right now we have gutted a lot of our educational opportunities and that we may not have the skilled work force necessary to support an older population.\"\n\nGonzalez said part of the problem is reflected in ethnic disparities, where minorities -- who will make up an increasing percent of the population -- have more health problems and less education.\n\nOthers noted that while disparities are present, there is also an increasing, vital group of older people that is likely to continue growing, even if it will not be a",

He knew news and gossip about \"drinking problem\" would likely be somewhere on the cover of the' Daily Profit' or the weekly gossip magazine 'By the Hour.' But hell, he thought as he tossed back another fire whisky, he stunt today was no doubt going to appear anyways- might as well give them their desert.\n\n\"Well I'll be damned.\" A thick Scottish brogue rumbled next to him. \"If it isn't little Harry Potter, all grown up.\" The voice sounded vaguely familiar, but the spike of annoyance at the man was fast overcome by the bartender setting down a newly refilled glass.\n\n\"Cheers.\" he mumbled, knocking back that glass too. It was odd, after about four of them the taste started to diminish. He probably couldn't tell whiskey from water at that point. He frowned at the bartender. Was the man watering down his drinks? He sniffed the glass. It didn't smell watered down, but you could never really tell. Water was scentless after all. He narrowed his eyes, gesturing for another.\n\n\"You might want to slow down a bit mate.\" The man spoke, amusement tainting his words.\n\nHarry shoved the glass towards the stranger without much thought. \"Does that taste watered down to you?\" he demanded, unaware of just how slurred his words were becoming. He watched closely as the man picked it up and took a sip with laughing eyes. The man was scruffy- with ruffled short brownish red hair and an unshaven face. He was handsome in a strong cave man sort of way. Harry turned more fully on his bar stool and balanced himself on an elbow resting on the wood. He defiantly wouldn't mind getting to know the rugged stranger better that night.\n\n\"Tastes fine to me.\" The laughter was still there, clear on his face. Brown eyes met green… Familiar brown eyes. Harry frowned again, his slightly blurry vision not helping. The man took another sip, lips quirked. He was probably a few years older then him. Maybe he went to Hogwarts?\n\nThe younger of the two was getting ready to ask when a voice yelled down over the music. \"Hey Wood- you coming or what?\" As a wadded up napkin flew at the mans head with dangerous precision. Harry batted it away without much thought- reflexes sharp, despite his inebriated state.\n\n\"Oliver Wood!\" He exclaimed with drunken delight. \"I'd apologize for not recognizing you off the bat, but you look quite a mite different!\" He was oblivious to the stumped Chaser leaning over the balcony, but Oliver wasn't.\n\n\"Start without me. I'll be up in a bit.\" He hollered back, the bar busy enough that no one else really paid attention. \"So Harry. How have you been? You're looking a bit different yourself, by the way.\"\n\n\"I've been… ehh. You know, same old. Life is what it is what it is…\" He trailed off, brows furrowed. \"You stole my drink. Well, that's not very polite.\" He sat their seriously for a couple more moments before a chuckle escaped and he flagged down the weary bartender yet again. \"Two rounds, if you please.\" He stated, dropping a hand to slap against the bar. \"And how have you been? Still playing for Puddlemere and all that?\"\n\n\"Aye. Going on seven years now. If you don't mind me asking, what's got you in such a tizzy? You're going to black out, if you're not careful. Strong stuff, fire whiskey.\"\n\n\"Tizzy? I'm not in a tizzy.\" He stated firmly. \"I'm celebrating.\"\n\n\"Oh? What are we celebrating?\" Oliver asked, holding up his glass to toast.\n\n\"My… resignation… from the auror program.\"\n\nOliver choked on his drink. \"You quit",
      "Three Canadian scientists being removed from an Ebola-affected region of Sierra Leone will not be coming home on a commercial airline, a precautionary measure the Public Health Agency of Canada decided to take despite its confidence that the trio are at a \"very low\" risk of being infected with the deadly virus.\n\nA spokesman for the agency said in an e-mail on Wednesday that \"to protect the privacy of the team members and their families,\" the names of the scientists or the arrival time and landing location of their chartered flight will not be released.\n\n\"The agency remains committed to helping in the response to this outbreak and is preparing to send another team to Sierra Leone once appropriate steps have been taken to ensure a safe living environment,\" the spokesman said.\n\nThe PHAC confirmed on Tuesday night that it was finalizing plans to pull its mobile laboratory staff out of Kailahun, a remote jungle outpost in Sierra Leone that is now the site of a World Health Organization probe into how Ebola spread to a Senegalese epidemiologist who was not directly treating patients.\n\nThe Senegalese doctor has been flown to Germany for care; the WHO has removed the rest of its team from Kailahun until the investigation is complete.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced Wednesday that it had flown one of its staff members home on a chartered plane from West Africa after the responder had a \"low-risk exposure\" to the virus, having worked less than a metre away from an international health worker who tested positive for Ebola.\n\nThe CDC staff member was reportedly working in Kailahun, but a spokeswoman declined to confirm the location.\n\nThe Public Health Agency of Canada said it decided to bring its scientists home after people in the hotel complex in which they were staying tested positive for Ebola.\n\nNone of the Canadian team members had direct contact with any of the Ebola-infected individuals and they are not displaying symptoms of the disease, which has killed more than 1,400 people in Sierra Leone, Guinea, Liberia and Nigeria.\n\nA separate and apparently unrelated Ebola outbreak has been confirmed in Congo.\n\nThe Canadian scientists are \"voluntarily isolating\" themselves, the PHAC said, although the agency did not explain precisely what that means.\n\nThe scientists will be monitored closely when they return to Canada, having their temperatures checked for at least 21 days – the maximum incubation period of the disease.\n\nEbola is not contagious until a patient begins showing symptoms such as high fever, headache, weakness, muscle pain and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhea and, in some cases, bleeding. The virus is spread through direct contact with bodily fluids, not through the air.\n\nThe Senegalese doctor worked in the same unit as the Canadians, who were helping to control the outbreak by rapidly diagnosing or ruling out cases of Ebola in Kailahun, a deeply forested area near Sierra Leone's border with Guinea, where the outbreak began.\n\nThe mobile lab was not treating patients; it was supporting a Médecins sans frontières (Doctors Without Borders) treatment centre erected in the bush outside the small town of Kailahun.\n\nThe WHO's director of communications, Christy Feig, said the organization is investigating how the Senegalese doctor became infected with the virus and plans to send its staff back as soon as the situation is safe.\n\n\"It could have been a straightforward thing; he was exposed in an accident with an infected patient, it could have been that simple,\" Ms. Feig said Wednesday in an interview from Liberia. \"But it also is a little unusual so we want to give it a close look so we can make sure there's not something about the set up there that's putting more people at risk.\"\n\nHe is the first person working on an Ebola outbreak through the WHO's Global Outbreak Alert and Response Network to have contracted the disease.\n\nThe Canadian team was also in Sierra Leone under the aegis of the outbreak response network, which is known by the acronym GOARN.\n\nThe outbreak has been particularly deadly for front-line health workers in West Africa, more than 120 of whom have died, according to the WHO.\n\nMSF said Wednesday that it has no intention of pulling its people back from Kailahun or any of the other regions ravaged by an Ebola outbreak that has killed more people than all previous outbreaks combined.\n\nThe aid organization has 184 international and 1,800 local staff fighting the virus at projects in West Africa, 10 of whom are Canadian. At least one is based in Kailahun, home to a recently expanded 80-bed treatment facility.\n\n\"We are not pulling our people out of Kailahun or anywhere else in West Africa – we are actively sending more people,\" Christina Campbell, a press officer for MSF Canada, said in an e-mail. \"We expect to send at",

      "After getting sued by the ACLU, the City of Beech Grove is taking down two Facebook pages.\n\nThe police and city Facebook pages will go blank by noon Wednesday, after a lawsuit filed last week by the ACLU on behalf of two Beech Grove women who claimed the sites violated their First Amendment rights.\n\nThe women say the city removed their social media comments, then blocked them. A city attorney says it happened when people posted comments not related to crime. In some cases, the comments were seen as inflammatory and not true.\n\n\"We find there are some fascinating constitutional issues we could litigate in this case, but can't justify the cost to the taxpayers, so we're going to try to get this resolved,\" said Beech Grove City Attorney Craig Wiley.\n\nWiley says the city will try to reach a settlement with the ACLU that would include a new city social media policy. But for now, the pages will come down.\n\nThe police department says its legal counsel advised them to remove the page, but went on to say, \"Unfortunately we will be losing our most effective tool for soliciting tips on unsolved cases. We still want to encourage people who have tips on crimes that have occurred to call our crime tips line at 317-782-4950.\"\n\n\"The police solved a lot of crime. They've got a lot of tips and now we've got to take it down, so that's the casualty in this,\" Wiley said.\n\nThe police page includes crime updates and photos of wanted persons.\n\nThe plaintiffs in the case were Kymberly Quick and Deborah Mays-Miller. Both women are members of Beech Grove Crime Watch. The ACLU says their posts \"posed valid questions about the city's crime reporting and police action and inaction related to the removal of political yard signs.\"\n\n\"When a government entity opens up a space for public comment, it cannot regulate those comments based upon someone's viewpoint,\" said Jan Mensz, ACLU of Indiana staff attorney. \"By giving itself unbridled discretion to determine what comments it deems acceptable, the City of Beech Grove has put all public speech on its social media sites at risk of further censorship.\"\n\nOne of the women is in a relationship with a former candidate for mayor.\n\n\"The government doesn't have a right to single out individuals,\" said Quick. \"There was nothing wrong with my comments at all and other comments have been allowed to remain that are racial and violent.\"\n\nTuesday afternoon, some of the comments to which Quick was referring were still posted on the department's Facebook page. Under the video of a purse snatching, one reader posted the \"N-word\" and another wrote \"shoot his (expletive).\"\n\nSome residents still value the page.\n\n\"I just took a DVD from my cameras, took it to the police and they put it on the Facebook site. I guess hit helped a little bit,\" said Bob Cagg.\n\n\"I mean, if it's helping the city, I think it should stay up,\" said resident Brenda Murphy. \"Because there's crime going on that's unusual for here.\"\n\nTuesday evening, the women behind the lawsuit said they went to the city website and noticed they were no longer blocked.

      "Virtues:\n\nEvery of your virtues grants retaliation for 3 seconds, thanks to the trait Virtue of Retribution.\n\nFurthermore with the trait Inspired Virtue, every virtue gives you another boon. F1: Might(5s), F2: Regeneration(5s), F3: Protection(5s)\n\nAs these skills are instant, I use them whenever a foe tries to burst me, because of the retaliation it gives me.\n\nF1 Virtue of Justice: Use this in combination with your burst, because due to the trait Fiery Wrath you deal 10% more damage while your foe is burning.\n\nF2 Virtue of Resolve: Not much to say about this skill other than what I already mentioned above: try to use your virtues to counter the burst of your foes.\n\nF3 Virtue of Courage: When you have an eye for your foe and know his skill animation, you can block powerful spells with this skill, it is hard though.\n\nGreatsword:\n\nSkill 1 Strike, Vengeful Strike, Wrathful Strike: The autohit is okay, because you can hit multiple foes and you get 5 seconds of might after the third strike, which isn't THAT much, but you take what you get.\n\nSkill 2 Whirling Wrath: This skill is a very important damage dealing component. It's very powerful if you use it right. Note: Don't use it when your enemy has retaliation, or you'll eat about 2k yourself. Also you pretty much gotta be in melee range to hit your enemy with the projectiles.\n\nSkill 3 Leap of Faith: Nice gap closer with blind when you successfully hit your foe (but no might, think it is bugged here) Note: You won't be able to jump to your foe when you are immobilized. If you are slowed, your leap will be much smaller.\n\nSkill 4 Symbol Wrath: This symbol gives you and your allies retaliation every second for 5 seconds. In my traits I also skilled, that symbols are larger and that you and your allies are healed every tick. This skill is very effective in team fights on a capture point.\n\nSkill 5 Binding Blade: A little damage, has a combo finisher and nice CC. With this skill you can pull your foes to you and you and your teammates can spike them down quickly.\n\nMace + Shield:\n\nSkill 1 True Strike, Pure Strike, Faithful Strike: You gotta try and hit the third strike for the heal. It's great and the damage is nice too.\n\nSkill 2 Symbol of Faith: Another symbol. This one gives you Regeneration in addition to the trait, which heals you and your allies.\n\nSkill 3 Protector's Strike: With this skill you can block the next attack for you or an ally. If you're not hit, you gain protection for 3 seconds.\n\nSkill 4 Shield of Judgement: Super effective in team fights! Damage isn't great at all, but the purpose of this skill is to support your allies.\n\nSkill 5 Shield of Absorption: Great for knocking foes off a capture point or kicking them away when reviving an ally.\n\nUtilities:\n\nSkill 6 Signet of Resolve: Usually I would say that every Guardian should have Shelter as a healing skill, but I like to have the little extra condition remove and massive heal.\n\nSkill 7 Sanctuary: You need a little break? Wanna cast your elite? Stomp an enemy or revive an ally? You can use this skill in so many ways, the only downside is the long cooldown, but I'm okay with that.\n\nSkill 8 Stand Your Ground: This is a must have skill for most of the Guardian builds in my opinion. Stability for you and your allies + retaliation + it's stun breaker = OP! This skill can also be used in so many ways. I love to combine this skill with the 5th skill in my elite form, more on that later.\n\nSkill 9 Contemplation of Purity: Another stun breaker and a great condition remover.

      "WASHINGTON, DC — US President Barack Obama today expressed his excitement to officially begin his second job as the President of the Republic of Indonesia on October 20th, after months successfully campaigning across the Southeast Asian country using the more localised pseudonym of 'Joko Widodo', and keeping it secret from his family.\n\nAccompanied by his wife and speaking from the White House lawn to reporters this morning, President Obama said that he was really glad to be finally able to come clean about his additional occupation, and said he 'feels no shame about holding two jobs' to supplement his income.\n\n\"A lot of people do part-time jobs or even hold two jobs to support their families, so I don't see why I can't do the same,\" said the Commander-in-Chief. \"Times are getting harder for everyone, what with rising cost of living and staggering inflation these days, a typical wage-earner like myself cannot just depend on income from one source. One salary just ain't enough, it's just reality of living in an urban area.\n\n\"A recent survey has found that Washington, DC is THE most expensive city to live in. Not just in America, mind you, but the most expensive in the world. And I've got two growing up kids. A big house to pay for every month, with its own staff to maintain. A few cars with drivers and security detail, and not to mention a plane, plus a couple of helicopters. For a government servant like me, it can be pretty tough,\" he added, as First Lady Michelle put her hand on his shoulder.\n\nObama's second job will see him succeeding Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono after defeating Prabowo Subianto at the polls in a tight race, receiving 53% of the votes.\n\n\"Campaigning across Indonesia was quite a challenge,\" recalled Obama, who in fact spent a few years during childhood growing up in Indonesia. \"I had to dig deep into my childhood memories running around my auntie's place in east Jakarta. All those great times picking mangosteens, jumping into streams, fishing. Fortunately I still remember some Bahasa phrases like 'Aku Cinta Kamu' and 'Trima Kasih.' I had to connect with the voters; be one of them. I had to sneak out of meetings to make video calls, record speeches. I had to fake business trips to that region so that no one could smell what I was doing. And I had to do this while not getting recognised by my team — and my wife!\" adding that traditional headgears and batik, as well as a different hairdo and makeup definitely helped.\n\nThe president said that despite the demands of the jobs, he believes he would be able to split his time between the two nations.\n\n\"Both government systems are pretty well-oiled, so I don't see any problem presiding over both administrations,\" he said confidently. \"In fact, I'm an advocate for flexible working arrangements, and I've invested quite heavily in getting myself wired in. The Oval Office is really just a symbol of my US presidency, but the fact of the matter is, with mobile technology, social media tools and cloud computing, I can work from virtually anywhere. Hey there, Big J!\" said Obama as he demonstrated Skyping with his future (Indonesian) vice-president Jusuf Kalla all the way in Jakarta.\n\n\"The really good thing about being the leader of these two nations is that they're on opposite sides of the world,\" said Obama. \"So I can focus on one country while the other goes to sleep. Pretty convenient, really, there's little chance of me being confused about which government I'm representing at any one time.\n\n\"I'd hate to be in an awkward situation where I'm meeting, say, President Putin, and start talking about sustained development in Jawa Tengah when I should be reprimanding him about Russia's escalating military presence in Ukraine!\" he said in jest, much to the delight of those present.\n\nThe president assured the public in both nations that he would be very careful in utilising the resources given to him as head of government.\n\n\"I'm very clear with my people that Air Force One is only used when I'm wearing my US President hat. That goes with The Beast too. Once I clock in the Indonesian office, I'll only use Jakarta-issued facilities and even staff. I'm all about transparency and accountability.\"\n\nMichelle Obama added that while she was initially surprised by her husband's decision to take on the second job, she's fully supportive and would ensure he gets all the help he can from the rest of the family.\n\n\"I know he's doing it for me and the kids. He's not the type who takes on more things unless he really believes it'd be good for the family,\" she said. \"We've worked out some tight time management",

      "There's not much to say.  There's not much to add. \nRest in Peace, Tanya\nA 43-year-old white woman living in a suburb of Kansas City, Missouri has been viciously executed by two black males.  There ages are but 13 and 14-years-old.  Tanya L. Chamberlain is a name you'll only read here, and perhaps a few more \"unsavory\" sites on the Internet, before her name fades into obscurity.  For even daring to remember her and how she spent her final moments on earth (being stabbed to death by two black juveniles), her family might write to SBPDL and s ay she had black friends and that she wouldn't want her memory to be associated with such \"vile\" thoughts.   Too bad.  She's dead.  She was stabbed to death by two black males, ages 13 and 14.  She's dead.  [ Police: 13, 14 year old boys fatally stabbed Lee's Summit woman , KCTV.com, 11-4-15]: LEE'S SUMMIT, MO (KCTV) - Two teenagers have been arrested in the brutal stabbing death of a 43-year-old Lee's Summit woman.   This comes after police released surveillance video on Tuesday of the 13- and 14-year-old suspects. Officers received several tips as a result and arrested the two boys Wednesday morning.   Charges were filed Wednesday afternoon in Jackson County Family Court. The two are charged with first-degree murder, armed criminal action and first-degree tampering.   Prosecutors are seeking to have them certified as adults to face felony state charges rather than felony juvenile charges.   The victim has been identified as Tanya L. Chamberlain. Police are saying that Chamberlain had no connection to the two teens.   \"We are just as shocked as the community that something like this would happen in Lee's Summit,\" said Officer Beth Glover of the Lee's Summit Police Department.   The discovery of the victim's body came after Lee's Summit police attempted to stop a vehicle about 1:15 a.m. Sunday. The officer believed the driver was intoxicated. The driver of the vehicle pulled into a parking lot of an apartment complex in the 500 block of Southeast Second Street.  \nThe two black male suspects in Tanya's execution: ages 13 and 14 Two males then fled on foot from the vehicle. The officer engaged in a short foot pursuit before losing sight of both suspects.    As the officer returned to the suspect vehicle, he discovered Chamberlain's body in the passenger seat. After working the case overnight, investigators determined Chamberlain had been murdered.   Glover said authorities initially had thought the suspects were in their late teens after viewing the surveillance video.   \"To actually find out they were 13 and 14 was a shock,\" Glover said.   Those who live in the area are traumatized by the crime.   \"To be here and be so close,\" said Linda Jefferson. \"It is devastating.\"   Officers conducted a search of the surrounding areas using K-9 teams from both the Lee's Summit Police Department as well as the Jackson County Sheriff's Office.   \"Our Investigations Division is confident all involved parties are in custody.   Detectives worked tirelessly around the clock over the last several days and they sincerely hope their efforts will help bring some resolution to Tanya Chamberlain's family,\" the police department posted on their Facebook page.   \"The Lee's Summit Police Department would like to thank the numerous community members who provided information that led to the quick apprehension of both suspects.\" \"To actually find out they were 13 and 14 was a shock,\" Glover said.  As presently constituted, the United States of America is tragically irredeemable. Tanya L. Chamberlain, white female, was executed by two black males. Two juvenile black males. And not a world of this execution will ever play on the network news or even the Fox New Channel.

Yet.\n\nBy Antonis Stroggylakis/ info@eurohoops.net\n\nI can't be sure of Bogdan Bogdanovic's musical tastes and he doesn't really strike me as a punk rock fan, but if there's one song currently humming in his mind these weeks, then that's probably \"Should I stay or should I Go\" by The Clash.\n\nOn one hand, he's been receiving tons of adoration by Fenerbahce fans that ask him to stay in their favorite team and become a part of the legacy that the franchise wants to build after winning the first EuroLeague title in the history of the club in May. There's the whole megillah: Hashtags (#StaywithUsBogdan f.e.) and countless messages in every social media platform. Also a video has emerged and currently going insanely viral where even fans of other teams (Besiktas, Galatasaray) appear and say that they want him to remain in Istanbul.\n\nThis is pretty much crazy and completely unheard of, since Galatasaray is the arch-rival of Fenerbahce and there are no sweet feelings with Besiktas fans either.\n\nIt will surely need more than this love storm by fans to silence the sweet, seducing sirens' song of the NBA buzzing around his ears. And don't forget that a call that comes from no other than Vlade Divac, the Sacramento Kings GM, carries a special gravity for a Serbian player.\n\nThe truth is that all signs and odds point towards him donning the Kings jersey in the upcoming season. The 24-year-old player has won everything there is to win in Europe, shined like the brightest star on several occasions and crucial matches, has been an ultra decisive factor for his team reaching its goals and there aren't any challenges left for him here.\n\nStill, he says he remains undecided.\n\nBogdanovic is currently in his hometown of Belgrade where the\"Bogdan Bogdanovic Basketball Camp\" is going to be held on 26 and 27 of June . While speaking in a press-conference ahead of the opening he was, naturally, asked whether the foreseeable future will find him in this continent or on the other side of the Atlantic ocean.\n\n\"When I went to Fenerbahce I went with hopes that one day I would be in the NBA. I haven't decided yet,\" the Serbian guard said. \"Maybe I'll leave in one year. Maybe in five. It depends on many factors. I want to leave for the NBA when the moment is the most beautiful. Like when I left Partizan\".\n\nThese latter words are another indicator that he's leaning towards the NBA. This season has been the best in the history of Fenerbahce and his personal career so far and it ended with him winning MVP in the Turkish League finals after leading his squad to a sweep over Besiktas.\n\nIt can't get \"more beautiful\" than that.\n\n\"They (Sacramento Kings) want me to come. I want to but I haven't decided yet. I will negotiate after July 1st. I gave my 300% to Fener. I have nothing to regret if I go to the NBA,\" he added.\n\nBogdanovic finished the season averaging 14.6 points, 3.8 rebounds and 3.6 assists in EuroLeague. He was named in the All-First team of the competition, despite missing most of the first leg of the regular season due to an ankle injury.",
      "Points to ponder after the Canucks scored a convincing 4-1 win over the Flames on Friday to even the Western Conference quarterfinal series 1-1, on a wild night where Eddie Lack scored more love from the faithful, Deryk Engelland scored the wrong kind of hat trick and Bo Horvat took his dad's text to heart:\n\nROLLIE NOT ROLLING OVER IN LAUGHTER: When Rollie Melanson was asked to respond to Jacob Markstrom dropping the gloves Wednesday when the stopper slugged it out with his crease rival during the Utica Comets' AHL playoff opener, the goalie coach shook his head and said: \"We don't teach that — what if he broke his hand?\"\n\nCan't imagine what he was thinking Friday when Eddie Lack responded to Brandon Bollig accidentally on purpose landing on top of him after a wild crease scramble in the second period, and the Canucks stopper responding with a series of blocker punches. And when Lack was bumped by Michael Ferland in the third period after the starter left the crease on a delayed penalty — and then stared down the winger — he heard from Willie Desjardins.\n\n\"For me, I was just trying to keep my cool,\" recalled Lack. \"I saw Willie yelling at me to try and get me away. It was time to skate to the bench for sure.\"\n\nAnd what would Melanson think of all this?\n\n\"I think he's kind of nervous up in the stands,\" chuckled Lack. \"It's kind of the way it's been going, I've been giving him heart attacks for five years now and I'm just going to keep it going.\"\n\nThe Lack laugh track is pretty funny stuff. What the Flames are finding out is there's nothing funny about trying to beat him. Kris Russell did manage to wire a power-play point shot Friday to make it 3-1 in the third period. Lack's biggest problem was keeping his head in the game after facing just three shots in the first period. Then Bollig woke him up.\n\n\"I was telling (Jannik) Hansen after the first that I was very nervous because I was just standing there and then it got going in the second and after that I felt normal,\" added Lack. \"And Bollig, it actually got me going a bit to be honest — I just felt good after that. Me and Bollig have been going at it for years — even in the minors — and he's a tough player who plays hard. He's around my net and there are going to be bumps and it's just part of the game. Same thing with Ferland? That was quite the stare.\n\n\"I'm sure he's not afraid of me, but I wanted to mark my territory at least,\" reasoned Lack.\n\nLack made his mark when it mattered most. A right pad save off Johnny Gaudreau early in the third period kept the Flames from gaining any momentum while trailing 3-0. And aside from Daniel Sedin, Chris Higgins, Ronalds Kenins and Radim Vrbata (empty net) doing the scoring, it was a monster night for Alex Edler. He had eight shot attempts, four hits and a shot block in 24:45 of ice time. He hit Sam Bennett so hard on the sideboards in the second period that the rookie didn't return until the third.\n\nALL EYES ARE ON ENGELLAND: Everybody seemed to have a post-game theory on what additional discipline Flames defenceman Deryk Engelland could face after receiving a triple game misconduct as part of his penalty package when a crazy melee erupted with 1:17 remaining, resulting in 132 penalty minutes among nine players. There's no automatic suspension for the three games misconduct but an instigator penalty in the final five minutes of a game may warrant a suspension. Or not.\n\nWhile Brad Richardson and Matt Stajan were involved in one bout, what started with Engelland and Derek Dorsett going at it dove-tailed into Dorsett being on his back and Engelland continuing to punch, Dan Hamhuis coming in as the third man in defence of his teammate, and things then heated up again between Engelland and Dorsett. Here's Dorsett's take:\n\n\"We've had a little history in the past, and when things get heated up you have to go with the situation. The only reason it was a 2-on-1, I was on my back and he kept punching and Hammer came over and grabbed him off. He (Engelland) was still trying to fight after we got him off and the ref was telling us to tie him up and he wasn't quitting. We just tied him up and everything kind of died down, and we were both standing there and kind of looked at each other and kind of came together again.\"\n\nHere's what Hamhuis had to",

      "The system, dubbed Vibrative, uses the three-dimensional accelerometer in Apple's smartphone to measure the characteristics of each tap on the table, such as the strength and frequency of the vibrations it causes, and compares them to \"training data\" to work out its approximate location.\n\nThe location is converted into a key press on the \"virtual keyboard\". Currently, the system determines the intended key correctly about 80 per cent of the time, so the data is also fed into an auto correct dictionary to ensure the words are spelled correctly.\n\n\"The signals I'm collecting are very weak,\" said Florian Kraeutli, a computing student at Goldsmiths, who created the system as part of his work on user interfaces.\n\n\"At the moment it's more of a proof of concept but if you made the accelerometer more sensitive you could improve the accuracy quite easily.\"\n\nHe suggested that accelerometers in smartphones may be set to be less sensitive than they are capable of to conserve battery power. The system is currently more accurate on smaller surfaces, which vibrate more with each tap.\n\nThe system needs to learn the vibration patterns for each surface on which it is used, but does not necessarily need to be taught the patten for each key individually.\n\n\"Ideally you would train each key, but you can do just a couple,\" said Mr Kraeutli.\n\nIn a video demonstrating the technology, Mr Kraeutli uses a \"keyboard\" printed on an ordinary piece of paper to train Vibrative and then type a text message. He also shows the paper is unnecessary for a touch typist, once the system is trained, by typing directly onto the wooden table beneath.\n\nVibrative Virtual Keyboard from Florian Kräutli on Vimeo.\n\nMr Kraeutli used a \"jailbroken\" iPhone 4 to create the software, as Apple normally does not allow apps to change the way the iOS keyboard works. Android does not have similar restrictions, and downloadable \"smart\" keyboard apps such as SwiftKey, which has advanced predictive technology, have blossomed.\n\nVibrative could easily be converted for other smartphones, said Mr Kraeutli.",
      "This spring, text messages got a lot more private. In April, the world's most popular messaging service, WhatsApp, announced it would use end-to-end encryption by default for all users, making it virtually impossible for anyone to intercept private WhatsApp conversations, even if they work at Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, or at the world's most powerful electronic spying agency, the NSA. Then in May, tech giant Google announced a brand new messaging app called Allo that also supports end-to-end encryption.\n\nMaking the news even better from a privacy standpoint is that both WhatsApp and Allo use a widely respected secure-messaging protocol from Open Whisper Systems, the San Francisco-based maker of the messaging app Signal.\n\nTo recap, there are now at least three different instant-message services that implement robust encryption: WhatsApp, Signal, and Allo. How is someone who cares about their privacy and security to choose between them?\n\nIn this article, I'm going to compare WhatsApp, Signal, and Allo from a privacy perspective.\n\nWhile all three apps use the same secure-messaging protocol, they differ on exactly what information is encrypted, what metadata is collected, and what, precisely, is stored in the cloud — and therefore available, in theory at least, to government snoops and wily hackers.\n\nIn the end, I'm going to advocate you use Signal whenever you can — which actually may not end up being as often as you would like.\n\nWhat's up, WhatsApp?\n\nWith more than 1 billion users, WhatsApp is the world's most popular messaging app. Which is why it was huge news among encryption advocates when the company a year and a half ago announced a partnership with Open Whisper Systems to integrate the Signal protocol into its product. The rollout was gradual, starting only on the Android version of WhatsApp and only for one-on-one text communication, but by this past April, WhatsApp was able to announce it was using the Signal protocol to encrypt all messages, including multimedia messages and group chats, for all users, including those on iOS, by default.\n\nSo if a government demands the content of WhatsApp messages, as in a recent case in Brazil, WhatsApp can't hand it over — the messages are encrypted and WhatsApp does not have the key.\n\nBut it's important to keep in mind that, even with the Signal protocol in place, WhatsApp's servers can still see messages that users send through the service. They can't see what's inside the messages, but they can see who is sending a message to whom and when. And according to the WhatsApp privacy policy, the company reserves the right to record this information, otherwise known as message metadata, and give it to governments:\n\nWhatsApp may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which WhatsApp is legally compelled to collect.\n\nA WhatsApp spokesperson told the Committee to Protect Journalists, \"WhatsApp does not maintain transaction logs in the normal course of providing its service.\" However, the company makes no promises and could easily record and hand over metadata in response to a government request without violating its own policy.\n\nWhen you first set up WhatsApp, you're encouraged, but not required, to share your phone's contact list with the app. This helps the WhatsApp service connect you with other users quickly and easily. A WhatsApp spokesperson confirmed to me that the company retains contact list data, which means that WhatsApp could also hand over your contact list in response to a government request.\n\nFinally, online backups are a gaping hole in the security of WhatsApp messages. End-to-end encryption only refers to how messages are encrypted when they're sent over the internet, not while they're stored on your phone. Once messages are on your phone, they rely on your phone's built-in encryption to keep them safe (which is why it's important to use a strong passcode). If you choose to back up your phone to the cloud — such as to your Google account if you're an Android user or your iCloud account if you're an iPhone user — then you're handing the content of your messages to your backup service provider.\n\nBy default, WhatsApp stores its messages in a way that allows them to be backed up to the cloud by iOS or Android. WhatsApp does let you remove your chats from these cloud backups if you go out of your way to do so, which I recommend you do, if you use WhatsApp to discuss anything sensitive.\n\nAllo, World",
      "Back when Intel first began pushing ultrabooks I noticed a trend — the overwhelming majority of systems deployed under the ultrabook moniker relied exclusively on Intel's integrated graphics. This trend has accelerated through the laptop world over the past two years. If you want to buy a boutique laptop or a gaming system for over a thousand dollars there are still plenty of options for a discrete mobile GPU, but what if you don't have that kind of money to spend?\n\nFrom the beginning, it's been clear that on-die graphics would cannibalize the low end of the GPU market in both mobile and desktop. What is surprising, however, is just how difficult it's become to find a discrete GPU — even as an option. When that option exits, it's almost always chained to the CPU — selecting a faster graphics card forces you into a faster CPU, which occasionally forces you into a higher-resolution monitor as well.\n\nIt's impossible to accurately survey the entire mobile market in a single post, but with the Back to School period almost upon us, we're going to walk through the options at various vendors. Obviously boutique builders are still selling discrete cards, but our goal is to stick with the more mainstream manufacturers and (hopefully) take advantage of their economies of scale.\n\nAMD and Intel: Two entirely different value propositions\n\nIn desktops, the AMD vs. Intel comparison is simple and straightforward: AMD's Kaveri and Richland APUs are priced to compete against Intel's Pentium, Celeron, and a few Core i3 products. As we discussed earlier this year, component pricing decisions have made it more difficult for AMD to compete with Intel in the budget desktop gaming market.\n\nIn laptops, the situation is markedly different. Below $600, Intel laptops with discrete GPUs are either nonexistent or use the very bottom of Nvidia or AMD's product stacks — solutions so weak, in other words, that Intel's own integrated chip might actually be an improvement, or at least on equal footing.\n\nHP's AMD-equipped systems, in contrast, start fielding discrete GPUs below the $600 mark. The 17-inch HP Pavilion 17z Touch is based on the A8-6410 (Beema) with a maximum turbo clock of 2.4GHz and a modest R7 M260 (384 GPU cores) for $569. There's also a Pavilion 15z with an A10-5745M and the same R7 M260 at $569.\n\nAMD has wedged itself nicely into the $550-$650 segment, though HP appears to be one of the only companies that's capitalized on it. HP is virtually the only major OEM with an Intel CPU/Nvidia GPU combination for under $800, and the Intel rigs don't start until $649, with the relatively anemic GeForce 830M. If you're willing to sacrifice touch, you can buy an Intel/Nvidia system for $660.\n\nPerformance comparisons between AMD and Intel in mobile gaming show a decisive advantage for Chipzilla when using high-end GPUs, but remember — we're talking about far more modest graphics cards, where AMD's weaker CPU performance is less likely to be a major problem.\n\nNext page: Which OEMs still ship discrete GPUs?",
      "The Collapse of the Soviet Union and Ronald Reagan\n\nSeveral WAISers disagreed with Christopher Jones, who denied Reagan's role in the collapse of the Soviet Union. Harry Papasotiriou writes: \"The Soviet Union certainly collapsed of its own weight, but Reagan helped speed up the process. The following paragraphs are from a forthcoming book that I am co-authoring.\n\nReagan's conviction that the Soviet Union was both a dangerous military power and a collapsing economic system derived not from any deep knowledge of the Soviet Union. Yet he proved to be the proverbial right man in the right place at the right time. By whatever means he arrived at his views regarding the Soviet Union, he drew from them policy directions that were devastatingly effective in undermining the rotten Soviet edifice. Because of the high oil prices of the 1970s the Soviet leadership avoided serious economic reforms, such as those that saved Deng Xiaoping's China. Instead, it relied on oil revenues as a means of keeping its decrepit economy going. By the early 1980s the Soviet Union was becoming a hollow shell, with an unreformed and increasingly backward industrial base producing outmoded pre-computer armaments. Thus it was highly vulnerable to the pressures that the Reagan administration was planning.<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = \"urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office\" />\n\nFrom the outset, Reagan moved against détente and beyond containment, substituting the objective of encouraging \"long-term political and military changes within the Soviet empire that will facilitate a more secure and peaceful world order\", according to an early 1981 Pentagon defense guide. Harvard's Richard Pipes, who joined the National Security Council, advocated a new aggressive policy by which \"the United States takes the long-term strategic offensive. This approach therefore contrasts with the essentially reactive and defensive strategy of containment\". Pipes's report was endorsed in a 1982 National Security Decision Directive that formulated the policy objective of promoting \"the process of change in the Soviet Union towards a more pluralistic political and economic system\". [The quotes from Peter Schweizer, Reagan's War.]\n\nA central instrument for putting pressure on the Soviet Union was Reagan's massive defense build-up, which raised defense spending from $134 billion in 1980 to $253 billion in 1989. This raised American defense spending to 7 percent of GDP, dramatically increasing the federal deficit. Yet in its efforts to keep up with the American defense build-up, the Soviet Union was compelled in the first half of the 1980s to raise the share of its defense spending from 22 percent to 27 percent of GDP, while it froze the production of civilian goods at 1980 levels.\n\nReagan's most controversial defense initiative was SDI, the visionary project to create an anti-missile defense system that would remove the nuclear sword of Damocles from America's homeland. Experts still disagree about the long-term feasibility of missile defense, some comparing it in substance to the Hollywood sci-fi blockbuster Star Wars. But the SDI's main effect was to demonstrate U. S. technological superiority over the Soviet Union and its ability to expand the arms race into space. This helped convince the Soviet leadership under Gorbachev to throw in the towel and bid for a de-escalation of the arms race.\n\nParticularly effective, though with unintended long-term side effects, was the Reagan administration's support for the mujahideen (holy warriors) that were fighting against the Soviet forces in Afghanistan. Reagan was determined to make Afghanistan the Soviet Vietnam. Therefore in 1986 he decided to provide the mujahideen with portable surface-to-air Stinger missiles, which proved devastatingly effective in increasing Soviet air losses (particularly helicopters). The war in Afghanistan cost the United States about $1 billion per annum in aid to the mujahideen; it cost the Soviet Union eight times as much, helping bankrupt its economy.\n\nApart from his defense policies, Reagan also weakened the Soviet Union through economic moves. His supporters' claims that he brought about the fall of the Soviet Union are somewhat weakened by the fact that he ended Carter's grain embargo, which had produced alarming food shortages in the Soviet Union. On the other hand Reagan was able to reduce the flow of Western technology to the Soviet Union, as well to limit Soviet natural gas exports to Western Europe. One of the most effective ways in which his economic policies weakened the Soviet Union was by helping bring about a drastic fall in the price of oil in the 1980s, thereby denying the Soviet Union large inflows of hard currency\".",

      "Missouri brother and sister get 15 years each for growing 20 marijuana plants after judge gave them harshest possible sentence\n\n\nNatalie, 36, and David, 34, DePriest had 12 mature plants and eight seedlings\n\nThey were accused of running a large-scale drug-dealing operation\n\nThey denied charges but hired a marijuana-activist attorney to fight the case\n\n\nProsecutor claims they turned down deal allowing them to serve 120 days\n\n\nA brother and sister who were caught with 12 marijuana plants and eight seedlings inside their home have been jailed for a total of 30 years.\n\nNatalie and David DePriest received the harshest sentence which can be given for marijuana growing in the state of Missouri, where the maximum punishment for manslaughter is also 15 years.\n\n\nIn 2011, a maintenance man entered the DePriests' home in the city of Farmington while they were out in order to fit a fire extinguisher and discovered what he thought was a pipe bomb on the kitchen counter.\n\nJailed: Natalie, 36, and David, 34, DePriest were sentenced to 15 years in prison after police discovered 20 marijuana plants in their Missouri home\n\n\nHe took pictures of the device with his phone before informing the police who went round to conduct a search.\n\nOfficers discovered the plants inside a bedroom closet along with three pounds of dried marijuana, a rifle which was a quarter inch shorter than the legal limit, two legally-held pistols and two bulletproof vests.\n\nThey also found ledgers understood to contain sales records totaling up to $8,000 a month. The 'pipe bomb' turned out to be harmless.\n\nThe siblings were accused of running a large drug-selling operation. David, 34, had one prior misdemeanor drug charge dating from from 1999 while Natalie, 36, had been charged with writing bad checks while she was out on bail.\n\n\nSpeaking from inside prison to the Huffington Post, Natalie, a former rep for Camel cigarettes, denied ever having sold any of the marijuana, insisting it was for personal use.\n\nShe said: 'If we had thousands of dollars in pot sales, it must be buried somewhere. Because I've never seen it.'\n\n\nThe pair hired attorney Dan Viets - one of Missouri's leading marijuana reform activists and head of the state's National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) committee.\n\nInitially they tried to fight the prosecution arguing that the police should not have entered their home without giving them notice or obtaining a warrant, but the motion was denied.\n\nHaving spent all their money they decided to plead guilty in the hope of receiving a more lenient sentence.\n\nSo in November last year they admitted growing more than 5 grams of marijuana and intending to distribute it. David also pleaded guilty to owning an illegal rifle.\n\nThe siblings denied running a large-scale drug dealing operation and insisted the marijuana was purely for personal use\n\nHowever St. Francois County Prosecuting Attorney Jerrod Mahurin, had warned them that if they took their case to court, he would request the maximum sentences allowed.\n\nMr Mahurin claimed he had offered the DePriests' attorney Dan Viets a deal under which they woulf serve just 120 days in jail, before being released on three years of probation, but that he refused.\n\nHe told the Riverfront Times: 'There were multiple offers made that would have had them released in 120 days.\n\n'But they felt that marijuana should not be illegal and will be legal soon, so they refused. I don't know if it will ever be legal in Missouri, but in this case I have to follow the law.'\n\nCircuit Court Judge Kenneth Pratte sentenced them to 15 years on the cultivation charge and a further 15 years for intending to distribute, with the sentences to run concourrently.\n\nDavid, an aspiring gunsmith, was handed an additional seven years for owning the illegal rifle.\n\nSpeaking at the hearing Judge Pratte said: 'The law is the law,' addding that he didn't 'care one bit' that most Americans believe pot should be legalized.",

Stewart asked O'Reilly about his experience growing up in Levittown, New York, which at the time was segregated, to show how African Americans were unable to access the middle class experience.

      "ADVERTISEMENT\n\nFrom the moment he stepped onstage at the 2004 Democratic convention, Barack Obama asked his audience to see things in a slightly more complex way, to set aside the categories into which they thought the political world slotted people and ideas. He was both black and white, Kenya and Kansas, arguing that \"We worship an awesome God in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. We coach little league in the blue states and, yes, we've got some gay friends in the red states.\" In the time since, Obama has shown himself to have an appreciation for ambiguity and uncertainty that is uncommonly rare among politicians. In eight years of his presidency, he has tried again and again to convince Americans to share that appreciation. But he has largely failed.\n\nIt's not that Obama was ever unable to stick to a simple message — \"Yes We Can\" was pretty simple — or that he shied away from making clear moral assertions of right and wrong. But as his time in office comes to an end, he's becoming more publicly reflective, and one of the themes running through his statements is the idea of values and goals in conflict, of irreducible complexity, of a government that has to move forward even as it knows that some problems can be ameliorated but not completely solved.\n\nHe hasn't been shy lately in his disdain for those who fail to grasp the complexity of the things that government in general, and the president in particular, has to deal with. In June, he conveyed to Bloomberg Businessweek his feeling about corporate CEOs who tell him confidently how he ought to be doing his job:\n\nI sometimes have to stop them and say, \"All right. One, I appreciate your advice. But imagine a situation in which half your board and management were actively trying to get rid of you and prevent you from accomplishing anything. And you had two million employees, and you couldn't fire a large portion of them. And your competitors weren't simply promoting their own products, but were continually saying how your products were the worst that were ever invented and will cause a civilizational crisis. If you pull that all together, then you've got about half of what I'm dealing with on a daily basis.\"\n\nObama obviously encounters no small number of business executives who think that politics is no more complicated than selling products and services. But politics is just about the most complicated human endeavor there is, which is a big part of why it's so interesting. Yet everyone seems to think that it demands nothing more than whatever enterprise they're successful in; if I can get people to pay $30 for a printer cartridge, surely I can run the United States government! Obama made a similar point last week at an event on technological innovation in Pittsburgh, even chiding Silicon Valley, where he has gotten tremendous support (and money), by making a related point about government's obligations:\n\nGovernment will never run the way Silicon Valley runs because, by definition, democracy is messy. This is a big, diverse country with a lot of interests and a lot of disparate points of view. And part of government's job, by the way, is dealing with problems that nobody else wants to deal with. So sometimes I talk to CEOs, they come in and they start telling me about leadership, and here's how we do things. And I say, \"well, if all I was doing was making a widget or producing an app, and I didn't have to worry about whether poor people could afford the widget, or I didn't have to worry about whether the app had some unintended consequences — setting aside my Syria and Yemen portfolio — then I think those suggestions are terrific.\" That's not, by the way, to say that there aren't huge efficiencies and improvements that have to be made. But the reason I say this is sometimes we get, I think, in the scientific community, the tech community, the entrepreneurial community, the sense of we just have to blow up the system, or create this parallel society and culture because government is inherently wrecked. No, it's not inherently wrecked; it's just government has to care for, for example, veterans who come home. That's not on your balance sheet, that's on our collective balance sheet, because we have a sacred duty to take care of those veterans. And that's hard and it's messy, and we're building up legacy systems that we can't just blow up.\n\nThose broad obligations make the calculations very different for government, even as so many people insist that it ought to \"run like a business.\" For instance, if the Postal Service were a business, it wouldn't bother delivering mail to far-flung rural addresses, because there's no profit to be had when you have to travel so far for each delivery. Indeed, if you send a package to many addresses via FedEx or UPS, those companies will literally take your package to the post office and mail it, because that's a lot more efficient and profitable than",

      "The 'underwater cathedral' at the edge of the Red Sea is arguably the most perilous diving spot in the world – even for experts such as Dublin-born Stephen Keenan. What lies behind its fearsome reputation?\n\nIn the bars and cafes of Dahab this summer, one recurring observation has been made among the diving fraternity, a core constituency in this Egyptian coastal resort. \"If it could happen to Steve, it could happen to anyone.\"\n\nLast month, Stephen Keenan, aged 39 and from Dublin, drowned while overseeing a dive by the freediving world record holder Alessia Zecchini. While attempting to cross \"the arch\" of the Red Sea's notorious Blue Hole using only a single breath, the 25-year-old Italian became disoriented. Keenan rushed to her aid and guided her to the surface. She made it out unharmed but he blacked out and was found floating face down some distance away.\n\nAs a safety diver, Keenan was one of the best in the business. His death has cast a shadow over the summer and provided a stark reminder of the dangers involved in negotiating probably the most dangerous diving spot in the world\n\nThe Blue Hole is a 120-metre-deep sinkhole, five miles north of Dahab. Its nickname is the \"divers' cemetery\". Yet thousands continue to flock here each year, unperturbed by the increasing number of plaques that hang on the cliff opposite to mark those who never returned.\n\nWith no public record, it's hard to say how many people have lost their lives. Divers in Dahab suggest as many as 200 in recent years. One man who doesn't venture to guess is 53-year-old Tarek Omar. A technical diver from Dahab, Omar began exploring the Blue Hole in 1992, fascinated by tales of a curse laid upon it when an unwilling party to an arranged marriage drowned herself there. Omar rose to fame in 1997 when he retrieved the bodies of Conor O'Regan and Martin Gara. \"They were the first bodies recovered from the Blue Hole.\" Since then, he says he has pulled more than 20 bodies out of the water, earning himself the grim moniker \"the bone collector\".\n\nIn recent years, as technical diving (a form of scuba that usually involves breathing special gas mixtures) has become more fashionable, Omar has witnessed a rise in the rate of fatalities. Deaths of freedivers such as Keenan are also a constant concern, with the sport growing in popularity since Luc Besson's 1988 film The Big Blue, which brought it to the world's attention.\n\nOthers maintain that as long as divers do their homework and exercise due caution, the Blue Hole's fearsome reputation is undeserved. Instructor Alex Heyes says: \"It just isn't that dangerous.\" Originally from Preston, Heyes, 32, moved to Dahab seven years ago and runs the H2O centre. She has dived the Blue Hole countless times and puts the high number of fatalities down to \"people being idiots\". She maintains that most of the deaths are primarily the result of hubris. \"People do 100 dives and think they know it all,\" she says, \"but they're not prepared for that kind of depth. A bit of knowledge can be a dangerous thing.\"\n\nMany of those who died were attempting to swim under the arch. According to Heyes, this challenge is to scuba divers what Kilimanjaro is to hikers. Below 56 metres, the sea wall stops, revealing a cavernous, 26-metre-long tunnel from the Blue Hole to the open ocean. Those who descend 100 metres are faced with a 50-metre-high opening to the Red Sea. \"It's beautiful,\" says Heyes. \"There's nothing else like it. It's like standing in an underwater cathedral.\"\n\nFloating in the deep: why do freedivers push themselves to the verge of death? Read more\n\nBut it can be disorientating. Divers have reported seeing light emerging from the tunnel and, believing it was the surface, have swum down to it. At this depth, it's possible to succumb to a condition known as nitrogen narcosis, in which breathing gases at high pressure causes mental, and sometimes physical, impairment. According to Dr James Caruso, the chief medical examiner for Denver, Colorado and an avid scuba diver, narcosis is often called the \"martini effect\" where \"as the diver goes deeper, the intoxication increases in a similar fashion to drinking more alcohol\".\n\nMuch like alcohol, it affects everyone differently, but Caruso says, \"no one is immune from the symptoms and if a diver goes deep enough, he or she will lose consciousness\". Add this to oxygen poisoning, where the gas becomes toxic under high pressure, and anyone continuing to breathe at this depth is on borrowed time.\n\nIt's possible to counteract these effects with specialised equipment. Technical divers, such as Omar and Heyes,",

I don't remember how 7up launched this guy as their mascot, and I certainly don't know how it ended up becoming an animated GIF that everyone in the world wanted to include on their homepage… but it happened.\n\nOn the continuum of dancing GIFs, the Spot isn't even particularly good… he's just kicking back and forth in different directions while he pumps his arms up and down. But dammit, I'm STILL just fascinated watching him go.\n\n2 | Under Construction\n\nI've always loved the use of \"Under Construction\" as a lazy man's web design tool. As a medium, any website is eternally under construction. It's not a magazine that has to go to the printer. It's not a sculpture. It's a website.\n\nBut slapping up an animated GIF that declared your website was \"under construction\" wasn't a sign of redundancy, it was a sign of sloth. In 1998, when you said your homepage was under construction, you were basically saying you didn't want to take the time to scan in your photos from the Better Than Ezra concert or convert your resume from WordPerfect into HTML.\n\nAnd the odds were something like 8:7 that you'd never, ever, ever go back into Microsoft Frontpage and do any more construction.\n\n3 | The Grabby Mailbox\n\nUnder construction GIFs always made heavy use of construction work imagery, which was funny to me… since construction on a website is pretty much the opposite degree of labor as construction on, say, a house.\n\nAlong that same line, for some reason, e-mail animated GIFs always made heavy use of regular mail imagery, like envelopes, stamps and mailboxes. My favorite of these… and, in my memory, the most popular… was the old mailbox with a hand coming out to \"grab\" e-mails.\n\nSure made ME want to e-mail the person, I'll tell you that.\n\n4 | The Spinning Earth\n\nTen years ago, many a person took a class where one of the big assignments was to make their own homepage. In college, I ended up in three different classes all of which had that project.\n\nAnd, for some reason, people always gravitated toward using animated GIFs of the Earth spinning. I guess that since, back then, we all still used the figure of speech \"world wide web,\" the logical thought process steered people toward including \"world\" iconography.\n\nNot that anyone from anywhere in the world would really ever stumble onto \"Jeff's Homepage For Comm Studies 201: Communication and the Internet\" where the first line read, \"What's up, world? I'm Jeff. This is my homepage.\"\n\n5 | The Dancing Baby\n\nThis was really one of the first Internet phenomena. And I was swept up in it. How could you NOT fall in love with a super-creepy baby doing hypnotic, undulating dance moves?\n\nEspecially when the person also included the \"ooga chaka\" song on their homepage to serve as the perfect soundtrack to the baby.\n\n6 | The Eternally Spinning Counter\n\nIn the '90s, everyone loved putting counters on their page. What a cool way to show how popular your page is: A counter that looks like an odometer, tallying up each time a person checks your site out!\n\nThe counter begat the eternally spinning counter… a GIF that made it look like your page was so popular that your counter just couldn't stop spinning up.\n\nNaturally, this was nothing more than a thinly veiled slice of overcompensation; you put up a real counter, realized you'd only gotten 32 hits in a month, and then decided to replace the real counter with a fake animated one. That way, you still have your requisite counter… but without the humiliation and stigma of said counter being a billboard of your unpopularity.\n",

      "One thing that has always struck me about LGBTQ+ activism is how little is made of poverty. Lots of things are talked about in the framework of human rights: the autonomy to have sex, the autonomy to be granted access to abortion, the freedom to not be abused but yet poverty is rarely ever spoken about even though it plays a major factor in all of these issues. Poverty is a violation of human rights. All people should have access to a roof over their heads, education and healthcare. Issues of class are also predictably ignored when it comes to bisexuality. Unless it's a fluff piece then you can forget analysis of what bisexual people are experiencing.\n\nYet as far as analysis on sexuality goes, bisexual people are more likely to be in poverty (this is especially true if also trans, disabled, neurodivergent and/or a woman of color). This is a huge factor in why bisexual people are often marginalized and isolated. There are very few events especially for bisexual around the United Kingdom: the major one being BiCon but if you're in poverty how exactly are you supposed to be able to pay for a hotel and travel? BiCon is an absolutely fantastic event but for so many it is the only event and even that is off the cards if one is in poverty.\n\nThis problem is exacerbated for anybody in a rural area. Groups for bisexual people in urban areas are rare, and at least there are often LGBT groups, but bisexual groups in rural areas are practically unheard of. Travel therefore once more becomes an issue, and taking a train into the city may not be possible for many. It seems then that the prerequisite for access to these groups then also depends on class and income (and let's not forget that people of color and disabled people are at greater risk of living in poverty).\n\nPoverty also plays a massive role in mental health. Bisexual people are particularly at risk of experiencing a mental health condition -- from depression, anxiety to substance addiction. They're also at risk of suicidal ideation and self harm. Mental health access is therefore vital, but not only are bisexuals often not recognized as an at risk group by healthcare providers, but mental health services themselves are often inaccessible. The narrow treatment options available do not suit everyone; some cannot take medication and talking therapies work on a limited number of individuals. Seeking treatment can be the toughest battle for those with anxiety due to the amount of phone calls required.\n\nFurthermore, even receiving treatment is somewhat of a lottery due to prolonged waiting times. For those in poverty, tracking down a counselor (and one that has good knowledge with tackling specific issues facing bisexual people) or a private service that would work for them is just not possible due to their charges. The compounding problem of poor NHS coverage and expensive private coverage means that bisexual people who are far more likely to need support or even less likely to be able to receive it.\n\nThere's an isolation that comes with living in poverty that dominates people's lives. It manifests itself in many forms from not being able to talk about the pressures to having every moment focussed upon how to pay the next bill. Bisexuality too is a silenced issue. Too many times bisexual people simply aren't welcome or safe in LGBT spaces and while the labels of 'gay' and 'lesbian' are receiving more support than ever, the only time people reject the need for labels is when the conversation turns to bisexual people. The immediate dismissal of bisexuality demonstrates that bisexual people are simply invisible. They are not recognized within the LGBTQ+ world and at times are treated as unwanted.\n\nThe stats show a bleak picture for any bisexual person in poverty (and clearly there are many). We talk about the loneliness crisis with the elderly (as we should), but what about bisexual people being left behind of all ages? The freedom to love or be (whichever line is being used right now) doesn't fulfil its remit if it ignores a large chunk of those it is supposed to be fighting for, and ignores the issue of poverty.\n\nThe overwhelming rates of poverty are a bisexual issue, and an issue for the wider LGBTQ+ community. The community however, has been inclined over the years to reject all analysis of class and/or poverty. Perhaps this is due to the more prominent presence of banks at Pride and the fact that LGBTQ+ orgs have to scramble around for private donations so any kind of analysis of capitalism is crumbling around us.\n\nWhatever the reason though, it isn't enough to just focus on issues such as same sex marriage which won't offend anyone new. The churches were always going to oppose any kind of legislation giving greater rights to LGBTQ+ people just like they always have and so in a way, the great legislative battle (at least in the media) was never going to isolate anybody within the movement because it was about taking on the same people we always have.\n\nPoverty requires different demands because the LGBTQ+ organizations that dominate are ones which are run by white, cis and middle class people who are use private companies and donors",
      "I hate Intuit, the makers of Quickbooks and Quicken software. The reason is simple: Instead of relying on value to sell their products, they use trickery, deceit, and strongarm tactics.\n\nAny accounting professional who uses Quickbooks in their work knows what I'm going to say without even saying it. Each year, Quickbooks comes out with a new product. This year's edition is cleverly named \"Quickbooks 2009.\"\n\nBut it's not really one product each year. It's three. Yes, there are three different versions of the yearly software, Simple ($99), Pro ($119), and Premier ($399).\n\nAnd in order for two users (such as a client and an accountant) to be able to share their bookkeeping file, they must be using the exact same version. If your client has Simple, and you open their file using Pro, the client won't be able to access that file with Simple anymore. Unless of course one is using Premier… then the file will still work if the other user has Pro or Simple.\n\nBut you get the picture. You must use the same \"year\" of software, and also the same version unless you get the really expensive version. And of course, the fees I quoted above are only for a \"one user\" license. If multiple people in your office need to access the file, you'll have to buy more licenses.\n\nMy hate for Intuit and Quickbooks goes deeper, though. This \"version\" scam is bad enough. But it's gotten worse. Each year the software becomes more and more filled with advertising. You can hardly enter a set of transactions without at least one advertisement disrupting things.\n\n\"Need to email invoices? Buy this!\"\n\n\"Need more check printing supplies? We have the answer!\"\n\n\"Ever thoughttt of doing XYZ? Pay us to help!\"\n\nI'm sure the nice Intuit people would tell you they're just trying to help with useful suggestions. We all know they're trying to make a buck and disrupting work in the software which has been paid for. (Hint: Annoying constant advertising is most often reserved for \"free\" software.)\n\nBut it gets better. I recently purchased Quickbooks 2009, and in order to get the lowest price for it, I was required to accept a \"free month\" of their technical support service. Take that \"free\" service out of the cart, and the price of the sofware jumped.\n\nAbout a week after my purchase, I got a welcome kit in the mail. Thanks so much for trying our technical support, blather blather.\n\nI immediately went about canceling the service, as the teeny tiny lettering indicated that my credit card would automatically be billed monthly for the service unless I canceled. Finding out how to cancel wasn't easy. It involved sending a note to customer service asking to cancel, using a particular form on the website.\n\nI did this twice. Yes, I sent two notes to cancel, so that I could be sure that my unwanted subscription was truly canceled.\n\nAnd guess what? My credit card was just charged for the service. Oopsie! We never received your request to cancel!\n\nI always find it interesting that the purchases of software and services never seem to get lost. But the cancellations… those always magically get lost in cyberspace.\n\nSo now I will spend time this morning calling customer service in India. Going through several automated and aggravating menus. Verifying all sorts of numbers. Being transferred several times. Quickbooks will not make this easy for me. I should have paid the higher price for the software and refused to deal with this.\n\nLesson learned. Intuit sucks. Quickbooks sucks. How about relying on the quality and desirability of the product to sell it, instead of trickery and deceit? I realize there aren't many options for accounting software anymore. Believe me, if I didn't have to use Quickbooks, I wouldn't. I hate you, Intuit and Quickbooks.",

      "Anorexia is an eating disorder where people starve themselves. Anorexia usually begins in young people around the onset of puberty. Individuals suffering from anorexia have extreme weight loss. Weight loss is usually 15% below the person's normal body weight. People suffering from anorexia are very skinny but are convinced that they are overweight. Weight loss is obtained by many ways. Some of the common techniques used are excessive exercise, intake of laxatives and not eating. Anorexics have an intense fear of becoming fat. Their dieting habits develop from this fear. Anorexia mainly affects adolescent girls. People with anorexia continue to think they are overweight even after they become extremely thin, are very ill or near death. Often they will develop strange eating habits such as refusing to eat in front of other people. Sometimes the individuals will prepare big meals for others while refusing to eat any of it.\nHow do you feel about looking like a sweat band-wearer straight out of the 80s? You're okay with that?

      "The Nemo Blaze is one of the lightest, roomiest full featured tents ever built. At a ludicrous 2 lbs 5 oz, the Blaze offers 30 sq feet of floor space, and a max height of 40 \". Can a tent this light and this spacious be too good to be true?\n\nThe Blaze 2p, as mentioned above weighs just 2 lbs 5 oz. This is achieved by using astoundingly thin materials such as a 7D PeU Nylon ripstop fly, and 20D PeU Nylon Ripstop Floor (both with 1200mm coatings). Combine this with an innovative single pole design that runs from one corner to another with an angled crossbar to create near vertical walls and you've shaved a lot of weight. Furthermore, the rain fly is slightly cut back at the head and foot of the tent, minimizing material usage, while the vestibule weight is minimized by shifting the compartment back, providing gear storage but also through room. The poles are made of the recent favorite 8.7mm DAC Featherlight NFL aluminum. The tent still manages to have two full vestibules and two doors, all for $449.95.\n\nWhat I liked\n\nThe space to weight ratio here is staggering, especially considering the full (mostly) double wall construction. The tent disappears in a backpack, and weighs so little that a solo backpacker can easily carry it without feeling any packer's remorse.\n\nWhile inside, the tent offers more than adequate head and shoulder room for two backpackers to comfortably sit up and move about. The 50″ wide floor is wider than most tents that weigh more, and combined with the 40″ of head room, the Blaze provides unheard of living space per lb. the wide doors allow for easy entry and exit, thanks to the long zippers that open up completely to avoid obstruction of movement.\n\nThe vestibules are just big enough to provide storage of backpacks and boots, while still being able to move through without too much climbing over, assuming you don't mind doing a little gear stacking.\n\nLots of mesh and low walls around the sides of the sleeper produces good air flow, without creating a cold breeze around the head or foot. This allows for a nice cooling effect in hot weather, but also helps knock down chills on areas sensitive to the cold. The mesh provides ample opportunity for star gazing also. The cut back rain fly around the head and foot strategically allows air to flow up and inside the top of the tent, reducing condensation and improving airflow.\n\nThe tent is surprisingly stable despite the single pole frame. The shelter tensions and stakes out in a way that minimizes the impact of wind, and guy out points half way along the vestibules add solid side to side protection. Once fully guyed out(by adding additional lines, more on that later), the tent holds strong without wavering too much in the wind. The only issue comes in the pole free corners. More on that later as well.\n\nThe included tent stakes are pretty solid, holding great and providing enough durability to be hammered in lightly with a stone.\n\nWhat I didn't like\n\nWith great weight savings comes a few sacrifices. The most notable issue is that the corners that have no poles can sag under less than ideal pitching conditions. This creates a loose corner that can hang down onto the sleepers face or foot, which is a compounded issue if there is lots of humidity in the air, and thus condensation. Not only will the fabric touch the foot or head of the sleeper, these areas pick up condensation due to the pseudo single wall section, and creates a damp environment that can wet out a sleeping bag. A good pitch minimizes the issue, but we found ourselves stuffing gear into the corners to keep them out of the way when conditions were poor.\n\nThe same corners can buffet in the wind, even with a good pitch, causing some light annoyances and possibly shaking off condensation.\n\nNo vents in the top of the tent, and no double zippers for venting the doors creates a mildly condensation prone environment.\n\nThe positioning of the internal pockets in the frameless corners of the tent makes them nearly useless when trying to store heavier items like cameras due the added pull of the fabric. This lowers the already problematic saggy corners further into the floor of the tent. I can't understand why they weren't stitched into the opposite corners where the poles would serve as reinforcement.\n\nTo fully guy out the tent you'll need to carry a few extra tent stakes and lines that aren't included (4 in this case). This significantly improves the stability, and is highly recommended.\n\nPitching tip\n\nWhen pitching, stake out the body, starting with the pole-less corners. Then stake out the corners with jakes corners (pole connections), and finally install the poles and erect the body. This better tensions the tent and minimizes sagginess. If you have a wrinkle in the floor, keep",
      "Newly banned Los Angeles Clippers owner Donald Sterling is battling prostate cancer, according to a report by ESPN, citing unnamed sources. (Reuters)\n\nDonald Sterling, the Los Angeles Clippers owner who was banned from the NBA for life Tuesday, is battling prostate cancer.\n\nIn addition to the lifetime ban, Sterling was fined $2.5 million and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver urged the league's other owners to force the sale of the Clippers because of racist remarks by Sterling that became public last weekend. The New York Post first reported that Sterling, 80, has the disease and sources confirmed it to ESPN.\n\nBlake Griffin said after the Clippers' 100-99 loss to Golden State in Game 6 of their NBA playoff series that he was unaware of Sterling's illness. \"If that is true, my thoughts and prayers are with him,\" Griffin said (via ESPN). \"Nobody deserves to go through something like that.\"\n\nOn Thursday, the NBA's advisory and finance committee, consisting of 10 men with ownership stakes in teams, met for the first time since Silver announced Sterling's punishment and \"unanimously agreed to move forward as expeditiously as possible\" on beginning the process of removing Sterling as one of the league's 30 owners. The committee will meet again next week.\n\nUntil recently, Sterling's ownership was marked by frugality, as assistant coach Kim Hughes learned in 2004 in a twist on the Sterling prostate cancer story that the New York Times recounted earlier this week.\n\nAfter receiving a diagnosis of a slow-growing prostate cancer, Hughes wanted to postpone surgery, but then-coach Mike Dunleavy encouraged him to get a second opinion. That doctor urged Hughes, who has a family history of the disease, to have surgery quickly, but he was told by the Clippers that his health insurance did not cover the $70,000 surgery and that they could not make an exception for him. Hughes proceeded with the operation and later learned that players Chris Kaman, Corey Maggette, Elton Brand and Marko Jaric had paid for it.\n\nRelated: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar says Sterling scandal is troubling for many reasons",

      "Paul Holder, former assistant Academy director at Crystal Palace, explains the next stages.\n\nMOVING UP THE LADDER\n\nWhat exactly is an Academy?\n\nAcademies are special training schemes set up by clubs to help them develop young players. All Premiership clubs have them.\n\nLiverpool's academy opened in 2000\n\nOther League clubs run either Academies or Centres of Excellence, which are run along the same lines. Many non-league clubs also run their own development schemes or community projects.\n\nDo I have to be a certain age to attend an Academy?\n\nA player must be at least nine years old to join an Academy, but many clubs - such as Arsenal - have development groups which cater for even younger players.\n\nDoes it matter where I live?\n\nYes. Strict new rules have been brought in to prevent clubs signing young players who live outside their catchment area.\n\nUnder 12's must live within an hour's travelling distance from the club, or 90 minutes for players aged 13-16.\n\nWhat happens once a club agrees to take me on?\n\nBetween the ages of nine and 16 you will be asked to sign schoolboy forms.\n\nThese will be renewed every year or two years, if the club is happy for you to continue.\n\nOnce you're 16, the club will then decide whether it wants you to stay on and join its Youth Training Scheme.\n\nA West Ham youngster show off his skills\n\nPlaces are limited, though. For example, Crystal Palace take on about six trainees every year at this stage.\n\nSome clubs take on more, some less. If you are one of the lucky ones, you will be offered a scholarship.\n\nThis can last up to three years, during which time you should progress from the Academy's Youth team to the Reserves.\n\nPremiership clubs also have Under-21 teams to bridge the gap between the reserve team and the first team.\n\nTechnically, you can sign a professional contract at 17. But Wayne Rooney is the exception rather than the rule.\n\nMost players will have to wait until they are 19 before finding out whether they have a future at the club.\n\nLIFE AT AN ACADEMY\n\nAt the Crystal Palace Academy, youngsters train three times a week - one and a half hours on Tuesday evenings and Thursday evenings and an hour on Saturday mornings.\n\nOn Sundays, they play matches against other Academy teams. That could mean up to 28 games a season.\n\nAt Under-9s, 10s and 11s, the matches are eight-a-side, moving up to regular 11-a-side numbers after that.\n\nAcademy players are given all-round assistance\n\nPlayers are given practical homework such as training drills they can practice at home.\n\nTheir parents are also given advice on things like nutrition and mental preparation.\n\nAgility is very important too.\n\nSo, while the players can practise their football skills at the academy, we'll ask their schools to make sure they take part in other sports such as gymnastics or basketball.\n\nWhen he's approaching 16, the club will sit down with the player and his parents to decide the best way forward.\n\nIf the player is offered a scholarship, he'll more than likely move to live in digs near the club.\n\nHe'll be expected to continue his education, though, and will be offered various courses such as A levels, BTecs or GNVQs at a local college.\n\nHe'll also be expected to do some jobs around the club, such as collecting the kit and taking it to the laundry.\n\nWHAT IF I'M REJECTED?\n\nYou've got to be realistic.\n\nJust think. How many new young players does a club like Liverpool or Arsenal sign every season?\n\nDarren Peacock overcame rejection\n\nThe answer is very few. The fact is that most trainees will never make the grade.\n\nTrainees released from scholarship schemes are put into a central pool which allows other interested clubs to come in for them.\n\nAnd former Fulham scout Roger Skyrme believes there's nothing wrong with lowering your standards.\n\n\"Never lose faith in your ability, but do be prepared to move down a level,\" Roger told BBC Sport.\n\nOne example is Darren Peacock, who was rejected by Bristol Rovers before being taken on by Newport County.\n\nHe eventually went on to make some 200 Premiership appearances for clubs such as QPR, Newcastle, West Ham and Blackburn.\n\n\"Now that's one player with real backbone,\" said Skyrme.",
      "The Heat, non-committal for months about whether Chris Bosh would be cleared to resume his career this season, suggested on Twitter Wednesday evening that it expects him to attend training camp.\n\n\"Looking good CB,\" owner Micky Arison tweeted. \"... Look forward to seeing in camp.\" He ended the Tweet with a basketball emoji.\n\nArison was responding to a Bosh tweet that included video of him shooting jump shots.\n\nThe Heat declined to offer additional clarity on Arison's tweet, including whether Bosh would be cleared medically by team doctors.\n\nBosh has been awaiting such clearance, according to a source. The Bosh camp has been unhappy about the Heat's handling of the matter, according to an NBA-employed person with direct knowledge of the situation.\n\nMeanwhile, an option has surfaced in which the Heat could allow Bosh to play a limited number of games this season and still get salary cap relief before next summer if Bosh has a setback in his attempt to return from his second blood clot episode in a 12-month period.\n\nIt has been widely reported in several publications that the Heat can apply to remove Bosh from its cap only if he does not play in a regular-season game before Feb. 9, the one year anniversary of his last game.\n\nThat's true, but there's a key caveat.\n\nAccording to Section VII (4) (h) (1) of the labor agreement, and cap expert Nate Duncan (who was kind enough to alert me), the labor agreement would allow the Heat to remove his salary from its cap before next summer if he plays in fewer than 10 games this season and then has a setback that's considered career-ending.\n\nHere's how the labor deal is phrased: \"If the player played fewer than 10 in a season, the team can apply 60 days after his last game [to have his salary removed from the cap], or the one-year anniversary of his last game in the previous season, whichever is later.\"\n\nPreseason games do not count toward that total but playoff games do.\n\nAs noted in our last post updating where the Heat stands with Bosh and the Bosh camp's frustrations, here's how the process works:\n\nWhen a team applies to remove a player from its cap on the grounds that he has sustained a career-ending injury or illness, it must waive the player and then apply for cap relief. According to the labor deal, \"the determination as to whether an injury or illness is career ending is made by a physician jointly selected by the league and players association. The determination is based on whether the injury or illness will prevent the player from playing for the remainder of his career, or if it is severe enough that continuing to play constitutes a medically unacceptable risk.\"\n\nIf the injury exclusion is granted, the player's salary is removed from the team salary immediately.\n\nBosh is believed to have found at least one doctor who has been receptive to him resuming his career, with use of a blood thinner that would be out of his system in eight hours.\n\nThe Heat rejected that proposal when Bosh wanted to return for the playoffs this past spring, but that approach has been discussed against this summer.\n\nIf the player later proves the doctors wrong and resumes his career, then his salary is returned to his former team's salary when he plays in his 25th game in any one season, for any team.\n\nThis, according to cap expert Larry Coon's cap document, \"allows a player to attempt to resume his career without affecting his previous team unless his comeback is ultimately successful. If the 25th game was a playoff game, then the player's salary is returned to the cap effective on the date of the team's last regular season game.\"\n\nSo if Bosh, hypothetically, plays in nine regular-season games or fewer in November and very early December, then suffers a setback, the Heat could apply to remove his salary from the cap on Feb. 9, a process that would be easier if Bosh is not fighting it.\n\nAnd if Bosh plays in nine games or fewer at any time this season, the Heat still could apply to remove his salary from its cap before free agency next summer if Bosh has a setback that likely would end his career.\n\nBosh is due to make $25.3 million in 2017-18 and $26.8 million in 2018-19. Removing his 2017-18 salary from Miami's cap would leave the Heat with more than $42 million in cap space next summer.\n\nBosh is set to make $23.74 million this summer, making him the NBA's 10th-highest paid player this season, whether he plays or not.\n\nThe Heat has said it has no update on whether Bosh will be cleared medically, but Bosh's wife said this week that he intends to play this season.\n\nUM FOOTBALL\n\nA few nuggets from UM football practice:\n\n• UM's defensive line,",

      "Game creator Jordan Mechner wanted to teach the next generation. So the man behind the groundbreaking 1989 Apple II game Prince of Persia recently posted his original 6052 assembly source code to Github. But getting the code from decades-old floppy disks \"covered with dust\" was no simple task. Mechner employed the services of vintage computer expert Tony Diaz and digital archivist Jason Scott to extract the bits from the floppies and assemble it into a readable code file.\n\nWithout Diaz and Scott, Mechner's code could have been lost forever. The exact methods he used to create this landmark game would have become as obsolete as the 1976 technology it was played on.\n\nBut old source code isn't the only cultural artifact that requires specialized knowledge to preserve. As paper and dyes deteriorate, acetate degenerates, and the minute magnetic flux recorded in analog tape fades with the ages, how do we preserve cultural artifacts like photographs, music, and film? And what of more modern digitally created media? Images and video are shot directly in digital formats and stored on flash media. Music is recorded in 24-bit, 192kHz digital resolution onto massive hard drives. All these files exist in various codecs, formats, and file systems; on spinning magnetic platters or in solid state NAND flash. How do we preserve these files for future reference, study, and appreciation?\n\nThese are the questions asked and answered by \"digital archivists\" every day. Ars spoke to Robin Pike, a certified archivist currently serving as a Digital Collections Librarian at the University of Maryland, to give us insight into the process, and the motivation, that fuels her work.\n\nCollections speak in a loud voice\n\nAnthony Bannon, a director at the George Eastman House, wrote in the forward to 500 Cameras that \"collections manage time.\" Collecting, documenting, and managing a collection of objects—in Bannon's case, cameras, photographs, and other photographic ephemera—gives us insight into our history, and can lead us in new directions. Such collections bring value when they are organized, interpreted, and shared.\n\n\"But we must care for them, say their names, and notice what they consign,\" Bannon writes. \"So we take responsibility for our collections with gratitude. The collector, whether individual or institutional, engages with the object to recognize the light of its value and hold the spark, to take on the responsibility of its meaning and make sense of it.\"\n\nPike brings such a personal sense of responsibility to her work as a digital archivist specializing in audiovisual materials. Growing up in a family of musicians and music lovers, Pike was exposed to \"legacy\" music formats including vinyl LPs, and even vintage glass 78RPM records, from an early age. Honing in on classic Hollywood musicals, Pike performed as both an instrumentalist and vocalist in high school stage productions, and performed in bands and orchestras.\n\nThis love of music took Pike to Indiana University of Pennsylvania, where she majored in music education. To supplement her studies, Pike took a job as a student assistant in the university's music library, first shelving books and scores, and later doing preservation repairs. Pike helped process numerous collections that were donated to the library, including an obscure collection of books and other documents from a former marching band director that had a zeal for military band history.\n\n\"It wasn't so much the content that interested me, but that some of these books were nearly a century old,\" Pike told Ars.\n\nPike also took, as part of her music education curriculum, a class focused on capturing and disseminating digital music. Among its subjects: MIDI files, compressed audio such as MP3, and digital score formats.\n\n\"By the time I finished my undergrad degree, I knew I didn't want to teach anymore; I wanted to go into librarianship,\" Pike said.\n\nSo Pike headed to the University of Pittsburgh to earn a masters degree in library and information science. Pitt is regarded as having one of the top three archivist programs in the country, but it also features a course called \"Sound and Moving Image Archives.\"\n\n\"While I work with all formats, my passion is still audiovisual media,\" Pike explained.\n\nAnalog to digital converter\n\nAside from her lifelong love of music, Pike is attracted to the complexity of working with analog materials. \"Analog materials are formed of layers of 'stuff,'\" she told Ars. \"Film exists of a base layer and an emulsion in which the dyes are suspended. Magnetic media, such as open reels, cassette tapes, and VHS tapes, are made of the base layer with the emulsion which includes magnetic particles that encode the analog (or sometimes digital) signal and a lubricant to make it glide over the tape player heads easily. LPs have a core material and a coating, in which the grooves are stamped.\n\n\"In",

      "(Reuters Health) - After training in a gender-violence prevention program, Kenyan boys and young men were three times more likely than their untrained classmates to report that they'd successfully intervened to prevent an assault on girls or women, a new study found.\n\nMore than 1,200 male high school students in the slums of Nairobi spent 12 hours in a six-week gender-violence educational program called \"Your Moment of Truth.\" Nine months later, they reported stepping in to stop sexual and other assaults 79% of the time. In contrast, 293 male students who did not get the training reported intervening to thwart violence 26%, or less than one third, of the time.\n\nOne of the boys who took the class told his teacher he used what he learned to intercede in what he believed was about to be the rape of a toddler, lead author Jennifer Keller told Reuters Health. When the trained student saw a man starting to remove the toddler's diaper, he yelled and stopped the expected assault, said Keller, a psychologist and professor at the Stanford University School of Medicine.\n\n\"These types of moments of truth define our character,\" she said. \"Shouting out to someone and saying, 'Hey, don't do that,' can really change the course.\"\n\nThe \"Your Moment of Truth\" training is one piece of a sexual-assault program called \"No Means No Worldwide,\" designed by Dr. Jake Sinclair and Lee Paiva, two of the study's authors.\n\nThe couple, Americans working in Kenya, developed the curriculum to alter male attitudes towards females, promote gender equality, develop positive masculinity and teach boys to safely and effectively intervene in gender-based violence. Young adult Kenyan men with at least 250 hours of instruction taught the program. It focused on the unique needs of high school boys living in Nairobi.\n\nIn Kenya, 29% of females reported being a target of sexual violence in the preceding year and 43% reported experiencing gender-based violence between the ages of 15 and 49, the authors write online June 10 in the Journal of Interpersonal Violence.\n\nPrior interventions have focused on aftercare for victims, they write.\n\nJocelyn Hollander, a sociologist at the University of Oregon in Eugene who was not involved with the study, called the results \"impressive.\"\n\n\"It's promising,\" she told Reuters Health. \"We really need a culture change to solve the problem of reducing violence. A lot of people say we should be focusing on women because they're the ones at risk, and a lot of other people say we should be focusing on men because they're largely the root of it.\"\n\n\"And this is a great example that it's not either or. We need a multi-prong approach to stopping violence,\" she said.\n\nThe young men who participated in the study were 15 to 22 years old, on average nearly 18.\n\nWhile the males who took the \"moment of truth\" classes improved their attitudes about women nine months after the study, males who instead took a two-hour life-skills class saw women in a slightly more negative way nine months later.\n\nKenyan boys generally take the two-hour life-skills class sanctioned by the Kenyan government. The class touches on sex education, positive gender roles and personal rights.\n\nMales who participated in the gender-violence intervention program were more than twice as likely to report successfully stopping verbal harassment and physical threats than those who took just the two-hour class, the study found.\n\nAn earlier study showed that self-defense and empowerment classes for girls reduced sexual assaults among Kenyan students.\n\nIn that earlier study, adolescents living in high-crime Nairobi settlements reported 38% fewer rapes 10 months after the classes began. Sinclair, who worked on both studies, said the prior curriculum worked \"like a vaccine\" to prevent rape.\n\nHe calculated the program cost $1.75 for each rape prevented and compared it to the $86 cost for one post-rape visit to a Nairobi hospital. Keller said she could not estimate the cost for the intervention in the current study.\n\nA White House report issued in January estimates that nearly one in five American women is raped in her lifetime. On U.S. college campuses, the report says, one in five female students is sexually assaulted.\n\nHollander and Keller both said they would like to see a curriculum like \"Your Moment of Truth\" tested on college campuses and possibly in high schools as well.\n\n\"We really want to help change these negative attitudes that perpetuate the violence,\" Keller said. \"We really want to give both boys and girls the power to prevent the violence together. This study shows we can influence attitudes.\"\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/1cX8Oko\n\nJ Interpers Violence 2015.",

      "Women may have keener vision\n\nArizona State University scientists have discovered the gene which allows people to see the colour red comes in an unusually high number of variations.\n\nThe gene sits on the X chromosome, which means women have two copies, and men just one.\n\nThe researchers believe this could mean that women may have a more acute perception of the red-orange spectrum.\n\nThe researchers, who report their findings in the American Journal of Human Genetics, analysed the DNA of 236 people from around the world.\n\nThey found no less than 85 variations of the key gene, called OPN1LW. This is about three times the usual number of variations found in most genes.\n\nIt is thought that the red gene routinely swaps bits of genetic material with its neighbour on the X chromosome, which controls perception of the colour green.\n\nSometimes this exchange goes wrong and results in a defect that causes color blindness.\n\nHowever, while an estimated 8% men are colour-blind, few women have the condition.\n\nThis is because the odds are they will have at least one good copy of the red and green genes.\n\nLead researcher Dr Brian Verrelli, who carried out the study with and Dr Sarah Tishkoff, who is at the University of Maryland, said the gene variations had probably been around for a long time, possibly hundreds of thousands of years.\n\nHe told BBC News Online: \"If it has been around this long, this suggests that it was beneficial and kept in the population by natural selection.\n\n\"Females may have historically been better at gathering fruits and other food items because of their better colour discrimination in the red range of colour.",
      "Liverpool, June 18th 2012 (Venezuelanalysis.com) – Communities organised into communal councils and communes are to be given increased power and access to funding under new legislation approved last Friday by Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez.\n\nMaking use of the enabling law power granted to him by the National Assembly in December 2010 in the wake of heavy flooding, Chavez approved a series of 11 far-reaching laws relating to communal government, tourism and housing. The laws were signed just 2 days before the enabling law was due to expire on Sunday June 17 in a Presidential Ministers' Meeting in Caracas.\n\nIn an interview following the announcement, Vice-president Elias Jaua said that the new laws had been passed \"for the people, for life and for the productive economic development of the nation\".\n\nCommunal Power\n\nOne of the new laws, entitled \"Law for Community Management of Functions, Services and other Powers,\" will open the door for organised communities to have greater responsibility in the running of local life and access to more direct funding from the government.\n\nThe new law comes under Article 184 of the 1999 Venezuelan Constitution, which states that local and national government must progressively start delegating their responsibilities to Venezuela's various local bodies of communal power.\n\nCommenting on the new law, Venezuela's Commune and Social Protection Minister, Isis Ochoa, said that communities would have increased control over the management of local services, as well as more input into Venezuela's \"changing\" productive model.\n\n\"In this law, mechanisms are established through which community participation can take on functions such as the maintenance of public infrastructure, such as schools,\" said Ochoa.\n\nLegislating for People\n\nThe other laws passed include modifications to the country's housing legislation to guarantee that all Venezuelans have access to mortgages in order to buy their homes, as well as the establishment of legal guidelines for state purchase of land for the government's mass house building programme.\n\nChanges were also made to national tourism legislation to make it easier for the government to invest in the country's growing tourist industry, and the country's agricultural laws were also modified in order to facilitate the granting of credit to small and medium sized producers.\n\nAlthough already underway, the government's \"Knowledge and Work mission\" which is hoping to see 3 million out of work Venezuelans trained and employed by 2018 was also officially written into law.\n\nAccording to the new legislation, the mission is aimed at both women and the unemployed in particular, and is seeking to alter socio-productive relations in the country based around a \"new organisational model\" constructed through workers' councils.\n\nA law allowing the government to restructure and re-found the country's criminal investigation body, the CICPC, was also passed as part of the 11 laws.\n\nPenal Code Reform\n\nIn a previous Ministers' Meeting on Tuesday, President Chavez also gave the go ahead for reform of the country's penal code, which was passed to the National Assembly for approval last week.\n\nReform to the country's penal code has been in discussion for years, with the country's National Assembly approving reform of the law as early as 2004. Although the law was subsequently reformed in March 2005, provoking backlash from Venezuela's opposition and human rights organisations, the reform law was then vetoed by President Chavez in August of the same year. According to the government, reforms to the law will mean that justice is carried out more efficiently.\n\nVenezuelan Minister of Prison Services, Iris Varela, said that although reforming the law was not \"the whole solution,\" it would still act as a \"fundamental tool\" for combating weaknesses in the Venezuelan judicial system, as required by Venezuela's Constitution.\n\nReforms to the law will prioritise ending delays in the national judiciary and the rehabilitation of prisoners. Municipal courts will also be created in a bid to end hold-ups in the judicial process.\n\nThe Republic's Attorney General, Cilia Flores, also commented on the reform, saying that the government was responding to the population's demands to \"end impunity\" and change a judicial model that was \"accusatory\" in nature and \"crushed human rights\".\n\n\"The president is acting and working by obeying the people, who are screaming for this justice system to be transformed in order to end impunity,\" commented Flores on the National Assembly's radio station.\n\nThe new penal code is due to come into effect on January 1st 2013.\n\nOpposition backlash\n\nVenezuela's political opposition has rejected both the new laws approved by decree and reforms to the country's penal code, accusing the President of \"smashing the State of law into smithereens\" and the opposition presidential candidate, Capriles Radonski, charged Chavez with \"burying participatory democracy\" through his \"imposition\" of the laws.\n\nOpposition sources also claim that the President is using the laws \"unconstitutionally\" to turn himself into a \"",
      "SYRACUSE, N.Y. -- A Corcoran High School ninth grader who is autistic was attacked by a middle-aged stranger during a cross country race in Rochester a few weeks ago.\n\nThe attack happened on October 14th during a cross-country race sponsored by Omega Psi Phi Fraternity called the Purple and Gold Invitational.\n\nDuring the race, 15-year-old Chase T. Coleman, who is an autistic non-verbal cross country runner, was attacked by a 57-year-old man. The suspect allegedly got out of his car and shoved Chase down to the ground. After the attack the suspect fled the scene of 100 Culver Road.\n\nThe mother of the child did not witness the attack first hand but was notified by witness Collin Thompson, according to the Rochester Police Department.\n\nThe witness told Police that she was running in the park around the reservoir when she noticed a young black male in the middle of the road and an older white male who got out of his vehicle. The suspect, allegedly approached Coleman and pushed him to the ground. Then proceeded to yell at him saying \"Get out of here.\"\n\nChase's mother, Clarise Coleman, said her son was in the road at the time of the incident because he was participating in the race.\n\nWhile being interviewed by a Police Officer who was dispatched to the area, the alleged attacker admitted that he had pushed Coleman to the ground because he thought Coleman was going to mug his wife and steal her purse.\n\nAt the time of the incident, the man's wife was in the front seat of the vehicle he was operating.\n\nHe later told Police his car had recently been broken into, which crossed his mind before he pushed Coleman. The suspect told the officer that Coleman, who is non-verbal, was not responding to him when he told him to leave the road.\n\nOn October 21st the Monroe County District Attorney's Office informed Coleman that Judge Caroline Morrison of Rochester City Court has denied the warrant application for the arrest of the suspect for charges of 2nd Degree Harassment.\n\n\"They are treating him like a third class citizen. He has the double whammy, he's black and has a disability. So it's not important, that's what Rochester is telling me,\" said his mother.\n\n\nOn October 25th, Susan Boyle of the Syracuse Common Council reached out to District Attorney Sandra Doorley of Rochester to ask why the warrant was not granted and the crime unpunished, saying the progress Coleman has made in his extra-curricular's \"To be lost due to a racist, aggressive, unprovoked attack on an African American minor with absolutely no consequences is, for lack of a stronger word, unacceptable.\"\n\nThe letter further went on to request an explanation why the action should go unpunished, adding \"Chase Coleman deserves and answer, the parents, teacher, coaches and teammates who have worked so hard to build Chase up to a place where he feels safe and accepted.... deserves an explanation and The Syracuse City School District deserves an explanation and an assurance that all of our City School District students will be protected under the law while visiting Rochester NY.\"\n\n\"When he left Rochester, he did not feel safe and he lost that love and that joy. To hear him tell me 'no more practice,' that hurts,\" said Clarise.",
      "KABUL (Reuters) - Suicide bombers stormed a Shi'ite cultural center and news agency in the Afghan capital on Thursday, killing more than 40 people and wounding scores, many of them students attending a conference.\n\nIslamic State said in an online statement that it was responsible for the attack, saying the center received support from Iran. It was the latest in a series that the movement has claimed on Shi'ite targets in Kabul.\n\nWaheed Majrooh, a spokesman for the ministry of public health, said 41 people, including four women and two children, had been killed and 84 wounded, most suffering from burns.\n\nThe attack occurred during a morning panel discussion on the anniversary of the Soviet invasion of Sunni-majority Afghanistan at the Tabian Social and Cultural Centre, witnesses said.\n\nThe floor of the center, at the basement level, was covered in blood as wailing survivors and relatives picked through the debris, while windows of the news agency, on the second floor, were all shattered.\n\n\"We were shocked and didn't feel the explosion at first but we saw smoke coming up from below,\" said Ali Reza Ahmadi, a journalist at the agency who was sitting in his office above the center when the attack took place.\n\n\"Survivors were coming out. I saw one boy with cuts to his feet and others with burns all over their faces,\" he said. \"About 10 minutes after the first explosion, there was another one outside on the street and then another one.\"\n\nRelated Coverage Islamic State claims Kabul suicide bomb attack: online statement\n\n\"SMOKE EVERYWHERE\"\n\nDeputy Health Minister Feda Mohammad Paikan said 35 bodies had been brought into the nearby Istiqlal hospital.

Before that, there had only been one major attack, in 2011.\n\nFORTIFIED ZONE\n\nThe United States condemned the attack, the White House said in a statement, pledging to work with Afghanistan's government to find and punish the attackers and vowing that \"the enemies of Afghanistan will not succeed in their attempts to destroy the country and divide the Afghan people.\"\n\nBacked by the heaviest U.S. air strikes since the height of the international combat mission in Afghanistan, Afghan forces have forced the Taliban back in many areas and prevented any major urban center from falling into the hands of insurgents.\n\nBut high-profile attacks in the big cities have continued as militants have looked for other ways to make an impact and undermine confidence in security.\n\nThe attacks have increased pressure on President Ashraf Ghani's Western-backed government to improve security. Much of the center of Kabul is already a fortified zone of concrete blast walls and police checkpoints, following repeated attacks on the diplomatic quarter of the city.\n\nBut militant groups have also hit numerous targets outside the protected zone, many in the western part of the city, home to many members of the mainly Shi'ite Hazara community.\n\n\"This gruesome attack underscores the dangers faced by Afghan",

      "Indeed, the perception of homosexuality as abhorrent and sinful has textual roots in the Old and New Testaments, portions of which were also incorporated into the Quran. The most commonly cited examples, the eight so-called clobber passages, range from the admonition in Leviticus 18:22 (\"Thou shalt not lie with mankind as with womankind; it is abomination\") to the declaration in Corinthians 6:9 that the \"effeminate\" are among the \"unrighteous\" who shall not inherit the kingdom of God.\n\nSex between men was called sodomy in a reference to God's destruction of Sodom, and even consensual male intercourse was criminalized under the name sodomy. In 1986, when the Supreme Court upheld a sodomy statute in Georgia, Chief Justice Warren E. Burger noted in his concurring opinion that \"condemnation of these practices is firmly rooted in Judeo-Christian moral and ethical standards.\"\n\nYet as far back as 1964, representatives from Baptist, Quaker and Episcopalian congregations in San Francisco formed a Council on Religion and the Homosexual to bridge the chasm between gay people and churches. One year later, the city's branch of the National Federation of Temple Sisterhoods called for consensual homosexual behavior to be decriminalized.\n\nSuch early steps led to more explicit efforts in the 1990s and 2000s by activists like Rabbi Yoel Kahn in Reform Judaism and Rabbi Steven Greenberg in Orthodox Judaism to formulate a textual basis for accepting gay identity, sexuality and marriage. In 2006, the Catholic theologian Daniel C. Maguire, a professor of religious ethics at Marquette University in Milwaukee, published a pamphlet, \"A Catholic Defense of Same-Sex Marriage,\" sending copies to 270 bishops.\n\n\"We have no moral right to declare marriage off limits to persons whom God has made gay,\" Dr. Maguire wrote. \"We have no right to say that marriage, with all of its advantages and beauty, is a reward for being heterosexual.\"\n\nIn response, the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States denounced the pamphlet as \"irresponsible\" and \"false teaching.\" Across denominational lines in 2008, a leading Mormon theologian and former bishop, Dr. Robert A. Rees, was formally silenced for about a year by his local leader in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, apparently for his consistent advocacy of compassion for gay and lesbian Mormons. The denomination was at the time campaigning for Proposition 8, the California ballot measure striking down same-sex marriage in the state.\n\nEven so, theological dissidence has grown across the spectrum. Some scholars questioned whether the \"clobber passages\" referred to all homosexual activity or only to coerced sex or sexual rituals associated with idol worship. Many theologians asked why the condemnation of homosexuality should continue to be enforced when hardly any religious person today would follow the Bible's injunction in Deuteronomy 21, for example, to stone to death a disobedient child. The American Muslim religious scholar Reza Aslan and a co-author, writing recently in Religion Dispatches, reminded their community of Islam's commitment to care for \"those who are persecuted.\" Dr. Rees has cited the Mormon belief in the sacredness of family as consistent with the acceptance of same-sex marriages.",
      "Originally published April 26, 2013 at 7:00 PM | Page modified April 27, 2013 at 5:42 PM\n\nThe new Q10 is a sometimes uneasy combination of the company's modernized BlackBerry 10 operating system, which is designed for touch screens, and a traditional design modeled after the BlackBerry Bold.\n\nThis is for the BlackBerry die-hards. You know who you are.\n\nYou're the ones who scoffed at those newfangled iPhones back in 2007, and still do. You turned your back when BlackBerry launched its touch-screen Z10 phone earlier this year. Your motto is \"You'll take away my physical keyboard when you pry it from my cold, dead thumbs.\"\n\nFor you, and only for you, there's the new Q10. It's a sometimes uneasy combination of the company's modernized BlackBerry 10 operating system, which is designed for touch screens, and a traditional design modeled after the iconic (at least to its fans) BlackBerry Bold.\n\nCarriers in the U.K. and Canada are taking preorders. The company says it will be in the U.S. by the end of May, at $249 for a model with 16 gigabytes of storage on a two-year contract; Verizon Wireless, AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile will carry it.\n\nThe new BlackBerry measures a compact 4.7 by 2.6 inches, and weighs just under 5 ounces. It's thoughtfully built, with a soft back that makes it easy to grip and three frets laid between the four rows of keys. The Q10 will run on LTE networks, the fastest cellular-data connections, where available.\n\nThe phone's most unusual feature is its screen. Unlike just about every other smartphone, whose displays are taller than they are wide, the new BlackBerry's is a 3.1-inch-diagonal square with a resolution of 720 by 720 pixels.\n\nThat means, among other things, that it can show much less content per screen than other phones — for example, icons for 12 apps, as opposed to 24 on Apple's iPhone 5 and 20 on the Samsung Galaxy. You can theoretically watch a movie on it, but I can't imagine why you'd want to.\n\nBlackBerry enthusiasts, of course, don't really care about that. What they want to know is: \"What about the keyboard?\"\n\nThey're likely to be more than satisfied. The keys are comfortably spaced and nicely sculpted, with a solid feel that will be familiar to the faithful. I haven't been a regular BlackBerry user for several years, but once the old muscle memory kicked in, I was able to rattle along as I did when Bill Clinton was president.\n\nSome features of the old BlackBerrys are missing. There's no trackball or trackpad; that function has been taken over by the touch screen.\n\nA swipe up from the bottom unlocks the phone; a swipe down when it's locked puts it to sleep, or, when it's awake, pulls down a window shade reminiscent of the one in Google's Android operating system, with various settings and notifications.\n\nInstead of using the touch screen, though, I often found myself using a new feature called Instant Action, which really is an old-school set of keyboard shortcuts.\n\nType bbm, for instance, and the phone automatically goes to the secure and much-loved BlackBerry Messenger service — which includes both voice chat and, with other BlackBerry 10 users, video and screen sharing. Type call, dial or phone and the first few letters of a contact's name, and the Q10 is ready to place the call. The same with text or sms.\n\nThe Q10 has many of the Z10's strengths, including its enterprise-friendly security features and BlackBerry Hub, a unified message inbox you can peek at from within other apps simply by swiping your finger.\n\nBut it also has the Z10's weaknesses, including the absence of many popular apps. There's no Instagram, no Pinterest and no Netflix in the BlackBerry World store, and a substantial chunk of the 100,000 or so apps are actually tweaked versions originally written for Android.\n\nNor does BlackBerry have much in the way of cloud-based services for saving and accessing information, the way Apple and Google do.\n\nMy guess is that the Q10's target audience won't really care. This isn't a phone to attract a new breed of BlackBerry users. It's one to keep the old breed happy. They will be.",
      "The OECD's forecasts combine expert judgement with a variety of existing and new information relevant to current and prospective developments. These include revised policy settings, recent statistical outturns and conjunctural indicators, combined with analyses based on specific economic and statistical models and analytical techniques, as outlined below.\n\nAssessing the current situation\n\nAn important starting point in the forecasting process is the re-assessment of the economic climate in individual countries and the world economy as a whole. Here, a combination of model-based analyses and statistical indicator models play an important role in \"setting the scene\" at the start of each projection round.\n\nA first step is to look at the range of relevant new information since the last projections were produced - such as changes in commodity prices (in particular the oil price), exchange rates and interest rates, fiscal trends, the path of economic activity and other key variables – to see how the recent past has developed differently from what was previously expected. With this new information, and using the previous set of projections as a starting point, the effects of the new elements and revised judgments are typically assessed on the basis of model simulations using the NIGEM global model and short-term indicator models. Thus the likely impact of combined and individual changes in assumptions and new information on key aggregates can be assessed in consistent fashion for each of the major economies and economic groupings. These results are mechanical and therefore intended to be no more than a guide to the informed judgments of country and topic experts on the underlying \"forces acting\".\n\nThe use of indicator models\n\nFor the euro area and individual G7 economies, the near-term assessment also takes particular account of projections from a suite of statistical models using high frequency indicators to provide estimates of near-term quarterly GDP growth, typically for the current and next quarter or so. This analysis builds on the work of Sédillot and Pain (2003) and Mourougane (2006) in using short term economic indicators to predict quarterly movements in GDP by efficiently exploiting all available monthly and quarterly information. These models typically combine information from both \"soft\" indicators, such as business sentiment and consumer surveys, and \"hard\" indicators, such as industrial production, retail sales, house prices etc. and use is made of different frequencies of data and a variety of estimation techniques. The procedures are relatively automated and can be run whenever major monthly data are released, allowing up dating and choice of model according to the information set available.\n\nThe most important gains from using the indicator approach are found to be for current-quarter forecasts made at or immediately after the start of the quarter in question, where estimated indicator models appear to outperform autoregressive time series models, both in terms of size of error and directional accuracy. The main gains from using a monthly approach arise once one month of data is available for the quarter being forecast, typically two to three months before the publication of the first official outturn estimate for GDP. For one-quarter-ahead projections, the performance of the estimated indicator models are only noticeably better than simpler time series models once one or two months of information become available for the quarter preceding that being forecast. Modest gains are nonetheless to be made in terms of directional accuracy from using the indicator models.\n\nStatistical indicator models are nonetheless limited in their ability to forecast quarterly GDP growth. Even with a complete set of monthly indicators for the quarter, the 70 per cent confidence bands around any point estimate for GDP growth in that quarter lie in the range from 0.4 to 0.8 percentage points, depending on the country or region and the degree of uncertainty is found to widen as the forecast horizon lengthens. Forecasting errors can also arise for a variety of reasons, including revisions to the initial published data and inaccuracies in the projections of the incoming monthly data.\n\nRegular indicator model-based estimates of GDP now feed into both routine Economic Outlook assessment exercises and interim analyses and forecast updates released to the press on a routine basis.\n\nWhile the OECD's world trade forecast is built as the aggregation of individual country import and export forecasts, additional tools are used to assess the short term evolution of world trade and its consistency with the GDP growth projection. Firstly, indicator models to forecast world trade in the short term have been developed from the techniques used for short term forecasting of GDP growth to allow the incorporation of the most recent information from key monthly trade indicators. This approach includes a bridge equation model based on a limited set of variables (world industrial production, export orders for the G6 economies, 2 technology indicators, oil prices and the Baltic dry index) and a dynamic factor model using an extended dataset (including a larger number of monthly series at world and country levels), see Guichard and Rusticelli (2011). These models are used routinely during forecasting rounds and also for interim analyses. Secondly, a global equation linking world trade growth to world GDP growth is used to assess the consistency of world trade and world GDP forecasts drawing on the work of Cheung and Guichard (2009). To the extent that possible",
      "This stand looked like a good bargain in the store. However, after struggling with and lugging this heavy item home, I opened the box to find small shards of glass. I assumed it was from a damaged glass side and saw where some damage had occurred to the back corner edge of the top glass. I figured the item was too cumbersome to bring back to the store and I could live with the damage. As I put the item together, that's when I noticed a large chip out of that corner. The product manual said to contact them for warranty. I called the phone number and was told it was covered under warranty and simply to take a photo of the damage and the receipt and email it to them. I was told the warranty was processed but I would have to pay shipping charges. That seemed fair until I was informed the shipping charges are $35. $35 is 1/3 the cost of the entire stand. When I complained about that, I was told I could bring the item back to WalMart. Since the TV stand is too heavy and troublesome to fully dismantle, repack and haul back to WalMart and then struggle with dragging a replacement home and spend another hour rebuilding the stand, I will simply have to live with the chip.

      "I have recently been introduced to an amazing format called Pauper EDH. In this format one can choose any uncommon creature as their commander and them create the rest of deck out of purely commons. It's a great (and cheap) format with amazing and affordable decks being built with a ton of commons that you probably already own from all those packs you've opened (can't hide that cardboard crack addiction from me) anyway this is contribution to his awesome format!\n\nThey lament the doom that is to come to your opponents, not your wallet! I chose Skyward Eye Prophets as my general for my deck because they're in my favorite colors and they also look freakin' awesome. This deck is based around walling till you can get a good combo out. These combos can range from Midnight Guard + Presence of Gond to Fertile Ground + Freed from the Real + Krosan Restorer or anything in-between. The land base isn't that amazing since we're limited to commons so it might be a little slower, but with all these walls our prophets can stay safe! Skyward Eye Prophets act as a great card draw/ramp and can thin the deck with freed from the real. Overall this is just a fun little deck I built for this format and it's been fun so far! You might think that pauper restricts the EDH format down to much, but with a near infinite amount of uncommon creatures I think that it expands it much more. I highly recommend this format to every type of magic player! What there to loose? You'll be paying more for a draft and at least here you get to play with a made out of every common in magic existence!",

Erowid.org . Sep 7, 2010. erowid.org/exp/83379\n\nDOSE:\n\nT+ 0:00 4 hits oral Unknown (blotter / tab) T+ 15:00 smoked Cannabis (plant material)\n\nBODY WEIGHT: 128 lb\n\nBackground: I am male, at the time of this experience 24 years old and weighing around 128 pounds. I take no prescription or OTC medications, but generally use marijuana and yerba mate on a daily basis. I have also been using kratom frequently, about two to four days most weeks. I have extensive experience with psychedelics, everything from mushrooms, LSD, DMT and 5-MeO-DMT, syrian rue and caapi alone or in combination with the aforementioned tryptamines, hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, MDMA, 2C-I, 2C-E, 2C-B, Trichocereus cacti, sketchy blotters suspected to be DO-x compounds, Salvia divinorum, nitrous oxide, ketamine and DXM.A friend had given me four hits of a new type of blank blotter \"acid\" to test out, reputedly from a different chemist than before. We have been doing a certain type of acid once a week or so, for several months. Thus I had become very used to the effects of legitimate LSD, at various doses. One hit to catalyze my mental processes. Two hits to feel the characteristic effects of LSD. Three hits to go deeper. Four hits for a trip to the moon. Five hits to be seriously, seriously confused and disoriented. Eight to twelve hits, to transcend the confusion and reach a much higher plateau of fractalizing goo. In other words, I knew acid, inside and out.Mindset going into the trip: So I decided to take all four hits (5 X 6 millimeters each) of this blank blotter on a Sunday morning. The friend who gave it to me had not sampled himself (he almost never takes psychedelics these days), but he said that everyone he had given it to reported it was stronger than the batch I was used to. I did not consciously state an intention for this trip, but was just feeling kind of bored and thought four hits of acid would be a good way to liven up my day. I was confident taking it all would be no big deal, as I had taken five hits a couple days before and been a-okay. When I put the blotter in my mouth, it tasted faintly bitter and did not have the electric-tingly tongue feeling I get from legitimate acid. However, I did not think anything of it at the time.The Experience: Right after dosing I walked down the hill with a couple people from my house, it was beautiful and sunny outside. After so much cold winter weather this unseasonal warmth was welcome. On the way down I began feeling somewhat detached. I concentrated on just being centred and grounded within myself, and not reacting to anything around me too strongly. I chose not to speak at all, unless specifically asked a question and even then my reply was terse. We went to a flea market which has some cool stalls. The community centre it was in had poor ventilation, and I was alerting and starting to come up. I felt very uncomfortable, people milling all around, and very aware of the funny smells in the building. Bad vibes. I quickly excused myself, saying I would hang out outside.Once outside I felt a very nervous energy. There was a little joint in my pocket, but I didn't feel comfortable just hanging out calmly and smoking. I needed to walk! There was a strong stimulated feeling, a kind of nervous energy soothed best by physical activity. Without telling anyone, I just started walking around the neighbourhood. Taking residential streets, soaking up the sunshine. I felt a little guilty about having just wandered off without telling anyone where I had gone, but at the same time I felt I had to keep walking to ease the comeup energy.The trees were beautiful, bare branches showing their growth habits against the blue sky. The elm trees in particular fascinated me, the fissures in the bark looking like eyes or faces. And the snow was melting and dripping all around, sparkling brilliant rainbow colours. I passed a house with colourful childrens toys, a little sled and toy shovel. Everything seemed more vibrant than before. The next house I passed had a decapitated seagull lying at the edge of the sidewalk. The head was nowhere to be seen, but the yellow feet caught my attention, pointing",
      "This week's fact-checking video by CNN's Jake Tapper looks at a fanciful story that President Donald Trump tells about President Barack Obama's last scheduled meeting with the Philippines president.\n\nIn Manila at the tail end of a 12-day Asian trip, Trump claimed that Obama's plane \"came close but it didn't land\" in the Philippines last year because of \"horrible\" relations between the countries.\n\nIt's true that Obama did not have a good relationship with Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte, whose anti-drug crusade has led to the extrajudicial killings of thousands of people since taking office on June 30, 2016. Obama made two visits to the Southeast Asian country in his eight years, but none while Duterte was in charge.\n\nHowever, contrary to Trump's account, Obama never had a flight to the Philippines diverted at the last-minute.\n\nHere's what happened: On the day before a scheduled meeting between the two leaders at a regional summit in Laos, Duterte called Obama a \"son of a bitch\" and warned the U.S. president not to challenge him over the extrajudicial killings. Obama responded by saying he did not want to attend a meeting if it wasn't productive — and then he canceled it.\n\nTrump's version: \"You know what happened. Many of you were there, and you never got to land. The plane came close but it didn't land.\" That's not true. Obama's plane did land in Laos — where the meeting was supposed to be held. There was no scheduled plane trip to the Philippines and no mid-air drama.\n\nOur article on Trump's false claim about Obama's plane and all of our fact-checking videos with CNN's \"State of the Union\" can be found on our website.",

Potter is a hero to the world, a symbol for everything and everyone that would stand and fight against the Dark Arts. No self-styled 'Dark Lord' could claim power so long as Harry Potter lives.\n\nYet mere death alone would not undo his life's work. Death would only change one man's quest into a crusade, change a hero into a martyr. Potter must die, that much is certain, but first he must be destroyed.\n\nAnd what better way to not just kill, but utterly destroy the hope and saviour of the wizarding world, to leave the masses helpless to the rise of a new wave of darkness and iron rule than to attack that which he holds most dear – his family. The man himself would be hard to kill, but to defeat what he stands for is next to impossible... unless the man were to become a monster. Enough emerald flame and hot blood dripping from the throats of his children could do that.\n\nHarry Potter could die a thousand ways, yet his cause must be torn straight from his heart. Then, and only then, will the light and hope of the world be cut deep enough to die... to make way for a new strength reborn in my image.\n\nTwo decades ago Voldemort underestimated the power of a symbol, the power of a lightning bolt scar and the strength of love over fear, friendship over control. His arrogance blinded him and Potter made him pay the ultimate price.\n\nWould the Boy Who Lived be as successful against an adversary who understands him? Against an enemy that understands his drive and his defiance? Voldemort considered this ability to love a weakness. Voldemort was right, but for the wrong reasons. And now history remembers the last Dark Lord as nothing but a terrifying failure, defeated before his reign could truly begin at the cost of far too many lives.\n\nIn that respect, at least, I must thank Harry Potter. Had Voldemort triumphed there would be no more worlds to conquer. No worlds, wizarding or muggle, worth conquering.\n\nNow there is work to do. The night is young and the castle is never silent. I will do what I have to do, and the consequences will not be kind for the Potter family.\n\nYet the necessary death of Harry James Potter is but a small part of my plans... plans of darkness and shadow.\n\nOnly in death does duty end, yet my duty to the world shall last forever once immortality is mine. Fate is never final, and magic is power...\n\nAnd I shall be the most powerful wizard to ever walk the earth.\n\nHarry crouched down so that Albus's face was slightly above his own.

And, try as he might, Geralt continually finds himself trapped between the political maneuverings of the Northern Kingdom's most ambitious contenders. So it's easy to forget that Geralt's true calling in life is as a monster slayer. Lucky for him the Northern Kingdoms has no shortage of monsters.\n\nWhile some of these beasts have enjoyed plenty of spotlight in other fiction, CD Projekt Red have dug deep into their own Eastern and Northern European ancestry to bring to life a mythology underrepresented in the echelons of generic fantasy creatures. We're all familiar with dragons and vampires, but what about the lesser known beasts that bloody Geralt's blade? The leshen, alps and botchlings? I've rounded up some of my favorite monsters from the Witcher series and the legends that inspired them so that we can contrast their depictions in the game, while getting a mythology lesson at the same time.\n\nAlp\n\nSadly, alps within the Witcher universe aren't nearly as wonderful as their mythic counterparts. In The Witcher, they exist as little more than blade-fodder for Geralt. Seen as scaley, naked women, they tend to behave more like common vampires than the beasts from which they share their name. In German folklore, however, alps become infinitely more interesting. Though they are sometimes likened to vampires, they are infact more closely related to the traditional idea of elves (alp is even a variation of the word \"elf\").\n\nContrary to the Witcher, alps are actually male, while \"mare\" or \"mara\" tend to be the female version of the same creature. (In German they can be known as \"Nachtmahr\"). Alps seek out female victims during the night, controlling their dreams and twisting them into horrific nightmares (in German, \"Alptraum\" or \"elf dream\" means nightmare).\n\nWhen alps attack, they sit upon the chest of their sleeping victim, becoming heavier and heavier until the crushing weight forces the sleeper awake. Terrified and breathless, they are unable to move or scream and must wait for the attack to subside. Interestingly, these types of attacks from various creatures are so common across different cultures that the modern belief is that victims were actually suffering from sleep paralysis.\n\nAside from terrifying night attacks, alps also are known to be quite the mischief makers. They enjoy such perverse acts like putting babies back in soiled diapers, souring milk, and even crushing small farm animals. Oh yeah, remember when I said they're often likened to vampires? That's because they like drinking blood from the nipples of men and young children. They also enjoy breast milk too, if that helps at all. At this point, I'm starting to understand why alps weren't adapted as faithfully into The Witcher universe. Could you imagine a quick-time event to prevent an alp from sucking Geralt's nipples off?\n\nLeshen\n\nOne of the most visually striking foes of The Witcher universe is undoubtedly the leshen. These gnarled, root-like monstrosities can be found in dense, ancient forests and are fiercely territorial. Their attacks manipulate nature itself, using roots and branches to assail their opponents.\n\nFortunately, leshen made the jump from Slavic folklore to the Witcher 3 relatively unchanged. The biggest difference being their appearance and name. In the Witcher novels and in Slavic folklore, leshen are actually called \"leszy\" or \"leshy\".\n\nIn terms of appearance, leshen seem to have drawn inspiration from popular depictions of \"wendigos\", a spirit of the Algonquian people from the Great Lakes region of Canada and America. Though wendigos can appear in a variety of forms, they are often seen as humanoids with the skull and antlers of a deer, an appearance similar the Witcher 3's leshen. In Slavic folklore, however, leshy are said to simply take the likeness of a woodsman. In their native forests, leshy are rumored to be as tall as the trees, shrinking down to blade of grass if they step outside of their forest.\n\nIn both depictions, they are guardians. Whereas in the Witcher they are downright hostile and violent, in folklore, leshy tend to be more mischievous. They like kidnapping children and leading travellers astray.\n\nNoonwraiths\n\nYour first encounter with a noonwraith in the Witcher 3 is an unforgettable moment. As far as monsters go, they have enough tricks up their sleeve to seriously confuse a new player, and their tendency to only appear during the midday makes them an especially memorable foe to discover.\n\nIn folklore, however, noonwraiths are much less unsettling. In fact, they serve merely as the personification for heatstroke that laborers risk suffering out in the fields during",
      "It seems that the curved-sided display on Samsung's imminent Galaxy S6 may in fact be a three-sided display, according to a new report. Samsung also suggests that the \"amazing\" camera in the next model will \"do all the thinking for its users\".\n\nGalaxy S6 display extends to 3 sides\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, at least one version of Samsung's new phone will have a display that wraps around three sides of the device – probably the top, left and right. If the Galaxy Edge is any indication, these extra displays will provide quick access to apps and display information such as texts, tweets and recent apps.\n\nRELATED: Galaxy S6 pictures leaked, sport new design and wraparound display\n\nRumours this past week also claim that both new versions of the Galaxy S6 (the normal model and the Edge version) will sport a more premium aluminium unibody design, but the downside is that users won't be able to remove the battery themselves. Samsung will be hoping that the new model can help to reverse its fortunes after a particularly bad year in 2014, and the three-sided curved screen shows that Samsung isn't afraid to shake things up a bit in terms of design.\n\nFurthermore, DongHoon Jang, Samsung senior VP and the of the camera unit at Samsung, wrote a blog post this week which demonstrates how far Samsung's cameras have come on since 2000, and perhaps what it could mean for the Galaxy S6. The post shows that Samsung's aims is to deliver a camera that is \"as close as possible to what you actually see.\"\n\nCamera improvements\n\nThat should of course mean even in low light conditions, as well as improving the ability to capture things without motion blur and focus lag that prevents users from getting the photos they want. Other possible improvements include faster camera startup and simpler one-touch controls to take pictures quickly.\n\nJang also noted the company's commitment to high-res cameras front and back, and illustrates how Samsung's camera components have evolved from just 0.3 megapixels in 2000 to the dual 16 megapixel and 2 megapixels cameras on the Galaxy S5 today.\n\nThe Galaxy S6 is rumoured to sport a 20 megapixel rear camera, and a front camera of perhaps 5 megapixels, or possibly as high as 8 megapixels. Based on all the Internet rumours and the information coming directly from Samsung, the S6 certainly has a lot to live up to.\n\nHowever we'll have to wait a few more weeks until both models of the Galaxy S6 are revealed at Mobile World Congress 2015 in Spain, on March 1st.\n\nSOURCE: Bloomberg",
      "My Life in Rugby: Dennis Hickie – former Leinster and Ireland wing\n\nOverall I have to be very thankful for what I was able to achieve in rugby with the help of great team-mates and some excellent coaches: a Lions tour, 62 caps and 29 tries for Ireland and lots of big games and enjoyable moments with Leinster.\n\nI had a career that I could have only dreamed of as a young, rugby-obsessed St Mary's schoolboy going to watch my heroes at Lansdowne Road.\n\nI wasn't the first Denis Hickie to play for Ireland. I share the same name as my uncle, who won six caps at No. 8 in the early 1970s and, was part of the last Irish team to win in Paris before the Brian O'Driscoll–inspired effort in 2000.\n\nUnfortunately Ireland were denied a chance at a Grand Slam that year because of 'The Troubles'. Missing out on a Grand Slam was something I experienced myself, when Vincent Clerc scored a last-minute try to deny us in 2007, and that's obviously one of my career lows. My father Tony played for the Barbarians and Leinster and my cousin, Gavin Hickie, played with Leinster and Leicester so you could say rugby was in my blood.\n\nMy first cap for Ireland came against Wales at Cardiff Arms Park in 1997, aged 20, and luckily I was able to mark my debut with a try in a 26-25 win.\n\nI developed a real affinity with the ground from thereon in. We picked up some good wins there but a bit of heartache too! I also played for the Lions at the Millennium Stadium in 2005: a 25-25 draw against Argentina. Unfortunately it proved to be a portent of things to come. I played in the midweek side and while we went well, the Test series, which is what any Lions tour is all about, was less than memorable as we suffered a 3-0 whitewash to New Zealand. I'd missed out on the 2001 tour. I'd been playing well but the foot and mouth outbreak played havoc with the Six Nations that year and, like my teammates, I was denied the chance to press forward my claims.\n\nThe tour I look back on most fondly is the 1998 Ireland tour to South Africa. Neither myself nor the team played that well, but the camaraderie of the group was something special. Under Warren Gatland we fostered a real 'band of brothers' mentality in the most hostile of environments.\n\nOther than my debut, the Paris win against France in 2000 was probably my standout moment in an Ireland shirt. Brian O'Driscoll's life changed forever after his hat-trick; it was an incredible individual performance. It was also great to play a part in the wins over South Africa (2004) and Australia (2002 & 2006) in the old Lansdowne Road, win the Triple Crown and have the privilege to play in the first match to be played at Croke Park, the home of the \"GAA\".\n\nI went to two World Cups: 2003 and 2007. I enjoyed the first even though I had to return home early after snapping my Achilles tendon in the final pool match against hosts Australia. But the France tournament four years later was very disappointing. We never got going at all.\n\nIt was great to be a part of the journey that saw Leinster go from modest beginnings and a small supporter base to being one of the best-supported – and most successful – teams in Europe. Winning away in Toulouse in the Heineken Cup quarter-final was right up there in terms of memories, especially as I scored a try. It was a bumpy ride at times with Leinster but one hell of a ride!\n\nTagged Dennis Hickie, Ireland, Leinster, My Life in Rugby",
      "Matthew Handrahan Editor-in-Chief Wednesday 9th October 2013 Share this article Share\n\nThe Russian government plans to offer financial incentives to local developers to create games about the country's history.\n\nSpeaking to the Russian daily Izvestiya, an aide to Vladimir Medinsky, the country's culture minister, impressed the need for the games to be accurate depictions of real events.\n\n\"The main thing we expect from the producers of video games is the realistic and historically truthful representation of events,\" said Arseny Mironov, Medinsky's aide.\n\n\"A video game has to have not only an entertainment value, but it also has to teach and be conducive to patriotic education.\"\n\nOf course, 'realism' and 'patriotism' do not always go hand-in-hand, and while Mironov did not recognise that contradiction, he made it clear that games featuring, \"negative image[s] of the Russian warrior,\" would not qualify for government support.\n\nThe initiative will be under the auspices of the Russian Military History Society, which is in turn controlled by Medinsky. The society's inaugural game, which will focus on the country's military aviation programme in the First World War, is already in development, and negotiations with several other Russian developers are now under way. Mironov confirmed that the government would eventually establish a grant scheme for \"patriotic\" game ideas.\n\nOf greater concern were Mironov's comments about games that misrepresent history to, \"discredit the Russian soldier.\" He suggested that the government would consider banning such games in the future, pointing to Relic's Company of Heroes 2 as an example.\n\nCompany of Heroes 2 attracted criticism from Russian officials at the time of its release, specifically due to its depictions of the behaviour of Russian soldiers.\n\nThanks, The Hollywood Reporter.",

      "Collectively, we have nearly 10 decades of experience in the area of corrections and conditional release. There are many issues we have disagreed over, but we are united in our concerns with the direction of the Harper government's \"tough on crime\" agenda.\n\nIn a country that prides itself on fairness, compassion and the pursuit of equality, why do we accept the idea that community safety will be enhanced through increased incarceration?\n\nAt both the federal and provincial levels, Canadian jails are overcrowded. It is becoming common to see double- and triple-bunking of inmates in cells designed for one. This overcrowding limits access to already scarce rehabilitative programming and increases the incidence of institutional violence. The fastest-growing portions of the inmate population continue to be those most marginalized within our society: the mentally ill, women and aboriginals. Decades of reports have detailed our correctional systems' failure to reasonably address the needs of these offenders and limit their numbers.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nBill C-10, the Safe Streets and Communities Act, which is before the Senate, will significantly increase the prison population. The Canadian Bar Association, summarizing its testimony before the House of Commons standing committee on justice and human rights, stated that the bill \"will require new prisons; mandate incarceration for minor, non-violent offences; justify poor treatment of inmates and make their reintegration into society more difficult.\" These results are inconsistent with our collective concepts of fairness, compassion and equality. In addition, no evidence is provided to support the bill's objectives.\n\nMeantime, the message from other jurisdictions that have pursued increased incarceration as a solution to safer communities is clear.\n\nIn an editorial on Dec. 6, 2010, The New York Times stated: \"There is almost unanimous condemnation of California-style mass incarceration, which has led to no reduction in serious crime and has turned many inmates into habitual criminals. America's prison system is now studied largely because of its failure – the result of an expensive approach to criminal justice shaped by fear-driven ideology.\"\n\nThe same month, The Guardian led with a report on British Justice Secretary Kenneth Clarke's efforts to restore judicial discretion in sentencing. Aiming to reverse nearly 20 years of punitive criminal justice culture, the report said, Mr. Clarke \"signalled that he would sweep away aspects of the statutory sentencing framework in England and Wales that 'unhelpfully fetters' the ability of judges to make the sentence fit the crime.\"\n\nOur collective experience and decades of research tell us that increased rates of incarceration neither decrease crime nor act as a deterrent to it. Safer communities and effective crime prevention are achieved through the development of integrated systems with both the flexibility and resources required to respond to individuals in a timely fashion. As a society, we must be prepared to actively support and finance early intervention strategies for youth; a judicial process with options to ensure that incarceration is a last resort; a community mental-health system that keeps the ill out of jail; a prison service that addresses individual offenders' problems rather than acting as a human warehouse; and conditional-release programming that supports timely, safe community reintegration.\n\nOur focus and our resources should be directed toward keeping people out of jail, not in it. The financial cost of implementing effective, integrated systems pales in comparison to the billions it costs to build and operate new prisons.\n\nCriminal justice legislation that increases prison populations while draining resources from community programs in mental health, education, child poverty and social services makes absolutely no sense.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe fiscal and human costs of the path we are on, in pursuit of safer communities, are far too high and will not be easily reversed. Sober second thought is desperately needed. We call on the Senate to ensure that our justice policies promote a fair and effective corrections and conditional-release system that will actually make Canada safer.\n\nJohn Edwards is former commissioner of Correctional Service Canada.

      "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\n\nIn response to the London terror attack, Rep. Clay Higgins (R-La.) had an extreme proposal: kill anyone suspected of being an Islamic radical.\n\nOn his campaign Faceboook page, Higgins, a former police officer, posted this message:\n\nThe free world…all of Christendom…is at war with Islamic horror. Not one penny of American treasure should be granted to any nation who harbors these heathen animals. Not a single radicalized Islamic suspect should be granted any measure of quarter. Their intended entry to the American homeland should be summarily denied. Every conceivable measure should be engaged to hunt them down. Hunt them, identity them, and kill them. Kill them all. For the sake of all that is good and righteous. Kill them all.\n\nThe post went up early on Sunday morning. On Saturday evening, suspected terrorists killed seven people during an attack on London Bridge. ISIS has claimed credit for these murders.\n\nWith his declaration that Christendom is \"at war with Islamic horror,\" Higgins was embracing a theme of the far right: the fight against extremist jihadists is part of a fundamental clash between Christian society and Islam. And in this Facebook post, he was calling for killing not just terrorists found guilty of heinous actions, but anyone suspected of such an act. He did not explain how the United States could determine how to identify radicalized Islamists in order to deny them entry to the United States. It was unclear whether his proposal to deny any assistance to any nation that harbors \"these heathen animals\" would apply to England, France, Indonesia, Spain, and other nations where jihadist cells have committed horrific acts of violence.\n\nHiggins office refused to allow a Mother Jones reporter to speak to a spokesman for the congressman. But in an email, his spokesman confirmed the Facebook post was authentic.\n\nIn late January, Higgins delivered a fiery floor speech attacking Democrats and the \"liberal media\" for opposing President Donald Trump's Muslim travel ban. He declared that \"radical Islamic horror has gripped the world and…unbelievably…been allowed into our own nation with wanton disregard.\"\n\nShortly before running for Congress, Higgins resigned from his post as the public information officer of the St. Landry Parish Sheriff's Office, where he had earned a reputation as the \"Cajun John Wayne\" for his tough-talking CrimeStopper videos. Higgins abruptly quit after his boss, the sheriff, ordered him to tone down his unprofessional comments. \"I repeatedly told him to stop saying things like, 'You have no brain cells,' or making comments that were totally disrespectful and demeaning,\" the sheriff said.\n\n\"I don't do well reined in,\" Higgins noted at the time. \"Although I love and respect my sheriff, I must resign.\"\n\nUpdate: Higgins' campaign spokesman, Chris Comeaux, told Mother Jones in an email: \"Rep. Higgins is referring to terrorists. He's advocating for hunting down and killing all of the terrorists. This is an idea all of America & Britain should be united behind.\"",

The mask is starting to slip…\n\nNow they're not even pretending to hide behind anti-Zionism anymore.\n\nSo yes, the McGill Black Students' Network is against racism as long as it's not racism against Jews. Then it promotes racism.\n\nSo in this case, does it surprise you that they were some of the most outspoken supporters of the BDS motion at McGill?\n\nUnfortunately, this seems to be more of an overall trend in the black community than a McGill problem.

      "GQ magazine named Colin Kaepernick its \"citizen of the year\" for his launching the last year of NFL kneeling protests. The magazine noted that Kaepernick refused to be interviewed for the cover article, explaining, \"As his public identity has begun to shift from football star to embattled activist, he has grown wise to the power of his silence.\" Seeking to suggest that Kaepernick is sacrificing himself for the cause, GQ quotes rapper J. Cole, who states, \"Had [Kaepernick not taken a knee], this guy would be making millions of dollars right now. Period, point blank. And more important than the money, he was living his dream. He sacrificed his dream.\" World's smallest violin, please.\n\nIn Linda Sarsour's adoring GQ tribute, she wrote, \"I always tell Colin: 'You are an American hero. You may not feel like a hero right now, but one day, people will realize the sacrifices that you made for so many others.' There might even be a day when we'll be walking down Colin Kaepernick Boulevard and people will remember what Colin Kaepernick did, just like we remember Muhammad Ali.\"\n\nIronic how little respect and honor Kaepernick and his sycophantic scribe have for genuine American heroes – those who literally sacrificed their very lives to ensure that pro football kneelers and other celebrities enjoy the freedom to make millions of dollars doing what they love to do while making a mockery out of our nation's flag. If Kaepernick is truly concerned about sacrificing for the cause of others, he can contact the nearest military recruiter's office and sign up to fight for much more than his sophomoric narcissistic ego – fighting as genuine heroes do for American Liberty.\n\nIn the meantime, Kaepernick may want to read up on famed abolitionist and escaped slave Frederick Douglass' perspective on this nation Kaepernick so clearly despises. While Douglass was not shy about criticizing that \"peculiar institution\" of slavery, he encouraged black Americans to sign up with the Union to fight for freedom. He was also known to regularly play \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on his violin, and in an 1871 speech at Arlington National Cemetery he said that \"if the Star-Spangled Banner floats only over free American citizens in every quarter of the land, and our country has before it a long and glorious career of justice, liberty and civilization, we are indebted to the unselfish devotion of the noble army.\"\n\nThe problem for leftists like Kaepernick and GQ is that they no longer believe, and may have never believed, that the United States of America is a noble nation that has consistently espoused and defended the ideals of justice and Liberty. So on the heels of Veterans Day, GQ honored the wrong kneeler.",

      "Dear Parent of the Average Child,\nI'm sorry. Your child is wonderful.  She is always at school on time, does her homework most everyday, works well on her own and is patient with those around her.  I really wanted  to go tell your daughter how proud of her I was of the work she was doing today.\nI was about to but you see I had a young girl  over in the corner crying because she hadn't had breakfast. Another was tromping around the classroom in winter boots. It's May. When I asked her to change she told me she didn't have any other shoes. I needed to send them and my CEA down to the office to see if we had some food and any extra shoes in lost and found. \nOh and over in the other corner there was a  boy screaming at the top of his lungs because, well no one is sure why. He is on a list to see a specialist, they hope to have a plan in place for him soon. Of course it has been 3 months, but the specialist teacher is overworked and only at our school a few days a week so we have to be patient. \nMore children trickled in. One girl told me that her backpack is at Mom's but she was at Dad's last night. He forgot to send a lunch. She also wanted to tell me about her Dad's new girlfriend but she told me I wasn't  to tell mom because it's was secret.  A young man tells me his cat died last night. Another lost a tooth! Exciting until he sees the blood, thenthe fear sets in.\nA child came in a little late looking afraid and tentative. She watched carefully what was going on but was too afraid to join in.  Everyone agrees that the child's fears aren't normal and that she needs some counselling but there are only so many hours in a day. They might be able to see her for one or two sessions next month. I started to head over to help her. Your daughter, wonderful child that she is, helps her put away her things and leds her to her desk. \nI was about to head over and say thank you but I notice 3 boys in the corner playing rough. I ran over to stop them and have a conversation about expected behaviour at school. I also tried to throw in a lesson on non-violence while I was at it.\nI turned back to look for your daughter. I haven't forgotten that I wanted to check in with her but I look up and realise I should probably begin teaching the lesson of the day. I told myself I would check in with her later. \nThis was all before 9am. Many other things  happened during the day that made it very difficult for me to check in with your wonderful daughter.  Students with learning disabilities, diagnosed and not diagnosed. Students with special needs and with behaviour problems. Students who are needier or put up their hand more often. Students who yell louder.\nI realised after a day of running from child to child and crisis to crisis, I never did get a chance to check-in with her today. I don't mean to leave your daughter alone but she seems to be doing just fine without me. I hope it is true. I'm sorry. I feel terrible. Would you mind telling her how proud I am of her? Let her know I appreciate her? I will check-in with her tomorrow.\nFrom Your Child's Teacher\nAuthors Note:\nI have 23 little treasures in my room. I care about them all. I want to teach them all and see them all succeed. I've had more days like this one than I would like to admit. When I think about a classroom without class limits or I think about a school system with even less specialist teachers and less services for our students, I worry. I wonder how many average kids go unseen everyday. I honestly don't think I can do this job under those conditions. Somedays I wonder how I do it now.  I know for a fact I won't be able to do it well.  \nPlease, please please understand how important this issue is.  I didn't become a teacher for the paycheck or the glory. I became a teacher because I wanted to help kids do amazing things with their lives.  I want that for all my students. I want to do my job well. That means that I need the tools to do that. This includes a reasonable class size and help from specialist teachers. That is why I'm willing to take a 10% pay cut and walk out inspite of the threats. For me isn't about the money. Its about the kids.",

Once that happens the lungs can no longer exchange oxygen with the blood and fluid begins to enter the lungs , this causes an effect akin to drowning . Depending on how much lung tissue is damaged this effect can take hours or it can be near instant , and death occurs as quickly as drowning would . Breathing in too much CO2 from smoke inhalation can cause dizziness and loss of consciousness . So you pass out , then never wake back up . If you ’re already asleep , like a house fire , you just stay asleep and never wake up . Rarely do external burns kill a person while they ’re in the fire . Lung damage kills faster in those cases .

This continues throughout the night , and the stages are of different lengths throughout as well . 6 hours usually is n't enough time to complete the cycle ( unless that is your body 's default , which is possible particularly in older people ) . A 2 hour nap ca n't really replace that full sleep cycle . In my own experience , sticking to a regular sleep pattern was more helpful for exams than cramming late into the night .",

      "Biochemist here . As others have noted , cigarettes / tobacco contain a lot of native ingredients- many of which have carcinogenic ( cancer - causing ) effects on their own . What is not often explained is that the process of combustion creates new chemicals that are perfectly suited to penetrate cell walls , travel through the nucleus of the cell , and actually interact with your DNA . For instance , BenzoPyrenes are a common class of organic ( carbon - based ) molecule that forms during combustion in the presence of several chemicals found in cigarettes . The shape of these molecules allows them to actually fit between the twists of the double helix of your DNA , and interferes with your cell 's normal ability to repair it 's own genetic material . This is an oversimplification , but if single benzopyrene molecule lands in a region of DNA that regulates cell division and some other conditions are met , then that single affected cell can divide without the normal checks and balances of cell division . The error introduced into the DNA is passed on to each daughter cell , and then those two cells can divide without control , and the 4 from it , and the 8 from them , 16 , 32 , 64 and so on until a tumor is formed . Again , a single benzopyrene molecule could hypothetically cause this . A single cigarette can yield a staggering number of these molecules , like , literally there would be no name for that number . It would be ( roughly estimating ) 1/8th of a google . Chemists do n't generally work on a scale of individual molecules , but the idea is that even this single specific cancer causing agent is in abundance in cigarettes . Again , a benzopyrene molecule would have to land in a specific region of the DNA , there are other conditions that have to be met , and your body has a few cellular defenses , but given the sheer amount of carcinogenic agents in cigarettes your probability for dodging the big C go down exponentially with each smoke . The science of cancer is incredibly complex but this is the best I would be able to do with a 5 year old .",

      "Diesel is a cut of crude oil vs. gasoline ( petrol ) which is a mix of different cuts of crude oil . Diesel is heavier and more energy dense and has a higher rvp ( Reid vapor pressure ) meaning it does n't ignite as easily as gasoline . When you compare the engines , it 's all about the compression ratio . Because diesel has a higher rvp , it can withstand higher compression which means it can pack more energy per explosion in the engine . This is why Diesel engines do not have spark plugs , they compress until they ignite . Gasoline ca n't withstand the same compression because it would ignite at a lower pressure . This is why you do n't want to mix the fuels in your engine . If you put diesel into a gasoline engine you get too much power when you ignite with spark plugs which can damage the engine . If you put gasoline into a Diesel engine , you get a lot of knocking because it explodes before the engine makes a full cycle . You can have torque ( power ) or you can have velocity ( speed ) . Some trucks use diesel because the compression ratio gives more torque which can be desired when carrying heavy loads . There is cost savings in diesel because you get more energy from a gallon of diesel than gasoline because of what I 've already explained .

I think it 's mostly that stereotypes are enforced in people 's minds , and when people seem not to conform to those stereotypes it seems odd to us . For example , even if you were n't thinking it , your mind was probably expecting drawings of Japanese people to have super squinty eyes and jet black hair . However , the anime artists are just drawing people , and they 're not trying to emphasize , bold and underline that these people are Japanese and only Japanese , never to be confused with another race , ethnicity , or nationality . Doing such a thing is insignificant and irrelevant to the anime itself , and it also severely limits the creativity of the artists ' depicting of the characters .",

As long as your child is feeding well, passing gas from below, has no vomiting and has a soft belly, there is nothing to worry about. It is normal to pass stool once every 2-3 days. Also, you may noticea change in stool color (green) after switching to formula feed. In this scenario, you can try using a cotton Q-tip (cotton swab). Apply some lubrication on it and stimulate the rectal area to see if your child passes stool. If this does not help, then try seeing your local pediatrician who can help with rectal stimulation and passage of his stool.",

Whistling, he stood and walked, to somewhere, anywhere, he felt like going next. \n \n -- -- - \n It hadn't started this way. He'd just been a normal guy, living a normal life, until one day he woke to loud banging at his door. Bleary-eyed, he'd stomped to his door, opening it to find his landlord standing before him, red in the face and practically foaming at the mouth. ``Get out,'' the man had yelled at him then, shaking a rusty crowbar, ``get out of my apartment, right now! I don't ever want to see you again!'' Shocked, Tom had thrown his shoes and a jacket, and ran past the man before he had a chance to put that crowbar to use. \n \n But the outside was no better.

Shit. \n \n Next on the list was your daughter. Let me explain : Brenda gave you a girl named Annie. She's really sweet. Thirty years old. But she wanted to apply. We weren't gon na let her. Yet, she insisted.Also, this might be harsh but Brenda died soon after giving birth, in a plane crash. \n \n So what we did was we took it back to the basics. We made an iron cube and place in the machine, took it back a full ten years ( which would be impossible right? Well this was a series of experiments but I'm keeping it short.). Well guess what : iron ore. That's right. The time machine makes PEOPLE and THINGS go back. Make them younger.

      "``MOMMY! LOOK!'' \n \n I jolted awake instantly. It's not just a mother's instinct to sleep with one eye open with a child around, but it's also a mother's instinct to determine whether a ``Mommy, look!'' is being said with terror or not. There's nothing scarier than being woken up from a nap to witness a horrific accident that happened because you weren't being responsible, other than what I just saw. What I just saw... is inhuman. \n \n Marcie ( my four year-old) said it again - she knew I wasn't quite with it yet. ``MOMMY, LOOK!!!'' and she pointed to the chair. It was fucking hovering. I saw it hovering, but it didn't register. This is like something out of The Sixth Sense. I'm still dreaming, right? \n \n ``Honey, what are you doing!?'' I inquired. ``How is this even possible? Do you know there are people that go their whole lives trying to figure out these kinds of things, Marcie?'' \n \n ``Oh, mommy, it was so easy. All I had to do was tell it to move. Watch!

They came from nowhere like lightning. The world powers were all caught off guard, the UN could do nothing but watch. The world as I knew it was gone. Tokyo, Paris, Hong Kong, and Orlando all fell within hours of the uprising. It was only due to sheer luck that Shanghai remained liberated, free to become the future home of the resistance. Within days key countries were taken over, countries whose value would soon become clear. Within a month over 20 % of the world was under control of this new faction. Old rivalries were soon forgotten in order to address the new menace. The United States of America and China united soon after, forming what would simply be known as the Syndicate. \n \n The Syndicate would soon be joined by the rest of the free world.

It's high-quality and on sale for $ 15, you won't find it cheaper anywhere else!''. I felt like an obedient drone contributing to the vomit-inducing consumerist landscape of today. ``Thanks'' she said, a woman of few words but holy shit was she good looking. In-fact she was much more than just good looking. As I gazed into her eyes I came to realise that she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen in my entire 26 years on this rock. Suddenly, she caught my gaze. I felt embarrassed but then she grabbed my hand and lead me toward the fire escape. Outside we went into the alleyway ; I didn't understand what was going on but neither of us were thinking about frying pans, I can tell you that. She threw off my Walmart uniform, and with confidence, I slid off her red summer dress. We were naked outside in the pouring rain but my sex life had behind somewhat stagnant of late and I wasn't about to pass up this opportunity. ``Fuck me'' she whispered into my ears. I was about to'lock n load' when I felt an unsettling feeling in my stomach. ``I can't do it!'' I cried repeatedly. My shouts somewhat muffled until she released her breast from my mouth. ``Why?'' I yelled to the heavens above. Why had I stopped? Thats the question I ask myself everyday. My employment was promptly suspended at Walmart when a co-worker reviewed the footage from the security camera.

Arms spread out, warm and welcoming. It was Dalanar who spoke for us. \n \n ``Am I to surmise, then, that I have arrived at the home of the Three Divines?'' When the statue-woman responded with a nod, he carried on : ``May we see them?'' \n \n ``Of course. I've been told to pass this message on to you, before you go any further...'' It drew itself up, reciting from memory if such a being could have memory ; ``Yes, there are humanoid personifications of karma, luck, and fate who are expecting you. Yes, they are feminine...''

The dark and silent night is only filled by the light from my car and the slow hum from the engine. \n \n ``I need to report this.'' \n \n I take out my cell phone and I began to search his ID. There was a letter in his front shirt pocket. Written in the front, ``To my killer''. \n \n Was he expecting this? \n \n I open the letter and read it. \n \n ``You have killed me. That is a fact. Whether it was intentional or not, rest assured I do not have any qualms about it. I will die and so will you, just like everything else. However, no one likes to die. No one likes to be forgotten.

Looking for shelter, a place to recharge her batteries, a place for the baby resting in her arms to sleep easy in the oncoming night.

To protect the baby, keep it safe, find a place for it to grow up in peace and comfort, and keep it healthy and alive.

It wasn't worth it. She was uninterested. \n \n ``Do you think you could you turn that off?'' \n \n It was a whisper, from the seat next to her. Her eyes darted guiltily over to her neighbor, a male with scruffy hair, wearing an unassuming black T-shirt with a green decal she didn't recognize splayed across the front. ``Sorry.'' She quickly darkened the phone's screen and stuffed it in her pocket. \n \n ``Sorry, it's just kind of distracting, is all.'' \n \n ``Yeah.

It's a little holographic display generated, I assume, by the injection, that tells me how much time I have left. Each person I kill adds a day to it, more if I'm lucky. Thankfully ( for me) they haven't gamified this thing to such an extent that there's a scoreboard with everyone's kill count and remaining time. We all know that if we're the only four survivors, we'll have to fight each other, and that saddens me. But only slightly. The nature of our friendship was one of necessity, not one of commitment.

      "By some strange alignment in the stars, or by the powers of some deity, everyone born in 1994 was given one wish. This was discovered in 1997, when many families began to report their three-year-olds mysteriously receiving things after much time spent begging. \n \n Once the discovery was verified, the government of my country immediately mandated that all children born in 1994 be notified of their singular wish on the first day of their public education. There was a formal script to be read, explaining the importance of using the wish for good and warning of the singularity of the wish. This law was fought ferociously by parents and teachers alike, but by the time it reached courts in 1999, most students had already been notified. \n \n Naturally, most of the students ( commonly called 94's) failed to recognize the singularity of their wish, despite the teacher's warnings. Wishes were wasted on candies, pets, money, and one quite famous dinosaur ride ( fortunately, the dinosaur disapp",

She told the girl in line ahead of us at the movie theater that she liked her skirt. They had an entire conversation about fair-trade clothing while we were waiting to buy tickets. She said to a bartender that she liked the way he had made our drinks with a ``great flourish.''

As usual, my thoughts drift with the song for thirty seconds and, just before it can repeat, I swipe a finger across the screen to tell it I'm awake. \n \n The workshop starts at 9:30am and it's only 7:00am now. That gives me a half hour to shower before leaving, an hour for a train ride, and an hour of silent reflection before class. \n \n From the purple toothbrush to the shower, to the coffee shop on the third floor of Weiboldt hall, I have that same song stuck in my head. Short bursts from brass horns and the swooning voice of Zach Condin take me from the bathroom in my studio apartment to the circle of desks on the fifth floor. \n \n While I wait for the rest of the class to arrive ( the instructor is usually here by now, isn't he?), I take out my iPhone to play the song aloud.

One of the disadvantages to working the night shift at the T.A.L. construction project, people didn't feel the need to be quiet during the day when he was sleeping. He couldn't make out what was being said, but it sounded like two clearly upset people. He considered briefly if he should call the police and report a domestic disturbance, but he didn't hear any sound of actual fighting, just an argument, and the tone of the voices didn't really sound angry, just upset. \n \n They weren't calming down though, and he wasn't going to get back to sleep until they did, so he decided to turn on the news. He scooped the remote off his nightstand and absently hit the button to turn the flatscreen on the wall to CNN. As soon as the screen lit up, he knew something big was going on. The usual calm, friendly demeanor of news anchors was nowhere to be seen, the young woman who sat in front of the camera was cl",

Fast and strong.'' \n \n The hag nodded. \n \n ``She said a spell,'' he said. ``An enchantment. And told me that I would be fast and strong when I howled three times. But...'' \n \n ``Yes?'' said the hag. \n \n ``But that I would turn into a wolf!'' \n \n ``That's awful,'' the hag said. \n \n ``I laughed at her,'' the soldier said. ``And left her shack. But when I yawned this morning, a howl ripped from my throat, and I could feel hair begin to sprout on my back.'' \n \n ``Terrifying!'' the hag said calmly. \n \n ``Just now, I felt the hairs grow again,'",
      "-028 \n \n The grass was cool against my skin. In the distance a whooping crane called. *Wah-hahoot-oot-oot. Wah-hahoot-oot-oot. * I listened to it and studied the silhouttes of the family before me. The sun was nearly set and their outlines were crisp and clean in their contrast with the horizon. I wasn't going to get a better shot than this one. I rose to my feet, dragging my long blood-caked blade through the grass. *Wah-hahoot-oot-oot. * \n \n They looked off over the hill toward the crane's call. *Wah-hahoot-oot-oot. * The grass parted before me. Off to my left, I saw the grass rustling, snakes of disturbance were converging on the family. I looked to my right. More snakes of disturbance, clear trails of rustling grass. My blade clipped a stone and the family turned toward me. The mother gathered up her two children and edged away from the tall grass. The snakes stopped, everyone dropping low. The man bent over and picked something up from the ground. I could see it. It was a mach",
      "'Xtend' - that's what the unimaginative corporate pharmaceutical engine branded it as ; stolen shamelessly from a 1976 book by Nicholas Fisk. It was an innocuous white gel cap that you took with water and the 24 hour halflife meant that for the duration of the drug's lifespan in your body, your own cellular decay was halted during that time. \n Taken every day for one year, it meant that the recipient escaped the ageing process for one year. \n Of course the drug was ludicrously expensive ; only the extremely wealthy could afford it. A one year supply of Xtend cost in the region of a cool one million US dollars and required extensive vetting from the Xtend Corporation. Film stars, singers, big celebrities, millionaires and billionaires were the only ones who could afford it, naturally. Presidents and Prime Ministers were given access to it for the duration of their terms and certain beloved'heritage humans' were given it for free - like the Pope ( not that he couldn't afford it) and ot",

But no worries, I had help from my actual engineer friends in America. But seriously, I'm asking for a raise. \n \n Students keep coming by to sneer at me, which is what I expected. Whatever.

Then you lose his face as the car just kind of takes up your entire view and then nothing. \n If I had to do it all over again the only thing I'd really change is the car that did it. The difference between a smart car and say a Bentley smashing you dead is a complete tonal shift. Ones a bit more of a joke and ones a bit more of a tragedy. \n But you don't care much about that. You want to hear about what comes next. You want to hear about the nitty gritty, the real facts. What happens when your numbers up and that tickets punched. Well the truth is there really isn't much to tell. First things first you'll come to the Pearly Gates. It's pretty much everything they describe in mo",

It was actually because of all the pictures being taken that we can determine the exact moment they opened fire on us. \n \n The ships turned their noses down towards the city, aiming their thousands of guns toward our helpless, pitiless species. Then they unleashed the fury of the gods. The first volley destroyed the entirety of the docks and the boardwalk, along with most the west side. The second volley obliterated downtown. I remember cowering under my desk, praying to every god I knew to please let this nightmare end. It seems the gods decided to answer me for once. \n \n Right after the last of the second volley had hit their marks, there was once again a terrible screeching. I looked out my now destroyed window in horror, expecting the worst. Instead what I saw stunned me. Out of a rift in the sky came a magnificent pure white ship, bigger than even the capital ship of the enemies. It came out of the rift guns a-blazin",

I scrub my feet and back and then get out ; the water heater in my apartment is falling apart, and my building super just hasn't gotten around to fixing it yet.

I'm supposed to die tomorrow. \n \n It's been like this my whole life. I was born with ``tomorrow'' on my arm, and my parents watched with disbelief as I grew up.

The trees that hung in silence underneath clouds frozen overhead. \n \n Nothing moved. \n \n Nothing except the figure. The figure that hadn ’ t been there just a minute ago.

She tried to sound as sane as she could manage. “ I want to stop seeing aliens and go home to Terry. ” \n \n The doctor consulted its device then looked at her. “ Terry? ” It was a slightly discordant note in his mucic, a human word that interrupted the song. \n \n “ Terrence Gottfried.

Most would describe her as plain even unattractive, but I saw a beauty in her vulnerable face that I had never before experienced. I despised it. \n \n I saw her in a bar, alone, not a friend to be had. I wasn't sure if her death would make an impact on anyone, since she appeared lonely, and I questioned if it was even worth killing her. But it was late and there weren't any better targets.

After the preliminaries - plenty of ``Yankee'' ``imperialist'' slurs, I gathered that I was speaking to some of the last Soviet cosmonauts, sent on a last, secret, highly ambitious mission. While we were hitting golf balls on the moon, they were preparing to settle-slash-create a worker's paradise on an entirely new planet! How about that? \n \n I would have expected them to be smug about it, but they seemed genuinely angry at me. What did I ever do to them? Well, turns out they were expecting more ships, supplies, comrades, etc. within a year or two of landing. What could have stopped the mighty Soviet space program other than the very end of the USSR itself? And what could have caused that besides betrayal by the West and nuclear obliteration? With no word from home for years, they assumed the worst. So maybe it was natural for them to be pissed... \n \n Luckily for me, we've come a ",

Stanley fell into the latter category ; he figured the Hun would find a sprinting Englishman much harder to shoot. \n \n Unfortunately, it appeared fairly quickly that neither approach was particularly superior, and that the ideal approach was to avoid being blown to smithereens by the German artillery. With this in mind, Stanley found himself a crater to dive into. \n",

      "``Brevity is the soul of wit.'' - Polonius \n \n I'd heard the phrase before in passing but never really gave thought to its origin. Part of the English curriculum is studying Shakespeare. Coming across the original source of something that you've heard as part of the collective cannon of absorbed knowledge in media can be quite jarring. Polonius' statement where the above quote originates also serves as a splendid example of irony. In short one could say that Shakespeare used Polonius as a critique of other writers that may use gaudy or pompous language. \n \n Purple prose is a good skill to have mastery over but what is the cost. Time is \n valuable. One can deliberate endlessly the nuances of language twisting it or even \n playing with it with a whimsical goal in mind. I argue that a more useful method is to do as Polonius said but not as he did. Making one's words short doesn't have to be curt or callous. This exercise was an attempt to limit useful expression but I argue that a m",

I stood up, and brushed the dust off my pants. As I walked up to him, he looked up at me, and his mouth twitched in an attempt at a polite smile. \n \n ``Hello sir, mind if I sit with you? I'm a huge fan of these little guys.'' I said, giving him as honest a smile as I could muster.'' \n \n ``Oh, sure.

      "The depiction of an angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other shoulder in cartoons described my life all too well. Every morning when I woke up the two voices would be going at it. The angel would say ``Time to get out of bed Joey'' while the devil would try to persuade me ``No hit the snooze button, think how good it would feel!'' I always did what the angel told me to do because I was raised in a catholic home and knew that if I were to listen to the devil I would go to hell when I died. There was nothing in this world I was more terrified of than hell and this drove me to make all my decisions in life based off of what the angel told me to do, even though the devil provided some enticing arguments. I never felt like I could tell anyone about this because they would call me crazy, or try to put me on medication, or even worse get a priest to perform an exorcism on me, and from what the movies portrayed I knew I did not want any of that. \n \n So I lived my life as the angel co",

One year since war had reduced this land to a scorched waste as forces were brought to bear that men still did not comprehend. \n \n On the hilltop stood a girl and beside her an enormous dog, spines rising from its back and a green glow emitting from its knowing eyes.

      "\n When I was a kid, my grandfather would read to me while I went to bed. He did this most nights until I turned twelve. Usually, the stories were from my big book of fairy tales but every now and again he'd slip in a story of his own. \n \n The last time my grandfather read to me before bed, he told me a story that I thought I had heard before, the story of the lost city of Atlantis. There were a few pages in the fairy tale book about the city and I had seen the Saturday morning cartoons where they went to the mythical land. I thought I knew everything about this story. Yet when my grandfather told his version, it was different. \n According to my grandfather Atlantis wasn't a great city but just a few houses on a small rock that floated in the ocean. The people never angered the gods and the island never sank. It was a lack luster place with average people who left the island to persue better lives. Grandfather's story was nothing like the stories I had heard before. The next night my grandfather went missing. \n \n We never saw my grandfather again and never knew what happened but life goes on. \n \n Years later they started draining the ocean, for mars colonization. All the lost treasures of sea where found. Gold from a sunken pirate ship, miles and miles of trash, anything that was ever made by man was found on the sea floor. But these where nothing in comparison to what they found at the bottom of the marinas trench. Way down in the lowest depths of the earth, there was a grand city. The city of Atlantis. \n \n It was just as the myths described and nothing like my grandfather's story. It was a bustling city with thousands of people and business. It was vibrant and full of life. And in the very middle of the city, there he was. My grandfather, that lying bastard, standing next to the missing Malaysian airline and sm",

Something must have kicked in on a subconscious level when the Gal'aya blew up Earth fifteen years ago, because ever since then I can't get enough alien tail. And often, yes, I'm putting my dick in a tail, or a stomach, or a head, or wherever this certain species has its reproductive organ, just to trick my brain into thinking I made a second human. \n \n The Gal'aya abducted me twenty-years ago, a dashing lad of twenty-three. Fresh out of Columbia's Delta Sigma Phi. Brown hair, blue eyes, a hint of a beard at all times. Six foot one, a buck eighty, pretty muscular.

My armor and weapons were in peak condition, but my humanity was slowly beginning to slip away. \n \n I had no idea how many times I had lived this scene before. Each time the same, I approached the hollowed giant, and each time his bladed chain sliced me in half. No matter how much I rolled away, he always found his mark.

Glowing lightly, ticking down to 1 year from now. \n \n I looked at my husband's side of my closet, and felt a sense of dread wash over me. I glanced at the sleek suits, the pile of workout shirts, and the line of running shoes. Justin was currently out on a 10-mile run, but I knew where his watch was tucked away. I dove into the box of running watches and stopwatches, and pulled out another ticking watch. It had three hours left. \n \n When Justin got home, I sat quietly with both watches in my hands, tears brimming in my eyes. I asked him if he knew - he said he did. I stared down at the watches, re-living the last four years. We'd been perfect together from the second our watches stopped ticking that night on the beach. But honestly - the last year had been different. I'd gone on anti-depressants, found my groove at work, and had finally started to feel like I knew who I was. I was someone who didn't need to rely on Justin to reinforce my value. I was someone who didn't want to go on 10-mile runs. I was someone who didn't want to wash my husband's clothes while bouncing a baby with a smile on my face. \n \n I knew I wanted a different life from the one I wanted years ago. And Justin deserved the wife that wanted to fulfill those roles for him. I looked back up at Justin and we shared a look that said it all. Today was the day he found his next s",

He found it harder to hide his smile. Suddenly, he split his arms apart as if he was presenting himself, and he began levitating off of the floor. It was a display of power, of control. Even the most talented Rule Breakers could not stay afloat for so long. The three youngsters' jaws dropped slightly. To them, this was the equivalent of witnessing a miracle. \n \n ``Well... we can offer you all of that. But we need to know a bit more about you three before we let you in.

A fan shifted this humid mass from one end of the shop to another. \n \n A gust of air swept in, as the door swished and chimed an abrasive electronic warning. The half-dozing young man behind the counter opened one eye, never removing his head from his hand and said : \n \n ``Mrwh?'' \n \n My eyes were dry, and i blinked slowly back into the sweaty, yellow light of the cafe.

Grandma Alice was sobbing into her handkerchief as Uncle Jay had his arm around her. I was very very perplexed about her relationship with Grandpa Joe.

My Grandpa Joe and Grandma Alice had thirteen children between them. My late Uncle Steve drowned when he was seven. That means they still hav",

The plane seemed to explode apart and my seat was the epicenter of that explosion. Chaos erupted. The cabin depressurized. Oxygen masks exploded from the ceiling and the plane fell from the sky in a tailspin so violent that staying conscious was difficult. A few moments later we smashed into the ocean and my hands are gripping the arm rests of my original seat and everything is back the way it was. I relaxed my painful grip and placed my hand over my heart. It was beating so fast I thought I was going to die. But then, I just had. \n \n I got up and returned to the seat further back in the plane. I had 6 hours to contemplate what was happening to me. I spent most of that time staring out the window.

Ever since the Gary's began their campaign there has been a resurgence in flowers in the area. People thought that the bees were going to die off but they instead grew to almost as many numbers as the Gary's did once the event started. Not like the bees even matter anymore. \n \n Me and my group have been hiding inside the art museum for the last few months. Every once in a while we will see a Gary hunting in its own and we lure it into our traps by putting down a Andy Mineo album or a basketball, or a pair of Nike shoes. The key to the trap is to make sure the item is sprayed with women's perfume. That's he Gary's weakness, women. We figure the smell given off by the flowers is the reason the Gary's have been so persistent in planting and pollinating them all over, it remind them of women. \n \n There are not many women left though, Hell, there are many men either.

The Bitter Rain is bad, but as long as your eyes and mouth are covered, you can manage just fine. It's actually my favorite to be on post in. The Perimeter Field, flat as a frycake, fills with puddles that swell and merge, and when the smog clears for just long enough the light plays one of its funny tricks. The perimeter looks like an endless mirror of dark gray sky. \n \n In reality, it's of course just an ankle-deep shallows of poison. But it's still pretty. There isn't much of that left. \n \n I like the rain. You know, if I have my mask. \n \n Wind is the worst.

      "``Is nothing here worth saving?'' my dad asked, sitting back on his heels. The back room was cluttered, with metal shelves lining cement walls. His hair, normally dark with small shots of white hair, had shifted into a dull grey from dust. Lines deepened on his face as he surveyed the room. I looked away. \n \n ``I don't know. It's hard to tell when there's so... much.'' I said, clearing my throat as best I could. On the shelves lay lumps of blankets, Christmas decorations, wreathes, and sundry other keepsakes. I reached out an ran a finger over a glass figurine the size of my palm. It was in the form of an evergreen, cheap, and layered in dust. ``Maybe the desk?'' \n \n My dad stood, his head nearly brushing the ceiling. Yet, he appeared smaller than normal, his shoulders slumped down as if uncertain of how to fill the empty spaces of the room. ``No, the leg is cracked, and the rest of it is only a bump away from collapsing.'' \n \n I grunted, focusing more on the glass evergreen. My fingers had cleared off a strip of its dust, and the tree glimmered at me, light passing through it to the other side. ``Why'd she keep all this anyway?'' \n \n ``It's hard to let go.'' \n \n ``So that's our job?'' \n \n A shrug from my dad. ``I'll get boxes ; we can donate it,'' he said finally, heading for the door. \n \n ``She held on to this for so many years, and we toss it out the next day?'' \n \n My dad sighed. ``It might be hard to let go, but you can't hold on forever.'' His face turned towards the door, I couldn't see his expression, only hear the exhaustion in his voice. ``And holding on hurts far worse than letting go.'' \n \n I stared at the cheap glass tree as my dad left. It was useless, worthless, and not even pretty, but I tucked it into my sweatshirt pocket as I headed for the door. The trinket settled there. Its weight stretching the fabric downwards as it bounced in my pocket and poked at my stomach with its fake branches. Still, when I left the room behind me, my fingers found the cool glass, and they curled ar",

      "The smoke from the old rickety chimneys finally ceased. I was astonished that the massive grey cloud hovering above us has finally managed to give way. The news was everywhere. ``Large Megacorporation Scraps Citywide Industrialization Scheme''. \n My city was one of the worst affected by the so-called Urbanization Initiative. After the heavy equipment came, our quaint neighbourhoods were leveled and parks flattened to make way for the factories. Many people were forcibly relocated to slums with conditions parallel to the medieval ages. I was no exception. \n \n My family contracted severe respiratory illnesses, but that was already the standard in our city and many more that were exploited. We suffered and mourned by the millions as the death toll surged. And yet, we received minimal attention because they claimed ``It would create more jobs''. \n \n As I slowly unfastened my mask and gazed up into the sky, a gleaming light penetrated the darkness and radiated a section of the road ahead. I stared wide-eyed into the patch of light and muttered under my breath while forcing a smile, ``Maybe, there is still h",

He'd be the guy to argue with the teacher when I sent them on the aforementioned tirade. He was a passionate debater and sometimes let his emotions get the better of him. When backed against a figurative corner he'd sometimes flee from class and I'd find him huddled by his locker silently crying. He'd get into fights for this, especially if I wasn't the first person to see him in that state. His bullies were quick to hover around him. \n \n That was before he melted their faces off. At first he thought he was going to be a hero. A full fledged flamethrower of justice. That's what I thought we could be, but he couldn't control himself.

      "Well, given that the moon is magical, it seems pretty straightforward that something in powerful and overwhelming contact with the moon would experience imbuement. Just take a look at the history of dogs - regular contact with humanity over thousands of years sufficed to dislodge them from the link with the Forest Mother. Considering the sun's output, the age of the universe ( 40kyo? I think the sages are saying right now? I'm not clear on the latest research) and the regularity of contact it's a pretty obvious result. I mean, even with the First Dark accounted for - that only lasted for a few hundred years, kind of a blip in the grand scheme of things. \n \n Anyway, it's not like I'm a professional nature-reader myself - I deal with symbol twisting day to day - but my understanding is that the souls the First Designer locked into the moon are what gives most of its magical properties.

Every building was adorned with yellow roof tiles and horse sculptures, beautiful in their uniformity. At the bottom of the stairs was a small but quaint courtyard, and at the center stood a giant tree, full of radiant pink blossoms that seemed to emanate waves of healing. I remember buying my son this game, but I never knew it could be this visually stunning. \n \n ``No lollygagging,'' the guard droned, hands at his side, motionless. I figured it was as good a time as any to just walk and explore. \n \n As I took my first step down the stairs my ears were immediately assaulted by what seemed to be some priest shouting a ridiculous sermon. Something about a Talos. What the hell is Talos? *Hmm, * I thought, *probably should stay away from that guy. He's probably like a Jehovah's Witness equivalent. * ",

I decided not to press the issue lest he decided to throw me out. \n \n \n'So, why can't you live above ground?' \n \n \n'It's dangerous above ground. Besides there is nothing up there. Above ground, below ground, doesn't make a difference.' As I said these words, a revelation struck me. Now I understood why this place felt familiar, this was how the old world would've been before everything was destroyed. I had seen paintings and images of the old world when I was young, I just didn't make the connection as the real thing was infinitely more beautiful than any image could ever convey. \n \n \n I noticed a deep sadness in the old man's face, he appeared to be on the verge of tears.'Wh..What happened?' he asked with a trembling voice. \n \n \n'It's a",

They knew him all too well. With a Moon Knight comic on his chest and earbuds holding fast, Kenneth dreamt of his IRA and those karaoke nights. He wasn't much for the fantastic sense of free time. \n \n Enter the night crew. A group of six. Friends by no means, but connected by their love of all things polka. They traded rolling out the barrel for cleaning carts, but knew a job is a job. Especially on that one night every quarter where, as they called it, the ``full wipe down'' occurred complete with steam, disinfectant, and conviction. Twenty minutes of elbow grease and three ill-timed jokes about a custodian's recently passed mother, Kenneth jumped out of his chair... startled... not from insincerity, but from the billions of microscreams he neve",

I really hadn't gotten much done, so I flipped the page and started on something else. I didn't know what I was drawing, I just kept going. About half way through, I noticed what it was. It was the creature that Lucas had shown me earlier, the one that I stabbed. \n \n Clearly it messed me up in the head, because I couldn't stop drawing it.

I'll talk to him this time. You can come along to distract him'' I said as I rose from my chair, sighing. But inside I was actually quite excited. Our lives were filled with boredom, and this bit of excitement was quite fun. Last time it happened we talked about it for a week.

As I speak, the human population of the planet is succumbing to an apparently incurable and fast-moving disease that appears to target the human genome in such a way as to resequence and reorder DNA. Put simply, people are collapsing and, in a very short amount of time, reverting to their basic chemical components. \n \n \n Something similar is occurring with our infrastructure and technology : Buildings, bridges, dams, roads, vehicles, skyways, telecommunications and satellites – in short, anything made by man – are being reduced to their component chemicals and substances at an astonishing rate. Communications, both worldwide and offworld, are quickly deteriorating to the point of impossibility. \n \n \n That we are under deliberate attack is made clear by the fact that no other organism on the planet – nor any natural structure – has been affected adversely. Quite the contrary – it appears that both the atmosphere and ocean biomes, for example, have somehow begun to regenerate",

Some of my better pieces still hung about the walls, while two or three had fallen, their presence marked only by dusty outlines like the chalk tracing around a murder victim. The majority of work though, about 10 years ’ worth of unsold paintings, sat stacked in various piles around the room. \n \n The beam of my flashlight scanned the room slowly, crawling over empty paint containers and torn up canvases until it stopped just short of the center.

The mold set itself up inside of buildings and anything made of wood or anywhere with standing water.. by the time it was identified, it had infected everyone.

As he walked onto the main deck, he saw all of the other crew members excitedly looking out the windows, faces pressed against the glass.

I searched all through the house, and all around the yard, and there was not a soul in sight. \n \n I sat on the sofa and cried for several minutes. I loved that dog. He was there for me through everything : the fights, the divorce, the depression, the anxiety. All of it, and there he was, or at least what was left of him. \n \n I thought of calling the police, but I didn't know what I would say to them. It wasn't like there were some strange monsters just hiding in houses and eating people's pets. Surely, this was an act of some heinous person who managed to sneak in and get away undetected. I wouldn't have the first clue for them. ``Oh well'', I finally sighed, and cleaned up the mess the best I could while I tried to control my sobs. \n \n Later that night, I was watching TV, holding Dogbert's favorite pillow close.

My father took me into his special room the night that we all found out about Godric's family's wealth, and he beat me. This time, however, I noticed something was missing from his strikes. Before, though it never seemed like it, he had had love in his hits. Disgusting, warped love expecting too much of a little girl, but love and hope nonetheless. This time, he didn't hold back. His breath stank like it did when he had been at the tavern too late at night, though he had never beaten me those nights. Every strike came with an insult, and after he hit me three times more than he had ever hit me, the fear returned. Too late, of course to be useful, but it was real : he was going to kill me. He had a worthless daughter who would at best be some servant to a rich family, a family like Godric's. When he finally stopped and undid my hands and feet",

Where's the real harm done in it?'' \n \n ``Well, for starters, I'm pretty sure that's how someone ends up in the nut house. You know, why am I even having this argument with you? You're just me after all.'' \n \n ``You know as well as I do that it's because of your silly fascination with seeing things from all angles ; Hell, why don't you just go the full monty and talk to all of us today?'' \n \n I sat up as my conversation with myself brought my mind wandering towards the DMT sitting nearby ; Not as open and in view as the cannabis that was frequently used, more hidden away. \n \n ``You sure about that?

Astoria was a girl he barely knew, having met her months ago when he had first moved into the dorms as the girl that was ``not really girlfriend but sort of'' to his roommate. They had exchanged numbers in case either of them ever needed to get a hold of his roommate when the other wasn't available, but he definitely never expected a text from her now, considering how the two had broken things off almost ten months ago. \n \n Tapping on the name, Christian sighed as he read the two text messages that she had sent him. \n \n **Hey are you free to come",

At first, I thought I could handle them by putting everyone into a city, and building a hierarchy of power so that the universe is governed well. I divided the universe up, and gave them certain areas of space that they were allowed to monitor and control, but the ones left in the city were very annoying.

But there's so much I still had to talk about, stories you needed to reretell and questions I needed and wanted to ask -- about your youth, your time in the REME and your adult life -- I only knew you for a fraction of it, and there's so much I don't know. \n \n Visiting Barry, your childhood city and final resting place was nice, too. But seeing your grave, your name, one of several, on one of thousands of headstones dotting the commercialised, sellout of the crematorium was sad, and humbling. I felt like that degraded you -- you were just one of the billions who passed before you. I don't believe in an afterlife -- and it breaks my heart to think that one day, I will be old, hardly remember or care about you, and when I pass, no one will know your name, your laugh or your stories. That'll be your so-called'second death'. \n \n And it frightens me, that you, me, mum dad and everyone will experience that. I'm scared of that, and I'm sad, because I can no longer hug you -- as you're dressed in suspenders, a bleached white shirt and your trademark hat.

I want to believe that it's not genetics, but the upperclassmen in my high school all have talents similar to their parents', whether in power or properties. Even Jeff Knox once said on TV that he was thankful for his parents, and while that could mean many things, my mind makes the worst of it. With my luck and my family's genes, I'll probably get a useless talent like burrowing underground so that I can quite *literally* shape the world. \n \n 3 hours from now is the midnight of my birthday.

      "What do you do when you run out of ideas?! With the upcoming release of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, James Gunn has to sort those problems out.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGunn is taking a break from the director of movies such as Super, Slither and Slither 2 to work on the sequel, and he has revealed that he's struggling a little, to say the least. He's trying to brainstorm and come up with new ideas, but then he just runs out of ideas.\n\n\nSo then you start to feel the pressure to come up with new things… The Guardians are the most famous group of people in the universe. Do you just get in the car and do something crazy, or do you think about what you could do?\n\n\nJames Gunn: I had the freedom to do what I thought was interesting, and now it's about trying to make a fun film that's not just a sequel. At the same time I have to sort of be careful. I have a family and a small business and an infant in the car seat. So it's getting tougher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, you know, I just finished a couple of films with a lot of other people and they're fun. And there's this thing, too: I am the guy who wrote and directed the movie Independence Day. I was working on the book and I was very much like, \"God there's not going to be a sequel to that,\" but then it got in all sorts of trouble. It was a $200 million [budget]. It was a big film, it was a big deal. I did not have enough room [to make the sequel that I wanted], so in a way that was an inspiration for these films.\n\nI feel that I'm at a similar stage in this one. It's a sequel, so why not do something with different people? This one is going to be fun to make. It's a little less ambitious than the first. I have some great actors. It's just a very, very good thing to have.\n\nSo is a lot of that pressure off because we have the success of Guardians in mind?\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGunn: The other thing I wanted was that I needed to honor this thing that has been such a big part of my life. I've been watching movies since I was old enough to be watching movies. I started off with the Superman comics, and those films helped shape me and made me more interested in science fiction. Now, I was in college when I was going to see the first X-Men and I started learning about this whole superhero thing and the idea of doing things that were not just superheroes. If I wanted to do the next film I had this knowledge behind me.\n\nI have so much more in common with the people who are making these movies than I did when I was a kid. It's like all of my dreams, my dreams, have come true, in a way that's so powerful. Now we have a group of people who have the best sense of science fiction around that are also people and people who are going to make fantastic films. So, you know, if a big movie like X-Men came along at a time where I didn't have that much of my life to fall back on this experience is more powerful if that's what I want to take and it's the only choice I have. So I guess I have to accept it.\n\nWhat do you remember about working with Groot in Avengers: Infinity War?\n\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGunn: That was the only time I was able to make something that was Groot that felt very alive. And it was very scary, but he was just so real there. In my movie he's talking to me about the dangers of space and he's talking to me in his natural tongue. I felt like he was a part of the movie. But they had to change Groot a million times and change his DNA and things, and I don't know if Groot's a creature that you just put in the movie and you can never change him. I really liked the fact that you had to keep him in the mix. He did the right thing in helping the crew. He's never going to go down there and have a happy meal with all these dinosaurs.\n\nI don't think anyone will question that he was a part of the group. And I have to say, there is a moment where I'm like, \"O.K., they've got him for like three seconds—and he does some good stuff.\"",
      "LONDON -- After spending eight seasons as a New England Patriot, wide receiver Wes Welker is joining the Denver Broncos.\n\nWelker was to sign an exclusive rights free agent deal with Denver before his old team decided to match the offer sheet from the Houston Texans.\n\n\"I think it's awesome. I think it's going to be fun,\" Welker said on Wednesday when asked for his reaction to being signed by the Broncos. \"I mean, I always knew when you get into the NFL, I always knew that there was going to be an opportunity. But going to an organization that just had a Super Bowl victory last year. Just to be part of that and feel that the organization is going to push me even higher.\"\n\nWelker had signed with a Houston offer sheet earlier before agreeing to terms with the Broncos. Welker will play for his fifth team in nine seasons and will earn about $6 million.\n\nDespite the long offseason for his deal, Welker admitted it feels good to be a part of a new organization.\n\nWELKER: We will be the top receiver here\n\n\"Being in a new situation, just being around it, it's more than just you have to go, here is an offer sheet,\" Welker said of the opportunity to sign with the Broncos. \"Now, you got to go sign it, and that gets on your brain. You got to go sign it, and then once you sign it you have to go back with your family and you have to go sign it with your agent to make sure that it actually works.\"\n\nWelker is one of the most accomplished receivers in NFL history. He won a Super Bowl to help New England win a championship in 2004 and in 2012 captured both of his individual MVP awards.\n\n\"There was going to be opportunities, but this was the best one that I've had. I love the organization, I love the coaching staff, I love the ownership,\" Welker said. \"There are a lot of great players coming to Denver, and there's going to be some great competition there. I'll enjoy that competition.\"\n\nWelker, 31, played with 11 different quarterbacks while with the Patriots, including four with quarterback Tom Brady. He also earned some time at wide receiver with New England before settling in as the second-best receiver of his era (2000-present) behind Deion Branch, with an average of 14.7 yards per catch. Welker, who turns 32 on Friday, averaged 17.3 yards per catch during his final two seasons in New England and has been one of the NFL's top receiving threats over the past 827 games of his career.\n\n\"I've just done everything for them,\" Welker said of the Patriots. \"I mean, I've been the team's best player, I've been their best offensive player, I've been their best special teams player, and as far as I know, they won three Super Bowls, so to win two Super Bowls in four years that shows me how good the team was that year. It was all done with my best efforts.\"\n\nDespite the Patriots' two Super Bowl wins with Welker during that stretch, the wide receiver also said he believes the offensive line in New England is still a work in progress since Brady was unable to have a perfect performance or an unimpeded week of practice.\n\n\"You still have to learn things. You still have to feel that pressure off and the feeling of it when you're under that pressure that you have to try to be perfect and you've got to try to get back to basics and things like that,\" Welker said. \"I think that's something that we'll all come back to once again, the learning curve, learning your own limitations and how to do it in the right way.\"\n\nWelker is not just a receiving target for Brady. He's a valuable part of the offensive game plan as well.\n\nThe Patriots have led the league in passing yards this season with an average of 305.5 yards per contest, an average that is nearly 3,000 yards ahead of next-best Kansas City, with whom the Broncos play on Friday night.\n\nWelker has caught 10 passes for 107 yards and two touchdowns this season. He has 16 receptions for 212 yards and five TDs in six career games against the Broncos.\n\nInformation from ESPN NFL analyst Louis Riddick and The Associated Press was used in this report.",

They were expelled because of a few comments of theirs (in the House),\" Mr Prasad told the Lok Sabha. \"But it is political vendetta...it is sad,\" Mr Prasad said.The two expelled leaders were BJP MPs Sakshi Maharaj and Anurag Thakur, who had earlier in the day questioned the government over GST.Mr Thakur had questioned the Centre over its \"lack of transparency\" over its policies, and claimed the GST Council under which the tax reform was being worked, had been constituted \"behind closed doors\".When the Minister was asked specifically about remarks made by Mr Thakur in the Upper House over the BJP's GST policy, Mr Prasad said \"no comment\" could be made.\"When somebody is seen speaking in the House, we will make a comment. I will not say anything about that. In fact, the person is responsible for what he is saying in the House. The Speaker must take a call and act against him. It was a very regrettable matter.\"The two Congress members, however, raised serious charges that were supported by many BJP members in the House, including Prakash Javadekar. \"BJP's Prime Ministerial candidate Narendra Modi had said in Mumbai that we had to be wary over the GST, but that is no business of this House,\" Mr Thakur alleged.The Congress MPs also alleged that the two speakers were forced to impose a one-day-long suspension on Mr Thakur and Mr Maharaj, alleging, \"the government was trying to take up the GST issue only and get rid of its 'anti-corruption' enemies.\" Mr Maharaj had in a speech today accused the government of having \"blood on its hands\".Speaking in the Lok Sabha, Mr Prasad rejected allegations made by Mr Thakur and Mr Maharaj that his government had not yet submitted its GST policy to the parliament. He said the \"government's GST policy would be published in the next few days\".In the Rajya Sabha as well, the BJP's Parliamentary Affairs Minister Venkaiah Naidu said the party had not made any statement on the matter because it will be discussed in the Upper House as well.\"It is a matter for the government. I do not know what has happened, it is a new issue in the Lok Sabha,\" Mr Naidu said.The Lok Sabha was adjourned twice after the House was adjourned by Speaker Sumitra Mahajan.The Lok Sabha later got up for the morning session without the two speakers.Later, while speaking at a rally in Amethi, the PM's Office made it clear that Mr Thakur and Mr Maharaj were not welcome to BJP and Congress gatherings.",
      "The city of Baltimore agreed to settle a lawsuit filed by a former state correctional officer who was sexually assaulted by an inmate who is still in county custody.\n\nDawud El-Amin, 47, sued the city for civil rights violations in federal court. The suit was filed in June 2013 on behalf of El-Amin and the state of Maryland.\n\nAfter a lengthy investigation and multiple visits from police, the Maryland Department of Public Safety took into custody 37-year-old Brandon Linsley in October. Linsley remains in the county jail in Jessup. The case against Linsley, who has not been charged in the case, has been resolved.\n\nBaltimore police initially arrested Linsley and found sexual assault evidence inside his dorm room. The department's Forensic Science Unit and the state's Attorney's Office both declined to file criminal charges.\n\nAfter interviewing El-Amin, the police department agreed to drop all charges, according to court documents.\n\nEl-Amin sued the city over its failure to properly investigate and address his claims, alleging violations of the Baltimore City Human Rights Act and the federal Civil Rights Act. The former corrections officer, who works at the Baltimore City Detention Center, said he believed that the department had failed him in his duty to provide and maintain a safe and comfortable work environment.\n\nThe state's complaint, which is based on federal law, specifically cites El-Amin's allegations regarding the department's treatment of him.\n\nIn a statement, City State's Attorney Marilyn J. Mosby said there had been no settlement reached. \"I am disappointed that the litigation was not resolved earlier.\" She said the settlement would require a judge to approve it since the parties did not meet.\n\n\"We want to hold our employees to the highest standards, and I am committed to ensuring the highest standards are met when it comes to investigations into allegations of sexual misconduct by Baltimore City employees,\" Mosby said.\n\nThe lawsuit was filed less than a week before the first of the four state trials on allegations of systemic abuse against the nation's largest corrections system entered its final phase.\n\nDuring the jury selection process, the law firm of Pepper Hamilton, an expert witness in the sexual assault scandal involving the Los Angeles Police Department that rocked that city for many years, was hired by the state to assist with the selection process.\n\nThe law firm worked from the moment the case was filed until closing arguments.\n\nEl-Amin's attorney, David Schoenhorn, said they would seek an injunction that would prevent any police from entering the jail until the case is settled.\n\nSchoenhorn said he was satisfied with the settlement.\n\nBaltimore attorney James Johnson, who is not connected with the El-Amin case and who also represented Linsley in his criminal case, said it was \"too premature\" to say if the settlement would force any changes of policy or conduct at Baltimore's jails or anywhere else in the city's criminal justice system.\n\n\"If it results in something that leads to better supervision or supervision of employees, that would be good,\" Johnson said.\n\njfenton@baltsun.com",
      "(Mental Floss) -- One of the greatest mysteries in the history of aviation is what made two French airplanes that flew the first transatlantic flights, in 1918, fly for so few minutes.\n\nWhile modern planes can often fly for five to 10 hours without taking off, the two French aircraft took much longer to reach their intended destinations. The original French airships were much more like airplanes than a dirigible. They were powered by pressurized steam that burned through a stack of combustible nitrocellulose fuel, and ran on internal liquid oxygen -- neither of which exist in commercially produced airplane fuel today. In addition, they had no landing gear, and didn't fly like today's airplanes do.\n\nThe problem wasn't just the engines. They weren't good for more than a couple of takeoffs per hour, and when they ran out of steam, they were no faster than a sailboat. There were other trouble spots: Each airplane had to use about 8,000 gallons of fuel to fly one mile (about 13.5 kilometers). So the French government decided to build two identical airplanes that had identical engines (one with an extra cylinder), two identical propellers (which had to be the same size), and two identical propeller shafts, but which were also built around two different types of electric generators: a small gas turbine in the front and a much bigger liquid-propelled electric motor in the back.\n\nIn theory, this would greatly reduce the fuel consumed by each airplane, but that didn't take place until years after the first successful flights -- and not only because of technical problems. In the end, those two engines ran so hot that they were only used to power the airplanes' engines for a brief period of time during each engine's run. And then they had to be turned off before the airships were even able to touch down -- a very time-consuming process.\n\nTo make matters worse, both of the French airships came equipped with electric elevators -- which didn't even work on the original ships, because the gas generator in the back couldn't run them. That left only one option if you wanted to travel across the Atlantic: a sail.\n\nWhen the first airships were in commercial operation, their use was limited mainly to science. The problem was that their limited range forced pilots to stay behind for long stretches in flight, which forced them to use up so much fuel that they didn't have much left to fuel the next leg of the flight. And when it came to science, nothing is more destructive to a scientist's schedule than a long and tedious trip.\n\nBut over the next couple of years, airplanes were able to make transoceanic flights faster than the original airships were able to fly across the Atlantic: In 1926, a B-24 bomber flying from England landed in New York after about seven hours. By 1928, four flights over 10 days had taken the two airships to Newfoundland.\n\nIn 1934, the first flight from Newfoundland to England took just over 11 hours, and by 1937, a trip took just over 13 hours. And in the 1950s, they were able to fly across the Atlantic in a little over 10 hours -- including a six hour flight in 1962 in a B-29 Superfortress nicknamed the \"Fat Man\" that had to be turned around twice.\n\nWhile airships were originally intended to be used as cruise ships and as \"floating laboratories,\" their use in the early days of science was limited to experimental work. And when they were used in the 1960s, they were mostly used to travel through underground tunnels -- which can be used to save a person in a dangerous situation -- or to conduct medical experiments.\n\nEven on the more advanced planes available today, only few of the parts necessary to make even one airplane are available commercially. But that hasn't stopped the designers and construction crews of the Airlander 10. Today, the airships are only used for research and military testing, although it's possible for the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration to send a few of them out as part of the International Space Station.",
      "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: I want to go now to the recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings striking down two major parts of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, a set of laws designed to protect black voters from intimidation by the Ku Klux Klan and the state. The majority opinion invalidated the formula Congress designed to give more rights to blacks than whites over election contests. That formula was designed to protect minorities from being able to keep the electoral power of the majority because states with a history of discrimination or low participation rates in electoral politics would have to make changes. The new ruling struck down a provision that allowed plaintiffs to bring lawsuits to challenge a particular jurisdiction that made changes in voting rules or practices. The justices concluded that requiring specific compliance with the formula amounted to an unconstitutional racial quota. This is a striking moment, because the Voting Rights Act was used to stop states from trying to protect the electoral power of white people over black people. But the ruling was issued only by the Supreme Court, not the appeals courts. And this case was not even about the Voting Rights Act, because the case originated in Texas, which is a state covered by the Voting Rights Act and where the state legislature passed new restrictions and a new formula in 2011, even before the Supreme Court had struck down the first formula. The justices found no racial bias, no discrimination, in Texas because it had changed the formula in 2011.\n\nFor more, we're joined right now by two guests, Marjorie Cohn, a New York Times reporter covering the Supreme Court, the chief election consultant to the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights, who was there for the argument, as we mentioned. She's heading a new study about what happened in the 2012 election. As she puts it, the Voting Rights Act was used to stop a state from trying to protect the electoral power of white people over black people, but not to stop the kind of discrimination that would actually make voting harder for minorities. And she joins us as well, by phone from New York.\n\nWe're going to be joined by Alice R. Chaplin. She's a senior fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University's School of Law, author of a study of the impact of new voter identification requirements that were imposed in states like North Carolina and Kansas, among others.\n\nAlice, let's begin with what happened in North Carolina before the Supreme Court's ruling.\n\nALICE CHAULIN: Good evening.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You've had the chance to listen to the arguments and the arguments over two different sets of decisions. The second—the first one will be announced today about voting access, a state of North Carolina voting case.\n\nALICE CHAULIN: Yeah.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: You heard two arguments from both sides earlier in the week. The court decided to hear those arguments, but they've given themselves almost two hours of time to do so today. What was your reaction to the court ruling? And what is the impact of the current voter ID laws, like Wisconsin's new ID law?\n\nALICE CHAULIN: Well first of all, congratulations on getting the decision, although I don't think you're going to be able to tell the justices what they want to hear. I was kind of hoping you're going to pick one of the four, which might be a little bit more likely to do what they say is right. And they did pick North Carolina. And I don't think the justices are going to want to go in and look at all these other states. I think they're going to want to take a very thoughtful look at what the legislators had to look at. They did decide to take a look at Georgia, though, because that law, which Georgia passed in 2005 and it's in effect, I think, until 2014 at least, required photo ID for the vote. And the Georgia law did not, by itself, seem to have any discriminatory effect. But it was passed. So the court now will have a chance to consider a lot of questions about the history of the Voting Rights Act, and I think will do a really good, objective and thoughtful job of evaluating the impact that the new laws in states like North Carolina have had, like Indiana's law that will not allow people with felony convictions to vote.\n\nAnd then also the issue of photo ID, the fact that there's a federal law, Section 5, that says that no discriminatory changes in voting can be made in states that have made a lot of progress to restore voting rights and have had changes, I think, relatively recently, in their voting laws that weren't that—you know, that weren't terribly discriminatory. So I think the court is going to have to make sure it doesn't go down that road and strike down the law at that point, because this was passed with voter ID in mind. And also, after the decision, there's a hearing scheduled for Oct.",
      "By: Jason Scott\n\nA new set of studies suggest that eating at a fast-food restaurant might not be so bad after all for your health. The latest research suggests that people eating one regular-serving-size portion at a fast-food restaurant per week are at least half as likely to die within the next year as are people who avoid fast-food altogether. Even better, eating fewer than seven fast-food meals a week appeared to have a protective effect on a wide range of chronic diseases.\n\nOf course, those results are based on data from just 12,000 people. But these results are not just good news for fast food purveyors. The findings from these recent studies indicate that eating a healthy, balanced diet at home is one of the most key ways to ensure that your aging body is in good health and can continue to fight infection.\n\nMost people assume that fast food and poor diet cause obesity as they work their way through the restaurant's aisles and try to sate their hungry appetites. But the latest studies suggests that this is not the case. While eating fast food is associated with increased risk for obesity among other health conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, it is associated with lower rates of diabetes, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, gallbladder disease, diabetes mellitus, and breast and ovarian cancer. Furthermore, eating fast food is associated with a lower risk of lung cancer, as measured by lung cancer mortality, while eating healthfully may, in fact, increase lung cancer risk.\n\nIf this all makes you feel sick to your stomach, there is good news. Recent studies have also shown that for men and women age 40–55 years old, eating two or fewer fast-food meals a week actually has a protective effect on cardiovascular disease risk. Other recent studies are finding similar effects even among middle-aged men and women who are neither overweight nor obese.\n\nThese are among the most compelling findings in a growing family of studies that suggest eating a healthy diet is one of the best ways to fight the spread of chronic diseases. In a recent review of 20 medical studies that examined the association between fast-food consumption and health outcomes, only one study failed to find a protective effect.\n\nSo what might be behind this finding? Researchers believe it may be the food that fast food restaurants serve because fast-food restaurants are known to be associated with serving unhealthy food, like sodium-laden hamburgers and fried dough.\n\nThe good news is that most fast-food restaurants don't serve healthful food. According to a 2007 study based on responses from people who had visited more than 300 fast-food restaurants across the country (over 400 restaurant categories, with a total of 2.5 million visits), nearly a quarter of surveyed establishments serve either fried food, hamburgers, or fast-food sandwiches. Other studies have found that fast-food menus tend to be laden with fat and sodium. In a recent survey of fast food restaurant menus in 17 major American cities, a large percentage of restaurants offered burgers that came in two, three, or more pieces, but no more than four. A smaller percentage offered vegetables, salad dressing, or a side-of-the-menu item. Fast-food restaurants, in short, tend to offer fast—and easily palatable—food that is the opposite of a healthy diet.\n\nHowever, these foods are not the only culprits. Fast-food restaurants' food is not always healthful either. This isn't just because they tend to be calorie-dense, but also because they're lacking in key nutrients like essential fatty acids, vitamins A and D, and antioxidants. One recent study found that people who eat fast-food more often also tend to eat fewer fruits and vegetables. They often also take in higher amounts of total fat, cholesterol, saturated fat, and sodium.\n\nIn addition, the studies suggest that the effects of fast-food consumption on disease risk are not simply due to a lack of whole foods such as fruits and vegetables. Fast-food restaurants also tend to serve lots of processed food, like ready-to-serve meals that have likely already been reconstituted. This high-sodium, high-fat-and-sugars menu makes people less likely to eat other types of foods that are important for disease risk reduction. Finally, fast-food restaurants may be responsible for creating unhealthy environments as well. According to the 2007 National Health and Nutrition Examination survey, more than a quarter of fast-food restaurants located in urban areas offer free Wi-Fi, which may increase exposure to food commercials.\n\nOne way to help prevent obesity, diabetes, and heart disease is to make healthier, balanced foods more readily available in the home. In a recent study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, researchers from the National Institutes of Health examined the effect of substituting healthy, balanced meals with fast-food meals on the glycemic response to a meal. The findings indicated that people who",
      "In a major boost to the Indian tech startup ecosystem, the US regulator has cleared the way for an influx of foreign investment in the sector for the next couple of months.\n\nThe US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Wednesday cleared a proposal to allow the companies to raise up to $500 million in a fresh money fund without attracting regulatory scrutiny. For any company of over $75 million, the agency will issue a \"formal notice\" explaining the reasons behind the capital infusion.\n\nA significant portion of this will be in the form of debt, with some companies seeking foreign debt as a way to raise funds.\n\nThis approval comes in the wake of concerns raised by the Indian government over excessive foreign capital being invested in the sector. According to an SEC notice, the proposed venture fund would be a \"well capitalised fund\" that will maintain a specific investment objective (a key criteria for approval) of no less than one dollars per new-company venture and no more than double that.\n\nThe companies will need to submit the required disclosures before January 31, 2018. These disclosures would need to be published on the SEC's web portal and available to the public.\n\nThe investments will be in new-startups and \"companies that are actively building a technology and providing the technology to customers\".\n\nThe SEC has also indicated that any new investment into an \"investment fund\" would \"need to be on equal footing with investments made in an initial public offering of common stock by the company\".\n\n\"There is no expectation of making any capital returns to the fund investors for their investment in new ventures and a fund must not be used to provide short-term income to the company's management or shareholders, other than the return on the investment of the amount invested in the fund,\" its order reads.\n\nAccording to an industry source, the SEC's view on these conditions reflects fears over \"crowding out\" in the sector. \"It's only a matter of a few months while the regulatory process is over for this scheme and in the intervening period, a number of companies may approach the regulator for an exemption and exemption in the capital requirement from foreign investment.\n\n\"The SEC had to clear this through a formal notice which may take some time to get cleared, but it looks to allow some of the more aggressive investment from investors in the Indian tech sector,\" said this person adding that the proposed scheme could be a way for investors to invest in Indian technology companies with little exposure to US markets.\n\nThe SEC's notice on the issue has stated that the fund will be managed by a third party company to ensure compliance.\n\nThe SEC's approval of this form of investment comes amidst a slowdown in the pace of funding in Indian tech startups. Venture capital commitments totalled $1.1 billion during September 2016-March 2017, of which about $200 million was from foreign entities. The next figure would be much lower in the year ending March 2018; as such, India's investment in the sector has actually plummeted over the past three quarters, to $70 million in the quarter ended July, from the $800 million invested in the previous quarter.\n\nThe news also comes days after an investment vehicle, SoftBank, launched Prime Venture Partners (PVP), a $100 million fund that will invest only in domestic technology companies in India. SoftBank is the largest investor in Flipkart; it has invested about $100 million in the ecommerce platform since late 2013, and now has over $500 million invested in the Indian tech space over the last 12 months.\n\nThe fund is backed by SoftBank, TCS, ICICI Bank, and Alrosa Investments among others. The PVP fund's first fund is expected to start investing in early August.\n\nHowever, while investors may have been looking more at India's $18 billion tech ecosystem than tech investments from foreign investors, India has received support from the Indian government for several other investments.\n\nDuring a meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and US President Donald Trump at Trump Towers on June 16, the two leaders discussed several issues of mutual interest, including the US's investment in India and the two sides' respective policies in the Indo-Pacific region.\n\nLast week, Modi also inaugurated the US Chamber of Commerce in India's new headquarters in Bangalore.\n\nThe announcement was celebrated by US business leaders, who said it would encourage more investment and create an enabling environment with which to grow Indian business.\n\nA year ago, the government in India and US had signed a comprehensive cooperation agreement on cyber security, which would be the US' first formal investment in the Indian economy.\n\nAccording to a US Commerce Department document, the US and India are committed to \"delineating and reducing risks of cyber exploitation and to advancing cyber security cooperation\", which both companies said they are in the process of building.\n\n\"We welcome the US-India Cyber Cooperation Agreement, which provides for a more streamlined and streamlined process for our bilateral commerce and",
      "In a post on Google+, Google employee James Turley wrote today about his team's efforts to help a customer who found an annoying bug that made the entire office sound like a garage. He said the bug, which the customer found only after he posted on Google+ and Google+, was caused by the company's cloud-based email system.\n\nThe problem? Users were spamming each other and sending multiple replies on the same email, Turley explained. So, the company implemented tools to reduce spamming to the company's internal server.\n\nThis is the problem with open source software. It works by being open-source, and that means everyone can be part of it.\n\nTurbley writes here:\n\nIf you'd like to find out what it took us months to find—but that many people at our company had already caught—see here: http://t.co/k5pLXqVnGf.

      "The White House has the lowest approval rating of any presidential administration. So far, nearly a third of voters in a new ABC News/Washington Post poll disapprove of the job the president is doing and more than 70 percent say it's \"too soon to say.\"\n\nInterested in Donald Trump? Add Donald Trump as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Donald Trump news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest\n\nOnly 27 percent of voters approve of the work Donald Trump is doing compared to 62 percent who disapprove. Just under half, 47 percent, feel that it's too early to say. An additional 7 percent are not sure. Among registered voters, Trump leads the poll, 39 percent to 31 percent.\n\nThe poll was conducted as the president, on his 72nd day in office, faced backlash after he signed an executive order temporarily banning refugees and people in seven mostly Muslim countries from entering the United States. After a weekend of protest at national airports, a federal appeals court on Friday blocked the ban from being enforced nationwide. The decision has been widely criticized by Republicans and some Democrats, who argued it was illegal and unconstitutional.\n\nOn the campaign trail, Trump repeatedly said he was \"humbled\" by the response to his policies, that he needed to put the country first and that Americans had to \"fight and rally and protect\" their culture. However, according to the poll, voters are becoming skeptical of his commitment to working in the best interest of all the people.\n\n\"The president and the Republican Party are more isolated and less popular than at any time in the modern polling history of this country. This is why we have the worst job approval rating of any president at this stage in his term: This is the way Americans feel about him already,\" ABC News consultant and pollster Charles Franklin said on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nPresident Obama was the only president in U.S. history to receive less than 50 percent approval in a poll conducted after the end of his second term in office.\n\nTrump is now more unpopular than George W. Bush, Barack Obama or Bill Clinton — the last three presidents to receive their last approval ratings in the ABC News/Washington Post poll.\n\n\"This is going to take a toll,\" Franklin said on \"Good Morning America.\"\n\nAmong those voters who voted for Barack Obama in November 2008 or 2012, Trump is also more unpopular now than Romney was at that point in their campaigns. Thirty-one percent of those voters now approve of Trump's work in office compared to 41 percent who disapprove. Among those voters who voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016, 28 percent see the president as doing an acceptable or good job, down 6 points from last month.\n\nNearly two years into Trump's presidency, voters are deeply divided over his agenda and his policies, with half seeing his agenda as a bad idea and 45 percent saying it's a good idea. Sixty percent of respondents say Trump is too quick to criticize other countries instead of considering the impact of his policies on people around the world; 54 percent say he's too impulsive.\n\nWhile Trump has focused largely on repealing and replacing Obamacare, just 22 percent of those voters surveyed see the Senate GOP's health care bill as the right approach. About one in four said Senate Republicans' efforts were the \"right approach\" when asked about the bill from Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell.\n\n\"There are several reasons why the Democrats and their allies — the media, Hollywood and the Democrats are pushing this legislation. They want their agenda to pass and President Trump to sign it. They're pushing this health care bill because it helps their agenda,\" Franklin said.\n\nBut, he added, \"there are problems if you look at this bill from different lenses.\"\n\n\"The numbers that they're presenting are bad for the Democratic Party, bad for the party of women, bad for the party of black voters, bad for the party of young voters and bad for the party of working-class voters,\" Franklin said. \"President Trump would be wise to stand up to these special interests, and Democrats want to talk about the Affordable Care Act as a failing program.\"\n\nIn response to the poll, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., said in a statement that a new poll \"shows how low President Trump has sunk in office. At this rate, we're going to end up worse off economically, and that's in direct opposition to everything President Trump promised during his campaign.\"\n\n\"Democrats will not support the president,\" Schumer added. \"To his credit, the president seems to have a better sense of what Americans think. Our job is to work together to move the country forward instead of driving it back in the opposite direction.\"\n\nThe new poll results were released as a coalition of advocacy, labor, and religious groups announced a lawsuit against the administration's travel ban, calling it a \"disruption to lawful international travel\" that \"has harmed both the United States and individuals and businesses globally.\"\"",

      "MEMPHIS (CN) – Memphis police violated federal law by taking a woman into custody and searching her before a jury on a traffic charge, a federal judge ruled.\n\nBethany Young, of Memphis, was driving on June 8, 2010, when police stopped her and issued a ticket for an improper turn, a failure to signal a lane change, and improper lane use.\n\nYoung, who was 19 at the time, did not have her driver's license on her person and a witness testified that she did not appear to be under the influence, but the police charged her anyway, the court records show. That is when the police's internal affairs unit began investigating.\n\nOn July 15, 2010, officers pulled Young over again on Interstate 40, a portion of interstate-20 between Memphis and Memphis International Airport. The charges against Young were dismissed, but police arrested her on another traffic charge, a violation of a city ordinance.\n\nThe complaint asserted the violation violated Young's First, Fourth, Fifth, and Fourteenth Amendments rights. Specifically, Young claimed she was arrested and searched without her consent and without reasonable suspicion, a violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\nThe officers testified that they were called to the scene because Young was \"wandering.\" They said that as the officers approached her a car crossed into the right lane and stopped in front of them. The officer said he saw Young driving while \"high on drugs and marijuana.\"\n\nYoung told officers she would take them to the hospital for treatment instead. An officer asked Young why she didn't pull over, though she claimed that she was unaware she had a license, but the officers \"could hear in her voice that she was high.\"\n\nIn the rear view mirror, the officer said he saw \"her in the back seat of the car having sex with the man in the passenger seat.\" Young said she had sex with the man but did not have sex with anyone else, so the officer left the scene.\n\nYoung tried to argue she was not under arrest and that the officers violated her Fifth Amendment rights, and that the officers lied to her when they charged her with the other traffic offense.\n\nBut U.S. District Judge James E. Beattie rejected this, saying the police's own internal complaints record showed that \"Officer O'Leary and the other officers who saw Plaintiff had reasonable suspicion to make further investigation.\"\n\n\"A reasonable jury or judge would be likely to find that the evidence seized from Plaintiff was obtained through improper search and seizure,\" Beattie ruled in favor of Young, and granted summary judgment in her favor.\n\nThe judge noted that the officers were given immunity from civil action \"and that the Court does not conclude that Plaintiff was denied equal protection because of her race or the color of her skin,\" although she denied her motion for a preliminary injunction against the evidence.\n\n\"Plaintiff did not object to the arrest of the car's occupants by the police, which would have been an offense under the Fourth Amendment had it involved a white vehicle's occupants,\" Beattie wrote. \"Plaintiff objected only to the fact that Defendants made an arrest.\"\n\nBeattie ordered that the internal investigations into the case be suspended and dismissed, ordering Young to pay her attorney's fees and costs. He also ordered Memphis police to investigate their procedure during similar traffic stops and give Young a copy of their policies regarding these stops and to \"ensure that the officers who observed Plaintiff in this incident have been counseled of the law governing traffic stops in general and the Fourth Amendment in particular.\"\n\n\"I think these officers are entitled to due process,\" Young said. \"I just don't know if Memphis is going to learn from their own mistakes.\"\n\nThis article first appeared on the Daily Dot.\n\nPhoto via mr.guitar/Flickr",

Yet she also seems to have lost her own mind at night on the couch. And Johnson even got into a serious fight after she lost five pounds the last time a court issued an arrest warrant. So she told her mom to get rid of the arrest warrant, even if it meant losing custody of all her kids.\n\n\nWhen they finally got the warrant issued for Johnson's arrest, it went to court on Jan. 15.\n\n\"She had been living under our radar,\" Johnson told NBC 12. \"This past December, we had gotten a copy of her probation officer saying she was still going to have to go to a counseling program. When we got the warrant, we decided we didn't want to put her through that. She'd have to go through counseling.\"\n\nThe only thing Johnson could think of doing was finding Katelyn a job in a restaurant.\n\n\"I didn't think I was going to be able to get her a job,\" Johnson said. \"If there's a job open for a 16-year-old in the restaurant, or a place that is an adult only night club, well she'd be there. I didn't think she would be on her own, and I didn't think she would need someone.\"\n\nHer mother says Johnson was getting into trouble by having sex with a minor.\n\n\"I think she's a horrible mom, and when you're in love with your daughter, you know that her actions don't match her words,\" Karen Johnson said.\n\nKatelyn said a lot of her friends thought she was having an affair with the police.\n\n\"That didn't make it any better,\" Johnson said.\n\nKatelyn was arrested and has been spending nights in jail at the county juvenile department. So far, she has not been charged with any felonies.\n\nJohnson says she's been doing the best she can with her daughters.\n\n\"I love her and I want her to get the help she needs,\" Karen Johnson said. \"That's the issue.\"\n\n\nJohnson says she plans on filing a suit against the law.\n\nAlertMe",

I want to use this document as a means of understanding the issues at stake and for informing the citizens of this country.\n\nI shall start with a brief summary of the alleged problems, such as the reduction of testosterone and its alleged connection to aggressive and violent behavior. I shall then present my own explanation of the matter, which is based on years of research. There are obviously many more subjects that could be used to make the point, but this would be a good place to start.\n\n[I will not deal with the matter of whether the alleged changes in sexual function of male members of military units are attributable to such a deficiency, or whether such a deficiency would manifest itself in any other way, as a disease, or whether it simply can be explained as the result of natural variability in the human organism—since neither of these theories is universally accepted. However, I have found many writers who take what is said above under a broader and more nuanced meaning—as one who takes into consideration a variety of possibilities at work in the human organism. To this end, I believe there is a vast body of literature that can be used to make this point.]\n\n[I can not guarantee that this summary will be without errors in understanding or attribution, since many questions still exist as to the precise significance of the various hormones, especially testosterone]\n\nThe following is a summary of the allegedly harmful effects of certain hormones on the body and how they may or may not be explained by our environment.\n\n1. A decrease in estrogen:\n\nThere are a number of claims concerning a possible hormone deficiency that can lead to depression in men, to a variety of physical ailments, and even to suicide. There are other indications that there may exist a similar phenomenon, a variety of the effects of which are being investigated with respect to women.\n\nIn general, research has been carried out that indicates that hormone replacement may be appropriate in many cases of hormonal deficiency in men, which may include low sperm count, low sperm production, sperm count deficits, and low testosterone levels. These results appear to be associated with the development of prostate disorders in men. There is no conclusive evidence that estrogen replacement will cause any of the symptoms associated with estrogen withdrawal such as depression, anxiety, stress, sleeplessness, and depression and anxiety associated with depression and anxiety in older men.\n\nThe following quote from the book \"Testosterone Replacement Therapy\" gives a possible reason for some of the negative aspects to this hormone replacement.\n\nStudies have shown that estradiol deficiency is associated with increased levels of some physical-mood disorders and other psychological problems like irritability, anger, depression, irritability, apathy, aggressiveness, and anxiety [2].\n\n[This is obviously an indirect reference to mood disorder related to estrogen, which in men may result in problems such as anxiety, aggressiveness, rage, and aggressiveness.]\n\nIn summary, the evidence suggests that estrogens are associated with lower aggressiveness and higher levels of psychological well-being in older men. At this point, research on the role of estrogens in the treatment of prostate disorders is relatively new, and is still being explored.\n\n[The research on this question is very promising, and it seems to be progressing.]\n\nAlthough some men may have a normal range of estradiol levels, this can be explained by a variety of factors including age, body composition, diet, stress, and medication.\n\nThere is no evidence that estrogen replacement treatment increases the chances of breast cancer [3].\n\n[The evidence here is limited in its present form; the fact that the breast cancer problem is present in both men and women suggests potential underlying causes that may not easily be addressed by an external force, such as the hormone therapy treatment. Other problems may result from hormone replacement—see 2nd paragraph, below]\n\n2. Decrease in Testosterone:\n\nThe most common hormone decline in men is also one that is reported to be related to stress;",
      "Dalhousie University was warned more than a year ago that it was not prepared for a student uprising if it did not cancel Tim Hortons Field.\n\nThe university's senior vice-president, academic and vice-chancellor, Richard Florizone, was told in December 2014 that the university needed to \"work more closely with the Tim Hortons corporation\" to come up with a strategy for managing a student protest with a soccer score.\n\nThe University of Guelph faced a similar complaint in 2013. But university officials had a solution for the University of Guelph faced a similar complaint in\n\n\"It would be best to simply relocate the game to a more private site,\" an email from Tim Hortons vice-president Bob Young in October 2012 reads.\n\nThe email was one of several emails sent to campus officials by Young in the months before and after the team's \"Blue Jays Day\" came and went on Dec. 23, 2011. The stadium then-known as Tim Hortons Field, was in need of urgent renovations after a fire in 2010.\n\nUniversity officials had been trying to find a new home for an Ottawa team since the 1993 season when the club moved from the University of Ottawa to play at the new Rogers Centre. The club was relocated to the old Montreal Expos field the following year when a new Major League Baseball park with about 30,000 seats was completed at the old Olympic Stadium.\n\nAt the time the stadium was built, the city was trying to figure out how to handle a pro sports team in the city while also building a new stadium for the Expos.\n\nAfter the university's original request for information on the football and baseball stadium proposal from Tim Hortons and the Toronto Blue Jays was rejected, the university was told to come up with a plan by Dec. 31, 2011 to relocate or terminate the two sports programs.\n\n\"Unfortunately, the university has failed to do this,\" emails from Florizone's office to the university's communications chair and vice-president human resources were sent in November 2011. \"The university's proposal simply does not meet, or in fact it fails to meet, the university's standards,\" the email reads, underlining \"failure.\"\n\nUnder Florizone's direction, the university's sports teams were moved or ended because the university was not ready to handle pro sports in Halifax, or in the case of the athletic departments of Dalhousie's medical and dental school, because those departments did not meet university standards.\n\nThe university, however, failed to act after the Toronto Blue Jays moved into its stadium. Tim Hortons was the only Canadian restaurant to bid to open a stadium that was not owned by the province.\n\nAt the time, the project was \"largely funded through corporate tax credits,\" a report by the auditor general for the next year after the stadium was built noted. A $300 million contribution from Tim Hortons was a crucial component, according to the report.\n\nIn August 2012, Florizone emailed Florizone wrote back in December of that year to note that construction was \"progressing well\" with an estimated opening date of \"April 2015.\"\n\nBut the stadium opened in July of that year, with the university expected to break ground on the stadium soon after the new stadium was completed.",
      "PURPOSE:\n\nTo determine whether exposure to lead during fetal development contributes to higher body weight at age 14 years.\n\nMETHODS:\n\nA cohort of 2,566 children from a birth cohort with no obstetric or nutritional risks was included. Lead concentrations in the maternal blood were determined at 1 to 6 months of pregnancy. Body weight was measured at age 14 years using standardized methods.\n\nRESULTS:\n\nAt 14 years, the adjusted mean (95% confidence interval) body weights in the group with no adverse prenatal exposures were 5.0 (5.1, 5.1) kg and 6.3 (6.2, 6.4) kg for those with lead exposure prior to pregnancy and not. Higher body weights in the cohort without adverse prenatal exposures were significant during any gestation (P for trend = 0.014).\n\nCONCLUSION:\n\nLead exposure during early fetal development alters body weight.",

      "The most difficult thing about learning to play the bass when first starting out is figuring out what sort of sound is right for you in the first place. While you might be able easily to pick out your style from the music you listen to, it's easy to be overwhelmed if the sound of others you know is different from your own. Thankfully, in order to figure this part out, you need to first learn to identify good bass sounds. The first step is to take a good look at your own voice and bass. If you've never taken a good look at either of these (or if you don't have the time to take it every day) check out the video below. In the video, David and I take a look at different bass sounds and try to explain how it might work when you're in the playing field.\n\nHere we have David giving an example of a good bass sound with his own voice:\n\nAnd here we have our guest Paul taking a look at different bass sounds in the bass field:\n\nFrom that, there are some general rules that allow you to understand how different sorts of bass sounds work.\n\nOne of the first questions you should ask yourself is what sort of sound sound would be most comfortable to me. After learning to identify \"my style\" (the right note and phrasing based on playing the right piece of music), you should now have some idea of what you play and what your own voice brings to the equation. From there you can ask yourself what sort of bass sound would help you achieve your goals on the bass. For example, if you were looking for a very powerful, full sound, there are many ways to achieve that sound (ranging from a bass that's deep, to a bass that is more mellow, etc.). If you're playing for maximum dynamics, perhaps a bass that is lighter will be better.\n\nThe point of this article is not to give you every possible bass sound under the sun (although if there are any you feel I've left out, feel free to post them in the comments). Instead, this post will walk you through a step-by-step process based on figuring out what sort of bass tone you most want and how that tone affects your playing, even more so than you think.\n\nBy the end of this section, you should have a better idea of what sort of bass sound you are looking for, how bass tones affect your playing, and where you can find your ideal bass tone.\n\nThe First Step\n\nThe first thing you need to start doing to figure out what sort of bass sound is right for you is to listen to music. That can be pretty much anything: your own music, other songs and genres, or recordings of other people (even the recording of someone else's performance). There are some benefits to starting out by just listening to music:\n\nBy doing this you learn your musical ear (which is what you practice at home with your instrument)\n\nIt helps you learn what other people are playing\n\nIt provides you with an opportunity to work on technique\n\nIt gives you a chance to work closely with the person you're listening to\n\nIt allows you to compare your performances to others that you like\n\nYou start to become interested (or intrigued) in other players' sounds. If you're interested and learning, you can be pretty sure someone you listen to is learning as well and is likely to like what they play (even if it's not your style)\n\nOnce you've made an initial list of songs you enjoy, it only takes a short amount of time to get it down on paper. You could record yourself from Spotify, Youtube, or Soundcloud and then email the list to yourself. Alternatively, just stick the songs in a folder on your hard drive and make sure it's easy to find.\n\nOnce you have the songs down on paper, then you need to put them in a format that lets you identify bass tones (for instance, by counting the amount of beats in a bar and by counting the number of double steps).\n\nYou might start out by asking yourself a lot of questions to get an idea of how you really might be able to play the songs you're listening to.\n\nAs you're learning to identify certain tones, one of the more commonly asked questions I get is: \"What does a good bass sound like?\" If you're really struggling to hear what the songs might be, try asking yourself the following questions:\n\nIs my voice really clear and distinct?\n\nIs the tonal balance very even?\n\nWhat about the rhythm? Do I really seem to have an ideal swing?\n\nI found a lot of my early performances simply didn't come across well because of the following problems that could arise:\n\nThe tone is too 'soft'\n\nThe beat is too fast\n\nThe rhythm is too 'rhythmically messy'\n\nI'm being overly conservative\n\nAll of these could actually be very useful in",
      "It can be hard being the boss, especially if you can't even keep things under control. The most difficult thing an employee can ever do is expect a job well done. To avoid this, bosses make a lot of decisions that don't reflect their own judgment, and this results in employees feeling frustrated and powerless.\n\nWhile it would be hard to ignore the fact that all managers can do better with better communication and management skills, being a leader can be difficult enough on its own, and when you add in the pressure of managing people, that pressure is hard to overcome. As an employee, you might be frustrated with your employer, but if you have a boss who will try to change things to fit his own agenda, then you can be just as frustrated.\n\nA recent Harvard business survey found that most managers think their employees are lazy and not hard-working, when in fact nearly half said they have given up on their own employees. One reason why so many people in the workplace hate their jobs is that they feel they are not capable of improving them or their company, and this drives them to work harder just to keep their careers going—even if that means working 10 hours more a week than they want to.\n\nWhen companies hire people to lead, in addition to their high-achieving skills and experience, they should also have some other qualities on their resume that demonstrate a willingness to do whatever it takes to keep it on track. To help you put a stop to that, we've rounded up eight of the traits best managers should focus on, whether you are working for an hourly or an hourly-compensated position.\n\nLead with humility\n\nIf you need motivation to keep trying to make your company grow, it's probably because you think you need to get more things done. This is why a company's founder, founder's son, or other powerful leaders often try to take credit for the company's success rather than accepting their role in it. This mindset, often encouraged by a senior leader, is harmful to your organization because it makes employees feel powerless and gives them a feeling that they need to do more to be a part of the team.\n\nWhen you hire a leader, it's important to have them demonstrate humility on the front lines. If you have to constantly do the work of being the leader, it will make it difficult for employees to trust that they can make a large impact without you. You might be able to make improvements with the help of a management consultant, but it's better to find a leader who is the epitome of humility and can be trusted to make the big decisions on their own—without letting them take credit for them.\n\nWhen a company decides to hire a leader, be sure to look for someone who displays humility in all his or her interactions, not just with managers. If a CEO or top manager feels personally attacked when discussing a particular problem, it signals to employees that he doesn't take their opinions seriously or is willing to take advantage of them. Employees who are not humble and confident in their skills will have a hard time trusting you and can't help but feel resentful.\n\nTake the initiative\n\nIn an interview, if a hiring manager tells you, \"No, this is the organization's idea, not mine. I'm the one who hired you,\" it shows that they think you are untrustworthy. If you were asked to give an opinion during your interview, be honest about your own qualifications and abilities so that whoever you worked with knew what they were getting.\n\nOnce you've been hired, you'll need to make sure that the organization respects your opinion and takes any suggestions seriously. If you show that you're capable of making important decisions, employees will respect you and the company will likely listen to you regardless of whether or not you were asked to make a decision.\n\nWhen a manager puts someone in charge whose ideas are different than his or her own, it can give an impression that people who work there are inferior. It's much easier to take a job that you don't feel is fit for you if you think you can't succeed at it.\n\nShow people how to contribute\n\nAs an employee, it is important to see every day what your coworkers are achieving at their jobs, so that you can see potential for what you can accomplish. If you can't see what your coworkers are getting done, you'll never know how to do it. Being able to see your company's successes doesn't have to be easy, and many business managers make it harder by trying to control everyone like they do the team at work.\n\nBe an active participant in meetings and discussions—rather than listening behind closed doors. If you take credit for the ideas behind the meeting, the person who was in charge of the conversation might get the idea that he or she could actually do a better job. If you don't participate in the meeting, or even if you do, it's harder to see what you could do if given a more active role.\n",
      "From WikiFur, the furry encyclopedia.\n\nI am Not Your Dragon The movie trailer for The Dragon movie.\n\nI am Not Your Dragon was directed by Eric B. and Rakim. It was released on July 31st, 1992, originally in the United States. It was written, produced, and starred by MC Mong.\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nThe movie begins around the middle of the movie, when MC Mong is looking for the dragon of his dreams. He runs into a dragon, who tells him he's not his dragon. MC Mong says that he is not your dragon. MC Mong says he is not your dragon, not to his dragon and not to any dragon. The dragon tells MC Mong not to say anything to his dragon about his identity. MC Mong asks what his dragon looks like. The dragon says he looks nothing like his own and there are a lot of other dragons looking like him. He tells MC Mong that he can't be his dragon and that MC Mong isn't his dragon. MC Mong tries to tell his dragon that there are other dragons, but the dragon doesn't want to hear it.\n\nThe movie follows MC Mong trying to find his dragon. At least some of the characters in this part of the story are based off those mentioned on a fan blog.\n\nThe Movie [ edit ]\n\nThe Dragon was originally planned as a movie for The Smog Films; however, after the financial troubles of Smog Films in 1993, The Smog Films were forced to take out The Dragon movie and the rest of the Smog Films lineup as part of Smog's bankruptcy. This is a huge loss to the fandom as this was one of the most high-profile movies that Smog produced as it was a huge crossover between Smog with the popular hip hop scene and fantasy.\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nFilming for the movie was conducted in Florida. The actual dragon fight scene was shot in Florida. MC Mong fought alongside Robert Smalls and the dragons were filmed in California.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\n\nIt had a positive reception from many furs. Despite not being at all related to Smog, a lot of people were turned on by the movie. Even though Smog and the Smog movies were off-the-wall, the plot and characters were all based off people from Smog, Smog people with similar stories, which made it easy to relate to (it also made the dragon fight as fun as possible).\n\nOther characters, such as Dragon, were also based off of people from Smog, Smog people with similar stories.\n\nOn the other hand, there are furs who dislike it. Many people feel (and see) the movie as a blatant attempt on Rakim's part to capitalize on hip hop. MC Mong was a huge character in the culture and rap culture in the mid-1990s, which seems to have been forgotten. He was portrayed as a villain because of that.\n\nThe movie also makes some questionable choices. For one, the dragons themselves are mostly poorly animated, and the music is bad (though it is still used in the movie). Other questionable decisions, such as the dragons having an enormous number of faces, and the fact that MC Mong is one of the main bad guys, were probably unintentional. People might assume that having MC Mong be a villain (in every sense) is a deliberate point, though Rakim was never going for that. In all other respects, the movie is okay to some degree by being a crossover between hip hop and dragon fantasy.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, MC Mong is one of the main baddies in the movie. For the sake of the movie and Rakim's reputation, he is the ultimate representation of what a bad guy can be; a bad guy without shame. However, many others were in the movie because they were bad guys. MC Mong was bad because he had to be; he wouldn't have been Rakim if he didn't like him. However, in the movie itself, MC Mong was not so bad.\n\nOne of the most notable of these bad guys in the story is Dragon. In the movie, the Dragon is shown as having a personality and the ability to use his abilities to a certain extent, but in an almost psychopathic way. He's also shown as having his own personality and as someone who didn't really get it from his dragon and still seems to have a major problem with this.\n\nThe Dragon is the most complex character in the story to explain. If you watch the movie without watching the comic and don't realize what a horrible person he is (and this is highly recommended if you don't want to ruin the rest of this piece), you can see he has an extremely dark secret inside his heart. When MC Mong asked him who he was, the Dragon told him to ask Dragon. If you ask Dragon he will say he is a Dragon for you. If you ask his dragon, who would ask that",
      "The U.S. economy has expanded for three straight years now and there's a renewed sense of optimism about the future amid growing confidence that the world's strongest economy has grown strong enough to withstand whatever could come.\n\nBusiness investment in equipment and construction has increased, leading business leaders, economists and the Federal Reserve to start talking about a U.S. economic recovery that was \"recovering.\"\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average closed above 18000 on Monday for the sixth straight session, a new record. Stock investment in U.S. and world stock indexes has jumped. And the labor market has reached \"full employment,\" the threshold at which the unemployment rate has fallen below 5%.\n\nBut the recovery has been led by consumer spending, in part because of the housing market's recent rebound, in part because of a stronger dollar and in part because consumers are finding ways to stretch their dollar budgets faster by making fewer big purchases.\n\nU.S. consumers saved nearly $200 billion in the first three months of 2014, according to estimates on Thursday from Bloomberg, and have become more aware of the possibility of credit card debt, which is up 16.1% to $1.5 trillion from the same period a year earlier, despite historically low interest rates.\n\n\"There's a perception among consumers that their debt is unsustainable,\" said Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank in New York. \"But they want to go on saving, and that makes it more attractive.\"\n\nDespite the recent upswing, many economists agree that the real strength of the U.S. economy is the housing market, with homeowners seeing strong demand to buy new homes. Still, the housing market has been fragile because of subprime mortgage rates that have been far higher than the average rates across the broader economy. In addition, home prices have fallen too far since the bottom of the recession.\n\n\"A solid recovery needs a lot of good home sales,\" said Jonathan Smoke, chief economist of the Mortgage Bankers Association. He thinks prices have already peaked. If they start falling, \"it doesn't look very good.\"\n\n\"Home prices have been trending down for years as we've learned about the impact of our housing recovery.\"\n\nStill, the housing recovery is already leading to some optimism over a better U.S. economic outlook. A Reuters poll in mid-October found the share of firms reporting strong growth or rising prices for their goods or service rose to a record high of 82%, from 69% the month before. A separate Wall Street Journal/NBC News poll found that nearly two-thirds of firms expect their business to grow at least three percent in 2014.\n\nIn addition to the housing market, the recent recovery has been bolstered by consumer spending. The labor market is near full employment, although job opportunities are still relatively thin, making it tough for workers to find a full-time job if one is available. But consumers want more credit and credit card debt.\n\nIn the third quarter, Americans spent $1.5 trillion, or 17% more than a year earlier, driven by spending on home-improvement products like furnaces and home appliances, according to Commerce Department data released on Friday.\n\nMore Americans are finding ways to stretch their dollar-savings. The share of consumers using credit cards and other forms of credit has swelled to an average of 63%, from 51% in early 2009, the first time consumer spending growth exceeded the growth in the gross domestic product, the largest measure of the U.S. economy. The share of cash cards has more than doubled to 28%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York .\n\nThe Fed also expects the proportion of the population that uses cash to rise to 15% in 2014 from 12% in 2013, the highest level since 1998.\n\nAlthough consumers have been increasing their credit card use, overall growth in credit card purchases has slowed. Americans spent $3.3 trillion on credit and debit card purchases in the first quarter, down from $3.9 trillion a year earlier, and the pace of increase has slowed to 2.8% a year from 3.1%, the first time declines in credit card purchases have slowed, the Reserve Bank of New York reported in October.",
      "Halloween is over! Time to start the next chapter of our ongoing Horror Stories. This is going to be one of those stories that will have many twists, turns and turns. This will be different from our previous titles with more of a character study. As we do, you will be able to decide how you feel about the ending!\n\nSo, here's where I'm at, starting with a small story we've been doing a while now.\n\nWe decided that the story has to center around the characters involved with the crime. The victim. This story starts to delve into the victim's past.\n\nThe victim, I'm going to start by saying is in a serious situation. But he has a plan. He has a way out.\n\nIt's really just a small part of the story where his friends are trying to rescue him in order to help him.\n\nWe're all pretty involved in the story so far and all have our own ideas about how the story may play out. The only way this story can continue is if we all stay with us.\n\nSo I'm ready to get started, but before I do that, I want to give you a little teaser of where things are going.\n\nYou may remember that we recently gave you the first part of The Case Of The Missing Lads. In that story, we talked a little bit about what happened to the boys.\n\nTheir parents had gone missing and the boys wanted to find them without help from anyone. Well, here's our second story where we will delve a little bit deeper into what happened, but do not worry we will be doing a lot of digging on this one to make sure there is no easy answers or any information we can glean from the past.\n\nThe case will be very much like the first story, but this one is going to be a little bit different. This will be more about how we dig up and research and gather as much information as we can.\n\nWe won't have the \"big reveal\" at the end of the story that was in the first story, but I'm not going to stop you from asking me. 🙂\n\nWe'll start out with how we were able to find the girl. We have some really helpful tools when we search for missing children. They are tools that can help find them, but they can also scare people.\n\nThe most common tool that we use is a metal detector. We have one of these in our house and it's really helpful for locating a subject or hiding spot. If someone says that something's wrong, then the tool can get a good idea of what they're talking about.\n\nWe also have a metal detector in our car that I also use when I'm out on a hunt. I never have to ask anyone to search my car, you might, but I've also never been asked that.\n\nHere's what the tool looks like when it's set off.\n\nSo we've used my metal detector a lot over the last few years. I'm pretty curious to see how the girls will react to this device, because I'm pretty sure they're not all that fond of it.\n\nWhen we go digging, the tools are a huge help. That's why I'm not asking you to do the same. But we're going to be looking for things all day long, so I don't want to make this one easy on us.\n\nWell, you can expect to see all sorts of items and things while we're looking for the girls.\n\nHere's another picture of my truck. I have the same tool that we're using for searching out the girl, so we can easily tell how many different locations we're checking out.\n\nIf these are the items that you have, they're going to be in the truck while we're digging and that's not going to be long at all.\n\nHere's the first thing we found. It just so happened that we were heading into a residential area when we found the first one.\n\nAfter that, we found a few more that matched all the descriptions of missing girls.\n\nNow, as fun as it is finding girls missing out of the girl's dorm by themselves, finding one with a brother is even more fun. A lot of the girls were from a pretty close home group.\n\nSome girls were close friends of friends of friends.\n\nSome girls belonged to a small religious club.\n\nSome girls were in an all girl softball team.\n\nMany girls were just friends to friends.\n\nI don't even know how many girls there were. Each one is important to the story, but you can't let them all be known and they all go missing.\n\nAs a part of our research and searches, we used the Facebook group and asked that the girls could share their thoughts and memories about what they were trying to do with an unknown boy.\n\nI'm not sure what the girls thought",

      "The second of three episodes in season two of Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. centers on Hive, who is apparently still alive. And he's got a new assistant – Skye. As they both try and figure out what HYDRA stands for, Skye will try and find out why her life seems so different from the others, as well as how she fit in at SHIELD.\n\nAfter last week's episode, here's what you need to know about \"Terraformars.\"\n\nWhat does this say about Agent Smith's character?\n\nIf you've been watching this show, you don't need to get the details. The fact that Hive is now an ally of S.H.I.E.L.D., and that he might have even taken a liking to Skye (played by Chloe Bennet), is enough for the character to have been reborn. It also speaks to the possibility of seeing how Hive fits into this new world.\n\n\"Hydra\" was an important part in the last episode, but it felt like a tease, because there was no real reason for it, and it wasn't addressed, but when we saw it, it was clear that Hydra is trying to take over the world, and it isn't going to stop now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is here to thwart the evil.\n\nHow will this change Skye's life?\n\nNow that we have a new ally who appears in the second episode, \"Terraformars,\" it seems as if we'll start getting hints in regards to who this new ally might be. It would be hard to imagine that one of those agents will not be familiar to fans, and the second we learn who it is, it will likely mean something big is about to happen here on the show.\n\nWe've seen Agent Coulson have a huge fall from grace in the show's earlier seasons, and Skye now comes into her own in that light. But she's a big part of the S.H.I.E.L.D. crew as it's been since she was first introduced. We'll see her grow into her role, like we've already seen Coulson's (Clark Gregg) father and Skye's best friend, Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) do, and we'll see Coulson and a little bit of herself grow with her.\n\nAlso, she's working for the most powerful agent that exists in the world, and it feels much like when Tony Stark's Jarvis was on the show before. We're used to seeing SHIELD team up with the Avengers, and we saw this happen in the season and a half premiere episode (but in the case of \"Avengers,\" it was more out of a desire to make Stark an Avenger). This will be the second time we see Coulson and Hydra work together, along with some familiar faces, like Agent Daisy Johnson (Chloe Bennet), played by Iain De Caestecker.\n\nIs there a reason for Skye (who was only introduced in the season two premiere) to know that Hive is alive?\n\nWhile it doesn't really mean much except maybe for the fact that Coulson needs to get a hold of her, this does mean we'll get some hints of what this new associate of Hive might be, considering she and HYDRA have teamed up on several occasions. She's been around for a little while. What's changed?\n\nWhat's going on in the world of this group of SHIELD soldiers?\n\nWe've seen the group's lives crumble when S.H.I.E.L.D. is attacked on their own home turf, first when they get pinned down by Hydra agents on the Helicarrier, then when they're trapped and captured by Hydra and forced to work for S.H.I.E.L.D., now Hive is making an effort to recruit his own to help further his agenda.\n\nIt's safe to assume there's been some progress with Hydra's attempt to take over the world, so we might be getting some answers to these questions in the second episode.\n\nDoes Hive have any connection to another character from the comics?\n\nNot really. Not very much, anyway. But if you like Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., you'll likely recognize Hive's resemblance to one of the biggest villains out there in the MCU: Thanos.\n\nWhat is Hive's big plan?\n\nIt sounds like this character is trying to help the world for some reason, but right now we don't really know, if he's trying to take control of the world in a more organized manner, or simply to help the world, or maybe it has something to do with the new Marvel movie in theaters, \"The Avengers: Age of Ultron.\"\n\nIf you're an avid Marvel fan and you want",
      "There is no way that a team could have been competitive given the fact that both teams were on the road against inferior opponents.\n\nThe Warriors, who were 4-6 after Tuesday, lost in double overtime to a team without a player who was born in the U.S.\n\nThe Suns have allowed 120 points in the past two games, and a loss will surely take the team out of the playoff picture.\n\nIn fairness, it also makes it harder for Arizona to make their case to a team that was looking to see if they could make the playoffs with a win.\n\nThis is the first time the team has been competitive in January. But it was not just a matter of losing a few close games.\n\nThe Suns lost 14 of the 18 games in January.\n\nThe Warriors were also playing on the road where they are 18-4, and had two games left against Dallas and Portland at home.\n\nThe Suns were 6-6 going into the Christmas break.\n\nThe win for Phoenix was on a night when the team was on the road where they were 4-10 after giving up a season-high 113 points to the Clippers at home.\n\nAs the Suns continue to try and get to the playoffs, you have to ask them if a strong January performance was enough.\n\n\"It's been tough,\" point guard Marquese Chriss said. \"It's really difficult but we've gotten a lot better, our mindset, our intensity level has just been better. So, hopefully that carries over into the playoffs. There's a lot of basketball left. When you think about it, it's like six or eight more games, so it's just about how our guys respond.\"\n\nThe Suns were supposed to make a push for the playoffs from the beginning of the season, after a 4-2 start where they were 5-2 in their last seven home games. They were 5-5 overall in January after being 4-6 on the road in December.\n\nThe Phoenix Suns lost to the San Antonio Spurs on April 26 and the Los Angeles Clippers on April 28, but Phoenix rallied to win that road contest against the Clippers.\n\nEven then, the Suns had a tough time with a playoff spot. At that time, they led the league in several categories including points scored (99.7), points per 100 possessions (106.2) and 3-point percentage (41.5).\n\nDuring the Christmas break, they were just five games out of the last playoff spot.\n\n\"It wasn't a huge shock to us that (this year didn't go) as planned given the injuries and anything that's happened in the offseason,\" Chriss said.\n\nDuring the break, the Suns were in discussions about whether they would be able to trade for a guard-for-guard such as Paul George in the upcoming NBA Draft or trade for a more veteran talent such as Al Horford in exchange for the picks that are coming from the future, but they chose not to pursue any trades.\n\nWhen the playoffs get here and the Suns need help with their roster, the odds for the Suns getting some help will be better if they go out and try to get more than the four players that were traded.\n\n\"It's not a surprise that we were one of the worst teams during the break and one of the better teams when we got back,\" Chriss said. \"We have a lot of depth but we want to continue to get better and we are trying to make our team better all the time. So, we've always been in the hunt. We knew this playoffs would be very challenging for us. It's going to be tough and whoever we end up playing, it's going to be a challenge.\"\n\nOne player who did not have a good January was center Markieff Morris, and he had 18 points and 10 rebounds in the Christmas game.\n\nThe Suns had just two days to prepare this game with three players coming up with injuries. That was a concern for both coaching staffs as to what the Suns would do when the injuries got worse.\n\nDespite dealing with limited minutes so far in January, Devin Booker is averaging 21 points per game in his first five games and playing on the perimeter and is shooting 46 percent from the field.\n\n\"He's been having a very good start to his time in our league. He's got the ability to make shots and make plays,\" head coach Earl Watson said of Booker. \"He's very unselfish and he's trying to make plays for others around him.\"\n\nThe Suns would like to have Booker be a more consistent scorer this season.\n\nIn the first quarter against the Lakers, Booker didn't score. He scored the Suns' first eight points in the second quarter, but the Lakers pulled within 12 and were up 10 at the time. Booker missed the second half of the game in the fourth quarter and was limited to five points.\n\n\"He took some",
      "On Monday, the U.S. State Department released an unclassified version of a report on the situation in Iraq, in response to a lawsuit by the Iraqi parliament calling for the release of the executive summary, the report's executive summary and the executive summary's executive summary, as well as redacted portions of the report — all of which came out last April. It was the second time the State Department released the report. The initial version was classified, but it was published in June, months after the U.S. military had pulled its troops out of Iraq. The release was controversial, in part because some State Department officials argued that it was unclassified because the report had been redacted: But other experts said the government's decision to do so meant that it was not a true unclassified report, but a report with one redactions after another.\n\n\"The Executive Summary is highly classified and the government's claim that it contains fully unclassified information is false,\" the group Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, in an April 11 statement. At a hearing last week in the case, State Department deputy spokesman Mark Toner said that it was a classified State Department product, but that it was \"no different\" from the documents \"that the department had in the past published.\"\n\nThe State Department's decision to classify the report at all marks a significant change in how the U.S. government has handled reports on torture. There's no reason, beyond a tradition for classification that's long since outgrown, why the report should remain classified. Many lawmakers, including some in the Obama administration, see the report as potentially being helpful to future intelligence officers, as information about the Iraqi government's practice of torture will have to be considered by future officials when interrogating people under interrogation.\n\nThere's also a more theoretical reason for keeping the full document secret: The report was meant to serve as an objective assessment of the Iraq conflict, not a partisan document that can be used by opponents of the White House. It's an approach that's often been criticized, both by critics of the Iraq war and by those on the left who would like to see it more common. The Bush administration, for instance, didn't include classified documents in the administration's official White House logs.\n\nThe report did turn out to be partisan: The GOP-led House Appropriations Committee requested the White House withhold the report last month, along with the complete executive summary (though that hasn't happened yet, likely because there is no chance it could find a majority in the Republican-controlled Senate to override a veto). The president already has said that he will veto any spending bill that included any funding for torture. But at the hearing, State Department Deputy Assistant Secretary for Iraq David Satterfield said that releasing information about how officials would use waterboarding and the like was a matter for the White House, not him. Even so, at least one Democrat — Rep. Ed Perlmutter (D-Colo.), whose district includes the site of the prison at Bagram Air Base, where the Bush administration used the technique to extract information from detainees — said he hoped the State Department would \"take some time\" to release the executive summary and the full report.\n\nWhat's more, the issue of torture isn't likely going away in the U.S., though U.S. officials have generally avoided openly discussing it, and even though a bipartisan Senate committee in 2014 released a classified report documenting the practice. The Senate's panel concluded that the CIA had misled Congress, which \"undermined America's ability to credibly fight terrorism.\" The report also found that the CIA had improperly removed documents on waterboarding, and one of the CIA officers convicted on a torture conviction is still working at the agency.\n\nThis article was updated at 2 p.m. on Monday to add comment from the State Department.",
      "Tens of thousands of Americans have sent letters and made phone calls to senators with more than 30 million phone numbers calling and mailings. While it's a major effort to get senators' attention, the biggest push is on the other side of the political spectrum: The Obama administration has been working since January on new regulations for ISPs that would create a new legal entity to regulate internet service. If the rules are enacted, some predict this entity could eventually be used to censor and control content on the internet — with the ability to take down sites like the World Socialist Workers' Party, among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt issue is the Net Neutrality rules, passed by the FCC in 2015 and designed to force broadband providers to be more transparent about who they are handing off their internet traffic to and how and where that traffic is going. In November, the Republican-led FCC voted to repeal the rules by a 4-3 vote, and then a day later announced they would rewrite them based on the Congressional Review Act. Now, it's up to the Trump-appointed FCC to write new rules, a process that will begin once it takes effect on December 14.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome see the current net neutrality debate as the latest in a long line of attempts to regulate the internet — as well as efforts by the Obama administration to stifle free speech and protect the interests of corporate monopolistic interests in the telecom and publishing sectors. This is, of course, a charge we've heard time and again by supporters of the industry who argue it is the job of the government to maintain an internet ecosystem of robust competition, diversity, and innovation.\n\nBut what are the real threats to our right to free speech and internet freedom? In many places throughout the industrialized world, free speech is considered a fundamental human right that is protected by local, national, and international legal protections and rights. As a result, the internet is one of the few places where open and unfettered expression can be shared and communicated freely.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn the US, net neutrality has been a particular hot potato with lawmakers and regulators as it pertains to corporate business practices and practices that impact competition in the internet industry. In fact, when Congress created the FCC in 1934, it did so without considering the potential ramifications of such an approach for the free speech of Internet users — and specifically for the ability of the public to access information and distribute it at the speed and scale they choose.\n\nUnder the law, the FCC can prevent broadband providers from blocking or throttling certain types of content, but it can't do much else beyond that. And as the FCC has failed to properly defend the agency's jurisdiction through the years, this is a serious threat to Internet freedom, because the FCC lacks adequate protection from regulatory capture by corporations and other interests in the industry. With the impending FCC leadership transition and an ever-growing, powerful political center representing the interests of corporate profits, the stakes are even higher.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNet neutrality advocates have been working tirelessly to stop the repeal, and, on November 21, hundreds of people took to the streets of Seattle's Westlake and First Hill neighborhoods to protest it. Demonstrators held signs, chanted songs, and held a vigil in front of the FCC headquarters in protest of the anti-Net Neutrality vote. Protesters then headed for the Capitol to lobby and raise awareness about the issue.\n\nA \"Day of Action\" calling on senators to stand with net neutrality supporters was held in Washington D.C. on December 2, and was attended by several hundred people to voice their concerns, even though internet service providers have spent years attacking net neutrality protections and lobbying against them.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn other regions, similar demonstrations have played an important role in advancing important public policy. In Europe, net neutrality activists staged a major public demonstration outside the European Union headquarters in Brussels, and activists in Europe have also held a series of protests in Berlin to highlight the threat to the principle of Net Neutrality posed by the new, new leadership of the European Commission.\n\n#related#Similar demonstrations were also held in New York City and San Francisco, but the FCC debate has the potential to take place in cities around the world. As the FCC begins deliberating new rules, tens of thousands of websites across the internet will be affected — perhaps millions. It is crucial that Americans speak out at the FCC as soon as possible, and we need supporters around the world spreading the word.",
      "Lil Wayne is one the more controversial rappers with a large number of fans who are convinced he is being set up by Universal Records to turn into a career in film and television work. His latest, The Carter V, is a movie about a man who is trying to live a very simple life. He only wants the best for his son, Carter. He wants a good life. Carter is the son he hopes to create. He works as a cook in a Chinese restaurant. Carter is a very simple kid and doesn't do things the way other kids do. At first, Lil Wayne is skeptical about Carter and he even tells his manager, \"What's this boy doin', got no friends?\" but Carter is the only person Lil Wayne will ever be like. Carter's father is away and he doesn't know him very well, he doesn't even come into the restaurant even when it's busy. He's lonely. Carter is there when Lil Wayne gets the call for the audition on his cellphone to sing on a track, \"We Ain't in No Gangsta Tunes.\" Lil Wayne is in the restaurant cooking when he calls to let him know Carter was selected for the track. The first part of the song is a slow ballad with Lil Wayne doing the lead vocals, and the second part is an uptempo dance number featuring everyone at the restaurant including the waitresses and cooks. Carter dances in and dances out and he dances too much and he even dances into a line of customers who don't know the track. He is so excited that he's almost too excited.\n\nThe second part \"We Ain't in no Gangsta Tunes\" was played on the radio in a few places in the United States and is a major song in the Lil Wayne story. This song was supposed to be a single and not a movie and it was supposed to have a big push from T.I. and it included his song \"The Best Around\" with a chorus from Rick Ross. This single would have gone to radio and it would have been a big deal which is what happened. The singles didn't come, the movies didn't come, and Lil Wayne ended up doing some more movie roles. He even appears in a couple of \"Hood Gone Boom,\" music videos in which rappers make fun of the movies they're in. He has since been playing a character in that film and Lil Wayne has since stated he hopes to \"make a movie one day.\"\n\nAfter the second song came out with T.I. making fun of Carter and his father, Lil Wayne decided to call T.I. out by singing \"Hey, How You Doin', T.I.\" He was actually going to do it right at the beginning of the song, just as many people assumed. But when T.I. came in the kitchen, he said, \"Hey, are you ready to make Lil Wayne famous?\". He said, \"I'm not ready. I'm a rapper from New York.\" Lil Wayne said, \"He didn't mean that. I heard him, that's my man.\"\n\n\"We Ain't in no Gangsta Tunes\" turned into one of Lil Wayne's biggest hits of all time for the number one spot on The Billboard Hot 100 in 2013. This song was featured on Lil Wayne's album Tha Carter V and it even had a few songs on the soundtrack of the film.\n\nAfter the success of Tha Carter V, Lil Wayne's first movie of his career, the sequel The Carter V was released in January of this year after a number of years of development. It had a short theatrical release in the United States in February of 2015, and is slated to have a longer theatrical run beginning in February of next year and a Blu-Ray release set for later in 2016. The sequel was directed again by Mike De Luca and is being produced by Pharrell Williams, who will serve as executive producer on the film.\n\nIn the movie, Lil Wayne makes his acting debut in a cameo as himself in a scene that features a character named Lazer. The film also stars Jada Pinkett Smith, Chris Brown, and Rick Ross. Lil Wayne has stated that he hopes to have a part in The Carter V as well. In a recent interview, Lil Wayne has said a lot of words on the movie and is quoted as saying, \"It's not really the Carter V, but I'd be honored. I'd be honored to work with any of the great actors out there. That's my dream. Anything can happen,\" and \"You have to try your hardest.\"\n\nWhat do you think about Lazer?\n\nI'll tell you what…I am not even sure if Lil Wayne is the star of this film. It's his life that people are so interested in whether he is or not. The guy who plays Lil Wayne is amazing. Jaden Smith and Chris Brown did a great job as well. Mike De Luca is directing the movie and Pharrell Williams is executive producing. The",
      "On a Sunday evening in October, two students at St. Mary's University in Halifax say they were harassed by protesters who took them off campus, prevented them from attending a Catholic mass and called them \"racists.\"\n\nA Facebook post of the incident, and a video obtained by CBC News, show what happened — and what it looks like when a university fails to act when students say they're being attacked.\n\nThe St. Mary's students, Emily Sturtz, a PhD student in law and a francophone student, and Brittany Ardoin, a student in the school of art and design, say they tried to watch a priest mass on the second-floor of St. Mary's library. It's the main prayer area in Halifax.\n\nThey said they were harassed during the Mass, and asked to leave the campus on Tuesday night so they could return to their accommodation nearby. Sturtz wrote on her status, \"This experience has forced me to make a decision to end my education. That choice will be with me until we speak of it again.\"\n\n'It was very hurtful'\n\nThe priests at the Mass said they were saddened by the students' experience.\n\n\"I think it's really unfortunate. It's extremely unfortunate that people are so sensitive around social justice issues and are acting out in this way. We understand that's a social issue,\" said Father Kevin Smith of the Anglican Church of North America.\n\nArdoin said Sturtz said they were \"very upset\" at the experience. The students said they had not been verbally attacked before that night.\n\nEmily Sturtz is a PhD student at St. Mary's University. (Courtesy Emily Sturtz)\n\nSturtz said in her post she was worried she would not get any sleep on Wednesday night or Thursday morning.\n\n\"I'm glad I did not cancel my Friday class, but I felt really bad about that, because I was thinking, 'How am I going to show up for my next class when I have this hanging over my head?'\" Sturtz wrote.\n\nPolice didn't file charges\n\nOn Thursday night, the school notified Ardoin this had happened. Ardoin told CBC on Friday that she felt \"very disheartened,\" but said she was willing to do whatever it took to get home as quickly as possible.\n\nBut on Saturday, Sturtz said, RCMP officers told her an investigation had been launched. \"They came to my house and made sure that I was OK,\" she said.\n\nArdoin said they didn't know the nature of the investigation, but \"I guess it wasn't a crime-of-origin thing. Like, they thought maybe we had assaulted a person on campus, and we haven't … and we weren't even aware of it.\"\n\nArdoin and Sturtz said they were interviewed by RCMP, but the police didn't file charges against them. They think they got the wrong cops.\n\nStudents feel 'left out in the cold'\n\nSturtz said she wanted to go back to school to do an MPA. \"That's all I wanted to do. Now I feel like I've lost the ability to pursue that in any case.\"\n\nFor Ardoin, going back to school isn't as important as the experience.\n\n\"It was very hurtful. It hurts me to know that I got the wrong information,\" she said. \"There was no justification for us to think there would be any consequences over this issue.\"\n\n'A big-deal moment'\n\nThe incident at St. Mary's comes at a time when student activism around racism and oppression is rising across the country.\n\nUniversity of Western Ontario student Keegan Ritchie, 22, said it's important to confront racism on universities at a time when students are feeling anxious.\n\nKeegan Ritchie, 22, at a \"race and class\" discussion at the University of Western Ontario last week. (CBC) \"It's just a big-deal moment in the history of the university,\" Ritchie, a second-year student, said Wednesday.\n\nA group of white students held a meeting on campus, \"to try and come to grips with the fact that they don't represent a group or a collective view at the university,\" he said.\n\nThe group wanted administrators involved, \"not just to be interested in the diversity of the campus but to have some vision for the future of the university and how we see ourselves as a society, what's possible for us in the next generation,\" Ritchie said.\n\nStudents have also held discussions about racial harmony on campus \"and how we're going to be able to move beyond race-based segregation,\" he said.\n\nSturtz said she thinks many racialized students also want to work with the school administration and be able to attend the university with \"a healthy and welcoming, inclusive environment.\"",

      "\nMISSISSAUGA — An auto repair shop on King Street East has suspended its use of e-cigarettes as part of a pilot project to monitor the smoking equipment.\n\nThe shop at 3100 King St. East closed on Friday night after being contacted by a customer who reported that \"the shop used cigarettes while working on its e-cigarettes.\"\n\nVaper's Choice Ottawa, the city's only vape shop, is not implicated in the incident, said manager Alex Virk.\n\n\"We've been working with the city for weeks on this pilot project. All the equipment used is new and the shop owner is happy where we are,\" Virk told the Star.\n\nHowever, Virk said that the shop will no longer be using e-cigarettes and will use the same methods when repairing cars on a regular basis.\n\n\"We will still use e-cigarettes in the shop, but using the proper tools to operate them in a safe manner,\" Virk said. \"Our goal is to maintain the same amount of nicotine consumption in our shop, but to make sure the vehicle we are fixing is in working order.\"\n\nA similar pilot project with several vape shops in the city is being run by the City of Ottawa, according to a news release issued March 31 by the city.\n\nThe city has been running the project since January, and reports suggest it has reported an increase in vehicle repairs completed with e-cigarettes.\n\nVirk said that he understands that he is part of the city's initiative, but that he has reservations about putting his livelihood at risk.\n\nThe Star recently visited three vape shops in the city, and were told it is not just about the taste or the smell.\n\nCars can last days or weeks without fuel or oil; and they often use fluids, which can contain a lot of water. The vapour produced from vaping can be harmful to the eyes, skin, and throat.\n\nThe e-cigarettes can only be used to smoke or vape.\n\n\"In my opinion, using the e-cigarettes means I'm inhaling second-hand smoke. So if I'm inhaling second-hand smoke, I'm potentially exposing myself to second-hand smoke,\" Virk said. \"My opinion might be different than that of the city, but if I'm going to smoke second-hand smoke, I really should use e-cigarettes, not second-hand smoke.\"\n\nmpearson@postmedia.com",
      "It's that time of year again, when it is time to spend some quality time with your beloved pets.\n\nOn occasion, your favorite pet will come into the life changing moment when he or she makes the decision to become a member of your family.\n\nThis is not unusual though.\n\nWhile you will often be the first to welcome a new member of your family, don't be alarmed if a pet initially resists. As your new family member, the new addition should learn to adjust to your family's routine, make friends with the babies in the family and, of course, try to take on your role as best as possible.\n\nWhether your pet gets along with the other family members is totally up to them. However, if you have adopted an adult rescue dog, don't forget your responsibility to your canine friend as a responsible pet owner. You are probably familiar with this concept if you are like most pet owners.\n\nYour dog is your family and needs to learn to respect all of you and your preferences as a dog owner.\n\nDogs are social animals with a love of company. Their natural instincts are to get along with people just fine, so long as that person stays pleasant to the dog – and if that someone isn't you, well, then it's an uphill battle for them to get along with everyone else.\n\nWhat's more – they have social media. Social media is like a social animal – all of its members and especially its parents want to keep in touch with each other.\n\nYour child, your friend, your neighbor and your dog all have blogs, YouTube videos and live chats. These are among your dog's daily activities. So do them a favor – just leave them alone! Just be sure your dog learns that there is no such thing as too many good friends.\n\nYour dog has plenty of positive memories during the summer months as he or she enjoys swimming, sunbathing, eating at the beach and playing with some of the other canine family members.\n\nWhen your pet comes to expect more from you than just company and a belly rub, then you should make time for some bonding time with your dog. You must be willing to help the dog become your best friend and your companion. This is important for a dog to develop into a confident good pet owner.\n\nWhen your dog comes to expect more than simply being a pet, then he or she should learn to come to you for help and support. Many dogs can be made to do everything that is asked of them. It's just a matter of practice and patience.\n\nYour dog deserves to know that you love him dearly.\n\nAs long as you are loving and kind to your pet, you will have plenty of time to have fun. Your dog will always have you by his or her side – so there really is no need to go out on the town or be in a serious work situation. But remember that as soon as your pet becomes too much of a burden on your family, then you will need to find an opportunity to get rid of him or her.",
      "\nThe FBI confirmed on Tuesday it has a \"preliminary investigation\" involving Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.), and officials did not immediately rule out the possibility of a criminal violation stemming from meetings Sessions had with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the presidential campaign.\n\n\nThe confirmation came after The Associated Press first reported the investigation on Monday night.\n\nAccording to the report, the FBI interviewed Sessions about \"his contacts with Sergey Kislyak, Russian officials and others.\"\n\n\"At the April 26, 2016, briefing, Sessions explained that prior to taking office, he had not been briefed on Russia's efforts to undermine the American democratic process, and he had no reason to doubt the accuracy of the information provided by Russia's senior-most officials,\" according to the AP.\n\nSessions has served as a surrogate on behalf of the Trump campaign throughout the 2016 race. He was a key figure in the president's firing of FBI Director James Comey last month, despite the bureau's ongoing investigation surrounding Russia's interference in the election.\n\n\"The Department of Justice has been following the recent developments with great interest,\" Sessions said on Tuesday. \"I have recused myself in any existing or future investigations of any matters related in any way to the campaigns for President of the United States. I am confident that I should be able to make this point without causing any further disruption.\"",
      "In our previous blog, we talked about how to change the default HTTP method to GET. With that step completed, we moved on to setting up a basic REST API. Before we jump straight into the code, let's give a quick overview of REST API concepts, so that we have a good grasp of what we're building.\n\nA REST API is essentially an object-oriented web service that connects to other APIs in a consistent and structured manner. Each API can have many nodes, each containing a collection of actions, filters and a response response. A node is usually created, or the node is already populated, by using Node.defineProperty . All objects that you declare can be accessed with Node.hasOwnProperty and its super form which returns true if the object is a property of the given object. The Node.getAll() method returns a list of objects representing all the objects in the system.\n\nA REST API can be a little complex to use, but it's also very powerful. In the article, we created a simple node which does nothing but return the message from another node. We also showed that if you have a single service, you can set up each of nodes individually and use a single object in many different scenarios. But it's also very easy to implement your own API for your own use.\n\nA Basic REST API\n\nIn this section, we'll show you how to create a simple REST API and then how to set it up with our node and other services.\n\nWe start by first creating a node and then a node and node pair with them.\n\nvar restangular = require(\"restangular\"); var node = restangular.createNodes(\"api\", { \"methods\":[\"GET\"], \"options\":{ \"limit\":5, \"offset\":4 } });\n\nWith that created, let's create a service which returns all our nodes. We need a method for each node which sets that node as the response for a request. We do this using the Node.defineProperty method.\n\nrestangular.service(\"myRestangularService\", function($http, RestangularProvider) { var myRestangularService = Restangular.fromService($http); $(function () { RestangularProvider.set($http, myRestangularService); }); });\n\nNow we need to create a function which can handle the request. We did this using the Node.getAll method to return a list of elements from our node. We also used a switch with two cases, the first being TRUE or FALSE and the second one being in a GET response.\n\nfunction myRestangularService() { var allNodes = $http.get(\"/my-node?limit=4&offset=2\"); var allResponse = $http.getAllResponse(); var myResponse = $http.responseJSON(); // we can now use our new response, which contains myNodes array myResponse.allNodes = allNodes; // we can add myNodes to JSON array returned // by myRestangularService allResponse.allResponse.push(myResponse); return allResponse; }\n\nI've used Json.stringify(myResponse) to turn the JSON response I just returned into a string containing a Node.setAllResponse object. This is what you will get for every node in your system.\n\nNow, using this service, you can implement a basic API using the same code that we have created earlier. To start, we can create our Node structure and setup a GET request on our system.\n\nvar node1 = {}; node1.methods = [ \"GET\", \"POST\" ]; node1.options = { limit: 4, offset: 2 }; // create our node, set it as return value node1.id = \"node1\"; // set the name of the response and store it in our cache node1.data = [ {\"id\": \"node1\", \"type\": \"id\", \"name\": \"My Node\", \"value\": \"Node 1\", \"url\": \"/my-node?limit=4&offset=2\"}; ]; echo(\"node1 status: \", node1.data);\n\nAs you can see, the response returns a node that contains a JSON array that we store as our cache. So we can retrieve the result with our data stored in the cache.\n\nvar response; response = $http.get(\"http://api.example.org/node.json\"); response.allResponse.push(node1.data); // get the whole response from the cache echo(\"node1 status: \", response); // and store it in our cache for later\n\nWhen calling our system, if you set a limit in your GET request header, you should also set the offset. Since our method for each node returns a list of our nodes, we know that we will have to set a limit for each node. In our example, the Node.setLimit method does",
      "A recent survey of 1,300 Australians who own a cat or dog by online dog breeders found that the majority are not interested in breeding.\n\nThe study, which surveyed 710 pet industry workers and dog owners across the country, found that most people are keen to make more money through new lines of pets than they expect they'll want.\n\n\"I can tell you in three months I will be breeding a cat, I don't necessarily need to tell anybody for seven years!\" one respondent told the researchers.\n\nREAD MORE: Are you better off with a dog?\n\nThe researchers say the lack of interest and willingness to share puppies with other people can affect the way a breed develops.\n\n\"When a breed can't be reproduced in its natural environment, it often becomes more competitive than the rest of us, and a smaller percentage of dogs from that breed are adopted by owners, resulting in fewer puppies being taken in to foster care with the goal of finding the owners,\" the researchers said.\n\nMore than 80 per cent of the respondents owned a cat in their homes, which is a large portion of the dog population.\n\n\"You're going to start with a smaller number of cats and get them up through to a population that's bigger,\" Dr Andrew Roberts, who contributed to the study, told Australia's ABC.\n\nREAD MORE: Dog abuse found in dog owners' home with their pets\n\nIf the study had been conducted a few years ago, the survey would have focused on dog owners because ownership rates were higher at the time and cat owners were relatively unknown.\n\nHowever, the findings show cat ownership is declining, with less than a third of respondents surveyed in 2016 owning a cat in their homes and fewer than a tenth having owned a cat in the past five years.\n\nREAD MORE: Two arrested following deadly dog attack\n\nDog breeds are becoming more rare as an animal and one that owners will want to have for pets, but owners of the dogs will want to be sure they are the right breed for their specific situation.",
      "The United States Air Force in the US is set to make a major investment in India following the Prime Minister Narendra Modi-Rajnath Singh's announcement of a long-term strategic partnership.\n\n\"The US Air Force is already in India for a mission that's not the biggest one that it has been doing in the last four years. We do have about 4,000 staff working out of one base at the air force technical college at Dehradun. It's about a third, and we'll be adding another third,\" Air Force Commander Col. Paul Funkhouser told a group of reporters on the sidelines of the Hindustan Times Leadership Summit this weekend.\n\nThe US Air Force has been working with Indian agencies to modernize technology such as the A-130 gunship to enhance the capabilities of the Air Force there.\n\n\"I think it's significant to the US Air Force specifically, in terms of what we know about India and the capabilities we think they have in terms if air superiority,\" Funkhouser added.\n\nThe Pentagon is expected to fund two to five long-term contracts worth about $8 billion to upgrade the entire air, naval and ground forces that the US is operating in India. This could involve new weapons systems, new helicopters, drones, and other equipment.\n\nThis could also include the long-pending US request for almost $3 billion for an Indian nuclear power plant that would give the country its first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier by 2024, if all else fails the US may ask for other facilities like a huge joint research and development facility.\n\n\"It's not going to be a complete conversion. It's going to have a lot of aspects that are going to enable us to have a much simpler, more efficient program,\" Funkhouser said, adding: \"we're not going to have a massive conversion of the force into an air wing and a naval wing – you're going to be maintaining what we have now and working with some of the best and brightest in the world to bring that forward.\"\n\nThe Air Force chief said that the modernization will also add \"an added dimension and sophistication\" in the air wing that will also be better able to execute air superiority missions.\n\n\"We're going to have about 1,500 airmen and airwomen from a diverse range of backgrounds – Army, Navy and Marine Corps – to participate in this modernization effort. They're going to be a very important part of this. They're an important part of these missions,\" Col. Funkhouser added.\n\nIndia will also contribute to the US' long-term investment and upgrade the entire forces deployed in Japan, Guam, Singapore, and Japan; the US will also provide more weapons to the Indian armed forces.",

      "Pitchers have had four-year contracts since the beginning of the 2003 season; however, in recent years a five-year deal was made possible because MLB negotiated with major league players and teams to end or reduce the use of 10-minute delays. In the deal that was reached with the players, if a pitcher misses a start, the teams must not use a five-minute delay in a subsequent season until July 31. Prior to this agreement, the five-year term has been a guideline for managers.\n\nThe players' union agreed that pitchers could be paid more while they were on the disabled list. The new agreements were the result of negotiation, and not due to an agreement between MLB and the players.\n\nAccording to the website Inside Baseball, one source said the length of the new deal with pitchers is not being discussed. If the negotiations with the players were in favor of a five-year arrangement, then the manager would have to decide whether he would want one or two years; he would also be able to choose not to have a fifth year. The new five-year contracts could make a difference in a player's salary if he signed a contract with a different team.\n\nIt must be noted that it is likely many clubs will opt for four-year deals for pitchers given the financial situation.\n\nThe five-year deal came in a report by Ian Desmond, and the Dodgers had not signed a five-year contract or extension by the end of the season. This new report will likely put an end to the rumors and questions surrounding Desmond's future.\n\nOne notable difference between the players and managers is that baseball offers three-year contracts, which in the case of pitchers can potentially prevent them from being traded. Another difference is the length of a contract and the player's contribution to a club, which could make it easier for a pitcher to sign an extension before he needs one.",
      "For the second year, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) today (July 10) voted for changes to its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual (DSM) of Mental Disorders that could result in many more people with mood disorders being classified as having a neurological or psychiatric illness that can be treated with psychiatric drugs. The DSM-5 is an extensive revision of the original DSM-IV, which, based on evidence from a review of more than 400 scientific studies, saw significant changes to depression, schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and other psychiatric disorders in 2009, when an attempt to change the disorder was opposed by the mental health community.\n\nThe new DSM-5, which will be published by the APA this fall, was created following a decade of consultations with the community, public participation, and the expertise of hundreds of experts—and follows four previous revisions of DSM-IV.\n\n\"The time has come to update the diagnostic criteria that guide our understanding of mental disorders and the treatments that we provide to those with these disorders,\" said the current chairman of the DSM-5 task force, psychiatrist David Healy of the University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill, in a statement. \"The changes made in this revision provide the latest evidence-based evidence for diagnosing and treating disorders such as major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, conduct disorder, and phobias.\"\n\nToday's final DSM-5 draft also updates the diagnoses for anxiety disorders, psychotic experiences, and substance-induced disorders. It also includes more comprehensive criteria for autism — including a broader definition of autism spectrum disorders — and more diagnostic criteria for eating disorders.\n\nAn important part of the DSM-5 has to do with the issue of how to diagnose disorders that fall into more than one of DSM-5's criteria and whether there is a consensus amongst mental health professionals on how to treat them. In the past, many psychiatrists have not supported the need to include more than one criterion in a classification, and instead lumped all the symptoms together under a general term. \"This has led to a classification where too few people are recognized for their mental illness and therefore have a lack of treatment options,\" APA Chief Psychiatrist Dr. Francesca Filbey said in a press statement. \"However, if we do not change our thinking, and if we continue to label people who lack the ability to communicate and who are socially isolated as psychiatrically ill when their conditions are really quite common, we risk a tragedy of the commons, where too many people are suffering while there are no effective treatment options available.\"\n\nCurrently, only about a third of patients with a current mental disorder are diagnosed with a psychiatric illness like depression or bipolar disorder — and of those, most are categorized as having a medical condition such as bipolar disorder that can be treated with mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, and antianxiety medications, according to a 2011 study in Biological Psychiatry. The problem is further exacerbated when many psychiatrists don't accept that depression is a real mental illness — they don't believe there is an underlying abnormality in the brain linked to depression or a genetic cause for it. As a result, they tend to dismiss depression as a \"temporary state of anxiety\" that fades with the passage of time.\n\n\"Depression is a lifelong condition, that will affect you, your family and your friends — and that's what we have to be aware of,\" said Filbey. As more evidence comes in confirming that depression is a real mental illness, \"we are going to make an effort to change the way people look at this,\" Filbey said. \"Depression is an illness that affects many people, just like an infection, that's not always curable, but they can be treated.\"\n\nOne of the major changes in the DSM-5 is the inclusion of the term borderline personality disorder. The name has been in use as a single diagnosis for more than 20 years and was last used in 2004 and updated in 2006. \"People need the proper diagnosis to get the treatment they need,\" Dr. Peter Gifford, chief deputy secretary general in the World Health Organization's Department of Mental Health and Substance Abuse, said about the new addition in a statement last year.\n\nThough the specific criteria for borderline personality disorder vary depending on the context, it often includes the following: (1) Imposed feelings of low self-esteem, self-doubt, worthlessness, and guilt, (2) an unstable self-image that can include grandiosity, feelings of inadequacy, difficulty in relating to others or being understood, and a general belief that one is a \"narcissist,\" (3) behavior that meets criteria for at least two of the four criteria for major depression: depressed mood for at least four weeks; significant weight loss (or gain) during that time; or loss of interest or pleasure in previously enjoyed activities; and (4) four or more of the following, including suicidal ideation, attempts or threats, or self-harm, in the past",
      "[image-51]\n\nIn an unprecedented event, the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR) has released a research-based, global climate model, called Climate Model E2, for the first time. The first global climate model with a resolution greater than one kilometer has been developed by NCEI as part of the Climate Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP) and uses the latest climate models available from NCEI and other partners such as NASA/GISS and the UK Met Office Hadley Centre.\n\n\"NCAR has developed a new globally representative, 2-km-scale global climate model,\" said Andrew Dessler, lead scientist for CMIP and principal investigator for CMIP at NCAR. \"This has important implications for our understanding of large-scale surface air temperatures and how they change with time. The model shows how global warming will change surface air temperatures and how much heat will be trapped in the atmosphere, and how this change will influence our weather and climate in the future.\n\n\"It is important for scientists to know as much as possible about our changing Earth, so that they have a more complete, accurate picture when writing future climate studies.\"\n\nThe climate model represents the current state of the climate system, including the ocean. The atmospheric model is composed of multiple atmospheric components that simulate the response of the climate system to increasing amounts of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\n\nThe model has been developed using a new, comprehensive, climate model code developed by NCAR scientists that incorporates input from over 600,000 climate system variables, including land, atmospheric, ocean, and surface data and experiments. While current climate models are typically limited to a resolution of about 30 kilometers, Climate Model E2 is able to address all of the key processes governing Earth's land and ocean systems and its climate system at the same time, providing a high-resolution global model.\n\n\"This is the first global model where all components in the atmosphere and land, the ocean, and land surface are integrated, allowing simulations more realistic than anything ever seen,\" said NCAR scientist Kevin Anchukaitis, principal investigator for Climate Model E2. \"This is a major step toward bringing together an unprecedented amount of information on how the Earth's climates are changing.\"\n\nClimate Model E2 is a major milestone for climate modeling, and will open the floodgates to modeling the Earth system in unprecedented detail. \"This model not only gives us a full understanding of the dynamics of the climate system but the ocean can be integrated in the model and its response can be modeled more realistically than ever before,\" said Anchukaitis.\n\n\"CMIP is the most sophisticated global climate modeling effort in the world, and one of the most comprehensive global climate modeling efforts ever conducted, providing data and input for more than 400 climate model experiments,\" explained Dessler. \"This model has a higher resolution than previous models, making it possible for us to more clearly resolve the relationships between atmospheric processes at lower resolutions. This new model allows us to answer some of the questions that have proved troublesome in past models, such as how sensitive global warming is to increasing levels of greenhouse gases, such as methane, which has a warming effect much larger in climate models than the global warming effect it has in the real world as well as the speed with which the Earth's carbon cycle is responding to carbon dioxide.\"\n\nThe global climate model will give scientists important information about the effects of greenhouse gases on Earth, and how global warming will change our weather and climate. CMIP simulations of the future climate will be crucial if the world is to implement policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and address climate risks.\n\nFor more information, see the NCEI press release.\n\nSee related NSF news releases:\n\nNSF Program Migrates to More Space for Earth-Observing Facilities\n\nNSF Director's FY2012 Budget Request Includes Increased Funding for Earth Science\n\nNSF Announces Award Recipients to Support NSF's Earth Science Agenda\n\nNSF Announces $25M in Grants for Earth Science Researchers\n\nDedicated Earth-Observing Satellites Continue to Provide Convenient and Reliable Data for Science\n\nNSF Supports Climate-Related Research Through Grants",

      "After a long history of making movies that are almost painfully self-aware in their social commentary, the French satirical duo of Quentin Dupieux and Guy-Laure Dévigné, better known as DDB&G, have returned with their second film which sees them venturing into the world of a new film with a new name, one that was the brainchild of actor/comedian Jean-Ralphio, famous for his role as the title character in the movie Mieville's The City & The City.\n\nWith a running time of just under two hours, a small cast – made up of the likes of Paul Verhoeven, David Cronenberg, Jean-Pierre Jeunet, and Claude Barras – has gone to great lengths in order to craft a film that is not only politically and socially satirical, but also visually arresting. In particular, the film's visuals would be an interesting thing to witness – as you will notice, the two leads aren't wearing much when they aren't in a group. What kind of message does the film's plot give you when we aren't looking at the faces of the characters?\n\nDirector Dupieux's previous film was the very funny A Trip to the Center of the Earth. He and the co-screenwriter, his cousin, both had a few experiences with being fired from a series of jobs. DDB&G then started making their own movies and got their film debuting in their short film \"A Man's World\" by director Guillaume-Francois Nogier – which they also starred in – which was also short-listed for an Academy Award.\n\nTheir third and latest film, \"Le Chasseur\" is set to be premiered in Cannes at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. As with Le Cinq, DDB&G have not revealed any plot details to date, though there is mention of the characters being \"friends,\" and a possible love interest.\n\nOne thing that was revealed to us at Cannes is that the two actors – while performing a play they did – had to be filmed in front of a green screen as the camera constantly moved around them in order for it to be accurate with their performance. They have no problem with that being the case, considering that they do a lot of work on the green screen. They have also made films together before and while not working together, they have found a lot of common ground when it comes to the way they do everything.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on \"Le Chasseur\" so far? Would you like the actors to stick to the script, or are you interested to see what different looks the actors will have on screen? Let us know your thoughts in the comment section below!\n\nYou can contact Adam Smitten here or get more info on his film here.",

      "As we celebrate the return of the Red Wings to the playoff spotlight with the start of their 2013-14 campaign on Friday, it's an excellent time to look back at how the club made their Stanley Cup run in 1991.\n\nWith the season still fresh on their collective minds, we can look back at the Detroit Red Wings' three straight years competing for the cup (1991-94, 1995-96, 1996-97). The success on all fronts was undeniable, with a total of 27 championships, seven of which came in the first six years of the current era.\n\nOf course, the Wings were a perennial powerhouse over these years of contention, and it was on the ice that the foundation for their success was laid.\n\nIn a move that shocked many, the Red Wings' management took the franchise in a different direction in July of 1991 with the addition of two young forwards. Steve Yzerman was the first piece of history that led Detroit to a Stanley Cup, as the captain was the face of the franchise from that point forward. The Red Wings had already picked up Yzerman's $5 million option on July 1 of 1991, with general manager Ken Holland having an extra $1 million available to add to the club's cap. In other words, a roster with Yzerman for the first time and with the team expected to make a run at the cup, was a formidable one.\n\nAnd so the first-year team was built, with Yzerman as the cornerstone and Peter Forsberg and Tomas Holmstrom as complementary pieces.\n\nThe Wings' first year in the league saw a lot of changes, both in the way they played and how the league treated them in 1991-92. In their fifth season in the NHL, Detroit had finished one and done nothing and they knew their time in the league was coming to an end. This roster was built for it, as the young nucleus of the Red Wings had all the makings of an enduring dynasty. While none of these young players could quite crack the NHL All-Star Game that season, all three were regulars in the post-season and Yzerman's presence, along with Holmstrom and Forsberg's, was a tremendous foundation upon which to build.\n\nTo start things off, here is a list of the players that played for the Wings in their first season, as voted on by you, the fans:\n\nFirst Year (1991-92) Players in Team: Yzerman, JLikens, Hasek (1) Forsberg (2) Franson, Zetterberg, Rypien (1), Johan Franzen, Niklas Kronwall (1), Yzerman (1), Eric Lindros, Justin Abdelkader, Mike Danton, Nicklas Lidstrom (4), Sergei Fedorov, Henrik Zetterberg, Lidstrom, Chris Chelios (4), Nicklas Lidstrom, Pavel Datsyuk\n\nNotable Additions: Pavel Datsyuk, Chris Chelios, Justin Abdelkader, Mike Danton, Nicklas Lidstrom, Petr Mrazek\n\nNotable Lost: Tomas Holmstrom (to injury)\n\nThere is one thing that is undeniable about the 1991-92 Wings: They were one of the league's biggest success stories. Even though the team struggled in most regards, the Red Wings' record-breaking roster put them at least on par with league heavyweights. It's just interesting to look back and see how some of these names in that first-year team are still around and active:\n\nPeter Forsberg started off the first season with a bang, scoring 37 goals and 54 points as the fourth forward on the Wings. Since then Forsberg has played more than 700 games in an NHL career that has seen him grow into a very productive player.\n\nJustin Abdelkader is now on the Hall of Fame in his own right, but he was on the Wings' first roster at the time that they signed him and played more than 800 games with the Wings before landing in St. Louis. He had already put up quite a career, as he finished second in Hart Trophy voting in his first stint with the Blues in 1994-95.\n\nDwayne Roloson began this second season with the Red Wings. In the middle of the year he fell ill and missed the entire season, and while he returned for the next season the Wings' captain made a surprising retirement from the game. Since then, he has been a special teams performer with the Blues and is still active on the NHL landscape.\n\nRhyun Jang was the third overall pick by the Wings in 1991, but had two seasons after his selection with the club's AHL affiliate in Grand Rapids, finishing with 48 points in 65 games in 1994-95. His play in his final AHL season was not quite as good, as he played only 25 games that year, but he eventually found a more settled role with the organization.",
      "RENTON, Wash. -- Arizona's second-string quarterback might make his first NFL start this week.\n\nThe Arizona Cardinals will have backup quarterback Kevin Kolb in for their game against the Washington Redskins on Sunday. The team has not announced who will start at quarterback, but it's likely Kolb will start since backup quarterback Drew Stanton's contract expires at the end of this season.\n\nKolb last played for Arizona in the loss to the San Francisco 49ers last November. He came in for Stanton, who suffered a concussion against the 49ers. Stanton didn't practice Monday after being hurt, but the team said he was fine. He didn't play in that game.\n\nIt wasn't easy for the Cardinals to find an able replacement for Stanton, who had a reputation as a player who could lead the Cards to the promised land. Kolb was a third-round pick in 2006 and played mostly practice squad and minor league football last season, then played in Arizona as a late-game sub in each of the last two regular-season games during Stanton's absence.\n\nKolb made the Cardinals' roster in November when Stanton and Carson Palmer were lost to injuries in Week 6. The 30-year-old Kolb was 4-1 as the Cardinals' starter after coming in for Palmer on a short week against the New Orleans Saints in Week 1. He's 3-7 as the Cardinals' starter in his career, but he did have his streak of 16 consecutive starts streak snapped twice on his way to being benched after playing well in one game.\n\nHowever, Kolb played well last week in the Cardinals' 27-13 win over the Atlanta Falcons after Stanton suffered a concussion, and he's got an opportunity, especially at this time, to keep the starting job.\n\nKolb could lose the job to rookie Taylor Kelly, though if Stanton were to return by Week 10 -- a likely scenario -- Kolb could still play well and make the Cardinals a better team.\n\n\nCopyright 2015 by ClickOnDetroit.com.

      "This morning, we learned a bit more about the long-rumored The Last Jedi project. According to a new report from Digital Foundry, the new trilogy's third chapter will feature new effects in each of its three segments. A new shader will be used in each episode to add more realism and clarity to the lighting. In addition, there will also be a new lighting algorithm to help resolve some of the problems in the old trilogy.\n\nThe Last Jedi was expected to be released in theaters in December 2017, the first new title to hit that date since Star Wars: The Force Awakens came out last year. It looks like the movie will be out well before that due to the fact that it is being shot in a relatively short and efficient manner. We do not know the exact release date, but it has been slated to hit theaters on December 15 in North America and December 18 in Japan.\n\nIt's all about practicality\n\nTo get the most out of the new trilogy, the new effects will be a major part of the filmmaking process. \"Everything has to feel practical,\" producer Kathleen Kennedy said. The new trilogy will utilize special effects techniques like the ones seen in the J.J. Abrams films. \"Our challenge for shooting is to make the movies look as real as possible. At that point, we don't have to worry about color, we don't have to worry about textures, we don't have to worry about anything, because it all comes down to practical effects.\"\n\nHowever, these effects will not be used only on the new trilogy. Although some of the effects weren't present at all in The Force Awakens, the franchise is doing its best on bringing these effects in the sequel trilogy. According to Digital Foundry, special effects are already in high demand in both the new and next three trilogy. The Last Jedi is still in production at Pinewood Studios outside London, UK. The movie was filmed from October 15th to November 10th in Leicester, England and in Sydney. The following episode is reportedly scheduled to shoot from February 9th through February 16th in Los Angeles, USA.",
      "This is a story about a woman who has chosen to put her faith in a church that has been the source of countless horrors. It's about a woman who believes something that most people think is a lie. It's a story about a woman who can't believe that her child is alive. It's about a woman whose life has been altered by the death of her child.\n\nIt's also about a woman who is still alive.\n\nBut she won't tell you that.\n\nThere are some things that I just aren't going to tell you. A lot of this book is about her faith and faith healing. I didn't want to do a book about faith healing because I have too much personal knowledge to share. It's not something that I'd want my family to know.\n\nBut my sister is my brother's wife and I know what she has tried to do with her faith. It doesn't work. So let's just do it on my own terms. I'm going to tell you the story about a little guy who made such a difference in the lives of his family and then left them, to do things. I'm going to tell you about her experience.\n\nThe Beginning\n\nThe beginning was a very strange time for him, when she was pregnant. She had decided that she was going to have an abortion and go through with it. She was going to go to this clinic that they had, so the abortion would be covered.\n\nShe had a good friend in the waiting room who helped her pack herself up, and put all of her important personal things in a bag and they got her there. She didn't have any of her paperwork that she needed to carry. He handed it to her. She signed the papers and he was on his way. He took her out to the car that he was going to drive her. She was so nervous. She got out, and before they started the car, he told her that he needed a little something from her first.\n\nHe put an envelope in her hand. The back side of the envelope had a bunch of little papers in it. She thought that they were for a baby registry. He asked if she wanted to read the papers. She looked over them, and they were birth certificates and medical information. She knew who they were for, so she said yes. She never thought that it was going to be for her child.\n\nAnd so it went. And then he gave her a small plastic bag, and she started to open it and she was holding the plastic bag in the palm of her hand. He asked her to hold on to it tightly, to remember to hold the bag tight because it was not for her, it was for his son. And she did hold onto the bag tightly, and it was a good, quiet moment of the woman that she was not going to let go of that bag. And when he handed her back the paper, she saw a picture of her baby and said in a very quiet, very sad voice, \"Oh, my God.\"\n\nWhat I found interesting is that they had a conversation about whether or not she was taking her child for adoption. She felt very strongly that she was not going to. She felt very strongly that he was never going to know where he came from.\n\nShe didn't even know who her adoption agencies were. She didn't know. She thought she had been adopted, or maybe she was adopted when she was still a teenager. She didn't know. She had no idea. So she wasn't going to take him unless they had a good, solid adoption plan that they were all on and she knew that she wanted him.\n\nHer boyfriend at the time told her that there was a child protective agency that she could go to if she wanted to, but she was going to take it anyway, and she was not going to be an \"adoption\" mom or mommy. She had to be the leader of this family that he was in. He was going to be the one who would teach her baby lessons with the Bible. And he was going to be who taught her how to be a mother.\n\nThere was one very strange thing that was said, which is that the state of Indiana said that they had come into custody. They were taking the baby away from them. They had taken it away from them, and they were going to give it to a \"parental agency\" because that's who they felt they could trust. And the other thing that was kind of strange was that it turned out that they did not have custody of him for long, but they had been taking him for a very long, long time.\n\nAnd they said, \"Well, if you're going to be a mom, you're going to need to learn some parenting skills.\" So that was all about teaching him to be a boy to be trained, not to be a man, and that was the kind of training they were providing for her, to prepare",
      "Guns and ammo are seen as two of the main weapons of the world, but in the world's biggest market for guns, a group called the Million Moms for Gun Control is challenging moms to boycott Target (NYSE:TGT) over its controversial gun policy.\n\nThe pro-gun control group started a campaign called #TargetBlackFriday, which calls for a boycott to pressure Target and other retail chains to ban guns in its stores.\n\nWhat's behind the boycott campaign?\n\nThe gun store chain was in the news recently, when news broke that its co-founder and Chairman, Gregg Steinhafel, was the subject of a federal grand jury investigation, which led the Justice Department to seize property and charge him with selling illegal firearms and ammunition to criminals.\n\nIt has also been revealed that Steinhafel's company, Gander Mountain, was the subject of two lawsuits filed by the Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) in 2010. The first lawsuit resulted in the company agreeing to pay more than $60 million in restitution to people affected by \"tampering and counterfeiting\" that occurred in the company's stores, including one of its largest store chains, Target. The second lawsuit, a class action lawsuit, resulted in the largest recall of a product in history, involving more than 6 million products.\n\nIt's likely the Moms for Gun Control are working on other ways to pressure Target (NYSE:TGT) and other businesses to end gun sales, such as placing a \"Do Not Stop at Target\" call to consumers and asking them to take note that they could face arrest for doing something that could save their lives, such as calling for help after someone is shot. These \"No Guns\" signs may also cause some shoppers to wonder if they can keep a gun in their car, given the number of places that allow guns inside.\n\nA Target spokeswoman confirmed the retailer has seen a rise in demand for firearms this Black Friday season. \"In our stores, we see people shopping to support their local communities, and they are certainly no stranger to using weapons as part of their safety strategy,\" she said.\n\nMore broadly, however, Target was also recently the subject of controversy after its CEO and CFO were accused of paying themselves more than 2 million dollars in bonuses last year, according to the Wall Street Journal. While the company has not commented on its stock, it's clear that the boycott may have helped Target in terms of overall sales.\n\nOther retailers, too, face the same issues, as many have seen strong growth in sales and profits in the year since the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre.\n\nTarget's competitors, however, will have to do a better job of winning over consumers' hearts and minds. The company has already seen a huge surge in sales of children's clothing due to the Sandy Hook tragedy, and shoppers will have to make up their minds if they want to be part of that trend with another round of gun bans.\n\nRelated:\n\nWhy Target is not going to let its sales collapse\n\nTarget's Chief: We were not negligent in the Sandy Hook tragedy\n\nTarget CEO 'shocked' by the Sandy Hook tragedy\n\nThe views expressed in this article are the author's own and do not necessarily represent MarketWatch's editorial policy.",
      "The following was written by our own Editor in Chief, Ryan Gorges.\n\n\nIt's one thing having an opinion on your favorite band in a record review. It is quite another going down and seeing these opinions reflected within a concert, an album art or artwork. It may be difficult to understand why so many people dislike Black Sabbath, and how it started over twenty years ago. It's a well known fact that Black Sabbath had very little interest in the American music business and never truly tried to gain an audience in the US. The band was not popular overseas and their biggest hit at home was not 'Iron Man,' it was 'War Pigs' when the band were just starting to rise up to the top. This is not an example of a band that would stop at anything to get in top form and gain an audience. In fact, it was because of the band's lack of popularity that they eventually broke up after 'Heaven and Hell,' and that was in 1968. Since then the band has gone into relative obscurity and the band themselves have been a bit more active in the music business while also developing one of their own that they released in 1989 called 'Iron Man' which was never a massive success.\n\n\nBlack Sabbath didn't start to gain any popularity until 1978 with 'Paranoid' which was an incredibly well marketed, well produced and very popular rock album. The album broke record sales, topped the charts and made the band, along with their manager Clive Davis a bit more known. Clive Davis is a legendary man who was the first recording industry executive to come out against the practice of using royalties to subsidize artists. Clive Davis was eventually kicked out of the business for his role in pushing the RIAA into their campaign against illegal file sharing on the internet.\n\n\nAfter 'Paranoid', Black Sabbath's following continued to climb higher and higher due to the massive popularity of their albums and the band's high quality touring. However, it was a very bad sign for the band when they managed to get a massive hit in the summer of 1982 with 'St. Elmo's Fire'. 'St. Elmo's Fire' was a hit and one of Sabbath's biggest hits to that point which is a testament to the great songwriting and production that went into the record. That record, along with 'War Pigs,' was the last one they made. The label eventually decided that Black Sabbath was too big a risk and that their success would start a chain reaction of major label bands. In an interview with the Guardian, Clive Davis admitted that he wasn't happy with their new sound or album sales and he wanted the band gone. Clive Davis ended up leaving the band sometime around the time 'Cannibal' came out and it was announced in 1987 that Black Sabbath would be reuniting in 1988 to begin making new and better records.\n\n\nSo the end came and two decades later the band was back in the limelight. A lot of people remember the reunion not for 'Cannibal,' but for their second album 'Master of Reality' which was released in 1989. The album sold around 4,000,000 copies and still holds the number 2 spot on the world top 10 album chart for 1988. The release of the album brought many people back into the fold again and Black Sabbath was back and more popular than ever before. 'Master of Reality' was another extremely well received album but it was a mistake for the band, and it became their downfall. On the strength of 'Master of Reality,' the band was promoted as one of the most important bands of the current generation (or at least it felt like it during the \"Back During the Day\" era.) The band began to get a reputation for their extreme musicality and the band had their biggest hit back in 1992 with \"Crazy Train.\" This was followed by the album \"The Dark Side of the Moon,\" which not only broke records, but the record for the highest selling album in the history of American music. It sold 1,000,000 copies in just one week. The record wasn't done though and the album's sales figures only continued to skyrocket when \"Echoes on the Grave\" and \"The Song Remains the Same\" broke the sales record for a rock album. 'Echoes on the Grave,' the second single off the album, sold nearly 2 million copies and 'The Song Remains the Same' sold over 2 million copies as well.\n\n\nFrom there, Black Sabbath got out of control, all the while continuing to expand upon the sound that had taken them years to create. The album was full of bands like Slayer, Mastodon and Anthrax and each band's sound completely clashed with the others and Black Sabbath never really knew what to do. The problem with this is that the band had become so big when the bands in the metal scene would call them out for playing in an overly technical way. Metal bands would criticize Black Sabbath for not being the \"real\" metal and instead playing in the pop style and they would continue to promote Sabbath to",

      "The last time a team on the NBA Finals field did what Golden State did was back in 2012, when they were the second seed behind Miami. The Spurs' run was pretty incredible but it was also a team-wide achievement, with the exception of Tim Duncan, who had been out all year. The Spurs were the best home team in basketball. San Diego State's three road victories out of their 12 games was as bad as it gets.\n\nThis year, Golden State's run to the Finals was a team-wide one. It was fueled by a great defense, a great offense that averaged 99.7 points per 100 possessions and an unbelievable 3-1 record against the Warriors. The team was very close to missing the finals last year after blowing a 3-1 lead on the Spurs to the Mavericks in Game 7, but managed to pull it off.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors are in the NBA Finals.\n\nIt is one of the biggest upsets in NBA Finals history, as the underdog Warriors beat the defending champs 6-0. San Francisco has been to the Finals seven times, falling in each game. There were a few moments of excitement on Saturday but when you do that in seven finals you have to be able to beat the Warriors.\n\n\"I don't expect anyone to underestimate us, but I also expect them to give us our toughest game in the Finals or else we got nothing, that's the thing we do here,\" Stephen Curry said.\n\n\"It's a total upset right there. A first time in the league, we upset the champs. That's the greatest upset you have ever seen in sports.\"\n\nIf there is something you have seen that hasn't quite added up, perhaps you can explain that with this graphic. Here's an explanation via Sean Fagan of the San Francisco Chronicle as to why San Francisco is the most surprising team in the league, but that's a discussion for a separate article.\n\nThe Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in four games, taking three of the games by double-digit margins. The three losses are not all against first place teams – Oklahoma City's losses came in triple-overtime at home from the Los Angeles Clippers and Utah Jazz. San Francisco's victories are in front of teams with a combined record of 17-66 against the Warriors; OKC is 10-51. The Golden State win streak was its longest since a four-game winning streak in 2015 that was matched two weeks later by the Dallas Mavericks.\n\n\"The Warriors are one of the best team's I've ever coached in the league, the best players in the league. I can't even put it into words,\" Jeff Van Gundy said. \"I think they're incredible. The fact they lost to the Thunder tonight, the Thunder are still probably in the playoffs, so it's one game. If a guy says they're the best team in the league, you shouldn't play well as an offense, you shouldn't try to play defense against them. I know we're having a tough time, the Spurs and all that, but these Warriors are so good. To go up against that team, it's like you're in the NFL and you're not playing against the Jaguars anymore, you're playing them every single week.\"\n\nSydney and New York were the other two teams playing in the NBA Finals. It didn't take long for them to tell the Warriors how dominant they are on both ends of the floor. The Warriors dominated throughout two games in the finals, taking two games from the Knicks and one from the Spurs. As much as San Francisco loves to talk about defense, it's hard to take them seriously when they allowed 111 points per 100 possessions this series, the best in the league.\n\nIn those games, the Warriors had multiple players who played much better than their regular season averages from every angle, and in Game 3 and Game 4 they had a player (Klay Thompson) averaging over 18 points while shooting 58 percent from the field. He also put up 21 points in Game 4, and he hit three triples Saturday.\n\n\"I don't know what they do to people. I have no idea,\" Warriors coach Steve Kerr said.\n\n\"The other team might be good but they just don't do enough to really change the momentum when you get a lead. They need to do it for the other team to really feel some pressure. They can do it for themselves when they're good and I don't really know how they keep people out of the paint because they're so big and strong.\"\n\nIn order to have success against the Warriors, the San Francisco 49ers had to learn how to play defense better than the Golden State Warriors.\n\nThe Niners played an average of only 97.7 points per game throughout the entire regular season. In the entire postseason, they only gave up 108.6 points per game.\n\nThe entire San Francisco defense, which is typically much worse than the defense of the rest",

      "I'm not a man of religion, but if the first time I ever wrote about this topic was back in 2001, it would look like this.\n\nI had been in the military for a year, serving as a combat medic. I had always been a devout Christian. My Christian faith was important to me. It had been my guiding light and a source of strength for so many years.\n\nEvery Christmas night my parents would take me back to a church where I had grown up. I would sit in the pew for hours waiting for a gospel song to begin, trying in my mind not to let a single sentence escape my lips. My mother would be the first to give me her blessings, and then my father would finish the song. I would always thank them for the service and God's love they offered to our family. There were countless stories of loving people who were brought to Christ, and I was one of them.\n\nI'd be standing in the pew in prayer, and my military service and my Christian faith would connect with me. It would be so real to me, I would think that if I wasn't a Christian, I would be one soon. I felt like Christ would want me to be.\n\nThen, one Sunday morning at the age of 22 I came home and saw a man in the hall, holding a gun.\n\nThe man, who was white, had a shaved head and beard, and no shirt. He entered my home and pointed the gun at my mom. I heard his conversation with her, but didn't understand why the gun was pointed at me.\n\nI never really understood the motive behind the gun; I was just so confused that I did not understand. I tried to ask the man to drop the gun, but it would simply go off. It happened slowly, one shot after another, and then I'd see smoke and then silence.\n\nThere was a woman lying in the next room, and I couldn't figure out if it was my mom or my father. Both had been shot in the head.\n\nI watched my father limp to the car, leaving just the shirtless, bearded figure in the doorway.",
      "New Hampshire resident Stephen Stills is one of those people who believe every day is Christmas, so it should come as no surprise when the artist of \"Merry Christmas, Santa Claus,\" decided to bring everyone a little extra.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Stills uploaded a photo of him in an old suit to his Instagram profile, complete with the caption, \"Christmas is a holiday that is about giving, a time to give to others and a time to remind ourselves to give in the future.\"\n\nThat's exactly what he did, according to police who say Stills tried to rob a North Smithfield, New Hampshire bank in a bizarre fashion. In an alleged attempted robbery, Stills reportedly held a note demanding money so he could get some presents for his own family, reports WGHP. After robbing the bank, Stills apparently left the note, which contained a gun. After leaving the bank, Stills allegedly drove around the city, where he stopped a vehicle and demanded money, again leaving behind the note.\n\nStills was charged with second-degree robbery and attempted robbery, as well as possession of a weapon. It's not clear how Stills obtained the gun.\n\nStills is due back in court on Feb. 3.\n\nMORE: Police: Man Uses Knife To Steal $8,000 In Canned Foods In Iowa",

      "Cape Town - A new research paper suggests that while the economy may not show visible improvements on the ground these are only short term improvements, based on indicators such as growth of productivity.\n\n\"While the economy grew by 2.1% in Q3 compared to last year, productivity growth slowed to a still-rebounding 2.7% in Q3 from an average of 3.6% in the prior three quarters,\" the journal of the African Financial and Economic Studies (AFES) said on its webpage on Thursday.\n\nThe AFES added that \"as the economic slowdown continues to deepen, this slowdown will eventually bite down on the GDP\".\n\n\"These are the slowest, fourth consecutive quarter of annual wage growth and growth of private consumption at its two lowest levels since 2009.\"\n\nAfrica's biggest economy, South Africa's, reported a 2.9% growth in gross domestic product (GDP) for the quarter. The official statisticians attributed this to higher investments in production. SA's GDP grew by 1.4% in July compared with June, and it's predicted to grow by 1.1% in August.\n\nIt's been a quarter of stagnation for South Africa, with unemployment at 6.7%.\n\nSouth Africa has been the most troubled region in the continent as well as the OECD since Q4 last year (the most recent data available).\n\nSince then, Africa's GDP growth has slowed down to an average of 1.2%, the AFES noted. The economies of the region are growing by an annual average of just 0.1% for this period.\n\nAccording to the AFES, SA's productivity was just 0.1% in Q3 on a quarterly basis, down from 0.3% last quarter and 0.5% in Q2.\n\nIt's expected to improve from Q3 to Q6 by 1.3% on quarter and 2% on a quarterly basis, it added.\n\nThe AFES urged macroeconomic policy to help accelerate the process of productivity.\n\n\"The current weakness in South Africa's productivity growth, the sluggish and unproductive labour market, and the continuing structural and institutional deficiencies of the labour market, suggests that South Africa's growth will remain unproductive in 2015.\n\n\"Achieving strong growth in productivity will only be possible if we are able to address these shortcomings. Policies that raise productivity will require strong public and private investment in human capital, training, and skill enhancement.\"\n\nThe Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) and the main Left Democratic Movement (MDL) political parties criticized the report for its \"false conclusions\" and that it has \"completely ignored the productivity factors that directly determine a country's economic growth\".",

The outbreak, centered in Staten Island, NY, has infected more than a dozen patients, including two children, since Feb. 15.\n\nOf the 22 people who have become ill with confirmed cases, eight have been hospitalized, and all have recovered.\n\nAccording to a statement released by the New York State Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (NYSDMH), the outbreak has infected a total of 34 people from six different states. Seven of the eight patients have been hospitalized and all have recovered.\n\n\"While these cases were initially reported in the same geographical location, no evidence suggests a common source,\" said NYSDMH.\n\nTwo of the eight people who have become sick were unvaccinated. One of them, a 4-year-old boy, had not received a measles, mumps or rubella (MMR) vaccine at 12 to 15 months of age. The other, a 28-year-old man, had not received a diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis, or acellular pertussis (DTaP) vaccine, which are considered the standard vaccines against these diseases to prevent whooping cough.\n\nThe first case in New York City was diagnosed last week, but the outbreak is already growing.

      "I'm a professional poker player who got hit with the ultimate \"don't go there\" note last week.\n\nThe note, which is attached to this post, comes from one of the main poker sites. It says exactly what is on the table for any player who does that: get off the street and play more poker. Of course, for a real-life professional poker player it's a great note. After all, that would be the only option for a player coming down with a virus or other kind of computer glitch. (The poker sites don't use virus detectors, so the only way to know for sure was to ask the site that hit you for more details.)\n\nFor me, the note was more of a reminder than an ultimatum. If a player is getting hacked, it should be the last thing they do. Especially if this hacker is able to steal your money and play you for free money in a few days.\n\nSo the next time a computer hits you with a virus or any other kind of software bug, do yourself a favor and shut down the computer for at least 30 minutes. Don't worry: it doesn't have to be a computer.\n\nHere is the full text of the note that came to me:\n\nI am disgusted every single time. This is why you can't go there.\n\nAs a professional poker player you can't be a good person and play poker. Your skill level is not high enough. If you are that bad it needs to stop.\n\nIt's not that I don't appreciate your passion. It's that you need to think before you click your mouse. Go down the road of being a good person. Play more poker. Start saving more money. Stop spending that extra $30 a month to play with someone like me. Or more, you don't need to worry about it. I will just send you some money to send you up the road, don't worry about it.\n\nWe live in different times. You need to remember your history with poker. You haven't done any good at all since you started taking bets on other players' hands. It was always a joke. You are not playing in a casino and not only your chips, but your reputation, are at stake. Your good name is the most important, not only in poker but in life. You are lucky to be a real player. But there are some real money players who play better. They won't be there for you if you go down in losses. If the real players who will be there for you would have any kind of respect or care for your money, you would have a much better chance to come back up on your feet.\n\nYou need to know the difference between a real player and a \"playing a bad hand\", as you say. It's not a card game where you have to keep making money from a large hand.\n\nJust like in real life, once you see how bad it is, you won't play in that hand again, even if it might win you some money. Playing a bad hand is a mental health issue. That's what everyone wants to call it in their game, but it's not even close to a real thing.\n\nThis kind of thinking that you don't have to win is wrong. The goal is not to win. The goal is to play better. There is nothing wrong with admitting it, as long as you can prove it. People in poker are willing to change. If you want better play, come over to poker. It's free, and for most of us, it is fun. Just get off the street and play more.\n\nSincerely,\n\nThe one who runs poker rooms\n\nThe last thing to say about this is: If you have a problem with online poker or online gaming then maybe you should stop. We are all human. We all have bad days. We all have bad habits. We all have our habits that we struggle with.\n\nThat's why it's important to treat your problem like a mental health case. See a doctor. See a mental therapist. Seek help.\n\nI don't know if this is the right place to send you any money though. If it is, I'm glad to know. If you do happen to be in need of cash, let me know and I will do whatever I can to get some for you.\n\nUpdate: I sent in the money for this post. Thanks for the support!\n\n(Image via)\n\nShare this: Twitter\n\nFacebook\n\nGoogle",

      "New Delhi: Former Chief Justice of India (CJI) T.S. Thakur on Thursday hit out at the Centre and expressed concern over the new law to create a unified law for crime against women.\n\n\"What is the government concerned with? I know my mother, she is a woman. We are talking about equal rights for women. There must be a law,\" he said in an interview to The Indian Express.\n\nThakur, who passed away late Wednesday at his residence in New Delhi, became the first Chief Justice of India to have opposed the new law on the grounds of gender discrimination.\n\nThe law comes into force with effect from 1 April and has been termed as an \"anti-dowry\" law to prevent violence by husbands against their wives or partners. It makes the rape of a woman by her husband a non-bailable offence.\n\n\"To make the law to protect women, why have the government not made it to make such laws on women's rights which affects all women at all times?\" he asked.\n\nThe court said that the new law needs to be brought in line with a series of conventions in the fields of justice law, human rights and social justice. \"The law should be framed in a manner which suits the purpose to do justice to Indian society\", he said.\n\nStating that the case of murder of a man in a woman's house is very serious and has to be dealt with with a heavy punishment, Thakur said, \"We cannot take the law in an arbitrary manner\".\n\n\"The criminal law cannot decide what crime is to be committed against a woman. The court also cannot make a law at will on the basis of social values. And then what will happen?\" he asked.\n\nThe veteran advocate also said it is a huge disappointment that the Supreme Court passed down what he termed as a \"nasty\" judgment by a three-judge bench on 26 October.\n\n\"That judgment is really damaging for our justice system. It will create such problem like if a couple fights in a house in Delhi and a man shoots his wife in a Delhi bus, people will say that woman was resisting him and that makes her murder eligible.\n\n\"In such cases, there is no crime to the man who could shoot his wife,\" Thakur said.\n\nHe also questioned the reasoning behind \"making an exception\" to the laws on dowry and adultery and passing down a one-off compensation of Rs. 2 lakh for murder of a husband in the wife's house.\n\n\"That compensation would not be sufficient to recover the woman. The compensation can be raised to Rs.5 lakh for each year of husband's confinement. There is no difference between Rs.2 lakh and Rs.5 lakh. The victim's family can approach the court, we also have to pay the compensation too,\" he said.\n\nThakur was in New Delhi to attend the funeral of former Bihar Governor Ram Manohar Lohia along with his daughter. Thakur has been appointed a member of the Supreme Court Law Officers Council. The Council was established on Wednesday by the apex court.",

And I'm also looking at other things, because a lot of people are asking that question.\"\n\nHe added, \"I have a very good relationship with President [Denis] Tsipras of Greece. He asked me about a week ago, 'What about a unified military effort between Ukraine and the U.S.? What about it?' And I said, 'You know what, it would be great. Let's see if we can do that.' \"\n\nThe president also is meeting Thursday with European leaders to discuss the Ukraine situation and other international concerns.\n\nThe proposal would have to pass Congress before it can be used and has been highly criticized not just by European leaders but by the White House itself for providing arms to Ukraine only after Russia annexed Crimea.\n\nThe Obama administration, as well as the Obama White House, had said that supplying Ukraine with weapons would not interfere with the Minsk cease-fire agreement.\n\nPoroshenko on Thursday told reporters at the European Union Conference in Brussels that he'd had a \"very positive\" conversation with Trump on \"many important issues.\" He added, however, that Trump was only in charge of the U.S. National Security Council and the president has the \"constitutional authority\" to provide support to Ukraine but not at the expense of the Minsk Agreement.\n\n\"We have to put the Minsk agreement as the main priority now,\" he said.\n\nPoroshenko said he was looking for cooperation from the U.S., European Union, Russia and others as Ukraine tries to rebuild its forces in the east and return control over the strategic border region with Russia to Ukraine.\n\nPoroshenko also said that his government has received a formal proposal for a three-year economic assistance program but he didn't provide any details.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed a measure in June authorizing the President to provide defense and assistance to Ukraine. The bipartisan bill was sponsored by Rep. Barbara Lee (D-California) but was not signed by Trump before its July 1 deadline.\n\nPushing back, U.S. State Department Spokesman John Kirby said that he \"didn't know\" whether the Trump administration was considering providing weapons to Ukraine.\n\n\"We are always careful in how we work with anyone outside our formal bilateral relationship, including the European Union, and especially in the midst of our very challenging negotiations,\" he added. \"So for the time being we're not commenting on this.\"",

I just didn't want to waste another year of your life doing things you can do from the comfort of home, and the way you always take charge of those classes is amazing.\"\n\nHermione blushed at his compliment, and a part of her didn't want to be embarrassed, because she thought she was pretty good at history. But she knew better, and she let out an irritated, \"I'm so glad I didn't tell you that.\"\n\n\"No?\"\n\n\"No.\" She gave Harry a serious look for one silent second, but then she regained composure and said, \"I know you're saying that, but I was being...stubborn.\"\n\n\"Why would you be?\"\n\n\"Honestly. I can't even read the books, much less write.\"\n\n\"What?\"\n\n\"I can write at times, but it doesn't always come to me. I get it half the time, I just can't make up my mind. I don't remember what I started on a couple of paragraphs or even a page ago, and that really bugs me.\"\n\n\"Really.\"\n\n\"Yes,\" she said, and there was a smile to her voice that made Harry think she was being truthful. \"I think. Hermione Granger, is a terrible student.\"\n\nHarry laughed aloud at Hermione's little speech. Hermione thought she had made a point of not talking to him if she felt any shame, but when he said that as an insult, that broke her. After he'd apologized for that stupid comment he'd made the summer before, she had said she didn't think she was a horrible student, she just didn't think she could do things as well from home as she could at Hogwarts. Harry had laughed again, and it had made her smile again, though that time it was a bit forced.\n\nNow, though, he was talking about her inability to concentrate. He couldn't even recall the content of her class, let alone the material she had been studying. \"How about I try to get help from some of my friends to help you? I know I have more time in my schedule than I think I do, but I just want everyone to...help you.\"\n\nHarry frowned at those words, but decided he couldn't say anything right now. It was a sensitive subject, and he simply didn't want to risk upsetting her.\n\n\"What about Ron?\"\n\nHarry looked puzzled for a moment, but then his face turned bright red. \"I'm not sure I can ask him for help, Hermione. I think he would want to come with me, and I...\"\n\nShe couldn't hear Harry's last words; he was crying. \"I...I'm sorry.\"\n\nHarry's face changed from bright red to a deep, dark red, and it was only when Harry was trying to sit up that Hermione heard his last words. \"I didn't think...you'd let me leave without telling me.\"\n\n\"I will try to explain. But I'm worried about you.\"\n\n\"I know.\" Harry leaned his head back and closed his eyes.\n\n\"But this is the first time I'm hearing you say that.\"\n\nHarry opened his eyes and met Hermione's gaze, his eyes were puffy and red and swollen and red.\n\nHarry wiped his face with his hand, and Hermione couldn't help but lean forward as he wrapped his arms around her.",
      "MOSCOW, August 31. /TASS/. Russia's Foreign Ministry on Monday voiced its concern over the detention of former US intelligence service contractor Edward Snowden in Russia.\n\n\"We are seriously concerned about the detention of former U.S. intelligence official Edward Snowden, in a request to Moscow by the Ecuadorian consulate, which has been made in breach of Russia's obligations. This step is a manifestation of the US aggression against countries as sovereign states. We are convinced that this step is illegal,\" the Russian Foreign Ministry said.\n\n\"We are convinced that there is no need for such a restrictive measure. Russia has never offered Snowden any type of asylum, as confirmed by the Russian Foreign Ministry. We express our concern at the violation of Russian obligations as an international state. Edward Snowden, however, must be handed over to the United States for legal purposes, within the framework of international law,\" the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nIt stressed that it is ready to help to establish a dialogue on mutual concerns and issues with the United States, as the issue is currently the subject of \"tense situation\" in international relations.\n\n\"In this respect, we also have to stress that we consider it unacceptable if this situation doesn't find a peaceful resolution,\" the statement said.\n\nThe Russian government made a reciprocal request to the United States on August 31. An Ecuadorian diplomat has been asked to help negotiate Snowden's extradition and hand him over to authorities in Russia. The Ecuadorian government said a bilateral delegation has already met with United States officials in Moscow and Washington DC, but that all Russian official diplomatic representatives in the United States had been turned away.\n\nThe Ecuadorian consulate in Moscow has been requested to help arrange Snowden's temporary residence in the city, where he is allowed to leave, and has been granted such permission. \"This is no ordinary request and it is not directed against any country,\" the Foreign Ministry said.\n\nIn the meantime, US State Department spokeswoman, Victoria Nuland, has said on August 30 that Edward Snowden had requested an immediate temporary asylum in Ecuador.\n\nIn April, when Snowden leaked information on the NSA surveillance activities, Russia was one of the countries that supported his actions. The country has already granted Snowden's request for asylum, but Washington has refused it. Washington has promised to \"defend\" Snowden, should he decide to go abroad, and to extradite him to the US. However, the United States has not made any extradition offer and a formal request for Snowden's extradition has not been submitted.",
      "I am writing this book to share my personal experiences with a topic that no one ever talks about, which is the role of religion in helping the average person to understand how the world works.\n\nThe reason I write a book is to spread my story to others so that they can better understand what is right and what is wrong.\n\nI believe that God has designed all life to thrive by creating many pathways for us (myself included) to succeed and succeed often. So for me the only way I could hope to understand why certain things work and why some fail was to learn from many different people who lived under various circumstances. It is an impossible task, but I have tried to write this book for those of us who are just beginning our journey into the world of science and medicine, who are interested in improving our society, or are simply curious about these topics.\n\nOne way in which many people try to understand why certain things happen is through the use of statistics. When you think about it, statistics are fairly basic pieces of information that are used to understand how the world works. However, when you are learning about statistics for the first time, or when you start learning about statistics for the first time with something as non-technical as the weather forecast, you may find that statistics are really hard for you to understand.\n\nStatistics is also a very popular subject in the computer science field. In fact, many people think that it is one of the best ways to learn about the world but I can't stress enough that statistics isn't good enough on its own. It is only a piece of information if our goal is to understand the world. In reality it is only a subset of much more complicated information that we need to understand about the world.\n\nWhen it comes to helping people understand the world, and why certain things happen, my advice is simple. Get out of your comfort zone. In other words, try things on for size before you believe that they work, and see what happens. If something seems like it is very complicated but in the end helps a lot of people, then that doesn't mean it is bad, it just means that it isn't that complex to begin with, so be sure to test it out and see if it works for you.\n\nWith that in mind, I have started writing this book. I would encourage people to read through it before reading any of the chapters to have a better understanding of how my work helps people.\n\nIf you are interested in the book's contents, feel free to contact me here or at info (at) cse.dod.mil",

      "Ralph Northam has a very close relationship with Trump. | Getty Northam: I'm 'proud' of how I voted\n\nA tight race in Virginia led to an intense back-and-forth Sunday evening in which Democratic gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam made one point: He was \"proud\" of how he voted on Election Day that brought Donald Trump into the White House.\n\nSpeaking to ABC 10 News, the state's lieutenant governor dodged direct questions about whether he plans to support Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton, nor when he would announce his political intentions. But in response to a question about whether a Clinton or Trump presidency would be \"more important,\" Northam made his case:\n\nNortham: I've been proud to do everything I can to get this country moving again, to make it a place where you can build new factories, get young people, young people doing useful work. And if we do that, we're going to have a stronger country for the future.\n\nI would have voted for Hillary Clinton this November. I'm proud to count on my own accomplishments.\n\nAt the end of the interview, Northam offered an update on his own political intentions, saying he planned to \"go out and tell you how I voted tomorrow,\" and that he hopes Virginia voters can be confident.\n\nIt's not the first time Northam has used a news event to promote his relationship with Trump: In a recent interview with The Atlanta Journal Constitution, he called his relationship with the president \"pretty good,\" and said he's been \"in touch with Ivanka Trump since he was elected,\" adding that the family will be coming to the \"great Commonwealth\" to help with some political fundraising for the Virginia Democratic Party.\n\nLast month, Northam, who is up for reelection Wednesday, called on all Virginians to vote. \"Our elections, and the choices we face in the next year, will determine whether our country remains the beacon of hope and opportunity it has been throughout our history or turns in on itself into a dark place where the strong and the privileged and the well-connected rule, and the rest of us are powerless,\" he said, according to a news release issued by the Democratic Party of Virginia.\n\nDuring the news conference Sunday, Northam said the Republican Party would \"disastrously\" damage the state's economy if it had any hope of winning.",
      "The first question that comes to mind when viewing this picture may be \"Where is the man in this picture?\" As the man is wearing no pants, you can imagine his predicament, that is if he is wearing pants in this picture.\n\nThat is because this photograph was taken in the summer of 1866 and the man is the world's smallest man on earth. The photo was a gift from one Alexander Pongratz, a German artist who had traveled all the way to the United States to see the life in New York that he was familiar with.\n\nAt the time, Pongratz was working on various portrait projects, but he was looking for a way to commemorate his trip so that he could present them at a later date. At the Smithsonian in Washington D.C. Pongratz presented the photograph to the Smithsonian Institution as a \"gift.\"\n\nToday there is no information on the photo beyond its origin and why it was chosen. The man's name is unknown to us.

But Shrestha's mother had decided to take her daughter back in time for Holi festival, and thus they stayed in Mumbai for almost two months.After finally arriving back, they had arranged for Shrestha's parents to fly from Vile Parle to Mumbai on Saturday morning where it was arranged to be celebrated.Patil, who is a resident of Mumbaikar Parel, and Shrestha, a student of B.A. in nursing and pathology from JJ College , have decided to celebrate their marriage on Sunday at Vile Parle College.\"It was a surprise for myself and my family that we got married even a year after my graduation. We had always planned to do so during the week to avoid too much of travel with two young kids,\" said Patil, adding that his wife and mother are ecstatic.A senior home ministry official said it would be mandatory for the school managements to conduct a meeting to discuss the issue of issuing licences for weddings of students during the Holi festival. \"If it's not possible to hold a reception for the couple, then schools who are already on their wedding list may be asked to hold an emergency meeting during Holi,\" he said, adding it will be up to the school managements to decide on the matter. The official also added that if the couple plans to take the rest day as their full day, then only those on the home department list may attend the celebration.",

      "\"We're having difficulty finding a house in a reasonable price range where our students are being treated fairly by their realtors,\" said Mr. Luecke. \"In a lot of ways, they feel they're being robbed of the right to negotiate a value for their property.\"\n\nThis is bad news for the city. In its quest to improve the quality of life it creates, it has created a system designed to give people what they want, when they want it. And with houses selling for record levels — more than $1-million this year, for example — housing is the most over-priced component of the residential sector, according to the provincial government's website, which suggests most of the housing in Metro Vancouver was built by developers.\n\nThe lack of competition means that prices remain depressed, and many buyers are forced to put in long-term commitments to move, or have to stay in rental property that in turn eats up resources like rent control. The city can't continue to let this persist, city planner Jennifer Keesmaat said in an interview.\n\nSome experts, however, see the problem in terms of supply rather than demand. They argue that Toronto and Vancouver can accommodate more housing density both now and in the future, with housing development in Toronto and Vancouver both expected to continue growing.\n\nPhoto\n\n\"Toronto is one of the great places to live in the entire world,\" said Christopher Beaulieu, an executive director at the Royal Bank of Canada in Toronto. \"The growth and supply of condos is so extraordinary that what the province has done in terms of the [condo] tax is absolutely necessary to try to bring the affordability back in.\"\n\nMr. Luecke, who is working on his second master's degree in urban studies at UBC, points out that he could move in next to downtown if his current place were to be demolished.\n\n\"My parents are getting old and they're happy with the way the neighbourhood is,\" he says. \"I would feel at home in Toronto.\"\n\nNewsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the year ended Oct. 31, condo units in Vancouver hit a record of 1.2 million, up 4 percent from the same time the year before.\n\nHe believes that the city is facing a shortage of the kind of multi-million-dollar rental properties that are required to bring down prices.\n\n\"We need to stop the insanity,\" he said.\n\nIf he could buy just one home in Metro Vancouver now, he would buy \"in East Van,\" an area that is being heavily redeveloped, he says. \"There is very little supply there.\"\n\nOne property of interest, a four-bedroom townhouse in the West End, sold last month for $2.14-million, about $500,000 above the asking price. The asking price at the time was $1.1-million, according to the real estate board. The buyer was a wealthy Vancouverite with a history of buying into Vancouver's overheated housing market — something the city is now paying attention to.\n\nCity council is currently looking at proposals for a new development levy that would force developers to add a certain percentage of affordable housing in their projects. Mr. Luecke says it is already the case that the developer of his townhouse paid a tax — about $600,000 — because of the development in the neighbourhood that he wanted to purchase.\n\n\"I think there's something that we're doing wrong, as a municipality,\" he says.",
      "DALLAS — Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump called for suspending immigration from regions of the world he said were \"compromised by terrorism\" at a campaign rally Friday, setting off alarm bells among Muslim activists.\n\n\"We have to suspend immigration from regions that have been compromised by terrorism, especially from the regions of the world that have had the biggest problems,\" Trump said. \"If we don't know what we're doing, we're doing nothing, folks.\"\n\nTrump's comments came as he sought to appeal to conservative Christian and traditionalist GOP voters as he has grown closer to the rest of the pack in the Republican presidential race. During an appearance on NBC's \"Meet the Press,\" Jeb Bush said he was \"disturbed\" by the plan.\n\n\"I think what Trump said is not only wrong on the facts, but it's dangerous,\" said Bush, the former governor of Florida. \"There are a lot of good people there, but the idea that we ban all Muslims from coming to the U.S. is dangerous and would lead us into a battle between us and the American people.\"\n\n[Trump calls for barring Muslims entering the U.S.]\n\nTrump's proposal immediately led to outrage from some American Muslims and from Muslim groups that have pushed hard during President Obama's administration to build stronger ties with the United States and its allies.\n\nAn official with the Council on American-Islamic Relations, which supports religious freedom in the United States and around the world, called Trump's proposal \"an incredibly dangerous proposition.\"\n\n\"Donald Trump's outrageous proposal to ban travel from several large majority-Muslim nations is not just un- American and un-Islamic, but it would be deadly for U.S. national security,\" said CAIR National Executive Director Nihad Awad.\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Homeland Security said DHS officials were not aware of any specific threat involving Trump's proposed ban, which has a variety of other provisions that experts said could potentially affect U.S. citizens, such as a moratorium temporarily barring refugees from certain regions unless further enhanced vetting procedures were put in place.\n\n[Hackers steal credit card data from Target, including 'precise retail ordering data']\n\n\"We would advise against any change in policy based on this announcement,\" said department spokesman Tyler Houlton.\n\nTrump's call for a temporary stop on immigrants from certain regions of the world is one of several positions he has embraced on the campaign trail, in which he has said he would seek changes to the nation's laws to prevent the United States from admitting Muslims. In the past, he has called for a database to be created tracking Muslims in the United States (he later said \"absolutely no religious databases\" in the United States are necessary), proposed banning the entry of Muslims into the United States, and threatened to impose a national ban on Muslims entering the country as well.\n\nAs part of the presidential campaign, Trump has frequently attacked fellow Republicans, including Bush. During a recent Republican presidential debate, Trump said that Bush may not have done well as governor of Florida but that he would \"have done well on the scale, of what he did.\" Then in his convention speech, Trump said: \"I'll be honest. Jeb, I'll be honest. You had a lot of people tell you it was impossible, but believe me, it can be done.\"\n\nTrump has come under fire recently for failing to immediately disavow Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke and for comments he has made about immigrants. In 2011, Trump called Mexican immigrants \"rapists\" and drug dealers. Last month, he said in a TV interview that Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), a war hero, is not a war hero because he was captured, a claim that was quickly rebuffed by McCain's campaign.\n\nJenna Johnson, Julie Tate, Ellen Nakashima, Robert Costa, Carol Leonnig, Philip Rucker, William Wan and Sarah Parnass in Washington contributed to this report, which has been updated.",
      "This was one of the more exciting debates on the ballot in the upcoming legislative session. Both candidates for the state Senate seat from Washington's 5th congressional district said they would be a positive influence on the legislation from Capitol Hill; one would be the best in Washington, while the other couldn't imagine a lawmaker with a better resume. And that's putting it mildly.\n\nBut while Republican state Sen. David Frockt said he's \"happily\" working \"hand in glove\" with Democratic Rep. Judy Chu (D-Seattle), both candidates didn't exactly paint themselves as liberal Democrats with a radical ideology or a strong aversion to conservative ideas. The candidates did express some of those same positions.\n\nAs we've learned, though, not all of the positions are consistent — and, as we've also learned, not all of those positions are liberal or conservative. One particular position, however, was repeated ad nauseam by three of the four candidates from opposite ends of Washington's political spectrum.\n\nThis was the candidate's only position at debate night:\n\nFrockt said he would like to make Seattle a sanctuary city, a designation that would prohibit city and state officials from enforcing federal immigration law.\n\nChu said she believes people in other states should be able to move to Seattle and seek affordable housing here.\n\n\"We want the best and brightest people, but we certainly want law-abiding people, too,\" Chu said.\n\nWe don't know exactly how many votes this was, but we do know that some voters found the candidates' positions surprising.\n\n\"I find my way, but sometimes my way is not the way of the mainstream,\" one voter told us. \"That position was a little surprising.\"\n\nFrockt also repeated his previous stance on marijuana. He said he favors the state's 2012 decriminalization law, but he doesn't like its restrictions requiring an employer to check the immigration status of people seeking federal contracts.\n\nChu supports marijuana legalization and said she plans to introduce a bill for full legalization in the next legislative session.\n\nAll three candidates said they would increase funding for public schools.\n\nThe candidates are among the three most prominent members of their district.\n\nCathy Glasson, the most prominent candidate for the Democratic nomination in that district, said in August that she'd never met a Republican or a conservative before she entered the race. She said her opponent, Frockt, is a conservative Republican.\n\n\"I don't think our nation as a whole is ready for a fully progressive, big-tent party, which is what the Democrats and Republicans have been doing, and I think this race is a good illustration of why,\" Glasson said, via video conference.\n\nHer Republican opponent, Brian Clem, also spoke at the same Seattle event. He said he opposes sanctuary cities but added that he thinks most Democratic candidates share that view. He also said this race is about bringing voters who don't usually participate in elections.\n\n\"People who haven't voted before in the state for many years are coming in,\" Clem said. \"And I think if we make that case, we can win.\"\n\nWe know the vast majority of voters in the Fifth Congressional District aren't big fans of anti-immigrant politicians like Chu and Frockt. And we know many voters are more comfortable with Democratic or progressive candidates than with anti-immigration candidates, or candidates of any party.\n\nWhat are the candidates' stances on marijuana legalization? A majority favor legalization. (A.J. Sisco/WSB photo)\n\nBut, regardless of how the candidates do in the election, it's clear that those opposing the candidates for the Democratic nomination in the Fifth Congressional District, in the primary in November, tend to be younger and more liberal — and not at all conservative.\n\nThat's how you end up with the three candidates discussing their legalization of marijuana in the same meeting room.\n\nWe also know that those opposing the candidates in the primary have no problem saying that marijuana use and possession is a violation of the law. But, according to the most recent public polling in Washington, legalizing pot could actually be the right choice for Washington voters.\n\nIn our latest WSB-SurveyUSA Poll, we found that 58 percent of Washington voters said marijuana usage should not be legal, the only other candidate for the Democratic nomination to get a majority in the survey was state Sen. Jamie Pedersen (D-Seattle). In that poll, 57 percent said they would vote for a candidate who supported marijuana legalization, while only 28 percent would vote for someone who opposed that change.\n\nNot surprisingly, the poll indicated that, along with the age of those supporting legal marijuana legalization, the youngest support the move — 57 percent of voters under 30 would likely vote for a candidate who supports legalizing it. It's actually older voters who show more support for legalization.\n\nWhile other candidates like Glasson and Clem support legalization, they",

      "A top FBI agent is set to testify in front of Congress about his interactions with two key figures in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia probe.\n\nThe testimony comes at a crucial time, as Special Counsel Mueller's investigation is increasingly closing in on President Donald Trump and his inner circle.\n\nThe Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism held a hearing with Deputy Director Andrew McCabe on Tuesday that he confirmed will be about his interactions with James Comey, the former FBI director whom he succeeded in August.\n\nMcCabe said he has asked the Justice Department to turn over all documents related to Comey, and he said he is confident they will disclose some details.\n\nHe also said Mueller's investigation has been very thorough, as he has requested an additional 250 interviews to date.

      "LONDON—A British professor, who has written extensively in books about Israel's supposed \"occupation\" of the Palestinian territories, was stripped of her teaching post Tuesday after an internal investigation concluded that she had expressed negative opinion about the Jewish state.\n\nDina Porat, 63, is a fellow of Israel's London School of Economics and Political Science, which she has chaired since 1997.\n\nThough Dr. Porat denies ever expressing any such negative views, a review of her writings and her lectures by her department staff concluded that she \"took an outspoken and aggressive position\" that was at odds with the school's stance on Israel and its policies, a statement on the school's website said.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\n\"While the Board acknowledges that these findings are sensitive on a very personal level, this does not affect our decision to terminate Professor Porat's employment at this time,\" it read. \"We feel this is the most appropriate decision given the seriousness of this issue and the impact that Dr. Porat's actions will have on the quality of our education.\"\n\nIt noted that the academic year was \"already underway\".\n\nIn an interview, Dr. Porat dismissed the decision, stressing that she has no \"moral qualms\" about voicing her political views. \"My political positions tend to be right,\" she said. \"My political stance is right within the international arena.\"\n\nDr. Porat has said that she is concerned by the way the Israeli government and military have come to control large portions of the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians claim for their future state.\n\n\"I am a professor at a world-class university that is very welcoming to all students,\" she said.\n\n\"People do come in and ask, 'What's going on, is Israel a democracy?'\"\n\nDr. Porat said she and her husband, a senior consultant at a multinational engineering company, decided to remain in Israel several years ago but were told to leave after she publicly criticized the government there.\n\nIn one case, shortly after she began teaching at the Morsky School of Advanced International Studies, a university in Jerusalem, she was reprimanded for \"inciting Palestinian youth against Israel,\" Dr. Porat said. After she protested, the president of the academic staff reportedly told her to keep quiet about Israel.\n\nIn the wake of protests about the treatment of Palestinians by Israeli troops last summer, Dr. Porat began to write about her experiences as a Palestinian. She has written that at times she suffered \"deliberate humiliation\" in front of her students in the summer camp, which she visited as part of her annual trip to Israel. At another time she was asked to change her academic research plan because it criticized the occupation.\n\nAs for Israel's policy of building homes for Jews, she wrote about how at her school she would often be met with insults, including having a Palestinian family member \"dressed up in Nazi costumes,\" after being mistaken for an Arab student.\n\nThe findings of the internal inquiry, which were released to the Guardian by a university official whose name was not revealed, were that Dr. Porat had expressed the opinion that the Israeli occupation would be in Israel's best interests at times as well as expressing views that conflicted with the school's official positions on foreign policy.\n\n\"This clearly goes against the ethos of the school and of the wider Jewish community here in the UK and is not in keeping with our commitment to academic freedom,\" said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity because she was not authorized to talk to the media.\n\nShe said the review was ordered at the behest of a senior official at the Jewish board of governors, who oversees the school.\n\n\"For too long, Jewish leaders in this country have been reluctant or hesitant to speak out about Israel, particularly the Israeli occupation,\" the official said.\n\n\"I think now, we are in a new day when the leadership of the Jewish community and its institutions see the occupation in one way or another as deeply problematic.\"\n\nDr. Porat said she had been notified of the investigation on Tuesday, and that she was not in favor of it.\n\n\"I don't believe the fact that an academic position has been in jeopardy is a cause for resignation,\" she said. \"In fact, I agree with some of the suggestions made in that statement.\"\n\nShe also said she wished the school well. \"I'll be thinking about the Israeli school,\" she said. \"It's a very great institution. I admire its leadership.\"",

      "The first time I saw a child with \"Lolita Syndrome,\" I thought it was just another thing kids said, a word used without much meaning. I was wrong. I was 14 years old and, to the best of my recollection, I'd been living in Miami with my parents and my younger sister when I heard it for the first time, on the first day of summer break I was taking. I had always felt at home in this kind of town, its warm, sunny weather more familiar to me than the cold winter of Florida. But, even in early June, something about the air, the music, the air quality, it felt like something else—something out of a horror movie or a movie noir. It was all at once too familiar, too far away, all at once unfamiliar: \"Hey, honey, what's this big box that's coming up the road?\" It was in the parking lot of a public park that I grew up nearby. My mother had just left and I followed her in.\n\nI was told it was a van, just like the one in the parking lot, but no one would help us out after school. We sat on the cement pavement of the parking lot for a period of 30 minutes, listening to the sounds of the truck's driver getting closer, and then I got out of the car, walking slowly towards the front of the van. With my long black hair, I'm pretty sure I couldn't look older than 10 years old. On the other side of that white fence was the driveway, where kids were playing basketball or whatever else. As far as I knew, there wasn't too much else to do there, save for a few adults that would sit on the porch in front of the clubhouse of the house we lived at the time. The fence was about a foot and a half high, with a white sheet covering it from one end to the other. At certain times, the wind started picking up, so the sheet moved around and we could barely see it. The fence was topped by a red plastic cover. I didn't mind the sound of its rustling though. I liked to see the little red flags flapping in the breeze; I even liked seeing those flags blow back and forth.\n\nI walked around the back of the van. My sister and I were trying to find something to put down on the cover. \"Where's the red cover?\" I finally asked her, looking down at the sheet from where I stood near the driveway. She took out a box from her backpack. \"This is the red cover for the fence around our driveway,\" she said. With the words tumbling out of my mouth, I remember the first thing I saw was a red flag in the breeze. I thought of my sister as we got close in. I knew if she saw it she would be happy for me because she wanted me to see it too. I just couldn't believe my eyes. I ran over and picked up the red flag, which was really the only thing she didn't want me to touch with my hands because it looked like it was still kind of fresh from the field. I was too eager; it still smelled pretty much the same though. As we looked at each other, I realized the thing that made her happy was that we were in the exact same spot! I was just getting used to the weather in this new place. I realized I wanted to go back to my family's house and watch TV with my mom and dad, we could talk about school and friends and just be a normal family, not worrying whether or not they'd die from cancer or some other disease. I didn't want to wait until it rained, the wind would get better, and everything would be just right for people to realize what a great life I was living. But, I knew all along that I knew my mom and dad would die before I did, in fact, I knew everyone who had died before I did. I had gotten used to the idea of how everything just fell into place, how everything fit together so well that it felt like fate or a gift, like destiny or something like that. Of course the next day they were dead, just as planned; of course I was gonna live the rest of my life doing all of that. I had only known people with a different kind of destiny; people who didn't fit into any order or structure, or even any reality at all.\n\nI had a lot to learn from her and her book, Lolita; I had been through so many weird times growing up in Miami, and I'd learned that everyone had their own weird shit they had to deal with, but I didn't appreciate what a difference it made until I started reading Lolita. What she brought to life in a book was my experience growing up in Miami. I saw people who were more innocent, more innocent than I was growing up in Miami in those books I loved. Some people I only seen as characters in books, but other people who were",
      "Cities across the United States have been turning to bike sharing programs to cut down on traffic and make downtown areas more pedestrian-friendly but what's not known is that this service is also having an economic impact by boosting rental prices for the city-dwellers who choose to walk their bikes instead of drive through the streets.\n\nThe cities that already rely heavily on bike sharing say that these bike sharing programs contribute to a \"complete street\" by helping to attract new businesses to the neighborhoods in which they're operating. The economic benefits of bike sharing, particularly in cities with a thriving downtown population, include improved connectivity – providing people from different neighborhoods access to goods and services, increased job opportunities and overall prosperity.\n\n\"Rentals can be higher in these communities than in areas without bike sharing stations,\" explained Dr. David Schleicher, Principal and President of the University of Minnesota's Metropolitan Area Planning Council.\n\nThe impact of bike sharing on prices in communities where bike share is well-developed appears to be similar to the impact of bike sharing itself. A study conducted by the United States Department of Transportation revealed that the amount of money cities collect in rental charges in areas without bike share stations was as much as 13 percent higher. The study also revealed that the overall effect on prices was not the same in all cities.\n\nThe economic impact on rental prices in the same areas is also similar to the effect of bike sharing itself, according to John Deasy, Bike Share Policy & Research Coordinator at Washington D.C. area advocacy group, Greater Greater Washington. \"In general, bike sharing increases retail prices in an already very competitive market,\" he explained, \"but there are also local factors that may limit some rental rates.\" Some of the most obvious local factors include whether or not bike sharing is already on the city's grid and/or whether or not it's located in a tourist destination.\n\nThe economic impact of bike sharing on prices varies depending on the type of bike sharing service operating in an area. The most common type of bike sharing on the East Coast, according to Schleicher, is the company Limebike. In cities outside of the East Coast, he said, there are two types of bike sharing – \"full service, like CitiBike, and semi-service, like Green-Bike or Spin\"\n\nBike share has proven to be an effective way to bring more people to downtown areas. \"Cities typically have a shortage of drivers, so a lot of the extra traffic that's created by bike sharing doesn't happen,\" deasy said. \"It also helps people who normally don't own cars get around.\"\n\nBike share also can add diversity to the urban landscape. The service allows users of different abilities to share the road and improve safety. Because of the mobility and ease of use that this service brings to individuals, bike share is often seen as a viable option for seniors, women, youth, individuals with disabilities and a wider array of riders from working poor to upper-income families than other forms of transportation.\n\n\"Many of the factors that drive the high cost of housing in urban areas – like housing prices and transportation costs, have nothing to do with transportation as such,\" said John Besser, President and CEO of Washington D.C.-based organization, Transportation For America. \"In addition to attracting more people to our communities, bike share makes our city more enjoyable and livable for everyone.\"\n\nAccording to the Center for Urban Transportation Research at Tufts University, in a paper released earlier this year, some of the studies that they did showed that in some cases, bike sharing had a significant economic impact on the urban areas it operates in.\n\nThe city of San Francisco is currently implementing the city's first permanent bike sharing program, which will run for ten years, until the end of 2018. According to city staff, the program has already seen increases in rental rates in recent months. A report by the city revealed that in 2015, the City of San Francisco saw a significant increase in bicycle rentals on City Center near the Embarcadero, and on the Marina and Marina Greenways and in the Mission District.\n\nThere, rents went from $15 an hour to $23 an hour in a 10 month period. The report also stated that the average rental rent grew by over 4.8 percent.",
      "If we do not stop the illegal war to oust Syria from power and impose an illegal and unconstitutional regime in its place, an evil regime with a history of genocide, mass murder and genocide is about to go the Assad way. What follows is the final chapter in a seven-part series on the history of the United States' role in promoting war to oust Gaddafi, and why the United States still needs to face up to the facts of history.\n\nThere is a very significant fact that we should stop and ponder: if it was not for the United States and NATO, Gaddafi's forces would have destroyed Benghazi, Libya in 2011.\n\nThe war of 2011 was the work of the United States and the United Kingdom and their NATO proxies in alliance with Israel. It was supported by the media, which ignored all the evidence that exposed how NATO was supporting the uprising in Libya's eastern oil-rich province of Sirte. The Western media reported that Colonel Gaddafi was about to attack the city of Benghazi – which is located in an easily accessible spot – and that only the \"revolutionary\" people in Libya's eastern oil provinces, the rebels, could stand in his way.\n\nBut when Gaddafi's forces attacked Benghazi on April 8, 2011, NATO intervened to prevent a Gaddafi-inspired massacre of the city's inhabitants. The Libyan dictator was soon captured by French Special Forces, and then taken into their custody in Paris. Once Gaddafi was captured, they then transferred him to a secret prison, which is now located inside Tripoli airport, where Gaddafi is still being held.\n\nWhen the NATO-backed uprising and Western-backed regime overthrow in Tripoli happened on December 16, 2011, the Libyan government, headed by Muammar al-Gaddafi, was replaced by a UN-supported interim government. At least at first – as the new government attempted to impose its will in the east of the country and deal with the Western forces supporting the rebellion – it appeared that there had been substantial progress to be made. The Libyan government managed to hold a new referendum on its independence, which went smoothly, and Gaddafi's forces were driven from Benghazi. However, these gains were soon squandered.\n\nThe UN-brokered transitional governing body was soon replaced by a new government of the same color as that of the rebels: it's not the government of the eastern oil provinces, but that of the Tripoli government led by Mohammed Magariaf, which has since then been working hand-in-glove with NATO. Libya, which had been the richest country in Africa before the NATO-backed revolt, is now now in a state of utter poverty and disorder, and it seems likely that the regime change that Western government is pushing for will not be successful. This situation has created a vacuum in the north of the country, between the Libyan cities of Tripoli and Benghazi and the city of Misratah, which has a significant number of armed militias. As a result, Libya has seen an outbreak of ethnic violence between the western-backed forces of the rebels and the ethnic Berbers of Benghazi. That is why Gaddafi's forces have attacked Benghazi in recent weeks.\n\nIn Libya, the government has the support of some major powers, such as Iran, Turkey, and Israel. But in order to bring this war to an end, it is necessary to understand and confront the truth: NATO and its proxies launched a war in order to remove Gaddafi from power, and not a single NATO-backed regime change has taken place since then.\n\nTo understand how all this fits in with the events of 9/11 – a war that started as a \"pivot to Asia,\" but has since had two of its most important targets removed from its map, and continues to be the most expensive war in US history – we should consider two facts about US policy since the attacks of September 11, 2001.\n\nIn 2001, the United States declared war on two countries – Afghanistan and Iraq – that immediately occupied the top and middle spots in American media consciousness when it came to issues like war, security, defense, and foreign policy. And this is what these two countries – Iraq and Afghanistan – will always be remembered for in the history of the American Empire. In both countries, Americans were mobilized into a state of absolute patriotic fervor and enthusiasm – at the expense of their own lives – to fight a war that was never to be won and that was being waged by the United States and its allies against enemies that they were never given any specific information about. But it was always American soldiers they were killing, and it was always \"them\" who were bad (even if they were foreigners), so of course this was justified. And of course – for reasons explained below – the United States and Israel continued to attack the Middle East even after both the 9/11 hijackers came home from America.\n\nIn contrast, it was the overthrow of the Gaddafi government in Libya in 2011 that was hailed in the Western media and by the Obama administration as the moment when the future of the Middle East had begun to change.",
      "T.J. Oshie, who was sent down to the American Hockey League on Tuesday, is close to signing a new contract, and is hopeful to play this year, reports Brian Hedger of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch.\n\n\nThe 22-year-old left wing has spent the past two seasons playing in the NHL with two different teams. The second time around he was a healthy scratch on several occasions, and was once referred to as a \"bad player\" by head coach Ken Hitchcock.\n\n\nBut in 2014-15, with his NHL career still very much on the line given the Stars' playoff chances, Oshie scored two goals in seven NHL games and showed huge improvement off the scoring side of his game. Oshie recorded seven goals in 39 AHL games while scoring 20 points and adding a team-high 16 fights.\n\n\nIt seems reasonable to conclude that Dallas would at least give him a chance to play this season, and give him some time to prove that his AHL stint was a failure by playing games for St. Louis at the end.\n\n\nOshie has been the second-leading scorer on the St. Louis AHL team, notching 34 goals and 54 assists in 120 games played.\n\n\nI believe the Stars have been patient with him and that a new contract will eventually be reached, and I can see that contract being for at least the remainder of this season, with a player option for 2016-17.",
      "The government should not only ensure that the next generation of scientists get to work in Scotland but also help them establish research centres in the East End.\n\nThis is because the capital will be the \"prime place for new international research\", said Dr Michael John McLean, an associate professor at Queen Margaret University.\n\nThe academic said the SNP government had provided no support for developing \"a new Edinburgh campus\" for scientists in particular – the subject of Dr McLean's submission to the Scottish Government-appointed expert panel.\n\nThe group, which is examining the future role of the university, has suggested the SNP's education minister Nicola Sturgeon consider providing \"continuity funding\" to allow Scottish and overseas universities to establish research centres in Edinburgh.\n\nIn a letter to Dr Sturgeon dated August 11, Dr McLean, who is also a former member of the Scottish Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (Scicri), suggested \"a new research centre in central Edinburgh would facilitate cooperation between academia and industry\".\n\nHe called on the university to consider establishing research centres in the East End, an idea which has gained increasing momentum in recent months following a plan championed by the former Tory chancellor George Osborne.\n\nProf David Mee, the former deputy vice-chancellor at Edinburgh University, who is on the scientific panel, said: \"The scientific reputation of Edinburgh is of real value and value to the whole of the UK and its influence on international science is significant. There are plenty of good centres elsewhere in the UK and other countries which can provide a similar quality of service, but I do feel Edinburgh is missing out.\"\n\nProf Mike Barton, president of the Royal Society, said: \"The capital city has an enormous reputation and we need to see a real commitment to developing more research in Edinburgh.\n\n\"It has a long tradition of producing some of the greatest scientists in the world and we must not rest on our laurels.\"\n\nProf Mee, who is president of the Royal Society's Scottish Council for Science, said the panel was particularly concerned about the quality of early research – known as early stage industry research and development – and its impact upon the future economic and social wellbeing of Scotland.\n\nThis was a key focus of the panel and the committee urged the SNP government \"immediately\" to fund a further £20 million in early stage industry research in Edinburgh.\n\nIn the submission, which is available in full below, Dr McLean said: \"The new university campus concept [should] not only be supported, but promoted to attract high calibre researchers to Edinburgh, particularly considering our existing excellence in this area.\"\n\nHe said Edinburgh had already established \"international collaborations\" with universities from around the globe, and that \"continuity funding\" would enable future scientists to establish research centres in central Edinburgh.\n\nHe said: \"This is for no academic purpose, but with the future potential of a burgeoning science and industrial presence for the capital, it is an idea that needs to be entertained.\n\n\"While we can't be sure at this early stage exactly what this would look like, we have a number of examples of institutions which have chosen Scotland as their international research base.\"\n\nDr McLean said while the university \"would benefit immensely\" from establishing a research centre in central Edinburgh, the government should make sure the centre was \"revenue generating\".\n\n\"The Edinburgh-based science centre should be revenue generating, rather than a commercial operation, and should be a model to be emulated in a number of cities,\" he said.\n\nDr David MacKay, SNP MP for Kirkcaldy and Cowdenbeath, which includes Edinburgh, added: \"Dr McLean's comments are right as he points out that scientists and companies could thrive in and around the centre.\n\n\"It has already been proposed that a new research centre be established at the University of Edinburgh to support early phase research into industrial applications from Scotland into the rest of the world, so Edinburgh could learn from Glasgow and other cities.\n\n\"This is exactly exactly what Dr McLean says the new university campus should be – a place where leading research can be nurtured, while enabling the next generation of academics to do their apprenticeship at the capital's best universities.\"\n\nMeanwhile, a campaign group said that the SNP's plans to slash science funding will only mean Scottish scientists' research is \"slashed even further\", pointing to a report on Scottish science priorities released by the Government today.\n\nThe report stated that the total UK science spend will have fallen by 14 per cent by 2022 – compared to 19 per cent for Scotland.\n\nThe report said that all areas of science are in danger of suffering – from the decline in spending on the Environment Agency to cuts to the new UK Centre for Economic Performance.\n\nBut it concluded that the overall picture for science in Scotland will not change because the Scottish Parliament is responsible for funding scientific spending and \"a good deal of this is already under control\".\n\nAn analysis published today by the Institute for",

      "Calls for a ban on high-end handguns made under licence could be a way to boost law enforcement funding\n\nAustralia is considering the introduction of a nationwide ban on high-powered weapons, under the pretext of increasing police powers against people carrying \"slab mags\" with a capacity exceeding seven rounds.\n\nIn a move that would cost hundreds of millions of dollars and be opposed by gun enthusiasts and gun rights groups, the country's gun lobby wants to ban high-capacity ammunition clips and the sale of \"any firearm that has in excess of seven rounds as the capacity\".\n\nCurrently there is no national prohibition on the sale of high-capacity ammunition magazines, but the law states that only people with a valid gun licence can possess such clips.\n\nThe new push for a ban on firearms with high-capacity ammunition clips under the pretext of crime prevention comes about a month after the government's national firearms law review came out with recommendations including a ban on high-capacity magazines and an expanded search and seizure powers for police.\n\nAustralia's national firearms coordinator, David Irvine, said that a ban on high-capacity ammunition was one of the suggestions on which the review would focus. He added: \"This is a weapon that is very popular with criminals and it is certainly something that we should look at.\n\n\"We need to work out how we balance out the public need to keep a firearm safe. As a government, we have the right to legislate.\"\n\nHowever, other gun rights groups have questioned why firearms should be banned.\n\nDavid Leyonhjelm, the Australian Conservatives' parliamentary leader and former federal minister for defence, raised the issue of the potential for guns being used against children, the elderly and the disabled during the parliament's inquiry into gun law reform in December 2011.\n\nHe told the Guardian at the time: \"I think the current national firearm licensing system is very successful. To have a national firearms agreement [in the US] that does not allow such clips, which are readily available on the black market, to be sold should be a policy objective of all politicians.\"\n\nThe government is expected to announce its response to the national firearms review by mid-April.",
      "The New York Jets may be the only team that has more questions than answers right now. Who would have thought that after seven weeks, the Jets would already have a backup quarterback under contract.\n\nOn top of that, the Jets are without their top two running backs. This is going to be a tough battle and is going to be extremely tough without Eric Decker being out for another month. However, it appears that the team already has one guy in mind to fill in that role for the time being.\n\nBills running back Karlos Williams is a free agent, and the teams are reportedly going to bring him in for a private visit. In other words, there is a deal in place to bring him in without having to pay a ton. However, according to ESPN.com's LeSean McCoy and others, it isn't a deal but rather a two-year deal worth $6 million.\n\nThis comes right in the middle of a stretch without DeVante Parker at wide receiver. The two first-round picks of the 2016 NFL Draft had been playing well together. However, since Parker went down, the duo has been on the bench all season. Hopefully, they can both make a huge jump for the season.\n\nUnfortunately, there could be another reason that the Jets are going forward with it. There has been a report from the Jets themselves that this is the plan and that he is coming in for a visit.\n\nIf this is the case, then he has a few things to do on this visit before he can join the team. The team is currently down two wide receivers. If Williams is on the team, it means they aren't going to keep their two first-round wideouts. That will make things tough for them to win.\n\nHowever, it is interesting that the Jets are going to keep two wide receivers from the team. They were hoping to retain Parker and Jeremy Kerley but both are being moved. It seems that if Williams were signing, they would make sure he was going to be on the team.\n\nThe Jets may need to make a decision soon as they have to figure out how to be competitive without their top two running backs.\n\nMain photo courtesy: NewYorkJets.com",

      "TEL AVIV – After the terror attacks in Paris that left 130 dead last Friday, Israel's Ambassador to Paris told his country on Wednesday that \"we are not in our century but in our time,\" in reference to the recent ISIS attacks on Beirut, Beirut and Paris. The ambassador, Ron Dermer, said this week that while it \"may seem a little harsh\" to Israel on the occasion of the 13th anniversary of the assassination of Rafiq Hariri, who was killed in March 2006 by a Hezbollah ambush in Beirut, the \"terrorist organizations have been getting closer in many fronts\" in the recent past.\n\nHezbollah, the Shiite terrorist group in Lebanon and a sworn enemy of Israel, has been active in some of the most sensitive areas of the conflict and has in fact been involved in some of the most violent battles between Israel and Hezbollah. But the assassination, a long-time goal of the Iranians, has only been partially accomplished. Since 2006, over 1,000 Lebanese have been killed, some 400 of the perpetrators have been killed in explosions in Beirut, while over 200 terrorists have been \"neutralized\" in the field, but Hezbollah has successfully escaped major harm.\n\nWhen asked for his comments about the latest events between Israel and Hezbollah, Dermer said, \"On the 12th anniversary of the assassination in Beirut, which is a reminder of how deeply and unrepentantly Israel holds Hezbollah responsible for an attack on its territory, I would like us to be more attentive to it and to use our influence on the international community to push for greater sanctions against Hezbollah.\"\n\nThe ambassador also mentioned that the \"extending of the sanctions has so far proved ineffective,\" as the organization appears to be \"doing better and better in its operations.\"\n\nIsraeli intelligence and the Israeli military have been particularly attentive to Hezbollah's presence in southern Syria, where the group's military chief, Hassan Sayyed, is stationed, in the Golan Heights, and in northern Israel. In the Israeli area of the Golan Heights, around Damascus, Hezbollah has constructed tunnels along both the demilitarized zone that separates the Israeli side from the ceasefire line, and the Israeli side that is under Syrian sovereignty. This network of tunnels serves as a conduit for weapons, money, weapons stores and communication between Hezbollah and the Syrian regime on one side as well as the terrorist organization and Hamas on the other.\n\nKeep updated: Sign up to our newsletter Email * Please enter a valid email address Sign up Please wait… Thank you for signing up.

Israel and all of our partners in the region understand with a certainty that Hezbollah is not a war of weapons alone. It is a war of will, determination and strength. And that means that even though it is using more sophisticated weapons and even more sophisticated weaponry, this will not be sufficient to deter Israel's strategic deterrence and our determination not to allow Hezbollah to expand its sphere of influence, its operations in the region, their regional reach and its terrorist activities inside the region.\"",
      "By Scott Maxwell\n\nCurtiss-Wright fighter jets landed on the runway at the Air Force Academy during a rare day flight on Thursday.\n\nThe jets from the 45th Fighter Wing landed at 10 a.m., according to Lt. Col. Jason Hanke, 41st Fighter Wing Operations Commander at the academy. Air Force Academy spokesperson Capt. Jonathan Davis declined to comment on the specific nature of the flight, citing security concerns. A flight of the Lockheed C-130J-30 Hercules aircraft arrived at the academy at 5:45 p.m. the day the planes were to depart for a training mission.\n\nThe academy's 45th Fighter Wing was one of 20 squadrons that saw action in Operation Inherent Resolve.\n\nThe flight, which occurred one day before the first anniversary of Islamic State-declared Raqqa Liberation Operation, also marked the opening of its new operations center, which Hanke described as the most sophisticated of its kind in the United States.\n\nWhile it was being constructed, the center was surrounded by a 10,000-foot fence that was not visible outside of the center's facility. Officials are trying to make the fence visible as a part of the center's security protocols, but they're still working on the technical logistics and cost of putting the system in place.\n\nThe 45th Fighter Wing's operations will shift into high gear in the first week of January. The 45th will replace the 1st Fighter Wing at the academy due to construction in the 1st Wing. The 1st Wing's operations are now split into two wings — a wing serving as the U.S. Airborne Reconnaissance Squadron, and another wing serving as a \"high-intensity, rapid-response squad\" from the 1st Fighter Wing.\n\n\"The first thing we are going to do is start to transition out of the 1st Wing into the 44th Fighter Wing. And then we'll be able to take a look and be able to say we're in full-time operations and do everything we need to do in order to prepare ourselves for the new situation that's starting to unfold,\" Hanke said. \"And then I don't want to be too hyperbolic. I will just say that the 44th will be a significantly larger operation.\"\n\nDefense Secretary Jim Mattis visited the 45th Fighter Wing in 2015 to preview its future operations. Earlier this week Mattis attended an inauguration-eve ceremony for the 45th Fighter Wing.\n\nThe Defense Department expects the 45th Fighter is the first and largest of four new squadrons currently envisioned in the new defense budget proposal released by Trump.\n\nThe proposal envisions the U.S. Air Force reducing the number of air wings to 18 from its current 19. The proposal, released in February, also calls for a $54 billion increase in military spending and increases for defense-related agencies. The Trump budget proposes to spend $6.5 billion on new KC-46 tankers and additional F-35 aircraft in the Air Force.\n\nThere were 15 U.S. airstrikes in Syria against the Islamic State last weekend, according to spokesman Major Ryan Brockman of the U.S. Air Force Joint Staff.\n\nThis article has been updated for errors and content.",

      "We're at the very beginning of the 2014-2015 Premier League season, and with that comes a flood of goals that most managers have yet to encounter in this era of the English top flight.\n\nThe stats are staggering. In the 13 games so far, we have recorded 20 goals by players who've earned double digits in points (or more).\n\nHere are the 20, chosen on the recommendation from the stats guru that is @BundesligaAnalytics.\n\nAnd for those who want to break the record or go past it, here are some historical performances of some of the best in the business.\n\n20. Sergio Aguero, Manchester City (2010-2014)\n\nThis season, Aguero became the second player in Premier League history (and first player to score 20+ goals in two consecutive seasons) to score 20+ goals in both the Premier and the Spanish La Liga.\n\n19. Wayne Rooney, Manchester United (2011-2014)\n\nRooney came close to doing this on a number of occasions.\n\n18. David Silva, Manchester City (2008-2014)\n\nSilva won the Premier League five times, the EPL Cup on three occasions (and the FA Cup on twice), and the UEFA Champions League. So, he's got experience of plenty!\n\n17. Edinson Cavani, Paris Saint-Germain (2013)\n\nCavani netted 25 goals in the 2013-2014 season, an incredible 33 goals in 35 consecutive league games.\n\n16. Juan Mata, Manchester United (2009-2014)\n\nMata finished the 2011-2012 season with a whopping 53 goals for the Red Devils. In 2012-2013, he added a double-deuce for an incredible 51 goals. In the 2012-2013 season alone, he scored 31 league goals!\n\n15. Nani, Manchester United (2011-2014)\n\nI like to say \"He was good this once\". Nani is another player who can really put the ball in the net at a high rate.\n\n14. Robin van Persie, Manchester United (2008-2013)\n\nIt would be an understatement to say that Robin van Persie has hit an elite level this season. He's scoring goals in big games, he's creating goals himself, and he's providing assists at every opportunity. We all know that Van Persie can still score plenty (he's scored at least 16 league goals in all 12 seasons he's played for United, but it's important to compare, especially when you can have him in the same team). He's also a phenomenal tackler, which is a vital component for any striker. If anyone can turn around Newcastle, I believe it will be van Persie. I like it when you find goals for no reason.\n\n13. Steven Gerrard, Liverpool (2009-2013)\n\nWe all know that Gerrard can be an elite level goal scorer. He scored more than 10 goals in more than 15 games all three seasons he's played for Liverpool, and in 2010-2011 he scored 19 goals in 26 matches.\n\n12. Yaya Toure, Manchester City (2007-2013)\n\nYaya Toure has made more assists in the Premier League than anyone who's scored more than 5 goals in the Premier League or Europa League, and he's done it two full seasons in a row. He's also more than scored in 15 of his last 16 matches for City.\n\n11. Fernando Torres, Chelsea (2008-2013)\n\nAfter winning the 2010 UEFA Champions League for Chelsea, Torres was sold to Liverpool where he helped them win the 2010-2011 FA Cup with a goal and 3 assists in a match that ended 2-1. He then scored 8 league goals that season, and he helped lead Liverpool back to the Champions League after one season in the Europa League, where they lost to Inter Milan in the Round of 16.\n\n10. Diego Costa, Chelsea (2013-2014)\n\nCosta had one of the best seasons of his career, scored 15 goals for Porto in all competitions that was more than Chelsea fans could have asked for, and is on track to score 27 goals this season alone. He's also the best all-around forward around at Stamford Bridge and even more so when you consider that many of his teams have also included Eden Hazard and Willian as part of their attacking lineup, and that he's been scoring in the second half of the season too.\n\nWhat do you think of our list? Do you consider it one of the best in history? Do you think Fernando Torres has been underachieving?

      "This is a list of things that I love about the San Francisco Giants (the \"Giants\") franchise.\n\n\"Let's all go throw it in together.\"\n\nI was a fan of the San Francisco Giants from the day they were founded in 1920 until the year that the team played their last game. I remember attending \"Happiest Day Ever in San Francisco\" in 1950. I was also born into this wonderful dynasty, in a little place called San Francisco.\n\nI also remember watching the Giants' first World Series game against the New York Yankees. I was only six years old. I was in the crowd, sitting on my parents' shoulders so that I could stay close to my Giants' team. The atmosphere in that ballpark was electric. Giants fans sang, danced, applauded. It was a beautiful moment in my lifelong Giants fandom.\n\nMy mother was a Giants season ticket holder, as far back as the 1964 New York pennant team. In fact, all of my childhood memories of the Giants are all of them attending Giants' games at home.\n\nThat first World Series is also one of the most difficult memories that I have. The Giants lost Game 1 to the Yankees. But we knew that it would be close, because it was a young team, without a lot of experience. It was the start of a long run that would see the Giants win three World Series, five pennants, and eight division titles.\n\nI was a Giants fan since 1980 when the \"Giants lost that one.\" I was a part of the crowd cheering them on when they lost Game 6 of the 1993 NLCS to the Mets. I watched Giants games in the 1990's in the stands while my younger brother and I attended all of their games at Candlestick Park.\n\nThis weekend I found out that the Giants won their last game. And I felt bad for the fans that had to leave. My mother drove home when we found out. This wasn't because of the loss – her favorite player was Buster Posey - but because the Giants had lost on the second to last pitch of the bottom of the 9th, and the Giants were going to the World Series. My mother didn't go to the game, but I did. I was devastated.\n\nAs a Giants fan, you have a very good chance of watching your team win the World Series, and your team make an incredible run. As a Giants fan, you're pretty much guaranteed to see your team win the World Series three, four, five, or six times in your life, based on the regular season record of any given team. You should probably plan on watching ten seasons by yourself.\n\nYou should celebrate when your team wins, and you should celebrate when you see your team win. There are a hundred different reasons why you should go to a game, to support the Giants. But I've found that I love the Giants so much that I'm happy regardless of what happens. That's how all Giants fans should feel.\n\nSome people like to get down to the nitty gritty of their team – their statistics, their roster, the different games, and so on. I don't get down to the nuts and bolts. At some point, you should just enjoy the night while the game is going on, and enjoy the crowd, and enjoy the victory.\n\nIn the beginning of every season, when I could still get tickets to most games, I used to listen to the radio broadcast of every Giants game I could get my hands on. At that point in my life, I had just graduated high school, entered the University of Michigan to become a physical therapist, and I had just started trying to make my way into that Giants organization at the minor league level.\n\nI could barely afford the tickets to the games, but I used to sit in the front rows with my dad. His seat was way far from the field, so I could see every pitch of every game. I used to listen to the broadcast, to hear the commentators talking about the games, and to hear the commentary team talking about how to prepare for these kinds of games. I remember hearing one of their announcers mention something about a player getting a hit with a pitch in the dirt, and the commentator making some type of joke about how good the hitter was. I remember feeling sick when I heard that, but the announcers kept going on about the hitters' strengths.\n\nWhen I was able to afford tickets to games, I would buy a new notebook to write down stats about all the Giants who were playing on the road that year. Some of the stats seemed so ridiculous that I never bothered to write things down in the same place I used to write things down in.\n\nDuring batting practice, in the early spring of 2012, I wrote down a list of every major and minor league baseball player who was hitting in that year's Giants ballpark that I could find. After I finished that list, I jotted down the numbers: Buster Posey",
      "It only takes a few seconds for people to get the wrong impression about the way in which the U.S. Food and Drug Administration works.\n\nAs a result, patients and patients' families are understandably frustrated when the FDA gets its work done right and the results are positive — and then gets the blame for doing something wrong. Even worse, patients and parents may be concerned that their doctor is going to take their complaints or questions about the treatment away from them — even when it's the right thing (such as the drug's safety and effectiveness) to do.\n\nIn fact, the FDA can be a powerful resource. It can use its authority to protect the public by blocking unapproved drug or device sales to prevent unnecessary harm to the American people — and it can use this authority with confidence.\n\nThat was certainly the reality in the recent case involving two drugs that treat HIV infection, both sold by the same company. These treatments, Zoladex (cobicistat) and AUCORO (sofosbuvir), both contain a protease inhibitor called cobicistat, which was first developed by Johnson & Johnson in the 1980s and is now marketed by Pfizer under the name Xtandi. There are two other newer, related protease inhibitors, lamivudine (zidovudine) and darunavir (trizivir), marketed by AbbVie.\n\nIn August 2012, Dr. Michael Ostroff of Massachusetts General Hospital's AIDS treatment group, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy Collaborative and the Partners in Health AIDS Research Organization and Harvard Medical School asked the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research to review these drugs as potentially having a role in treating HIV. The review, released in October 2013, concluded that cobicistat \"may improve clinical survival among patients with HIV-associated neuropathic pain associated with peripheral neuropathy.\" The review also concluded that cobicistat is useful for the treatment of HIV-associated neuropathic pain as a long-term adjunct to antiretroviral treatment. But the FDA's Center said that its review was limited by a lack of evidence about the drug and that there had never been any clinical studies demonstrating the effect of cobicistat on HIV-associated neuropathy in the human population.\n\nThese findings came as a surprise to Dr. Mark H. Davis, who heads the Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention at the CDC, and is the co-discoverer of HIV protease inhibitors in the late 1980s.\n\n\"We have a lot of data on how to use protease inhibitors,\" Dr. Davis said, \"but there is not a lot of data on the short and long-term prognosis for those on their [pilimumab] regimen, nor the effect on neuropathic pain.\"\n\nThat was why Dr. Ostroff approached Dr. Davis about taking on the review of these drugs. As the two men were talking, Dr. Ostroff asked Dr. Davis \"if I could get him a copy of the [federal review] document — since that's a lot of information — that was supposed to be in their possession.\"\n\nBut Dr. Davis said that he could not provide access until the FDA \"pulled everything down\" — which he had not until October 2013, four months after Dr. Ostroff contacted him.\n\nWhat Dr. Davis did provide was the CDC's version of the review, complete with the agency's letter to the FDA's Center on why they had made certain conclusions about the drugs' safety and efficacy. When the Centers received the document, \"they were quite upset,\" Dr. Ostroff said about the CDC. \"And we talked with some of [CDC's] other experts — who were just as baffled as you and I were at the time, and thought we had got it all wrong.\"\n\nThe FDA was equally frustrated with both the CDC and the CDC's counterparts at the CDC and at Emory University in Atlanta, where Dr. Davis was doing much of the work. Dr. H. Gilbert Welch MD, chairman of the CDC's Infectious Diseases section, told Science Insider that, at one point, he wanted to see what the CDC was hiding, but he was \"kept away from it.\"\n\nThe CDC review \"was probably a bad idea. It would be a good idea [to have a federal review],\" he said. \"It would allow all of us to examine and compare all the relevant data. We didn't get to see what they were hiding. But I can't imagine how we could have gotten it to them this late in the game and let all of this stuff happen.\"\n\nIndeed, the CDC's Office of AIDS Research (OAR) told the FDA they had \"lost\" their review file, because they \"would have had to re-examine the data … and obtain a grant to review the file.\"",
      "It's a great feeling getting a great movie like Inception out, and once it's released, it'll be fun to look through online comment sections to see what everyone is doing to the film when they're finished, and see what really inspired the fans' reactions.\n\nSo for that reason, and for the very limited amount of time I had to work on this post, I decided to write a little something about a very specific part of the movie, and how it was made! Before Inception, I went to college at NYU, and many famous professors there would always say that the real test for a film was how well it worked on the eyes or how well it worked on the ears or whatever, and I always thought that was pretty true. As far as I know, no film has ever had even a small part of it do well on the eyes, which is a shame, because so many films in the past have had them do really well, and not just because it worked on the ears.\n\nBut Inception was a movie that came out in summer 2009, and it had a really great opening weekend — it made over a billion dollars, broke several records, I think the cast all became super famous for life. So the big question was: was it going to work on the audiences, or was it just some kind of bad dream that was supposed to be really big?\n\nHere's the actual opening scene, where some guy named Cobb (the main character, John Reese, played by Leonardo DiCaprio) awakes in his apartment and thinks he's in the dreamworld of his new company.\n\nThe opening scene is about 10 minutes long, and the opening scene works perfectly on the senses by opening very naturally enough that it doesn't seem like a big change from the actual story. Plus, as a very well-made movie, the opening scene has a very distinct style, like a dream or something.\n\nWhen you look at the screenshot, that very particular thing — in the left-hand corner, the white building — looks like this:\n\nYou can see that most of the building is the actual building in the movie world, and what I think is in that building is a very tiny, tiny \"dome\" with lights on it, all the lights connected together on this little wire, or something. All the \"lights\" on it have a really simple white light, which is in the corner on the left-hand side, and is the white building, so when you're looking at the screen you don't feel the effect of light on light, like in a really big building or something.\n\nAnd the first scene of the movie is in the same location and looks very much like this:\n\nIn the first scene of the movie is also the first scene in the movie that does not include any kind of light source. I think that's an important part, because this is the first scene in the movie where you can see a \"white hole\" going through something, which happens a bunch throughout the movie, in different ways, not all of them intentional but many of them.\n\nBut the biggest effect of the opening scene, that really made people go \"Hey, that's a big effect, that opening scene is really subtle!\" is this line of dialogue:\n\n\"You see, everything in the dreamworld — even the lights, even the flooring in your bedroom — is created by the imagination. And that is where the real wealth is. This is how you earn it.\"\n\nThis line is so subtle and subtle and subtle that it's sort of like a trick. Because it works so well in the scene that it's in, it makes people go \"Wait a second, it's the same guy as in the previous scene, and that was a huge part of The Prestige, remember\"?\n\nAnd actually, I think you can go further.\n\nSo here's the shot I was talking about, this shot of John's bedroom, back in in the dreamworld when he is back in his bed. The shot is framed beautifully, so it's really nice.\n\nHere's the same shot, but now it's all dark because John in this shot is back in a dark room in this dark room, which we know was part of the very first scene of the movie:\n\nThere's no little \"dome\" on his bedroom floor, and the only thing around him is a big dark closet that has no lights in it.\n\nSo there's a subtle difference there, and again, with the first shot, I think it makes people go \"Wait a second, this is what was really going on in that scene?\"\n\nTo get to that shot in this article, you just have to look at the frame. So here's what it looks like when it's dark:\n\nAnd here's what it looks like when it's light:\n\nJust a really subtle difference, but it's there.\n\nThe",
      "The last of the year came and went without a new Moto X. And with an anticipated April 1 unveiling of the new Moto X+1, it seems unlikely we'll see another device in the form of the Moto X-like Moto X+2. So let's take an in-depth look at the Moto X+2, which is coming very soon.\n\n\nThe Moto X+2 is a phone with a few features missing entirely from the Moto X. For starters, it's built around a Qualcomm chipset with 2 gigabyte of RAM, instead of 5 gigabytes on the Moto X. It's also missing a removable battery, and instead uses an internal one that you can change. It also has a very slim bezel at just 6.2mm thick.\n\n\nThe Moto X+2 is also very thin, making it one of the thinnest phones on the market. And even though its body is not much larger, Motorola is touting it for its \"stunning display,\" with a 5.2-inch screen with a 3,500 x 2,500 resolution.\n\n\nIt's not clear if this \"stunning display\" means it looks better than some of the big TVs, or if it's just a marketing buzzword. In any case, I'd say it's pretty nice. The display is very bright, has only a very minimal bezel and is a bit larger than average — but that's not a bad thing! The display is bright enough for use in low light, and is sharp enough for watching HD videos.\n\n\nAnother big change from the Moto X is that the device is now water and dust resistant up to a depth of 1.5 meters for up to 30 minutes. The first generation Moto X used a standard IP68 certification. I have tested it for about 10 minutes and it seems to be good to go.\n\n\nThere's no mention of LTE on any of the renders I have seen, but I can definitely see that Motorola has decided to use a dual-antenna setup — likely the same as their Moto G4 — and it seems to show a clear distinction from the Galaxy S7 Plus and Note 7. The rear camera has optical image stabilization, which is good to see.\n\n\nThe first Moto X was very popular, but I honestly don't remember it getting as much hype and attention as the Moto X+1. It is certainly worthy of its own hype over the Moto X+1. It's a much faster and better performing phone, but the price difference is not nearly as big as the difference in size, especially if you buy the 16GB version of the phone. That should definitely make it a more worthy upgrade.\n\n\nThe Moto X+2 should be available April 1 in the US, or later in Europe like the Moto G4 Moto X (2nd gen) and Moto X Pure Edition. I'll definitely be reviewing the device soon, and you will too!",
      "The state attorney's office in Missouri wants to sue a local school district, saying it is responsible for the \"toxic environment\" that led to the suicide of an 11-year-old who killed herself after being bullied at school.\n\nKirkwood School District has reportedly refused to pay nearly $5 million in costs and penalties related to the suicide of Emily Doe, who allegedly died as a result of the school's mishandling of \"emotional distress.\" Her mother, however, has said she believes the suit is a way for district supervisors to deflect blame over her daughter's suicide.\n\nIt's likely to be a difficult case for the school district. Missouri law prevents schools from being held liable for \"any failure to prevent suicide.\" Missouri also protects individual school personnel from being sued, making the idea of a school district having to pay the victim's family thousands of dollars a day for the emotional distress caused by a student's suicide extremely difficult to swallow.\n\nThat's why the district likely will be seeking dismissal of the case, the Times-Journal reported.\n\nEmily Doe committed suicide May 21 last year after she was allegedly attacked after a fight at a party on the school track. Her family believes she was the target of sexual harassment from other students at school and on the football team.\n\n\"We're just so relieved that her death will not, unfortunately, be used to further an agenda designed more to harm than to help,\" said Emily Doe's mother, Tammie Mele, in a statement provided by attorney Brian Lopresti. \"She wanted to end her life but she wanted to end it at home, but she couldn't do that.\"\n\nThe lawsuit filed in Missouri argues that in 2011 school leaders and staff created a \"toxic environment\" based on \"unfounded\" allegations that Emily had been bullied by other students and by members of the school's football team.\n\n\"I'm a proud gun owner and very much value my right to bear arms,\" Emily Doe's grandfather said in a YouTube video posted by T.J. Kohn of The Daily Beast's Radley Balko. \"So when she was bullied by the football team she was scared for her life. For the first time in her life she felt she had no chance.\"\n\nKohn reported that the suit claims Emily \"was repeatedly called a liar and defamer by the bullies and the school system failed both her and the other boys at her school.\"\n\nThe district would likely argue that the district does not have a liability and that a high school student cannot sue the district over a suicide that occurred after the victim had graduated from high school, according to a Missouri Law Review article. But, Kohn notes, the law protects school officials and teachers from liability, \"even though their individual actions may have played a role in the victim's death.\"\n\nKohn notes that the student's alleged bullying only occurred during the weeks before the school tried to prevent her from quitting school after she was deemed to have \"made a negative school situation even worse.\"\n\nAn editorial published in The Missouri Daily noted this dilemma when it called the district's decision to file an appeal \"the most remarkable legal maneuver of the year.\"\n\n\"The district may be required to pay a victim in any lawsuit claiming negligence or violation of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act, but this is extremely difficult to do,\" the editorial declared. \"The school district will likely claim the suit was filed for punitive damages. But if it does, the victim may be able to get at least some portion of the award through their lawyers' fees.\"",
      "This week I received a wonderful surprise, an email asking me if I would review a new product called the Pinnacle P7200-AQ. This is probably the cheapest monitor I've ever reviewed; it starts at less than $400 shipped but has about a 1/3 discount for shipping and discounts on Amazon. In this review, I'll break it down the components one by one, and get an immediate feel for how much you'll get for your money.\n\nThe P7200-AQ is the most minimal (albeit most awesome) monitor you could purchase. In comparison to many of today's monitors with all sorts of features, it's simply amazing how little this one little unit does. For my review, I'll be using it alongside the P320QT I reviewed earlier this year and comparing their features against each other, and hopefully showing you which one you should opt for for your next set of upgrades.\n\nAs you'll soon see, the P7200-AQ has been a long time coming; this is the first LCD monitor from Sanyo, and it marks a major milestone in the development of the P series. Not only is the P7200-AQ a beautiful monitor, it is the most portable in my experiences. This is something that was lacking from last year's P320QT; the extra height and depth in height were more on the expensive side, and the depth of the P320QT is a little shallow for my tastes. That being said, the P320QT wasn't the cheapest monitor, and most folks would probably not find it as portable as the P7200-AQ is.\n\nNow that you're all caught up with the history, let's move on to the review itself.\n\nSpecifications:\n\nPanel: TN (in-cell)\n\nPanel technology: In-cell\n\nTechnology: 120Hz\n\nPanel type: 3.09-inch\n\nDisplay size: 21.5″ W × 13.2″ D (6.05 in.)\n\nField of view: 200° horizontal and 150° vertical\n\nRefresh Rate: 120Hz\n\nWeight: 2.6 lbs. without stand\n\nDimensions: 19.9\" × 10.5\" × 0.76-2.4″\n\nFeatures: LED backlight, tilt/pivot, and pivoting tilting mechanism\n\nPackage Contents:\n\nP7200-AQ 21.5″ TN Display (Full HD)\n\nOne DisplayPort cable\n\n1 HDMI cable\n\nOne DVI cable\n\nOne USB 2.0 cable\n\nCarrying case\n\nThe Good The smallest aspect ratio on the market today.\n\nBright colors.\n\nTilt/pivot mechanism. The Bad No headphone jack, no SD card reader, and no integrated speakers.\n\nNo OSD menu system.\n\nNo stand.\n\nNot a lot of ports\n\nThe monitor is tiny.\n\nThe P320QT was one of my favorite monitors of the past few years – a gorgeous IPS screen with a fast frame rates, easy to read colors, and great colors. The P7200-AQ, on the other hand, features a 1920×1200 resolution and a slightly larger 21.5″ screen size. That being said, it features the same type of technology as the QT series of monitors and offers the same type of connectivity options (such as VGA, HDMI, and DVI) as well.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\nThe build quality is excellent. The bezels are nicely small and thin.\n\nThe P7200-AQ is an IPS panel. While IPS panels are not as great for color accuracy as TN panels, I liked that it wasn't as bad as I thought it might be. I've been very pleased with IPS panels in general for the past several years.\n\nI also loved the tilt/pivot mechanism. No matter what angle you're sitting at, the monitor bends. This means you can adjust the viewing angles in multiple ways. If you don't like the tilted angle on the display, simply tilt it back to it's original sitting angle.\n\nAs good as the matte panel is, the glossy finish is actually a bit better at reflecting glare.\n\nThe brightness of my viewing window was surprisingly high.\n\nThe included stand is a nice touch for portability.\n\nThe included backlight is great. My monitor was brighter than it would have been if I had a separate backlight in the monitor. (Note: if you really want to use a backlight with your monitor, this may not be the best thing for you).\n\nThe audio output was very good. It's not quite as good as the speakers on the P320QT though, so if you like to use a headset with your monitor, the P320QT may be a better choice for you",
      "We've all seen the video. You see the big, scary, black guy wearing a red T-shirt standing menacingly outside a window of a gas station. The gas station's sign is out and you can make out the words \"Tire Service\" on it. You stare at the T-shirt, wondering what is going on and are about to write an angry comment of a few minutes' duration. But you're stopped in your tracks by the fact that your phone is ringing. The other guy's name is John, and he's on the other end of the phone. He's been there for a few minutes, he tells you. \"I am the guy who does all the tire repair for this place,\" he tells you. \"You can sit down over there and get some work done.\"\n\n\"Wait, how long have you been here?\" you ask.\n\n\"Since I came in from work,\" John replies. \"The truck in back, it can't get out yet, is still broken. I had to come inside and get my tire.\"\n\nYou're so excited that, for a moment, you think that John is a real person, not an imaginary character or a man made-up persona. After all, he was the only one of us who had arrived at the place earlier that day. (There's a real guy with the same name.) \"Do you know the name of the place, John?\"\n\n\"Oh, that's right. I'm here for a tire.\"\n\nYou're both puzzled at first. Then you get to talking, and soon you're laughing and joking, and laughing, and laughing. John asks you how old you are, if you are a \"professional\" or \"amateur.\" When you tell him you're 34, he asks what kind. You point out that it's a V8 and you have to do it with a special jack. John says the one he's had on hand is a V8-only. You make up your own story as to why you need the special jack. You tell him you did a long delivery to get to this place. You explain that, since you knew it would be a big job, you wanted to make sure you had the proper tools. He says he remembers you being a professional driver who did long drops on some big assignments in other cities. He smiles broadly and says that his father was a mechanic, and his grandfather worked on the docks for Shell Oil. You tell him you're here in Houston because you've got a car that'll come down to Florida and he tells you that most places don't get back up that quickly in weather like this. You are smiling and laughing and reminiscing about the good old days. You are talking about how much the city has changed, how the whole place was one big party when you were there back in the good old days. And you are enjoying it.\n\nOne, you have been here a few hours, and two...well, if things go well and your tires turn out okay, you should probably just get another car on the way back to Florida. Then again, you could just keep driving into Texas, and you could drive into Texas again until the job is done.\n\nAnd the most important thing, when you sit in silence with your friend at the drive-thru window one evening:\n\nYou have become a true Houstonian, and have no intention of leaving again.\n\n(Note: There's a lot of other things that you should know about Houston besides this one, but these two paragraphs explain a few of them.)\n\nIt's hard to believe, this place has changed so much since we first got here, and that I've never been down here on a normal day before. Back then, I'd never imagine I'd be moving back here anytime soon. But here I am, and I'm not going back anytime soon. You see...\n\nWhen I first went to school in Houston in 1992, we had a choice between Houston State and Rice. They were just two of the many public universities in Texas, and if you went to them, you knew that you could be rich and famous one day, or you could live a good and happy life forever, and neither of those was going to happen to you if you chose one of those two over Houston State. So we chose Houston State. That was a good choice, because that's what makes good choices.\n\nThen, you graduate from high school, you start taking classes, and they all seem so easy. They are easy in many ways, like the people who are your teachers, and in others, like your classes. After all, when you're a freshman, you don't want to work too hard to keep up with everyone else who's also an aspiring professional musician.\n\nBut after a couple years, things start feeling harder. Things start looking a lot more like what you were taught in high-school. You realize you're starting to feel the pressure",
      "Sleater-Kinney is back with two new albums: No Cities To Love and No Cities To Hide. We caught up with Janet Weiss to find out some juicy details about her new project:\n\nNo Cities To Love is \"a kind of a goodbye tour,\" Janet says. \"We weren't going to do that, but I think we both came to the conclusion over the last couple of years that we didn't want to do it the same way and continue to work so many long hours. It's been seven or eight years since we've spoken about it. It's sad. It's a lot of work, and we've really enjoyed it, but we feel like doing it another way is what's best for us and for our fans.\"\n\nWhile Weiss hasn't decided what she'd play on No Cities, she can tell us a bit about that tour – and tour partner, The Soft Moon.\n\n\"When we started touring a year ago, we were a little more wild,\" Janet says. \"If anything, we're still more wild, now that we've been kind of on a short tour.\"\n\nWhat's different this time around? \"We've been doing a lot more song writing so we can play a whole fucking show with a whole fucking band. We've been able to work out all our different musical interests together.\"\n\n\"In terms of how many songs we do, we're going much faster than before,\" she muses. \"Maybe we're more willing to do a certain amount of material than we used to be, which is a good thing.\"\n\nIncluding No Cities to Love on her upcoming tour, Weiss is aiming to hit every corner of North America in the fall. And she's got a few more surprises at her disposal.\n\n\"We also have a bunch of new songs that we haven't done before,\" she says. \"And we're going to play a bunch of new songs that we've been keeping under wraps for a long time. A lot of it is just coming together. We have a pretty big touring catalog and it's nice to have a variety of stuff that we're excited to play. There's lots of exciting things coming.\"",
      "The first full-length English translation of William Faulkner's seminal novel, The Sound and the Fury will be issued in February from Bloomsbury, with the novel based on Faulkner's 1926 manuscript.\n\nThe Sound and the Fury, which is not a straight adaptation but a re-interpretation of Faulkner's prose, has been published in 40 languages.\n\n\nThe first volume will be published in English by Bloomsbury.\n\n\nThe Sound and the Fury contains the novel's second third of a five-part sequence. On October 5, 1921, William Faulkner received the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction. He was 55 at the time, and it was the award's second since 1901.\n\nIn the sequence the protagonist, a rich and brilliant New England entrepreneur named J.P., finds himself drawn into the life of a small New England island town.\n\n\nDuring the first two thirds of the original work, J.P. visits the beach and pondered on his role in a \"world gone mad\" of violence, greed and corruption.\n\n\nHe then turns to his wife Lizzie and asks her to give him a reason why he remains in the \"flesh\" at the urging of his \"bloody-minded\" father, who has been sent back to Ireland to serve time for murder.\n\n\nThe last third features a brief scene in which the couple's teenage daughter, Emily, meets Lizzie for the first time and tells the girl she is going to meet Lizzie's godmother, the beautiful and enigmatic Emily Dickinson who disappeared off the face of the Earth a year earlier.\n\n\nFluency in both Gaelic and English, William Faulkner's Irish roots are evident in his story. Faulkner's paternal grandfather, George L.W. Faulkner was born on Dublin's Rathmines Street in 1887, and his grandfather James, who had left school at 17, settled in Ireland after making a fortune in Ireland's sugar plantations and was the first American to visit the country while a young man in 1925.\n\n\nBy 1929 Faulkner would be the first Pulitzer winner under the new American System.\n\n\nThe Sound and the Fury was published in October 1920, and has sold millions of copies. The novel won the National Book Award for Fiction in 1957.\n\n\nFaulkner's son David, a literary agent, has been involved in translation projects featuring many of his father's works. The younger Faulkner said his family's involvement with Bloomsbury had been \"an opportunity to bring these books to our own community\", adding: \"I am pleased in a small way to bring them to this publisher who can help readers in other parts of the world find the stories they find appealing and rewarding.\"",
      "(CNN) In a rare show of unity, a group of U.S. senators who met last week to discuss the Zika virus urged President Donald Trump to declare a public health emergency in the United States.\n\nSen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-North Carolina, Sen. Richard Burr, R-North Carolina, and Sen. David Perdue, R-Georgia, proposed an emergency declaration in a joint letter this week, The Hill reports\n\n\"An estimated 1 in 5 of our fellow Americans will get infected with the Zika virus as the mosquito-borne illness has now spread across several states in North America,\" the senators wrote. \"Public health authorities know of no other disease that has spread from one country to another with as much rapidity and potential impact.\"\n\nThe senators said a public health emergency would \"provide much-needed immediate funding to deal with Zika\" and could give other countries like Canada, the United Kingdom, South America and Central American nations greater access to U.S. aid, which is \"extremely limited\" due to a continuing federal government shutdown.\n\nThe Zika virus was first detected in Brazil in 1947 and is spread by the Aedes aegypti mosquito, which spreads dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever.\n\nThe latest reports from states where the virus has spread, with hundreds reported in the United States and Mexico, are alarming. It is not clear when the virus first appeared in the United States. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported 658 locally acquired cases of Zika virus in people or pets since January. Only one in four of the cases have been travelers to an area where Zika virus transmission is ongoing.\n\nThe senators wrote that the National Institutes of Health has funded 1,150 Zika vaccines, though it is not clear when, or if, any of them will be approved or if all will be ready for the vaccine to be tested in a human trials. That vaccine is expected to be ready by February 2016.\n\n\"We would like the president, as soon as possible, to declare that the Zika virus is a public health emergency so that Congress can approve funding to prepare for its spread and provide care for the millions of affected Americans,\" they wrote.\n\nWhile there have been no reports of microcephaly, a birth defect in babies with abnormally small heads, the senators say the threat is \"very real\" and says it remains to be seen that if the Zika virus is the cause. Experts are calling for more research before deciding what actions to take and if there was a vaccine.\n\n\"We must begin immediately to identify the mosquito species or animal models that may be most effective at treating this disease -- a vaccine or some other form of preventive treatment -- so that the United States may have the advantage over any other nation in the fight against Zika,\" said David Nachman, a professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. \"That means identifying an infectious virus, isolating it from a mosquito, and testing it for safety and efficacy in humans so that it's ready for tests and use now.\"\n\nJohnson, who has long advocated for increased research funding for Zika, is one of the four senators who has been pushing for an emergency declaration in the Senate. He said in a statement that his efforts to get this to the Senate floor would make the \"United States more prepared to fight the Zika virus.\"\n\n\"All of us are in this together and I know there seems to be a lack of urgency among the government as a result of the current funding situation,\" he said in a statement.\n\nOn Monday, Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida, a Democrat, introduced a bill that would create an additional $1.1 billion to help fight the Zika virus and other emerging infectious diseases across the United States.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1bDdM9E",
      "An American woman is suing a Russian businessman after he offered her $10m to stop her family moving back to the US because he felt \"they wouldn't have a future there\".\n\nKaren Ondreski claims she and her husband, Steven, and their four children, Joshua, 17; Anna, 16; Anna, 10; and Jacob, 8, had already planned to relocate to California after Steven retired. They were due to become permanent residents by the time they reached the age of 40.\n\nOndreski, 58, from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, said in her complaint filed on Monday in the Northern District of Florida that the Russian-born businessman and his company, E-Prime Investment, told her three months before their scheduled move that their marriage \"was about to end\".\n\nThey later decided against having a separate property deal and Ondreski decided to rent their home in Lakewood, Colorado, to pay rent, the complaint said. She declined a $1m offer on her life insurance.\n\n\"He is telling me that I cannot be proud of my kids. I'm just going to have to live a lie. I have been a faithful wife for years, I am making everything work and if something happens to my husband I'm OK. I'm just not proud of my kids. I can't protect them. I'm just going to raise them and raise them with someone else's name on them,\" she told the Guardian.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Karen Ondreski. Photograph: Courtesy of Karen Ondreski\n\nOndreski told Reuters that she and her husband were unaware of her husband's plan to move out. She said they have spoken with him once since the move plans were put on hold and that he denied any wrongdoing.\n\nThe case follows the high-profile trial in the spring of a family from Georgia who were deported in a joint US-Russian operation under a visa waiver for tourism. The Russian government said the family was planning to move to Russia to adopt Russian children. The parents had said they intended to come to the US where they had planned to establish a business, but the US State Department denied that they were planning to leave at any time.\n\nRussia has a history of deporting foreigners who take U.S. citizenship. Ondreski claims E-Prime was not a legitimate company and should not have been eligible for the visa waiver programme.\n\n\"E-Prime is clearly a criminal enterprise that engaged in criminal conduct. The allegations in this complaint are absolutely credible and well substantiated,\" said David Weinstein, the attorney representing Ondreski.\n\nA spokeswoman for E-Prime said in a statement: \"E-Prime Investment and its principals are fully cooperative with all the authorities investigating the events that unfolded and as part of that investigation we submitted a comprehensive set of information to the US government that showed that we were fully compliant. This case is a complex one and we expect to fully defend ourselves in the court proceedings.\"\n\nWhen the news of their deportation reached their neighbors in Lakewood, the Russians began to harass them using social media and by going to their doors and knocking and making threatening calls, she said.\n\nWhen their landlord received a \"very threatening\" letter and a voice message at his home, he took the matter into his own hands and sent a man to the Ondreski's home to find out what was going on, she said. The man told Ondreski he was going to stop the letter and her son Steven was going to be deported, she said. A few hours later, the agent came by, removed Steven Ondreski and Ondreski's two sons, and arrested both of them for violating the terms of their visas, she said. The agent told Ondreski and her husband that she would be going to jail for not returning home.\n\nKaren Ondreski at home in Lakewood, Colorado. Photograph: Courtesy of Karen Ondreski\n\nAfter Steven was released a few weeks later, Ondreski went to court for the boys and their passports. She claims a judge ruled in her favor, but Steven was able to appeal against that decision and get his passport back. He then went back to court.\n\n\"The US citizen is not only a US citizen who has lived in America for 17 years but is also a husband, father, grandfather and has a beautiful family. This is an outrageous act by a foreign entity that is in no way, shape or form being treated any differently than any other US citizen has to deal with. How can a foreign entity get what is seen as a major privilege and have the entire US government on their side? It's the epitome of injustice and it's unacceptable,\" said Weinstein.\n\n\"It's a violation of US law that any foreign government would ever get away with this and get the blessing and participation of our government to do anything.\"\n\nKaren Ondreski.",
      "Budget cuts to federal departments have forced The National Security Agency to shut down its bulk collection of communications with friends and loved ones outside the United States due to a lack of funding, the agency says.\n\nThe NSA says the move is a move to be more responsible and accountable to Congress, which is set to begin a debate June 13 on the future of the NSA's bulk collection program, which the agency has reportedly been using to analyze the communications of millions of Americans.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nThe Guardian first reported on Sunday that the NSA has started to wind down its domestic call data monitoring.\n\n\"Given the challenging operating environment the agency is facing because of the constrained funds, and to ensure full compliance with the law, NSA has decided to wind down data collection activities in this program,\" the NSA said in a statement. \"NSA leadership is currently reviewing alternatives, and will report back to the President on NSA's options.\"\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the NSA will continue to use the telephone metadata program for \"about 15 intelligence-gathering efforts each month,\" but won't use it for \"nearly all of the operations,\" according to the Journal's sources.\n\nThe bulk collection program, known as PRISM, began six months ago and has been controversial since Snowden began leaking a trove of classified spying documents to Greenwald in June, 2013.\n\nThe Associated Press reports:\n\nThe NSA had already collected the phone records of millions of American customers of Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile and other U.S. phone companies, and had a separate database of phone location records in several U.S. cities that went to a third-party service that was authorized by the FISC. The NSA said the new phone records program \"had been approved under an procedures manual previously issued.\"\n\nBut the bulk collection program has come under fire from lawmakers on both sides of the aisle and privacy advocates for allegedly sweeping up thousands of innocent people's personal communications in the process, but officials claim they only go after \"narrowly monitored\" phone numbers of suspects of links to terrorism, but not the content of phone calls.\n\nThe House Judiciary Subcommittee on Criminal and Civil Rights, also known as the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, convened a hearing Monday on how the NSA can protect Americans' privacy and \"hold terrorists accountable\" without violating Americans' free speech.",

      "The best of the best are here, and the first three in this round-up are the best of the best of the year (or perhaps ever). The first is no surprise - and it's also the oldest.\n\nTaco Bell's double-whammy of the year, one of the strangest, most bizarre, and inventive, takes all the things that Taco Bell does, does them better than anyone else, and then does them a little smarter and with a bit more imagination. And in the end, it still just sort of sucks.\n\nBut no one can do what Taco Bell did this year - that would be the company's announcement last Monday that it was buying out the other half of a Mexican fast food franchise called Zaxby's, in the heart of Mid-Town Los Angeles. With some $500 million for the Zaxby's franchise and $200 million in cash, that brings Taco Bell's acquisition costs from $500 million to $600 million, and it will give the company more than 500 outlets by 2018.\n\nNow, the idea of a Taco Bell with fewer than a thousand outlets is crazy. What Zaxby's did at its peak in 1997 was put about a quarter-billion dollars of venture capital into that one store in one year (and in the process created a phenomenon of course). But the Zaxby's chain has a lot of competitors, so it's more than probable that this one could fail completely. Taco Bell did well this year, though, with $3.8 billion in sales and $1.8 billion in profits - all while making less than what McDonald's made last year. They also took in about $5 billion in profit last year. For its part, Taco Bell's profits actually increased by nearly $3 billion, meaning that they increased their profits on the sale of food by a factor of five, from 2.7 percent of sales to nearly 9 percent.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd with all that increased profit, Taco Bell also raised prices for food and drinks, giving customers a price break on most things. One Taco Bell store is selling three meals a day for $1.25. The same item is selling for $2.50 at Zaxby's, and a two-in-one can get you 10 grams of protein for $2.95. And that price is on the high end of what Taco Bell is being expected to price it at. In fact, Taco Bell even took out a commercial trying to sell you on the value of a Zaxby's menu. While the company may not yet be known as the great price gouger, at least with Zaxby's their customers have some idea of what they'll be paying, and it's usually a whole lot less than the price of many things you buy.\n\nBut what is it about Mexican food and the idea of tacos that Taco Bell always seems to find a way to make so much more money with? And how is a $6 burrito that only gets you three calories really a lot? In case you don't believe me, we asked the man who created what might be called the great taco:\n\nWhat's the first thing you do when you start to make tacos?\n\nI always start by getting to know my suppliers, finding out exactly what they offer, and understanding their processes. I'll do this with other food enterprises too, for example with the ingredients I use in my tortillas, making sure I learn about everything from how the tortilla is made up to the packaging that goes along with the product.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAre you a chef? Do you cook yourself or do you get someone else to cook for you?\n\nI do both. I have my own restaurant up in Los Angeles, making food, which is basically one giant party.\n\nWhat is the typical recipe for a taco you find on the internet? Does it vary from taco bar to taco bar?\n\nTo be honest, my recipe is very loose. I like the ones that people leave for me in their comments on Taco Bell websites. The one posted by a taco blogger that I find to be the best is Taco Bell's 'The Taco Bell Original' recipe, while another taco blogger I like to follow is a friend of mine called 'Taco Dancer.' So, you can call it yours and mine.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDo you have a favorite recipe to share?\n\nIf all you want of a taco is just the shell and cheese, that's what's on the menu at Taco Bell... so I just love that! But, that particular recipe from Taco Bell is amazing. It has a good balance of both ingredients, and it's delicious.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd, how about the taco meats? Do they vary from the ones found at the taquerias?\n\nI'm a great believer in the idea of using local, sustainable ingredients, and what I mean by that is that I'm constantly thinking about what's available to",
      "In a new statement, the state-run Saudi Press Agency (SPA) has issued an apology for a report stating that the kingdom was the largest destination for female tourists.\n\nThe story, which is not widely published, claimed that the Arab world's most populous nation is awash with women traveling to Saudi Arabia in search of happiness.\n\nIn response to the story, Saudi Tourism and Culture Minister Mohammad al-Ahmed told the local TV station Al-Ekhbariyah that it is \"inaccurate and not an accurate representation of reality in Saudi.\"\n\nHe said it is \"an unfortunate error of judgement that is unacceptable, especially given the ongoing efforts to boost gender relations in our country,\" the SPA reported.\n\nThe incident was also reported by the Kuwaiti news site Saba, where a similar story on the SPA reported that \"Women spend a huge amount of money on luxury hotels in Saudi Arabia for that same purpose.\"\n\nThe newspaper reported that the Tourism Minister \"apologized and assured the public that the tourism website and the Saudi media have already been edited, with the story being deleted from all official channels.\"\n\nThe story, the report claimed, was based on comments from Kuwaiti TV presenter Tariq al-Azzawi -- a well-known critic of the Islamic conservative monarchy. The website reports that al-Azzawi's comments were picked up by another Kuwaiti TV station.\n\n\"Women in Arab countries spend money for many reasons and for what they consider to be happiness,\" the paper notes. \"And here we have an example of an error and misuse of the Arab people's hospitality.\"\n\nIn 2015, the Interior Ministry said that women make up 23 percent of total foreign tourists visiting the Holy Land, and about 1.3 million women visited Saudi Arabia in 2014.\n\nThe state-run Saudi Press Agency, a mouthpiece of the ruling Al Saud dynasty, regularly publishes positive stories for the country's rulers and its princes, such as a recent article which highlighted the accomplishments of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and said the future ruler could become \"King of Culture.\"\n\nAlso in 2015, the agency was widely criticized for publishing a report claiming that the Arab Gulf region would \"declare war\" against Qatar, as part of an effort to cut off the emirate's money sources, a move that was seen as an effort at isolating the Muslim nation. It was later retracted after public outcry.\n\nSaudi Arabia remains a very conservative Islamic monarchy, where women are not allowed to leave the house without a male guardian, and cannot drive.\n\nThe ban on women driving in Saudi Arabia has been criticized by international advocates for the country, but the Saudi authorities continue to reject suggestions that the ban should be lifted.\n\nIn 2013, Amnesty International International said that the kingdom was using the Islamic religion to repress women. This was after one of the kingdom's prominent female activists was sentenced to a two-year prison term for \"inciting public protests.\"",
      "The Obama administration is seeking to take on a key element of a landmark trade deal between the United States, South Korea, Japan and 10 other Pacific Rim nations, the Financial Times reported Saturday.\n\nThe United States has asked South Korea to allow the United States more access to the Korean market under the terms of the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The Obama administration is pushing to open up new markets in the region without opening them up to U.S. rivals.\n\nThe financial services industry represents the largest single segment of trade with South Korea and is one of the most important sources of new export markets for U.S. companies. South Korea is a critical component in creating a \"free trade\" zone in Asia, and U.S. companies rely on them for much of their production.\n\nSouth Korean companies have long relied on the U.S. market and its demand for their products, including services, on the terms of the North American Free Trade Agreement, but the two countries have been wary of increasing economic ties with the United States.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn increased trade element was a top priority for President Obama this year when it came to negotiating the Trans-Pacific deal, dubbed by supporters as \"the world's largest free trade agreement\" because it covers 40 percent of the world's economic output. But it would fall victim to a trade war between the United States and Mexico and could be a sticking point for negotiators.\n\nIn May 2012, Mexican President Felipe Calderón said that Mexico would be willing to accept bilateral trade agreements with North America and with Europe \"to get free trade.\"\n\n\"The United States is sending signals, trying to push Mexico to join a NAFTA or a proposed European zone,\" said Daniel Arshack, a South Korea economist at The Korea Research Institute.\n\nThe European Union is set to hold a \"summit\" meeting starting Wednesday in Brussels to negotiate a new European Union-U.S. trade deal, and President Obama plans to visit Mexico City in the spring to further emphasize his desire for a free trade area.\n\nIf a new trade agreement on U.S. terms is not reached, Obama is expected to argue to Congress in his State of the Union address on Feb. 12. He plans to say that new trade deals need to be crafted to strengthen protection for workers and protect the environment.\n\nThe State of the Union address was announced just as the TPP talks got under way at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Bali, Indonesia.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn December 2011, the Obama administration agreed to provide $1.2 million to help set up a South Korean nonprofit that specializes in the creation of financial services-style products by bringing together academics and businesspeople to develop new business models.\n\nIt is not known what new products will be added to the South Korean market under the TPP with the help of the South Korean government. According to the Financial Times, the United States has also been asking the South Korean government to offer financial services on a \"non-tariff basis\" instead of just for bilateral trade.\n\nThe financial services industry accounts for more than $3 trillion in annual global revenue, the third largest industry in the world after manufacturing and energy resources. The United States has about $300 billion worth of financial products and services trade with South Korea, according to the U.S. Trade Representative's office.\n\nThe financial services industry accounts for 2.8 percent of GDP in South Korea, and 4.9 percent of its manufacturing sector, according to the World Bank. That is a larger ratio than China and Japan, but lower than the United States and South Korea's trade.",
      "For the first time in a long time, a new record has been set for the price of an iPhone.\n\nBloomberg reports that over the week since its introduction, the price of an iPhone 6 has dropped to $199. That's down $100 from the opening week of availability, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis is the first time since the iPhone 4s launched that iPhones have been priced competitively with their Android counterparts. The last time that happened was late 2005, when Apple was charging $269 for the iPhone.\n\nThe price drop is a direct result of the iPhone 6 Plus' announcement, just as it was last year when it lowered the price of the iPhone 5 to $99. For years, Apple has offered different models for $199 and $299, and while the iPhone 6 is the most expensive iPhone the company has ever made, it's certainly not the most expensive smartphone. As The Verge noted, the Samsung Galaxy S6 edge+ will cost just $826 when it launches later this year.\n\nApple's new iPhones are expected to sell out before they ship, and a retail outlet has already been set up for customers who can't wait to get their hands on new devices.",

      "The first time you are faced with a question like the ones described in the introduction to this guide, you are probably going to ask yourself \"how on Earth should I solve that?\". Fortunately, in the grand scheme of things, the decision can be made by simply looking at what your options are and making the decision that makes you feel the most comfortable.\n\nHowever, we all know that sometimes situations can't be solved simply by looking at options, and if you don't have adequate skills or other options in your toolkit, there will be times when you will have to make a quick, tough call: either try something, but at the risk of hurting your chances of success and failing, or try not to waste resources, and not do it at all.\n\nIn some instances, the decision made will involve choosing between two actions that have different probabilities, different stakes, different consequences, and different opportunities. In those cases, I will talk about the decision you should make that maximizes your chances of success. I will also give you some examples by way of comparison.\n\nA Simple Case: the 'Possum Problem'\n\nThe problem involves two possible choices:\n\n1. Let the possum get away (let it starve)\n\nor\n\n2. Capture it (take it)\n\nThe decision you make here depends on a couple of properties:\n\n1.) How likely is it that the possum will eat the berries of the rose garden?\n\n2.) How likely is it that the possum will try to escape the garden and try to find food elsewhere?\n\nSo what should we make sure of, given these property probabilities:\n\n0.5 x 0.5 x 0.3 or 0.6 x 0.3 or 0.7 x 0.15, or 0.4 x 0.2 or 0.7 x 0.20, or 0.3 x 0.1 or 0.6 x 0.15, or 0.4 x 0.2 or 0.7 x 0.15…x 0.10…x 0.25, or 0.5 x 0.1\n\nIn the examples I have given, the number 0.25 represents the chances that you will miss the possum (this is the lower bound if you don't have a camera or camera traps; and you are at the very least allowed to shoot it once if you wish, and in the more common scenarios you may even be permitted to shoot it several times). If you shoot the possum in these scenarios, and it does survive you will recover a food item. However if you do decide to shoot the possum and it does not survive to be shot again, you will recover zero food, and any meat or other meat products it ate will have to be used as a source of food (and a risk), so the odds of getting your food back are really low.\n\nYou could think as a first approximation to your answer that if you don't want to risk capturing the possum, you should try to capture it at a low enough probability, that is at the point where the possum has lost all of its chance to escape. This will mean that the chances of it surviving being captured are high enough that you have a chance of getting your food back if you manage to shoot it (so you have to shoot it at a high enough probability), and the chances of your food items losing too much value (so the chances of getting your food back are lower, so the likelihood of getting your meat back is high). This approach works reasonably well, but you get the following trade off:\n\nOn the one hand, the above approach gets you a chance of getting your food back if you captured it. On the other hand, you must capture it in a case where you do not have a camera and/or traps nearby, if you intend to get your food back afterwards. At the same time, capturing the possum may lead you to miss your shots.\n\nThe above approach does work for some cases, but not for all, and in most cases even if you capture the possum, the best you can hope for is getting enough meat to make a meal for one person. This means you have to take the trade off a second time and make an assumption: if there are three possums, which ever one of them is more likely to eat the other two possums first, will get to eat the others first, since the chances are not equal between all three?\n\n2.) What is the best strategy that maximizes my probability that I can capture the possum and have the most meat available for eating?\n\nGiven any situation P or S, it does not matter what the actual choices are, only what the probability of the outcome is, what the expected value or expected value of my choices is.

Tim Murphy, R-Monclair, wants the U.S. Supreme Court to weigh in.\n\nThe idea is simple: If the court declines to take a case against a lower court's decision in a constitutional challenge to the refugee resettlement program, Murphy says, the U.S. would be able to admit fewer refugees in the face of a terrorist attack.\n\nHowever, his bill's sponsors say their proposal would address a legitimate concern.\n\n\"Our nation should never be a safe haven for terrorist activity, just as no country should be a safe haven for terrorists,\" says Murphy, the fourth-term Republican from Fairfield County. \"That's what I know about representing New Jersey.\"\n\nMurphy's bill would allow the administration to admit 110,000 refugees in fiscal year 2017. If the court were to overturn that rule, the administration would only be able to admit 110,000 refugees in the budget year beginning Oct. 1, instead of the previously announced 110,000.\n\nThe measure has been introduced in the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n\nA federal district judge in January ruled in the case of a Syrian family seeking resettlement in Newark that the resettlement program was unconstitutional, ruling that the federal government had violated the Constitution by bringing Muslim refugees to the U.S. while the government was refusing to allow Christian Syrians into the country.\n\nIn a 3-0 ruling, a three-judge panel of the 3rd Circuit U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision.\n\nThe case is expected to be argued before the Supreme Court in June as the court prepares to hear arguments from the Trump administration and religious opponents.\n\nFor the second time in a month, the administration is in court defending its refugee program. A federal judge last week issued a preliminary injunction blocking the resettlement of refugees.\n\nThe Justice Department is appealing the judge's ruling.\n\nOn the other hand, Murphy's bill would have the same effect as stopping future refugees from traveling to the United States as part of government-provided settlement assistance, if the courts were to strike down Trump's Refugee Executive Order.\n\n\"We have not said we will shut off this program. But we are saying we won't allow refugees in here permanently until they learn English — until they realize that they are not welcome. And that's unacceptable,\" Murphy says. \"It's also unacceptable if they are radicalized before they get here.\"\n\nBut the idea of limiting the number of refugees admitted to the U.S. has been around for years, according to Murphy.\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks and the ensuing wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it \"became clear that some countries in this world simply, in the interest of national safety, were not open to the many millions of people who have sought safety on the basis of their religious faith,\" Murphy says.\n\n\"So I have been very clear of my concern with refugee resettlement and the refugees who come to America,\" he says.\n\nIn his proposal, Murphy says he was inspired to propose a plan by conservative news talk show host Laura Ingraham, who has proposed similar legislation. Ingraham suggested a similar process in January.\n\nBut the measure would likely not be adopted by the Senate. If passed, a final vote is set for early December, and the president has said he will sign it.",

      "LAKEWOOD, Ohio - Four Lakewood police officers were placed on paid leave Thursday as an investigation was launched into a video showing them beating a man who has been charged with assaulting his girlfriend, Lakewood Police Chief Mark Beckner said.\n\nBeckner did not identify the man or his fiancée or reveal how many times the officer had punched the man before arresting him on an aggravated domestic violence charge in June. The officers have been placed on paid leave pending further investigation, Beckner said.\n\n\"At this stage, it looks like a very well-considered decision was made by the officer and that's probably what happened,\" Beckner said. \"When you have something like this that goes viral, it can cause damage. But then again, when it doesn't go viral, it can cause damage.\n\n\"That's why when this goes viral, you hear the criticism that the police department needs to do something about it, so people see that their actions are scrutinized. And then when we're able to be part of that and hold them accountable, there's a very positive benefit to that.\"\n\nThe video appears to show officers beating a man in Lakewood Township Municipal Court July 20 that resulted in several other police officers showing up at the courtroom. Lakewood police said an officer arrested someone at the court, but Beckner called the arrests \"routine.\"\n\nThe videos show several officers kicking a man in the face and repeatedly striking him with batons, according to court documents.\n\nPolice Chief Mark Beckner said police are looking at the video of police officers beating a man with batons in court. Lakewood Police\n\n\"It was an isolated incident,\" Beckner said. \"It was not part of some larger scheme.\"\n\nThe court documents state three officers arrived with their police cruiser at 11:38 a.m., ordered the man to the floor, kneed him in the face, kneed him and kicked him. They handcuffed him, placed him in the cruiser and placed him in the back of the cruiser again. They then took the man's ID and other items from his pockets, according to court documents.\n\n\"A video recording shows the video of the incident was not deleted prior to the officer's departure for work,\" according to court documents.\n\nAfter the officers left the courtroom at 2:50 p.m., one of the officers showed up again shortly before 7 p.m. on a warrant for another crime, \"with the intent to harm/kill, or to have caused the injury or death to,\" an arrest affidavit states.\n\nThe officers ordered the man down, handcuffed him and \"hit him in the middle of one shoulder on the left side, back, and upper right chest on the left side of his chest, as he was lying face down,\" the affidavit states. In the video, two officers appeared to put their foot on the man's neck, the affidavit states. Beckner said the man was later treated at the hospital for injuries to his neck and shoulder. During the arrest, his fiancée tried to step in but was blocked from doing so, the affidavit states.\n\nBeckner said the internal investigation will go deeper into the incident that left the man with what Beckner called \"severe injuries,\" including multiple fractured ribs. The officers were placed on paid leave pending the outcome of the officer investigation.",

      "D.C. Council member Jamie B. Raskin, a Democrat who is considering running for mayor of the District, has begun a push of his own to expand the tax base by taxing corporations more heavily, a move that is opposed by most Democratic politicians in the city.\n\n\nThe move, which is part of a campaign to raise the city's corporate tax rate from 8.75 percent to 11.49 percent, would be in contrast to the current policy of a business-friendly D.C. government. For instance, Mayor Vincent C. Gray recently ordered his administration to move the District's corporate tax from 8.75 percent to 10.25 percent, as a way to boost the city's economy.\n\nRaskin, however, said his plan should be considered alongside Mayor Muriel E. Bowser's call to raise the city's tax rate to 11.49 percent. Bowser wants to raise the rate to pay for a number of economic development and business initiatives throughout her two terms.\n\nBowser wants to raise the rate from 8.75 percent to 11.49 percent. In 2015, the city council voted against increasing that tax rate to 11.49 percent, but later in 2015 the council did vote to increase the corporate tax rate to 11.49 percent, despite calls from Raskin and other council members to not do so.\n\nBowser said at a press conference Friday after the vote that expanding the tax base would reduce the burden on businesses in the city, a sentiment Raskin said he agreed with.\n\nIt's also an attempt at a policy shift toward Raskin's campaign, which has focused on closing the city's huge budget deficit in favor of a citywide increase in taxes for corporations and high-income individuals.\n\nAlthough he's supported a proposal to raise the corporate tax rate to 10.25 percent, Raskin has said that he would also like to increase the corporate tax rate to 11.49 percent. He said in an interview the idea could be good for the economy because it would increase the number of workers in the city.\n\n\"If you had more people in the city, you generate more business, more tax revenue for the city and more business owners, and there's some multiplier effect in the economy,\" Raskin said.\n\nCouncil member Kenyan R. McDuffie, a Democrat opposed to raising the corporate tax rate above 10.25 percent, has said that Raskin's plan was not his to propose and criticized him for using an additional tax that has not been identified by city officials. McDuffie said the proposal would be the exact opposite of what Raskin promised him during a meeting in June. His office declined to discuss the proposal.\n\nMcDuffie is one of four council members backing a bill to eliminate the city's surcharge on certain businesses, the so-called payroll tax, that has existed since 1972. The surcharge is paid by firms earning over $50,000 a year and helps finance city budget issues.\n\nAnother of McDuffie's colleagues, D.C. Council Chair Phil Mendelson, said he was \"deeply concerned with the proposal\" because it could result in an increase in the city's corporate tax rate.\n\n\"I support the payroll tax increase and also support the corporate income tax increases, but I would like to see another source of revenue. This is going to be bad for the budget,\" Mendelson said in an interview.\n\nWhen asked about the mayor's new rate proposal, McDuffie suggested that Raskin's campaign proposal is more in line with his campaign proposals.\n\n\"It's more his campaign proposals,\" McDuffie said. \"He should be talking about what he supports, but his campaign is much more, if anything, progressive than mine.\"\n\nMcDuffie has also stated that he opposes the payroll tax increase.\n\nMcDuffie said that raising the city's corporate tax rate could actually be detrimental to businesses in D.C.\n\n\"The only way to do that is to use an incentive that is completely unrelated to economic development or to economic growth,\" he said. \"This is a very bad option that is totally contrary to what the government's policy should be.\"\n\nD.C. Council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D-At Large):\n\n\"I'm concerned that the mayor's plan doesn't address the real concerns of everyday D.C. businesses – including smaller companies – who pay the same rates on their gross income that large corporations do. The plan increases the rate for the city's lowest wage jobs – an untenable rate of increase for a District with growing and innovative companies. It also raises the rates for businesses in neighborhoods that have been hit hard by job losses and are home to many small businesses. \"My hope is this plan will also work to lower the city's business tax rate. A city business tax rate that's 11 1/2 times that charged in the nation",
      "(Adds details)\n\nMOSCOW, April 22 (Reuters) - The Kremlin is not concerned about a report of Ukrainian military involvement in Donbas conflict, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Monday, dismissing it as an attempt by the West to \"blackmail Russia\".\n\nWestern countries accuse Russia of sending support to pro-Russian rebels in eastern Ukraine and, as the annexation of Crimea from Ukraine is not recognised in Russia, they say it is providing them with arms and financial backing.\n\nRussia denies any such role. Last December, however, Moscow imposed economic sanctions on Kiev over the crisis.\n\nOn Monday, Kiev said that a unit of its army had crossed its border into rebel territory and destroyed an equipment convoy on Saturday. The head of Ukraine's national security council accused separatist leaders of being behind the move.\n\nPeskov said it appeared to be a local mistake, adding Moscow was not giving any reaction to the Ukrainian government conclusions.\n\n\"We are only talking about this issue in relation to a situation in the south-east of Ukraine where there is an aggressive, illegal armed group that was preparing to launch an armed conflict of a certain dimension,\" Peskov told a conference call with Russian journalists.\n\n\"This is all about Western attempts to blackmail Russia. This is not our policy and that's why there are no such claims about this issue at all.\" (Reporting by Alexander Winning, editing by Timothy Heritage)",
      "An international study examining a \"lost\" archaeological discovery in China has revealed the region's ancient inhabitants were not all farmers as previously thought – the earliest known population lived a nomadic lifestyle as hunter-gatherers.\n\nAccording to the findings, unearthed from an ancient walled city in Henan Province, China, the civilization developed about 5,000 years ago, in a period of major migrations. However, evidence from other ancient sites suggests the site was already abandoned at least 13,000 years ago.\n\nThe results are reported in the latest edition of Royal Society Open Science. Lead author from the Chinese Academy of Geological Sciences, Yang Ma, said: \"It had been widely assumed that China was the origin of the Han people, but this was only the oldest city we studied.\n\n\"This shows that the Han actually emerged in ancient China, as well as the emergence of several different ancient cultures, long before Han rulers came to power, around 1,000 years later.\" The study also showed that in Henan Province, there were at least five archaeological settlements dated to this time, all of which are associated with nomadic groups. These are found in the area around the village of Yaxia.\n\nThe cities are built around walled compounds built with giant stone slabs. At least five complexes are located around the capital Yaxia. In the northern area, near the city of Xixi, a walled compound was identified with more than 100 buildings. The site is surrounded by a large sandstone quarry, with numerous artifacts excavated from nearby sites.\n\nThe study concluded that the site had a population of more than 1,500 people living the nomadic lifestyle. Researchers said the evidence indicates the inhabitants occupied the area up to 7,900 years ago, during what was probably a violent migration. During the migration, over 10,000 people died but about 5,000 survived.\n\nHowever, the ancient people appeared to be more interested in commerce and trade than fighting. The nomadic population could have lived a hunter-gatherer lifestyle as they would have depended on domesticated animals, such as wild sheep, to sustain themselves. The discovery indicates that the original people of northern China were a mixture of groups, suggesting that more than one ancient culture could have existed in the region.\n\nProfessor Yang noted: \"We believe the people who lived in the Walled City lived in a semi-nomadic lifestyle, as this lifestyle was common at the end of the last Ice age. When humans reached the northern regions, they likely mixed their farming ancestry with nomadic and hunter-gatherer ancestry.\n\n\"Our findings show that the ancient people of northern China did not live on the plains of central Asia, as previously thought, it had a completely other origin that had nothing to do with farming. It is really exciting evidence, showing that the migration that pushed Central Asians into the area may have come from central Asia.\"",
      "The first of three talks at the 2016 Bitcoin & Blockchain conference in Milan, Italy, featured a conversation between the founders of the Bitcoin Foundation and Roger Ver. Ver, who has frequently made headlines by declaring that he intends to move away from the digital currency, made it clear that bitcoin is more than just a store of value, noting that the technology that underlies bitcoin is also a \"game changer.\"\n\n\"The most interesting way to describe bitcoin to me is that it is a world-changing technology,\" said Ver. \"It actually helps us overcome a problem that we all have, and that's the lack of trust in one other party's ability to protect your assets.\"\n\nSince bitcoin was created over a decade ago, Ver has made multiple comments, including in 2014, that he intends to shift his attention from mining bitcoin to other blockchain-based projects. However, Ver, who also serves as the CEO of CoinBase and a developer on the Bitcoin software client, appeared to walk back his promise to move away from the currency in the interview with CNBC.\n\n\"I don't see bitcoin dying today,\" he said. \"But I believe that bitcoin is more than just a currency. It's much better — there are more interesting uses. In the early years, it was just something that you stored money in and sent it from one place to another. I think that's a small slice of what bitcoin can do. But what I would not do is try to move away from bitcoin. People have been thinking that way for the past five or 10 years that bitcoin is doing what, in real life it's not doing, and that's being traded on stock markets and that sort of thing.\"\n\nVer's comments about how bitcoin can be used to achieve other goals than just money, and how digital currencies can be used as tools for the public good, are a positive sign for bitcoin. The more that the technology behind bitcoin is developed, the more that the blockchain can be leveraged to improve the technology behind bitcoin and the ecosystem that has grown up around it.\n\n\"There is nothing like bitcoin today except for what the blockchain is. Without it, no one has any idea if a transaction or something else was recorded correctly.\" –Roger Ver — Bloomberg (@business) April 19, 2016\n\nOther blockchain-based projects such as IOTA, a currency based on the distributed, encrypted ledger technology that underpins much of bitcoin's network, are also demonstrating what it might someday be possible to build a digital platform that improves on the basic features of bitcoin.\n\n\"I don't have confidence in the other tokens, because I believe it is so difficult — I think no one will find a viable and easy way to achieve what the blockchain can, in the traditional sense.\" –Roger Ver pic.twitter.com/3zwW5j3QyT — CNBC (@CNBC) April 19, 2016\n\nSome bitcoin investors have also expressed concern about the prospect of digital currencies gaining broader acceptance and adoption, particularly when it comes to government regulation.\n\nVer's statements align closely with those of one Bitcoin Foundation member, Charles Hayter, who recently claimed that the foundation should \"just go away.\"\n\nFor more details on the talk participants at the panel at the conference, read Mike Caldwell's report.",
      "RICHMOND, VA – The Richmond Kickers hosted the New York Red Bulls II on Wednesday night at City Stadium, and the fans came out on fire for a late win that kept them in the AFC North conversation, while Red Bulls II dropped their second game in a row. The result leaves Richmond in sole possession of third place in the USL Eastern Conference, with five matches remaining in the regular season.\n\nRangers got on the board quickly, and doubled their lead eight minutes after entering the match. Ryan Christopher got his foot to David Estrada's corner, and was able to control the ball and put a low shot past the outstretched arms of goalkeeper Jon Busch and into the back of the net.\n\nThe two teams continued to battle for a lot of the second half, but the Red Bulls continued to find opportunities to find the back of the net.\n\nRed Bulls II continued to keep the ball well, but the Kickers continued to apply pressure, and had another late chance to level the game shortly before the hour mark. Chris Nanco played a long ball to an unmarked Harrison Delbridge, and the winger was one-on-one with Busch, who got his legs into the back of the striker and was able to get the ball to Delbridge and draw him in. Delbridge was able to get a shot off, but was denied by a stunning Save of the Week-winner from Richmond's Jeff Parke.\n\nRangers came out of the half on a four-game losing streak, and in the 78th minute, they finally got a game-winner. Chris Nanco got the ball on the left wing, and crossed to the far post where Charlie Adams was able to put a finish past the diving Busch. The home side held onto the lead thanks primarily to that goal, but Red Bulls II found themselves down two men in the final moments and were unable to convert.\n\nThe game winner and another goal a minute later from Chris Goslin gave Richmond a 4-3 win.",
      "As an experienced user of the original iPhone, Apple's Touch ID fingerprint scanner is incredibly cool. On paper, it provides the strongest security in mobile payments, and it's certainly the key to getting consumers to embrace it.\n\nWhen all devices have fingerprint sensors, though, the benefits of fingerprint scanning will no longer be limited to mobile payments. The technology itself will be able to be used in other applications, such as biometric identification for things like voting, as well as as keys and access control locks. Finger print scanners could also give us back physical keys, as it wouldn't require physically pressing a button for the unlock.\n\nOne potential use for biometric security in the home is for securing electronic devices such as smart thermostats. Finger fingerprint IDs from an iOS device could easily be used for security, such as preventing unauthorized access of the home or preventing a thief from accessing the Internet or other connected devices from inside the home.\n\nThe technology was originally designed for use by banks to prevent hackers from gaining access to online accounts, but the security has been greatly improved by Apple in the iPhone 5s.\n\nTouch ID, however, isn't the only fingerprint scanning technology. Google's recently released (early 2012) Android phone, the Nexus 5, also has a fingerprint scanner. As of November 4, Android phone can be fingerprint scanning using a mobile application app (available free on the Google Play Store). Finger scanning allows users to identify themselves without a physical screen on their device (an alternative to using a PIN code or pattern for biometric identification in a home) and is more convenient than using a physical card for security.\n\nFingerprint scanners are now being used in hospitals to verify patients' identities when they are examined.\n\nWhen we use fingerprint scanners, we assume that we can never be denied service because we were issued a fingerprint for any purpose: if the scanner detects that our finger was previously touched to a scanner before (as well as fingerprint scanning is not used to prove identity in the digital environment or for any other purpose other than to prevent access), we aren't let into the system. Fingerprint scanners were designed for use in a physical location, such as on a bank card, but they could easily be adapted for use inside a mobile device.\n\nThe use of mobile cameras to scan people's finger prints is already happening; Apple already uses its own Touch ID fingerprint scanner with the iPhone 5s for iMessage.\n\nThe potential applications for biometric security in mobile devices are only limited by the imagination and imagination of developers and manufacturers. As a result, fingerprint scanners could become the core technology behind new security systems for mobile devices in the future. For now, however, the best solution will be to simply use a physical password.",
      "A \"toxic\" mix of water, plastic and plastic-based products are leading to a growing number of marine wildlife deaths and illnesses.\n\nFor instance, a baby dolphin dies every eight minutes in the waters around the Florida Keys, with up to a quarter of the deaths attributed to toxins from plastic waste, according to a study by the University of Miami.\n\nA report released in June found that roughly two-thirds of all dolphins in the wild are poisoned by plastic, along with one-third of all blue and gray whales and one-half of all North Atlantic right whales. And since 2013, researchers have documented thousands of deaths of sea lions in Hawaii as a result of ingesting the large quantities of plastic that washed up on the island.\n\nIn the wake of such pollution and related illnesses, U.S. marine scientists have begun looking abroad for a solution.\n\nEarlier this year on a trip to the northern Caribbean, American and European scientists found a \"sea turtle soup\" — contaminated with plastic and other pollutants — in waters they sampled in the United States, according to a recent report in the Journal of Clinical Oceanography. \"All species were dying,\" said University of Miami environmental scientist Robert Zalucki, who took part in a dive on July 30 as part of OceanSight expedition's \"Coral Reef Health\" and Plastic Pollution projects.\n\nThe report follows similar findings by the Institute of Marine Sciences in Hong Kong in 2011 and a report by the University of British Columbia this year that found \"plastic pollution\" in waters off the coast of California, as well as another finding that found a plastic-contaminated lake in Panama.\n\n\"At high concentrations in the marine environment, and especially in large concentrations, plastic can be a very damaging toxicant\" and an \"endocrine disruptor,\" said study co-author Eric Lambin, a biologist with the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.\n\nThe problem of aquatic pollution, especially in U.S. waters, is \"absolutely a crisis,\" said Lambin, who is also a senior scientist and deputy director of the Laboratory for Marine Bioscience at NC State. \"It's going on now, it has been going on for decades and we're still not doing very much about it.\"\n\nThe researchers said the current level of underwater plastic in the Atlantic Ocean makes the world's seas look more and more like the Great Pacific Garbage Patch, an estimated 400,000-square-mile patch of trash that's been swirling around the ocean bottom for decades, thanks to human overfishing and dumping. That's a problem not only for the marine environment, but also people, as the patch has attracted various invasive species, including jellyfish and starfish, the researchers said in their report.\n\nScientists have previously found plastic-laden sediment — known as bio-composition — in deep seawater where currents bring plastics from their point of production into the ocean, the report said. But only about 5% to 10% of plastic waste gets dumped into the ocean. \"The vast majority of plastic waste is ingested by marine organisms, with the potential to enter the food web and cause harm to ocean life,\" the study said.\n\nThe ocean's health suffers when too much of this plastic floats as sediment, creating a sort of soup for organisms of all kinds, including birds and other marine mammals, scientists said. There's evidence that plastic debris is also ingested by humans and animals that eat fish.\n\nThe study, which analyzed data gathered this year on 3,000 types of creatures from 14 of the 26,000 species of sea stars and pelagic animals in the eastern Atlantic Ocean off the U.S. East Coast, also said that sea turtles also suffer from plastic contamination. \"The animals are ingesting plastic, and it is being ingested by turtles,\" Lambin said. \"What does that add up to?\"\n\nThe researchers found that the worst plastic pollution occurred in the ocean near the coast, where plastics tend to end up during shipping or at seaports. At the same time, some of the worst areas for wildlife suffering from plastic pollution are also the most crowded.\n\n\"You have plastic litter in the more remote areas, where people aren't going out to fish,\" said John Gartner, a professor of psychology who co-authored the study. He and other researchers said they hope to create computer models to try to determine where and when plastic pollution occurs, and then try to prevent it.\n\nThere are relatively simple ways to minimize the amount of pollution in aquatic areas that will also reduce a variety of health problems, researchers said.

      "Randy\n\nThe most interesting thing about this whole thing is that Randy went from being a \"good kid\" to being a serial killer. He had his own cell, a library to his back, and someone constantly coming to visit him (his daughter?) so at some point, after a few years of being in prison, he decided that he didn't want to spend eternity in prison either.\n\nI remember when I first met Randy at our church youth group as a 12 year old he didn't quite seem like the same person I knew in the morning. He was still the guy who would drop by just for a chat but a few years after I had heard him for the first time he had gotten his first wife and become a serial killer. When I first met Randy back in the 90's it was clear to me that he is a great person. He seemed to be a good Christian just like me and his story of being a \"good kid\" and then committing crimes was very similar to mine: He was always a little overweight and didn't do it to get a girlfriend so why would anyone think that he would have a \"lust for blood\" (as he puts it)?\n\nHere is a picture of a \"good kid\" in high school with his first girlfriend and her brothers (no, not the same person)\n\nRandy was a good, decent man who loved his family and was a lot smarter than the average 13 year old. Why would someone do things, as they later admitted to me, that were so self deprecating? When I first met Randy and got to know him he told me that he had a habit of coming to visit prisoners in jail. Why was he there? His reasoning was simple: He was there to talk to prisoners about their lives who had been through a lot and ask them how they did it. When I looked into it as though I was a child again, I was completely stunned at the thought that people went from being a nice person to being a rapist and murderer in what seem to be 4 or 5 years. Randy had no reason to kill because he had his own bed to sleep in and had no one to be afraid of.\n\nIn 1995 Randy tried to commit suicide by drinking a fatal overdose of sleeping pills. He was rushed to the hospital that evening, and although he had no major bleeding or life threatening injuries was diagnosed with a rare form of leukemia. He received chemo and a bone marrow transplant, and is now in remission for leukemia.\n\nI think Randy's family and friends could have gotten a better handle on his situation by contacting a professional, but it is hard to know with people. Here is the story I know.\n\nMy mom was in the hospital the morning after Randy came to visit and I was terrified because he was a good person with a family that trusted him and thought he would be a good mentor for our kids when they got older. The following morning I found myself trying to stay out of sight in my room, wondering if Randy was going to show up that night or if he would even know who I was. The next time I checked on him he wasn't there and so I called our pastor, we tried to find out where Randy was and when we called to his house that was all we heard for months because Randy had been incarcerated for a year. On day 2 of being incarcerated Randy showed up, I was very disappointed and scared for our children. Randy explained that there was a girl, a young woman in his cell whom he wanted to be his girlfriend. At some point in the next month, after he'd been allowed back onto our yard, he broke up with the beautiful girl. Her name was Lori and she lived across the street. While this all happened I was in a drug treatment program and she still managed to get her job and moved in with me. I was shocked and terrified at this time. I did not know if he would kill me, if I could live any longer, or if either of us would ever be free from this hell, but I will never forget how Randy got to where he was at that moment in time. He was not the kind of man to show anything, to beg for help, to beg for a break from his situation. I think that after all he had been through he was a bit of a \"dumbass\" and had given up. I was shocked at my own stupidity as I had given the devil the best opportunity he could ever have to manipulate me and I really believed that he could do it. As I sit here I must ask myself what I did (what I should have) to avoid what happened to me. I must also remember that I was not physically strong that day and could not do anything to protect myself. I had two little girls that were with me and I had no one else to protect them from Randy's cruelty.\n\nIn the days and weeks after that incident, my father and pastor came to visit me in my room and he did nothing to dissuade Randy from",
      "In a move that could bring the UK up with the rest of the developed world, the number of people in poverty across England is set to fall to 1 million this year, compared with 2.2 million in 2011, a report from the think tank, Joseph Rowntree Foundation, published today states.\n\nRent increases have \"left families struggling to earn enough to live on – and many end up on the breadline altogether,\" the report says.\n\nThe report predicts that the number of children living in poverty in England will reach its lowest level since the survey began in 1983, with 4.3 million children living below the poverty line.\n\nThe number of people on low incomes who struggle to afford basic necessities like groceries, heating and other essential goods has almost doubled between 1985 and 2012 – rising from 2.6 million to 5.3 million.\n\nThe UK is the second richest economy in the G7 group of the world's leading economic powers, which will have the UK in joint 17th position ahead of the Euro 2016 football finals in France.\n\nBut despite the financial and political boom in the UK, the report stresses the country still faces substantial challenges.\n\n\"As the economy improves, this situation will only be worsened,\" it says. \"Even modest levels of economic growth – like those since the 1970s – will continue to leave most workers at risk of falling behind.\"\n\nThe economic recovery saw a reduction in poverty rates among the older generation. The number of people living in poverty for people over the age of 59 fell by 9% between 2011 and 2012, compared with a 9.2% drop in 2011 among younger people.\n\nFor those between the ages of 15 and 59, the rate of poverty fell from 18% to 14%; and for under-15s, the rate dropped from 18% to 8.6%.\n\nThe fall in under-15s' poverty levels in 2012 was partly due to government initiatives to increase the number of free childminders – who look after children up to the age of three – and support for nurseries.\n\nThe figures also show that there was a fall of almost 8% in children in working poverty from 7.9 million before tax credits were cut to 6.3m in 2012.\n\nThe report says the number of people living in poverty due to housing costs continues to rise in the UK. More than two million families are struggling to pay basic bills in 2013 compared with 6.1 million during the preceding year, the report found.",

      "Chenoa, N.Y. - New York State Police have identified the two suspects in what was described as a \"terroristic threat\" at a high school in Chenoa.\n\nState police and Chenoa school officials have been searching Monday for the two suspects, who apparently used social media to try to lure students and teachers to the school with a fictitious threat about a shooting at the school.\n\nAccording to state police, at approximately 10:18 a.m. on Monday, school officials were alerted to the post. In the post, one of the suspects posted that they were \"trying to get a gun in\" the school. That post was removed by the suspect's friends but was shared extensively.\n\nA state police alert was sent to schools in the area.\n\nAt approximately 10:30 a.m. State Police received information that a third \"suspect is located in an East Meadow apartment parking lot\" in relation to the online posting.\n\nInvestigators later located those three suspects, a 17-year-old and a 15-year-old, at an apartment at 1155 E. Main St, East Meadow, a town of about 5,000 residents south of Rochester, N.Y.\n\nBoth suspects are in the youth detention and were held for a period of 48 hours.\n\nA school spokesman told 11Alive that the student told police they were trying to scare their classmates by posing as a possible shooter.\n\nAuthorities also searched the town.\n\n\"It was a false alarm. The town has been searched and there are no weapons at the school and we are confident that we have done everything to ensure the safety of our students and our community,\" school officials said.\n\nThe student told authorities that two of their friends had been trying to recruit them to act \"like real shooters\" at the high school.\n\n\"I just want all my friends to be careful. We are in a dangerous world and we need to be careful of what it says on social media and what we read in books,\" one of the teens told investigators after a school police officer showed up at their home, according to a criminal complaint by state police.\n\nAccording to state police, the students were told that the suspect who posed as a real shooter, was looking to bring a gun into the school and that they were being \"set up,\" state police said in a news release.\n\nAccording to Chenoa School Superintendent John Miller this is the first time a school has received a threat like this this close to opening day. He said students and staff are \"shaken up\" by the situation, but they are safe now. He said school officials will have a better idea of what to do in the coming days.\n\n\"We have had two kids arrested in the past month because they were concerned about their safety,\" Miller said. \"But this is something completely different.\"\n\nThe Chenoa school board has offered grief counseling to students today in the event they need it.\n\nIn February, a high school student in Pennsylvania posted a picture on Facebook allegedly showing her classmates holding guns to their own heads, and threatening to shoot up her school.\n\nIn May, a 14-year-old in Colorado was arrested after he asked another student to get him a gun so he could shoot his friends.\n\nPolice said the 14-year-old was angry about what happened to him in high school earlier this year. He had been arrested and suspended for two weeks earlier that school year. He said he intended to go to a school in Nebraska where he didn't attend class but police were still able to confiscate the gun he had with him.",

      "Trevor Noah's The Daily Show has a major new hire: David Simon, a man who helped bring America's war on drugs to a devastating end with The Corner.\n\nNoah is the latest in a long line of journalists to bring Simon's writing to his own talk show on the Comedy Central outlet.\n\nThere's a good chance the two will team up for the upcoming season of The Daily Show, which is currently filming its third season out in the American South. \"What I'm doing out there is taking something that I'm incredibly smart at and making it a lot more accessible for people,\" Simon told THR of his new gig.\n\nNoah said he was drawn to Simon's writing for two reasons. \"One, he's very political — a Democrat who's not afraid to call everybody out,\" Noah said before describing the other reason that he's excited to hear from his former showrunner: \"I'm excited because David is a man who's a thinker and is very smart ... I'm looking forward to having him come on the show and start talking about things like race relations, and gender equality, and drug legalization.\"\n\nSimon isn't just going to be on TV, though. The comedian already had plans to work on Simon and Michael Koman's new Fox pilot Life Sentence. \"There's a role in that pilot that he's writing that, if we have a show, we'll use,\" Noah revealed. \"We are just about to start writing. He's an incredibly gifted writer and he's also an incredibly talented comic. He'll be able to break new ground. And I'm excited that we're giving him a chance.\"\n\nThe Life Sentence executive producer, Michael Price, added that they're already \"talking some stuff at the moment.\"\n\nWhen asked which TV projects he's currently working on, Simon mentioned Netflix's Black Mirror. \"It's a good show with a lot of great guests and I love that show,\" he said. \"It takes the idea of technology and media as a whole and has a way of looking at things that doesn't necessarily make us happy — a lot of people — but the fact that it does makes me a little excited because it is kind of a future in itself.\"\n\nThe Daily Show continues to add talent, including Zach Galifianakis, Sarah Silverman and Larry Wilmore. Last night they brought on Louis C.K. on the show's fourth-annual Roast of Rob Ford, a roast that was not hosted by Noah, instead taking place at the Ed Sullivan Theater.",
      "You could be forgiven for thinking that the latest leak of NSA documents is the latest revelation of an ongoing secret surveillance program by the agency. But as it turns out, the documents actually give us no information about the NSA's surveillance powers -- at least on their current scale.\n\n\nThe files dump is the latest installment in the Vault 7 series by the Shadow Brokers, which are a group of hackers who claim to have stolen \"over 400 GB of information\" from the NSA. In the latest release of documents, they've revealed that the agency is not just collecting telephone records. They have also stolen the source code to various NSA tools. In other words, if there is a tool designed by the NSA to steal your phone's contact list, you should expect to see that tool in the Vault 7 release.\n\n\nThe agency is also collecting a vast amount of \"meta\" information about your calls, conversations, texts and other information, including the time, duration, and phone numbers called.\n\n\nThe documents show that the NSA is getting a whole lot of value out of this collected data. NSA director Mike Rogers defended the agency in a statement and pointed to several programs the agency has developed to analyze meta data.\n\n\nRogers went on to say, \"It is the job of the executive branch to protect the nation against terrorist threats that span national boundaries and require the integration of signals intelligence, human intelligence and technical analysis. NSA has been doing that job well, for over a decade. With this new authority, the agency will augment that vital work. Our new authorities further demonstrate that the nation's spies, when deployed appropriately, are as worthy a defenders of America as the men and women in uniform.\"\n\n\nThe leaks show that, in fact, the NSA is actually developing some of the tools that they are revealing in the NSA Vault 7 release. But it seems like they aren't getting much out of this kind of data, not even from what might be the most valuable information that the agency has.\n\n\nWhile there aren't any major revelations to be made, the release does shed light on an interesting question about surveillance programs. As I mentioned before, there is a tremendous amount of information that the NSA collects. The leaks show that the agency is currently collecting phone numbers, the time of a call, the locations of people calling -- all data that could theoretically be used to help prevent terrorists or criminals from making calls. But in practice, this kind of collecting has not been used in recent years. We don't have any hard numbers on this and don't know why.\n\n\nNow that we know the NSA is collecting meta data about our phone calls, what's the difference between having metadata and collecting the full call list? The new leaks suggest that metadata is better in the long run, and it isn't clear if the NSA collects everything without having a way to search the data further to find the names of terrorist suspects.\n\n\nWe don't even know how many people the federal government is collecting all of this meta data from, or where it is being stored. If the information is collected by many different agencies at once and stored across multiple offices, it is going to be a lot harder and expensive to track these people down. The only way to find this information would be to take a step back and take a look in the mirror, as we've heard Snowden suggests the NSA wants to do. If you've been keeping up with all of the recent Snowden leaks, this one isn't really surprising for you, but you'll get a much better understanding of the privacy implications of all this if you watch his speech.",
      "I'm an aspiring author (my short story, \"The Man on the Other Side,\" and a trilogy of novels, \"The Bully Gets Married,\" \"The Boy From the Woods\" and the third and final book, \"The Last Day of May,\" are out now!).\n\nI'm also an animal rights activist and advocate for all of life on Earth. As an author and a life-long humanist, I have dedicated my entire life to working toward bettering the conditions for all of our species. For the most part, my writing is about animals.\n\nWhy am I raising money for Animals Asia?\n\nI'm an author, and my story was written, in part, in Thailand. I can now share the story that inspired me with you all, but only if I can reach enough readers to support my dream - to bring this story to the readers all over. Through Animals Asia, I will be able to do exactly that!\n\nWhere will the funds go?\n\nI've already invested a significant amount of time and energy in this story. I've put a lot of thought into the story format and characters, and, of course, researched the most important issues.\n\nMy goal is to write the best book possible. I want to provide you all with a complete and engaging book, no matter what your level of understanding in this area. And beyond that, I want to work with Animals Asia to bring animal rights advocacy and a compassionate world-view to the readers. So, I need to hire a publisher and the appropriate editorial teams. At the end of the day, I need support.\n\nCan I read the full book first?\n\nNo! The short story has been released on my website, and you can see it, along with a very few other short stories, at www.sunnythemes.com/the-man-on-the-other-side.\n\nI've chosen to make the novel out of paperback. I will also ship paperback copies to select media and animal lovers around the world.\n\nI have a publishing deal for the story and all of my other books. Can I send you my contract to review and you tell me whether I can accept it?\n\nI can't guarantee you my commitment if you aren't interested in the story. I would much rather you give me your opinion and help me create the best book possible!\n\nCan I ask questions?\n\nWhen I first started my Kickstarter campaign, I posted the FAQ in the About section. I've received a number of questions about the project, so I'd like to post answers here as well.\n\nQ: What will Animal Asia make from my support?\n\nA: While this campaign is about raising money for Animals Asia, and making books, this is a non-profit organization. What it does pay me in royalties is for the promotion and posting of my books. I've been working with Animals Asia to provide the book for a lot of years, and I do so as a volunteer so it doesn't impact how much time I have to spend on the writing myself.\n\nQ: What is the publishing deal for the novel?\n\nA: The novel has already been published as an e-book in Thailand. I've also got other stories and short story collections in the works. I hope that by supporting this project you also get your hands on the more famous and better-selling books.\n\nQ: I'm a media person. Can I help promote this book?\n\nA: Yes! I know that publicity isn't a glamorous job, but I do feel that I can best help Animals Asia by bringing the animal rights awareness in my own life. I can reach many more animals through media exposure, and then help bring awareness to the rest.\n\nQ: Is there a link to my email or phone number in the About section?\n\nA: There is a link to my Press Kit. You can also check out more information at www.sunnythemes.com/press.\n\nQ: Do you work for Animals Asia?\n\nA: No, I don't work for Animals Asia. I'm not a spokesperson for them. When I asked for a press kit, I simply told them that I have a short story that they might find interesting, and it just so happened that Animal Asia contacted me at the same time. I'm not officially associated with Animal Asia. Of course, I would love to help out if I could, but I know they have to make their business work without me contributing.\n\nQ: Can I send books over?\n\nA: Yes, of course. I can't send books out without first making sure the book is formatted correctly for your Kindle device and that it's formatted correctly for your e-reader device.\n\nQ: How can I share this page or share this project with others?\n\nA: You can use the \"Share\" button on the left of my page",
      "A few weeks ago, my husband and I put together our annual Christmas Eve plan for this family. My son's birth is a day before, meaning he's going home with us later today. I knew he would be a little late (he's usually at the hospital before he gets home from his dad's room), and if there was going to be any kind of mess from Christmas Eve to New Years, there would have to be a little mess. There was a pile of toys and other stuff in the kitchen, and now there's a bunch of stuff in the living room that was left out.\n\nI thought it would be okay for him to go home at 1pm to get ready for the birth tomorrow. I mean, he's going to be home and ready by himself, in about 3 or 4 hours, right? Plus we'll have some time on New Years Eve, so I figured it would just be one or two hours of cleaning and preparation, plus some down time.\n\nWell, yesterday morning I woke up and there wasn't much in the kitchen. I grabbed some items and did some yard work for her and some cooking for myself, and that was it. When I came downstairs, all of the clutter (and some shoes and a toy truck) had been cleared away. I had no idea what had happened, but there he was, in our living room, ready to go for his mom and dad.\n\nI called a couple of hours later to let his mom and dad know they'd be coming home at 1am from the hospital, I told them I didn't think they wanted him around the house all night, and she said \"No biggie, as long as he's happy.\" I took my son out to go do some shopping as usual, and had him get dressed in a black outfit. I made sure he was wearing nice shoes, and had his hair and lashes done a couple of days ago at The Salon in Riverview. I didn't want him to get dressed that way in the future so I let him sleep in his white coat and jacket tonight.\n\nI went to get him a snack, grabbed me a couple cups of coffee and grabbed my husband's laptop and the Xbox controller. I made him an extra New Years celebration game and some hot chocolate and we hit it head on. We're already planning another New Years celebration to take place at The Village Inn next week.\n\nWe were just watching the news the other day, and they're talking about a woman who had a dog who was found with an open bag of crackers on the floor. Now, I'm not a huge fan of crackers or candy (I don't like the sugar rush of sugar), so I was pretty taken aback when I first heard this.\n\nI was like \"Oh, my goodness, this woman has an open bag of cracker's on the floor? It needs to be stopped! People need to know not to leave things lying around, especially cracker's and candy. It's just a matter of time before something bad happens.\"\n\nMy husband and I were on the phone a couple of hours later, in tears. My son is so excited for Christmas Eve and all the Christmas goodies and stuff that he thinks all the stuff will be there after Christmas. It was all in the kitchen, but now that they cleaned it, that stuff isn't. It's a bit of a loss when it comes to him being excited about Christmas, but he looks up to Santa too. Now he's crying while I think about what to do.\n\nI have talked to his dad, the night before he left to go to the hospital. When I asked him if he knew something was wrong, he said he thought we left some things out, and my husband and I are the only ones who have been home since Christmas was over. My husband can't wait to be home tonight on Christmas Eve, but what do I do? What are my options?\n\nThanks so much for reading!",

Pikachu appears alongside the other starter Pokémon Pokémon in the initial Generation I games, Pokémon Red and Green and Pokémon Blue, but did not appear in Pokémon Yellow.\n\nHistory\n\nPikachu is born\n\nPikachu is born in Pewter City, where it is named Ash Ketchum. At first, Pikachu is quite terrified of things that move, so a few trainers try to calm it down by using electricity or rubbing it in. One trainer, Jenny, who is a motherly figure, takes great pains with her training and shows Pikachu that it doesn't have to be afraid at all. Once a strong bond between Pikachu and Ash is made, Jenny names Pikachu Ash. Later, Ash and Pikachu leave Pewter City to travel to Indigo Plateau in order to compete in the Indigo League.\n\nWith three other Pokémon, Pikachu takes on Johto's Gym Leaders. It wins easily enough to make its name famous and become a Gym Leader. When he reaches the Indigo Plateau, Giovanni offers Pikachu a Kalos Gym Badge, but Ash declines it out of respect for Ash's Pikachu. Giovanni threatens Ash that he will see Ash and Pikachu on the next World Championship, and the two then share a touching final battle.\n\nPikachu in battles\n\nPikachu first used to use Quick Attack against James's Golem in the final round, but it was quickly defeated by James. He then challenged the Gym Leader of Pewter City, where he easily defeated a Pokémon Trainer named Brock. He battled Ash in his seventh battle of the day. Pikachu won the battle after two Thunderbolt attacks.\n\nAsh then called on his Pikachu for a battle against Giovanni's Gyarados, but Pikachu wasn't able to win. Gyarados used Hydro Pump on Ash, which sent him flying. Ash ended his battle with Pikachu, saying he will now be his \"proudest disciple\".\n\nA year later, Ash and Pikachu are sent to the Pokémon League to compete in the Indigo Region Pokémon League Tournament. Pikachu and Ash win the tournament easily, but once the tournament is over, they return to Kalos and decide to take their Kalos League journey to Cerulean City in the next generation. As Pikachu takes Ash around in his electric wheelchair, Ash finally takes Pikachu to the Indigo League, where he sees his Pokémon battle the Indigo League Champion, Iris.\n\nOnce more, Pikachu is defeated by Iris's Pikachu and this time in a rematch Pikachu loses again. Soon after, Ash and Pikachu set out for Cerulean City in order to continue the journey and the battle. They head to Cerulean City to compete in the next Indigo League Tournament, only to have to face their first Pokémon Trainer in the process. The Trainer is Iris's mother, June. Despite being a very strong Trainer, her Pokémon start to lose to Pikachu's and are soon defeated, but Ash is able to get Pikachu to use Thunderbolt. Pikachu eventually wins and is able to take Iris's badge. He then heads to Mt. Moon, where he sees a wild Pika (Pikachu's first Pokemon).\n\nBattle against Giovanni\n\nPikachu facing off against Giovanni\n\nIn Mt. Moon, Pikachu's electric abilities finally reach their peak. The battle is over when he uses Thunder Shock. At the end, May, June and Iris, along with a small army of Team Rocket, arrive to stop it. Iris takes Pikachu by the hand as a prize from Giovanni.\n\nFollowing his defeat, Ash and Pikachu were sent around the region. They later go up against each other again in their second Indigo League tournament. This time, despite Pikachu's victory, Giovanni still wants him to battle once more. But when Ash and Pikachu both refuse, Giovanni begins to rage and begins to unleash a powerful attack on Pikachu. But he is scared of the attack and runs away. The only reason he stayed behind was because Ash's Pikachu is one of the few Pokémon that do not obey Pokémon Rules and that he would lose even if he accepted his challenge. Giovanni then makes his Pokémon battle and his Rhydon uses Thunder. Ash watches and after a long moment he leaves and gives Pikachu a thunderous pat on the head.\n\nIn the next Indigo League Tournament, Pikachu and Ash's Rhyhorn face off against Jessie's Pachirisu, May's Piplup, Steven's Pidove, Bonnie's Ivysaur, and Dawn's Ledyba. Ash and Pikachu finally manage to hold out for a bit, but eventually Giovanni's Rhyd",
      "I've been looking for a way to share my work in a more efficient manner in hopes that it would help increase visibility and engagement with my work (on a personal level, as well as on a professional level for the blog!) So, that's the intention with this post.\n\nHere are 6 resources that are great for sharing your work, but probably not well suited for what I want to do in this post.\n\n1. The internet\n\nThe internet is your friend! It's the greatest collection of useful information and information in all of existence (well, in my book!). While it's always a good idea to keep one of the many resources mentioned in this post, I also strongly recommend reading some of the blogs out there. Blogs like What is the Internet and What is the Web. You can just click one of the blog names and go. These blog posts are amazing, and have been a huge source of inspiration for so many of my ideas in the past. If you want to learn what a blog is in the next 10 minutes, check out my post about what is blogging (click the banner at the top right to go to that post).\n\n2. Google\n\nI love search engines! I love looking on them, I love writing with the most popular searches you can perform. I'm going to keep using Google as my default browser, but if you're going to use Google for your main search engine, it would be the same as the rest of the resources below.\n\n3. Your Facebook page\n\nYour facebook may not have an app, a plugin, or a community to connect to the internet, but it's the main social media platform that I use in my personal life.\n\nDo an SEO audit on your facebook page, and optimize for both organic and paid search. You can find out what search terms people search for most on your website and use those terms in search engine results. I used to use Google and a tool to do this, but then switched to Google Adwords, just because it works quicker and it's a more accurate and timely source of search terms. When you're ready to update your Facebook page, you'll need to look at the changes you want to make. Facebook lets you add content to your page that will show up on the feed. You can set things like links, shares, videos, avatars, and comments that will show up on the feed.\n\nYou can find out what to share on Facebook, how to set up the social news feed, and get tips on how to use it in marketing as well. There are a few tools I will be using that require a facebook account, but not for this post. You can use an app such as SumoMe to do an SEO audit on your Facebook page and also look at how content would go through the site if your page were promoted. This could also help you see how social profiles are structured and find the best time to post.\n\nI'll be posting more tips here on Social Media Examiner about using Facebook and the social web as if they weren't there in the first place.\n\n4. Pinterest\n\nI've found out that Pinterest has a really good way of showcasing content for people who are looking for it. As a blog owner, you have to have a Pinterest account (I use Pinbot) to start pinning things. One thing that can make Pinterest a little hard for blog owners is that it makes it a little difficult to figure out what to post about. You may have more than one \"pin\", but not be able to pin one of the things I'm going to talk about in the post because it was too niche or doesn't fit with whatever topic I was going for in the post. To use Pinterest, do your best to pin the things that would inspire you as a blogger and share it with your friends, who may also be interested in taking a look at what you're sharing.\n\n5. LinkedIn\n\nIf you're on LinkedIn, you can connect with people who know about your niche so that you can start communicating. This is a great place to connect with anyone that might have something to say about your niche.\n\n6. Email\n\nI am on email (mostly) when I'm creating content or promoting it. There's a lot of information about finding and organizing your emails out there, but I wanted to add the important thing to remember while using email for promotion of your blog. Most email clients are configured so they'll create a Gmail for you (or perhaps you could do more advanced configuration options, which I will cover in future posts on promoting your blog). But in most cases, that's it. Now, you've got to find the email that you want to send to a specific person. Once you can create a successful email campaign that uses the email the person wants to receive, then you'll have a much better shot at making your audience feel like it's important to them and that your email may be a great choice to send them",

      "I recommend that you have some kind of life insurance, but I don’t think it is necessary for the amount of life insurance that you have.  The amount of life insurance that you need is determined by a percentage of your income, and the amount of life insurance that would be required for those years is actually a percentage of your total income.  If you aren’t earning enough money in the years for the number of life insurance items that you need, then you need to have a certain amount of life insurance insurance in order to protect yourself.  The number of life insurance items that you need is calculated as a percentage of your gross salary (of which you have a percentage of in the form of cash).  So, if you have money in the form of cash, and he is earning money, but not enough money for the amount of life insurance that he needs, then you need to have a certain amount of life insurance in order to protect yourself.\n\n",

      "\n\n\n I’d recommend something called a “covery”, which looks like a “T”-shape, and is made by cutting it out from a larger piece of fabric.  Then you fold it on top of the T-shape.  If you are using something called a “t-shirt”, that doesn’t require cutting.  The t-shirt looks like a little square in which you fold a small square to create the top part of the t-shirt.  The top of the t-shirt is called a “back”, which is the part folded over and across the middle of the t-shirt.  So it sounds like a good rule of folding, basically, there is a little bit of horizontal “folding” happening before the vertical fold.  Does that help?\n\n",
