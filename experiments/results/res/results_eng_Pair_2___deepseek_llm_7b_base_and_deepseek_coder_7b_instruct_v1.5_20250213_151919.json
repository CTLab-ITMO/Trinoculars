      "A few days ago, the first installment of our two-part series on the upcoming release of Windows Phone 8.1 was released. So why didn't we go for it this time round?\n\nWell, we were too busy.\n\nWe took some time to look over all the information available for the Windows Phone 8.1 Developer Preview (build 9292) and decided we needed a bit more time. After all, 9292 includes a whole host of new features which we wanted to cover. It even introduces some new features that weren't introduced with the first Windows Phone 8.1 SDK. But it also has some significant changes: changes that affect the user experience, stability and security – as well as making improvements to many core features and UI components.\n\nWe were also looking to have time to go over the new features at a deeper level, and provide information about what exactly is new. As in the past two posts, here is a list of all features that we've discovered so far in 9292. We'll be back with another post soon with a comprehensive list of all the new aspects.\n\nNot everything is perfect, and the list below will be updated as we uncover more.\n\nFeature\n\nNew Settings Dialog\n\nOne-handed operation is now enabled by default using the new Settings Dialog. This makes it easier to access to any app which requires one-handed operations – for example, the Camera app or settings.\n\nWe can find the old Settings Dialog by navigating to Settings, then to Personalization, then to Control Panel. If you are using the new settings dialog (i.e., if you have Windows Phone 8.1 Preview build 9292 installed) then the old menu is still available under the Personalization screen and in the Action Centre.\n\nWe will add an icon to the old Settings Dialog, but the new dialog will remain in place and will still act the same way.\n\nApps List\n\nThe apps view is now shown by default in the app list on mobile Windows 8 PC. You can now choose to display the list of all installed apps there too, but only a select few of these apps are listed.\n\nNote that the app list in the Action Centre is unaffected by the new Settings Dialog. If you want to use it then open Settings, then the Action Centre and set Enable Show app list in action centre to On in the Advanced Settings (scroll down till you reach the Advanced section) section.\n\nYou can now see all apps in the list in an expanded window in the Action Centre and on the Home screen as well.\n\nThe app list now shows more than just installed apps. For example, the Store app is shown. You can search all installed apps by typing in the search box, or select a selected app by pressing the search icon.\n\nNew search filter option is available: \"All\". This is particularly helpful for apps which are already installed on the PC (as we are doing below), and won't be installed when running on mobile Windows 8 PC. If you want to search only for a specific app or specific language – we used English here – you can do that too now by searching for only \"English (United States)\" at the search box: you'll get only English apps from the Store.\n\nIf you are not sure about whether you want to include an app in a search, you can now select the app and press the Show More button on the left. The app will be shown, and you can select what app you want to include in the search in the results.\n\nYou can also enable show all apps and show all apps in list only mode from the Apps List settings page. But this is not yet available in the Settings dialog itself, as we are investigating the options there.\n\nIn order to show any app or language in the app lists, you'll need to enable search filters for these.\n\nOn mobile, if you select any app in the list which is already installed, then it will be removed from the list even if it is still installed on our PC. To prevent this, you can now go to your \"All Apps\" filter page, select any app and then press \"Select All – All apps\".\n\nApp Shortcuts\n\nThe new shortcut system for apps is now activated by default. In addition to enabling shortcut system for a few third party apps, you can choose to do that for any third party app from the Settings page if you want – for example if you have third party games, utilities and utilities that you use frequently.\n\nNew Shortcuts\n\nWe have discovered new shortcuts for a number of third party apps. Below, you can find them in the \"Shortcuts\" list:\n\nInstapaper – The Instapaper app has been extended with a new shortcut system: swipe left on the share menu on a web browser then choose \"Add to Instapaper shortcut\".\n\nHangouts – You can now get to the hangouts",
      "In his latest appearance before Rep. Devin Nunes (R-Calif.) as part of Nunes' oversight of President Trump and the president's transition team's ties to Russia, former acting Attorney General Sally Yates told Nunes that she knew about Michael Flynn's contact with Russia and didn't tell the White House in December about the concerns.\n\nYates, who is testifying before the committee Thursday afternoon as part of her testimony, was asked about an exchange she had back in January with White House Counsel Don McGahn regarding Flynn's call to the Russian ambassador before Trump took office. The Washington Post, citing two anonymous sources, reported Monday night that McGahn instructed Yates to let the Trump administration know about the phone call and its contents to avoid a \"poison pill\" that might raise legal issues and force her to resign. She declined to talk about what prompted her to tell McGahn about the issue, but said that she felt she owed McGahn an explanation for what had occurred.\n\nFlynn, in his testimony earlier this week, said he hadn't communicated with the ambassador about his pending U.S. sanctions against Russia and couldn't recall the details of the conversation, which was recorded by U.S. intelligence officials.\n\n\"I said, 'Sir, that's what I was told,' \" Yates said. \"I thought they were going to fire him because it was inappropriate. He said, 'No, no, no.' There was nothing inappropriate about the conversation.\"\n\nHer testimony in front of the House Intelligence Committee came as multiple members on the panel have questioned whether Trump's campaign may have worked with Russia to help him win the presidency during the 2016 election. Democrats on the panel say they remain skeptical that the Trump campaign may have colluded with Russia in efforts to influence the 2016 election and that Trump officials may have coordinated with the Russians to sabotage Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.\n\nYates told Nunes on Thursday that during this period she saw no signs from Flynn that he was compromised by Russia. Flynn had previously been a supporter of Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton for president but now is a supporter of President Trump. The day after Flynn was identified in a January intelligence report as a Russian military intelligence officer, Yates said she spoke to the White House chief of staff about it. She said no one would be able to say why Flynn was still employed by the Trump team.\n\n\"I never felt, as I had during the Obama administration, that President Trump or anyone at that level was compromised by Russia,\" she said on Thursday. \"But at the same time, at no point did I feel comfortable about not telling him. I don't know why that was. I don't know in retrospect. It just wasn't something that crossed my mind.\"\n\nYates was the first attorney general to be fired by her boss, former president Barack Obama. She was appointed as acting attorney general by Obama in the waning weeks of his presidency and was later denied a permanent attorney general position.\n\nDuring a February meeting in the White House on Flynn's conversations with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak, Spicer told senators, incorrectly, that Obama fired Yates in March after she declined to defend the administration's executive order on immigration, a move for which she was later criticized. A spokesman later added that Spicer's statement was meant in reference to the \"troubling\" situation in which Yates was serving and the fact that the Department of Justice had requested that she recuse herself. Nunes told The Daily Beast that he had been talking with White House counsel Donald McGahn before he made the inaccurate claim. The White House did not issue a correction to Spicer's statement.\n\nYates' testimony before Nunes on Thursday was part of a series of interviews that Nunes has given this week about the details behind Trump and Russia ties. On Tuesday, according to CNN, he disclosed that he has seen intelligence reports that show how Obama used the British intelligence agency, Government Communications Headquarters, to spy on foreign leaders who were meeting with members of Trump's campaign team.",
      "Bengaluru-based digital wallet Flipkart will go live on September 14 and will support a large number of international banks like UBS, HSBC, State Bank of India and Axis Bank.\n\n\nThe company also announced that it would allow users to make foreign currency withdrawals at the RBI ATM overseas.\n\n\nFlipkart already allows users to make their offline purchases from select international financial institutions (IFIs) outside India. It is already on the ground at the Reserve Bank of India, UK-based Lloyds Bank, US-based Barclays and more than 100 other IFIs around the world.\n\n\nThe new feature will mean that customers will be allowed to make cash withdrawals at the RBI ATMs overseas, and can withdraw money from their Flipkart wallets (including the Flipkart Prime) at the ATM abroad. Flipkart Prime accounts can be used at foreign ATMs that are supported by debit cards from the Indian banks.\n\n\nThe service is available only for the Flipkart Android/iPhone and Microsoft Windows apps.\n\n\nHowever, UBS, HSBC, State Bank of India and Axis Bank are among the \"preferred banks\" of Flipkart.\n\n\nThe announcement comes after the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) allowed banks to link their customer accounts with Indian banks as a way of offering a cheaper service. A customer can link their bank accounts to a non-Indian bank to avail a cheaper service.\n\n\nAccording to the latest Reserve Bank statistics, there are nearly 600,000 non-Indian banks and payment banks. Over 30,000 domestic bank branches are operational. However, the availability of Indian accounts to these banks or their inability to link them to non-Indian banks is a worry for financial institutions.\n\n\nFirst Published: Sep 19, 2016 14:37 IST",
      "Bike Share is the first step toward a successful future for cities—the first step to re-establish a community-based bike culture at that future point.\n\nWhile it's a small and temporary experiment, the recent rollout of the Citi Bike system in the city of New York has many in the biking and riding community calling for a full national expansion of bike share programs. Cities of their size might be ideal for such a program as they already have populations that skew to the young and urban, allowing for a culture of bike sharing to develop.\n\n\"At its heart, Bike Share is about empowering people to use a shared form of transportation. We see the future of bike sharing as a tool to improve the health of urban populations by providing a healthy, equitable alternative to car ownership.\" -Lael Brainard, president and CEO, AARP\n\nBut a lot more needs to be done, in addition to a large city like New York. As a start, bike share needs to become part of public transportation again. New York has very limited public bus service.\n\nThat's not a huge problem, since the MTA offers free transfers to all participating Citi Bike stations, which are in Manhattan and Brooklyn. The problem is with the fare collection — which can be problematic as New Yorkers tend to pay for bus and train passes separately. That's why, for example, the free Citi Bike parking lots tend to empty before the bus.\n\n\"We need to get back to that transit way of doing things.\" -Lael Brainard, president and CEO, AARP\n\nIf bike share could also be offered across transit agencies and across the city, and be part of a larger transportation policy, then it would help everyone. As a start, the free parking lots could become a network of free-for-all bicycle parking. Or perhaps we could all buy one-way tickets to our destination stations on bikes and pay with a credit card after all.\n\n\"We are all riding bicycles. The question is, can we all share this public transit system? We envision a paradigm where everyone rides a bicycle to work,\" says Brainard. \"We are all riding bicycles. The question is, can we all share this public transit system? We envision a paradigm where everyone rides a bicycle to work.\"\n\nThat kind of community-based, community-built, neighborhood-oriented, city-wide system can only come about through active participation, a broad public outcry, and a robust government support system. Unfortunately, much of the U.S. has turned to road tolls, car-centric suburban policies, and high parking costs as the primary ways to help cities with bike share. That's what we call the system.\n\nBrainard recommends thinking through the future of bike share in other cities. For example, where would a Citi Bike system exist? Would it be in a separate parking garage, with all the attendant problems and problems associated with providing parking free to Citi Bike riders? In that case, she suggests considering whether an expanded use of parking permits for Citi Bike, similar to how cars can be issued with a parking tag in lots in NYC before they can be park at a station, might be an answer.\n\nEven a bike-sharing system that's built into a city bus would have all kinds of problems. The bus could be a \"revenue-capture\" type system where revenue would be derived from fees for using the bus or from parking fees. The revenue-capture aspect comes more into question when you consider that many cities that have established successful bike share programs also have had their transportation budgets taken away by their elected mayors/mayors in order to \"pay for\" bike share in the city.\n\n\"We must ensure that a bike share program is successful so it can continue after the program ends.\" -Lael Brainard, president and CEO, AARP\n\nIt's not just a bike share program that's important, though. It's also a culture of bike riding.\n\nBrainard says \"We must ensure that a bike share program is successful so it can continue after the program ends. Cities can be very effective incubators for innovative public institutions and programs if they're supported from the top down.\"\n\nThat's why AARP and other groups are advocating for more investment in bike share and more public support of the infrastructure:\n\n\"There is a lot of pressure now in the United States to build our infrastructure and maintain it. New York City is under more pressure than most cities, with all the problems that come with urban environments.\" -Lael Brainard, president and CEO, AARP\n\nWhile Bike Share currently relies on a combination of the government and private funding, there are already plans to move beyond that, and encourage private investors to invest in the Citi Bike system. The bike rental firm Motivate has already announced plans to launch a subscription service that would put bikes in a Citi Bike's docking stations. That plan could even include an additional parking",

A Senate Judiciary Committee hearing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. Saturday at the Capitol. If approved, it would send the bill to the full Senate.\n\nThe House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to meet on Monday on two related bills: one that would allow concealed carry permit holders to carry firearms across state lines with a valid concealed carry permit; and one that would allow certain criminal defendants in civil cases to waive jury trials to allow a plea.\n\nAll three bills are sponsored by Republican lawmakers and include language to allow guns in restaurants, churches and day care centers, according to the legislation lists from the committees.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/27gK0jn",
      "How to make your own DIY Sock Sizing Chart\n\nThis is a project I came across while watching The Art of Manliness and wanted to share it here. I did my best with the resources provided but any help is appreciated. There are so many resources out there for Sock Sizing so I've gone ahead and created my version for those who may wish to make their own. Please use caution and if it's your first time, have a beginner sock chart handy. I will not be liable for any mistakes you make.\n\n(This article was written in an attempt to help people find some of the \"big kids\" sizes out there which may help them make better decisions when buying socks or shopping for socks.)\n\nHow to do the Project:\n\n1. Get a pair of your desired socks\n\n2. Cut your socks in the size you would like them\n\n3. Measure a tape measure.\n\n4. Calculate your foot length.\n\n5. Cut a piece of tape about 8″ long and a little bigger than the length you calculated. Stick it to your sock, thread the end through the middle hole and pull tight.\n\n6. Measure the distance between the 2 tape marks\n\n7. Cut another piece of tape about 2″ to 3″ long.\n\n8. Measure the distance between the two tape marks with the second piece of tape.\n\n9. Measure your foot again.\n\n10. Put 2 strips of the first tape on each foot\n\n11. Take your third length measurement and cut 2 smaller pieces of tape. Take these on the top and bottom of the socks and sew them on.\n\n12. Do your fourth length measurement\n\n13. Measure 3 smaller lengths of tape (the length you measured on the first 3 pieces) with the last piece of tape\n\n14. Take your foot measurement again\n\n15. Put 2 strips of the first tape on each foot.\n\n16. Take your last measurement and cut 2 shorter pieces of tape. Make sure these are in between each seam.\n\n17. Once you can move your foot without the foot touching the seam of the sock, you are done.\n\n18. Tape the sock to a piece of cardboard that you are going to use as a guide with a small piece of tape. Mark a line along this piece of tape and cut a hole through the cardboard.\n\nThat's it!\n\nI hope some of you will find this useful!",
      "It was the first time in 16 years that the Federal Reserve would raise interest rates, and it raised the Fed's overnight lending rate by a quarter of a percentage point.\n\nThe central bank's move Thursday pushed interest rates up to near zero and signaled a big step toward unwinding two decades of unprecedented easy-money policies. The Fed had repeatedly said that any higher rates would have to wait until 2015 before being enacted.\n\nThe Fed's decision, the first rate hike since 2010, also was accompanied by a big boost to the economy.\n\nIt is a signal that the federal funds rate, the rate at which the Fed lends funds to commercial banks, is likely to slowly rise from zero in coming months and years.\n\nSince the recession, it has moved close to zero but never gone back to that level. It has been in the 0.5 percent to 0.75 percent range for the past four years. Until now, the Fed had kept rates on hold for several years while officials debated the rate-hike path.\n\nThe Fed's board of governors and its chief Janet L. Yellen said during the Thursday meeting that the economy has been growing steadily and unemployment has held steady, but the Fed will raise the target interest rate when it sees the economy grow consistently faster. If the Fed begins to see a slowdown, it will begin to dial back. In other words, the Fed isn't just waiting for a recession, the economy is now.\n\nThe Fed raised its target interest rate to 2 percent from 0.5 percent on Jan. 27. But the rate remains below levels that many economists had expected for a better economy and that the Fed had projected for months. (The Fed forecasts 2.4 percent rate, with inflation below 2 percent, for 2014.)\n\nBut the central bank did not set a time frame. If business improves, the economy might return to full employment, or even higher, and unemployment might even fall.\n\nThe question of when the Fed will start unwinding the central bank's bond purchases — called quantitative easing — has been widely discussed.\n\nMany Fed officials believe that the time has come.\n\nThe Fed has bought $2 trillion in bonds since late 2008, when rates were close to zero. But that number has since more than tripled, from $800 billion in September to $2.5 trillion in December, and the purchases were not supposed to continue.\n\nDuring Thursday's meeting, the Fed announced that it would begin winding down the program gradually. When that occurs, officials want to use the money to help struggling businesses and the unemployed. But at some point, officials expect the government to sell the loans back to the banks that bought securities.\n\nMany analysts expect the program to end eventually, because the economy has been improving so much during the past few years.\n\nThe interest rate rise came one day after the economy expanded at an annual rate of just 1.5 percent.\n\nThe central bank expects U.S. gross domestic product should grow at a 3.4 percent annual rate this year, after expanding at a 3 percent pace each of the past two years.\n\nThis year, the Fed expects consumers will spend much of the extra money left from the higher rates on gasoline, clothing and other household goods. The economy should expand 2.2 percent this year, after expanding 2.1 percent last year.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://usat.ly/1D4e2R8",

Here is the story:\n\nPresident Obama appointed Robert Bauman to be the new chair of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB). After being nominated in October, the Senate confirmed Bauman in early November. It has been his job to lead the NLRB during the term of President Trump's new board chairperson, the former labor secretary and Trump campaign donor Mark Gaston Pearce. (This is the first time a president has named a new NLRB chairman during his first year in office.)\n\nWhy did the Senate confirm Bauman to head the NLRB?\n\nThe Senate voted 94 to 7 in favor of the confirmation. Most Senate Democrats voted in support. The Senate Minority Leader (D-Maine, who is no longer a senator) voted nay.\n\nWhy is Trump's appointee to run the NLRB, Robert Bauman, a well-respected lawyer? I've read some things that suggest that the Republican Party and business groups view him as a weak-willed \"moderate\" and not a conservative; some say they don't want a hard-line conservative like him on the board. (Or perhaps one of those \"moderates\" didn't want a strong-willed conservative, but also wanted to curry favor with business.)\n\nI would like to put the record straight, though this is an odd example. I don't have access to the text of the vote, but that's not important. In the Senate, there's a principle called the \"Rule of Three.\"\n\nThe Rule of Three is a simple principle. This is how the Senate operates.\n\nEvery Senate meeting (at least one per day, though this is not usual) has a three-hour window for debate, so that each senator is allotted a \"three-hour speech.\" The purpose of this rule is to promote debate and discussion. The three hour window is meant to discourage filibusters and other backroom maneuvers.\n\nAs I have noted in this space before, senators who don't like how the rule works have used it to block consideration of the nomination of Robert Hanabusa as Associate Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court in 2000. (Hanabusa was then an associate Justice of the Hawaii Court of Appeals, and he had served on one or both of the state's Supreme Courts; he had filed briefs in the Arizona Supreme Court on behalf of a group of immigrants.) That is to say, senators who don't like how the Rule of Three works are using it to block Hanabusa's nomination.\n\nAnd that is precisely what the Republican leadership in the Senate did. When Bauman was nominated, they used the Rule of Three to filibuster that nomination. (This is not unusual—you can find similar examples from President Bill Clinton, but President George W. Bush used the Rule of Three about eight times more frequently: twice for his nominees and once for his appointee.)\n\nBauman will now serve as acting chairman of the board for three months as Senate Democrats take up a nominee for the two-year term. The Republican leadership will make up the difference in time during that three month period. I don't know yet whether Trump's appointee to run the Board will be available for the duration of the delay. (I can't be sure, because I'm not privy to the board's meetings. This is the first post in the series on who leads the Board of NLRB. I'll follow up the next blog post with a look at the Board itself.)\n\nUPDATE: Some have asked why Democrats are not using the Rule of Three to filibuster President Trump's new NLRB chairman, Mark Gaston Pearce, since he was a friend and former colleague of Robert Bauman. Here's a quick explanation.\n\nFirst of all, in a two-person presidential nomination process, neither the Senate nor the president has the votes needed for filibuster. This is one reason why presidents usually choose to nominate people who are well-respected by senators — the Board members themselves are appointed by the governor; they also are all paid by the federal government.\n\nSecond, Bauman may not have the votes to block Gaston Pearce; he may be able to defeat the Democratic leader, Joe Manchin (D-WV), but that's not guaranteed. I don't know which senators will be willing to vote to deny a Trump nominee to a job they had voted for in the past. It does seem that a handful of Democrats are willing to do this.\n\nThird, Gaston Pearce wasn't nominated until after Trump had been elected and thus has",

      "\"Beware of the Lord. I'm going to stab her.\"\n\nIt's possible, of course, that the man in the black suit has a very bad case of mistaken identity, or that, more likely, his wife has been seduced by Satan himself. At this point, it makes no difference. The man who stabbed his wife has every right to stab her. What's more problematic is the police's attitude to the story.\n\nAt 1 a.m. on the morning of Thursday, May 26, in the town of Buitenkant, the police discovered an injured woman who, at the time, they say, \"appeared to have been stabbed.\" According to authorities there, the man she was sleeping with, who apparently doesn't want to be named because he is still a subject in a criminal investigation, was trying to escape from his home on a bicycle. But he didn't stop to do so. Instead, he turned on his lights to look for an exit; he was looking for an alley, possibly to make his escape.\n\nAccording to the police, there was a road to the back of his house and, within seconds, something terrible happened:\n\nA short while later, a group of people arrived at his house, and a woman tried to stab the man. It was at this point that the man used his phone to call the police … The officers arrived to find the woman seriously injured and the man armed with a knife, which he had hidden while the police arrived. He has since been released for questioning but told investigators he did not know the woman and was just trying to help her by getting her on a bike.\n\nIn other words, a husband stabbed his wife for trying to protect their child. No wonder one of the officers responsible for this story described it as an example of \"bizarre behaviour.\"\n\nWhen police spoke with the woman, they also noticed that, by her account (which is corroborated by her husband), she had been trying to take his bicycle when she tripped and fell on the ground, knocking her wrist so hard it had to be amputated. As reported in our previous story, the injured man told officials that he, too, had tried to save his wife, but his efforts had failed. Still, according to the victim, she tried to get up and walk away, but didn't get far. \"I couldn't go any further so I stabbed her to stop her from getting out of reach,\" he told the police. This account differs from that of the police story, because it doesn't support the account of the wife as a demon-sorcerer who is hellbent on getting her husband killed. \"I thought my wife was dead, but she came back to life to stab me,\" she told one of the police officers. \"Please tell me what really happened because I don't want to be married again.\"\n\nIt shouldn't come as a shock that when two equally disturbed parties have different accounts of what happened, no good conclusion can be reached. It's not just the police who cannot make up their minds, but also the victims. \"What happened to me will always haunt me. I can't forget what has happened. I won't be able to forgive myself after this,\" one of the injured women said when she arrived at the hospital. The only thing she has been able to forgive herself for is coming back to her husband:\n\nIt can be argued that she could have left her violent husband for good after the incident if she had taken the opportunity. If she had not come back to get her husband, it is doubtful he would still be alive right now. She is the only one who saved me and that is enough for me to forgive.\"\n\nAnother of the injured women, who was in her early 20s, told the police that when she met her future husband (who, like his wife, apparently has a history of domestic violence) at a dance school he had attended, he had told her to \"kill everyone in the room.\"\n\nThe couple was in love, and after the incident they immediately married each other. It is unclear whether the woman's marriage has since come to an end. If it has it is likely to have been over because he is a convicted criminal. (His wife told officials that she had forgiven him and had forgiven him for his abusive behavior toward both of them.)\n\nIn a sense the case illustrates just how deeply rooted sexism and homophobia are in Dutch society. Even if the police do eventually exonerate the man, their behavior has already tainted his reputation. \"I can tell you that the woman, who appeared to be a prostitute, had previously told her new husband that she could see him with another woman,\" a police spokesperson from Buitenkant told The Local in advance of a press conference.\n\nUnfortunately, the authorities are not only covering up the facts. They are also covering up the identities of the two women involved. The police initially informed The Local that the woman whom",

      "ROME – When Italy's first astronaut, Samantha Cristoforetti, took the stage at a symposium on Thursday — as well as during a live webcast — the room was a sea of white.\n\nThis wasn't because everyone wanted to hear exactly how hard Cristoforetti was training for her planned flight as an Italian-American, but because she was making history.\n\nSince the beginning of the Mission Control Center in Italy's southern Emilia Romagna region has seen space flights of the two Americans, including the first U.S. woman ever in orbit on Feb. 1, 2004. But no Italian had set foot on the space station.\n\nThe only woman on board the ISS was Italian astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti in March 2010. (Photo: ESA)\n\nNow, though, a little thing called the International Space Station is about to come to Rome, where a few hundred people will pay their respects as they mark Cristoforetti's official departure from space and the end of an eight-month stay.\n\nThe astronaut flew on the space shuttle Atlantis and has been living on the space station with a rotating crew that includes U.S. astronaut Don Pettit. Cristoforetti's mission was to serve as a training partner.\n\nShe had been preparing to visit the ISS with NASA since December, preparing to do two spacewalks and three spacewalks as an Italian.\n\nCristoforetti's departure is the last step of a major overhaul of the Italian space exploration program. From the earliest days of the program, Italy has wanted to take a leading role in the global effort to expand human presence beyond low-Earth orbit.\n\nIn a way, it's been a long road. At the first Italian International Space Station conference on Earth in 1999, the organizers had to choose the conference venue because it was the first time Italy had ever invited a space conference anywhere.\n\nSince then, Italy has hosted the annual congresses twice. In 2005, as she prepared for a long stay aboard the ISS, the first female astronaut from Italy ever, Cristoforetti met a woman in the audience from Florida who had also been following her journey to the ISS.\n\nIt's \"just a dream come true,\" she said following the meeting, according to CNN.\n\nSince she is the first Italian woman to set foot on the ISS, Cristoforetti has had a very special bond with mission engineer, Christa McAuliffe of the U.S.\n\n(Photo: Christa McAuliffe via NASA)\n\nAfter Cristoforetti began her first spacewalk in late 2009, the two women became the only pair to work together.\n\n\"There was a point in time when we felt that we had the same goals and goals for this country, the U.S., for all of humanity,\" McAuliffe told Italy's Corriere della Sera.\n\nThe two women's friendship was so strong that during her 2009 training, during a spacewalk, Cristoforetti put McAuliffe's name in the \"person of interest\" list on her helmet, so that the U.S. scientist could be in the same room at the same time as her.\n\nOne of the most important milestones in the evolution of this partnership was achieved in May 2011 when McAuliffe was the first person to go up to the station and use an ISS robotic arm to snag something.\n\nHer actions were symbolic, as her mission would test out three new robotic arm technologies.\n\nThe first robotic arm to be used aboard the ISS was from Sweden's Space Research and Technology Centre, which NASA awarded the contract in 2012 to conduct three tests to demonstrate the suitability of the technology.\n\n(Photo: ESA).\n\nAfter the robotic tests failed and the contract was canceled, McAuliffe became the first astronaut in space to use a robotic arm to grab a piece of food.\n\nThe second was a test with Italian space agency (Roscosmos) astronaut Paolo Nespoli, and the third was in-flight docking to a space station module with NASA's Steve Swanson.\n\nIn-flight docking experiments were carried out with the station's Automated Transfer Vehicle, the Automated Transfer Vehicle (ATV) was designed in the 1960s to get into orbit aboard rockets. It was developed from the first-ever manned satellite, the Automation System, which successfully delivered U.S. astronauts to the Moon in 1972. The next major test of the ATV would be to dock with a spacewalking astronaut and then uncoil and unload.\n\nAs the mission progressed, one of the astronauts, Russian cosmonaut Anatoly Ivanishin, was removed early from the mission, leaving McAuliffe in command of the station.\n\nCristoforetti then performed the only two spacewalks of her four-person crew. The first was for the \"docking in progress\" and became the shortest spacewalk ever carried out. (",

      "[1] In addition to the effects on the environment of the effects on the individual, the effects of the current environment are magnified by the effects on families. The negative effects of child poverty are more than three times as large as those for family poverty, a phenomenon well described in the literature (e.g., Wachter et al., 2010).\n\n[2] Our results for child poverty were robust to adjusting for other influences on social capital. They were robust across different measures of social capital and robust across multiple time periods. In addition, they were robust to an alternative specification in which we omitted family wealth to assess family effects, thus controlling for the effects of economic and non-economic factors other than family wealth on social capital. Our estimates could therefore be sensitive to the extent of family wealth (but not family poverty).\n\n[3] In our estimation strategy, we used a set of dummy variables for gender; education; age; race/ethnicity; parental and sibling income; and number of children. We then estimated both an individual and a family regressions that included these variables at the national level. We then computed a standardized score that is the average of the individual and family scores. We used an indicator of poverty to represent any income above poverty thresholds for a single parent household or below three times poverty levels for a two-parent family. The index was weighted, as was poverty, to account for the fact that we only considered individuals and families, with no difference in probabilities between individuals and families. For this reason, we assumed that a single-parent household with no children was as poor as a two-parent household with no children.\n\n[4] If the child does not have a sibling present, we did not include this variable in these regression models. If, however, there was at least one biological sibling present, we included this variable in these models. All regressions used CPS data on children living at the address in which parents reported work outside the home. Thus, we only included data on the full sample.\n\n[5] The coefficient on maternal education was negative for both men and women.\n\n[6] We used the term \"black\" to refer to those living in families with two non-White parents, but those living in families with two White parents.\n\n[7] In other samples, these children are known to have lower levels of academic performance.\n\n[8] The proportion of children living in single parent or two parent households has increased (see also Smith and Wright 2005).\n\n[9] The results were robust to an alternate specification in which we controlled for maternal age in one of the regressions, with the same specification and weighting.\n\n[10] The results were robust to a standard specification including race.\n\n[11] For women, this term was not a significant predictor of the individual variable, so it was omitted from these regressions.\n\n[12] We used a variable for educational attainment.\n\n[13] The coefficient on unemployment was negative for both men and women for men with a postsecondary education and non-voting and a non-voting father (in the model using the unemployed parent). This suggests that the effects are limited to parents who are not in the labor force at these times.\n\n[14] Unemployment is often measured at the national level or at a regional level, although there is evidence that it tends to be particularly high in small states (Parry and Turetsky 2004).\n\n[15] We used a dummy variable for race. This variable was included both in the individual and family regressions for the whole dataset.\n\n[16] We excluded data on the child's father, and the effects were significant.\n\n[17] We used an indicator of family wealth that was measured only at the state level (because state-level measures are unavailable at the individual level, and because the state-level wealth measure is a composite of several measures).\n\n[18] For data on mothers with a job at the time of the survey, we used mothers who reported that they had not worked in the past 4 weeks.\n\n[19] In other samples, children who would later become parents are included in their father's age category. In our sample, however, many fathers were older than their child's age group, so we considered this group older for fathers than for mothers.",
      "This weekend, as part of their annual \"Proud Black Man\" weekend, the U of I's Young, Gifted and Black (YGB) student government committee invited members of the community to meet with students of color and take a vote on the possibility of having an all white student government.\n\n\"The purpose of this [all white student government] is to create a space where our students feel comfortable expressing their thoughts, feelings, and frustrations regarding the current status of the university,\" according to a YGB statement. \"As the school's most underrepresented demographic, as many YGB students have experienced systemic disadvantage and are in need of support, YGBs are particularly well-qualified to understand the ways in which the current system is harmful to them.\"\n\nYGB was created as a way for Black and Brown students to take part in the student government process and also provide an outlet for young, young people of color who had a platform to voice their frustrations.\n\nWhen YGB was formed a little over six years ago, its first meeting included 15 students, YGB Executive Director DeShawn Johnson said.

It shouldn't be any different than any other campus that is all-black, or all-minority, or all-female as long as their voices are heard.\"\n\nBuhl said that YGB is not an alternative student government model.\n\n\"Black students are not a privileged group, the students of color that YGB has, or any other campus that I was aware of,\" said Buhl. \"We're not looking at this as a way to provide an alternative for all students.\"",

      "Hear the story of the great American novelist, who wrote a great book, who also wrote a great poem. The original work of the poem is lost and never found, but a new version has been added by George Lipsitz to the New York Times. This new version makes great use of the language found in the original and has made the poem of great interest and importance to our present day and past generations. He speaks in the third person, and uses poetic expressions, but the form, structure and language are exactly the same as in the original poem, and are used with the same authority as the original. His prose style, although simple and concise, has great power and power comes from his use of words and his eloquence as a writer and of the words he uses in the poems. In the original poem the language is difficult to understand and the use of it is not particularly pleasant. In this new version words are used which will be easily understood by anyone who has read the book before, and the poetry will no doubt appeal to any reader who loves great literature. The book is entitled, The Book of the Longing, and is published for the first time with an introduction by George Lipsitz, and with an index and cross-references for further reading.",
      "Rome (CNN) It's a mystery that has puzzled historians, doctors and scientists for decades: how to clean a penis without damaging its natural tissues.\n\nThe answer could take the form of surgical \"prostheses,\" an idea that has long been dismissed by many doctors. But now a group of British doctors is investigating it as a possible new option in the fight against HIV.\n\nTesticular prostheses are a type of artificial male genital tissue that was introduced to the world in the 1980s, when the use of artificial prostheses was seen in Japan . One technique -- where the penis is split into two sections, the \"top\" and the \"bottom\" -- is now popular in Asia.\n\n\"With the use of plastic prosthetics, men can now take advantage of the extra natural sensitivity a normal penis has,\" surgeon Ben Jones, head of urology at Imperial College London, told CNN.\n\nProsthetic penis\n\nA doctor examines a penis in an operating room at the London Hospital.\n\nDespite a lack of medical evidence, various surgical techniques have been proposed to repair the damage to the penis' delicate structure. Some focus on the glans or head of penis, in the upper half of the penis, including a technique known as phallic-sparing (\"phallic-free\").\n\nOther techniques aim to repair the penis before, during and after surgery -- which has been shown to be a beneficial option.\n\n\"This approach is designed to allow the penile shaft to heal by removing damaged tissue that could be harmful to the penile nerves,\" said Jones.\n\nBut despite their advantages, phallic-sparing surgery has been criticised for doing more harm than help.\n\nJones -- who is also the editor of the UK's The British Journal of Urology and The British Journal of Surgery -- and his team are now exploring a new option for the penis: tissue-sparing surgery, which would see the penises of men with damaged tissue removed and replaced.\n\n\"It's a surgical procedure that was originally developed to treat phimosis (a tight foreskin) that has been adapted through research to repair penile injury,\" said Jones.\n\nHe explained that phallic-sparing surgery aims to prevent damage to penile nerves during surgery.\n\n\"It uses two types of tissue to reconstruct and repair the penis of a man that might not otherwise repair itself,\" said Jones.\n\n\"Both penile nerves and blood supply through the penile arteries and veins are removed during this procedure,\" he said.\n\n\"These parts are then re-exposed to the blood supply and the glans penis is exposed to oxygen and is able to restore its normal shape, and blood supply, following repair through the skin.\"\n\nThe process, Jones said, can take as little as one to three hours at room temperature, and is also suitable for men with damaged tissue elsewhere on the body.\n\nJUST WATCHED Penis transplant for transgender teenager Replay More Videos ...

Circumcised men were more likely to be negative and have a greater number of certain infections such as chlamydia than uncircumcised men.\n\n\"The benefits of circumcision seem to offset the risks,\" said James Tabor, professor of obstetrics and gynaecology at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital in New York. \"We would expect greater benefits if circumcision were more common in the United States and Europe.\"\n\nThere is some precedent in developing an alternative to circumcision, with several countries recently beginning to re-consider the decision they made nearly 100 years ago.\n\nJUST WATCHED A penis made from DNA Replay More Videos ...

      "The United States has developed a new approach to using space to boost the economy, which involves taking the latest technologies off the ground, and building and operating satellite-manufacturing, repair, and servicing centers on a global level, said the president's deputy chief technology officer, Peter Vincent Pry.\n\n\"This [new] industrial model, we call it the space factory, is a global industrial strategy,\" said Pry, addressing the recent ISS conference on economic policy at the International Academy of Astronautics, Space. \"It enables us to move our economy and make our countries more competitive in this competitive world. It's not just about sending stuff out into space, but it's about supporting innovation and production on a global level.\"\n\nWhile it's difficult to determine whether the United States, which is the most advanced country when it comes to satellite development, actually has this new industrial model (see \"Astrobiology: The World of the Space Factory?,\" The Space Review, June 14, 2014), the administration is already working on it, using NASA's own International Space Station, which serves as a manufacturing factory for the nation's astronauts.\n\nAt this point, the first satellites developed out of this new space factory will likely be of space-going spacecraft, perhaps as commercial services like Google's lunar-exploring Project Moon (see \"Google's Moon Base Plans and Challenges,\" Space Review, July 25, 2014).\n\nWhat the future may bring is a space-based manufacturing industry to augment the one currently in place, though it's not clear exactly what the role of the new space factory will be. The first step is to develop some type of structure to support its use, like a domed building to house the satellites. The next step is to use this factory—and a nearby manufacturing plant for components—to build spacecraft components like parts, engine valves, and fuel systems. Then the factory will develop parts for the spacecraft.\n\nAfter the spacecraft are built, a small team of astronauts will work in the factory to repair or re-manufacture them, and eventually launch them back to Earth. Then there will be one more step before the first private spaceflight, in 2021 or later; that will be the first commercial mission beyond low-Earth orbit, according to NASA. \"What we [have to do now] will be to enable NASA to support the commercial space industry,\" said Pry.\n\nThe space factory concept will also serve as a way to generate U.S. jobs. For example, the NASA satellite manufacturing facility in Huntsville, Alabama, has employed 1,500 workers over the past 15 years. The ISS satellite factory will be used by NASA for training to the ISS crew, which makes up part of the ISS-related STEM learning activities that are also a main focus of the Obama administration's BRAIN Initiative (See \"Obama Administration's Plan for Science and Technology Education,\" The Space Review, February 30, 2014).",
      "The New York Times's front page on Tuesday afternoon was devoted to an article about a \"major new study\" on American Muslim attitudes. The paper, apparently citing news reports, reported that the poll of more than 1,000 American Muslims \"suggests that the image of American Muslims is at odds with the feelings of the overwhelming majority of the general population — a view that appears to have contributed to the sharp uptick in recent surveys of attitudes among the large American Muslim population.\"\n\nBut the poll is not new. It was conducted in 2011. Indeed, the Times's story seems to have gotten that impression from an earlier item in the same edition of the paper:\n\nThe study was co-authored by the director of the polling organization, John Green, who has a background in community and educational polling. The American Muslims for Democracy and Elections and Peace (AMPEP) have been active in public polling on American attitudes toward Muslims for decades. In a 2005 article, they identified three fundamental principles and four dimensions of Muslim identity: religious; political; civil; and spiritual. In the current poll, they also asked respondents about their attitudes toward homosexuality. The poll, done in collaboration with the Eagleton Institute for Public Opinion, included telephone interviews with 1,000 Muslim adults, all of whom have identified themselves as American citizens.\n\nThat report also quoted Green as saying that the poll was \"the first serious attempt that we've found to measure the American Muslim community and to find the core beliefs, values and attitudes that drive their views.\"\n\nBut the new study doesn't contradict anything we found in 2005. The only relevant material in it contradicts Green's 2011 comments, not the study itself.\n\nA key finding of Green's study is that Muslims overall are highly liberal; roughly seven in 10 describe themselves as liberals or strongly so.\n\nThe rest of the survey is a collection of questions about how the Muslim respondents responded to seven statements. The six statements are, in order of frequency: \"People have a religious duty to help those in need,\" \"People must be tolerant before they can be tolerant,\" \"People should show respect for their fellow citizens,\" \"Religion is very important in a person's beliefs,\" \"People with strong religious faith should strive for high social status\" and \"Religion contributes to positive social outcomes.\"\n\nThe study reports that, while \"most Americans say they see Muslims for whom they disagree as fundamentally hostile,\" only 16 percent of Muslim Americans agreed; the overall figure for all Americans was 52 percent.\n\nThe \"positive social outcomes\" statement is interesting in this context. The story was about the \"positive social outcomes\" of American Muslims, but the headline and lead on the Times's own story suggest something different: that American Muslims are deeply critical of Americans — and especially the American government, which has been accused for decades of mistreating and discriminating against Muslims — and that hostility toward Muslims is driving the American Muslim public's alienation.\n\nThe pollsters used this sentence to make a number of statements. In addition to being incorrect in all those cases, it assumes that the Muslim respondents are expressing opinions that everyone in the general population has. That is, if you read the survey and came away thinking \"Muslims seem hostile toward the U.S. government,\" you have to assume that you are among those people, which is not true.\n\nFurthermore, the \"religious devotion\" statement is not \"strongly\" so. It includes the word \"strong\" to distinguish it from the \"strongly,\" an indication that, perhaps, it is used less.\n\nThe \"supportability of [American institutions of society]\" statement is not \"strongly.\" It includes the word \"strongest.\" While it is true that one percent of Americans, according to the poll, \"strongly support these institutions,\" that hardly indicates American Muslims would support them in the same numbers.\n\nGreen, the pollster, later told the Times that \"the 'social outcomes' part of the question might be more helpful but is not intended to indicate support for institutions, but rather to highlight how people see themselves and their communities.\" He noted that the study's focus on Muslims' beliefs — and not their views of those organizations — was deliberate. One of the poll's authors, Adnan Abu Khalifa, a professor at Southern Illinois University, echoed that explanation for the \"religious devotion\" line, saying \"we were interested in finding things specific to Muslim beliefs about their faith.\"",

      "Takahashi Masashi is a composer, guitarist, and DJ who is known for his electronic music compositions. Masashi's career began during a brief trip to America in 1978, but he quickly went to work to get his first commercial song record on a record label. After two years of effort, Masashi was able to release his debut album, \"Fushigi na kizure,\" (Blue Water, 1981), which appeared in the Japanese pop music scene. The album received rave reviews and helped Masashi gain national popularity.\n\nMasashi then took a few years off from his work and went back to Japan, where he joined two other musicians, and recorded a number of singles for domestic and foreign radio stations. Masashi's success continued with the release of his 1982 album, \"Sora ni Yoru (Maiden and Princess),\" a hit that found its way into the \"Gangnam Style,\" and an international music industry hit. By 1983, \"I Want Love\" had been added to the \"Gangnam Style,\" and became a world-wide sensation.\n\nIn 1985, Masashi released his first album, \"Sora ni Kuchizuke (Maiden and Princess), a more melodic and danceable work which received moderate airplay and popularity in Japan. However, he was then able to move on to producing solo and chamber music under his own name after his work on the \"Gangnam Style\" led to a number of major Japanese stars coming to the U.S. and Europe.\n\nAfter the 1985 release of \"Sora no Imouto no Koto (I Will Return,\" Masashi released his next album in 1987. It received widespread critical acclaim. Masashi's next four albums featured a mixture of orchestral music and electronic sounds that were more closely aligned with his country's own pop culture. These albums, which were released from 1988 to 1989, included albums with the titles of \"Odaie (A Girl Who Wasn't There In the Beginning), \"Neko na Chizu,\" \"Kagayaku na Kimi ni (My Baby), and \"Koukoso Keshinden.\" In 1988, Masashi was invited to compose for the film \"Yume wo Daku (Rabbit,\" starring Tomi Takema), and he wrote the score for the film, which was released in Japan in 1989.\n\nIn 1990, Masashi was invited to compose the music for an upcoming TV reality series called \"Shizuku no Tama ni\" (\"The Mystery of the Golden Flower\"). However, a year into writing his music for this show, Masashi's wife passed away and his manager asked Masashi to quit producing music for the program in order to concentrate on his business. Masashi did so on November 25, 1990, and released a final album as \"Masashi no Oji (Troublest) during 1994. Masashi had a long career in the U.S. and Europe, and his numerous successes include \"We Will Rock You (Remix)\" and \"Gangnam Style.\"\n\nSince \"Gangnam Style\" was released in 2012, Masashi has released one EP as well as a new album on November 21, 2013 in Japan.",
      "The first time that I heard about the word 'snowflake' I was sitting in the office of an editor for an indie game developer. At the time, I'd just been hired, and I was the first one she hired. We were discussing a demo game her boss had made which she thought was a lot of fun, but which wasn't very good. I said that I wanted to make that same demo a little better, and she said:\n\n\"What do you mean?\"\n\n\"Sometime later, I'm going to go to that game developer's office, and ask them to tell me what the problem is.\"\n\n\"I have one of those,\" she said, pointing at a framed picture on her desk.\n\n\"So what do you mean, it's just that this one guy there makes terrible games? That's what I mean by a snowflake?\"\n\nHer face was frozen with disbelief.\n\nThis is all very familiar to me as a woman in game development. Women game developers are often perceived to be whiny. We tend to be seen as demanding, entitled, and insular, and then when we disagree, it's often misinterpreted as \"male privilege\" (which, of course, can't exist, but it's really difficult to get away from). What I'd like to do here is look in detail at exactly why this is.\n\nHere's what you say: Someone asks for my opinion:\n\n\"I really like this song but I can't stand how they've used the first three minutes just to have three annoying guitars loop. What do you think about how they've used the opening of the first verse? Should I add more guitar to make it a bit more exciting?\"\n\n\"If you don't like it you should just turn it off.\"\n\nHere's what you say: You've made a game called 'You're a Badass' and you're looking for feedback from a publisher:\n\n\"I've been working on it for about seven years. One problem that I've run into is that my game's not really for the ladies. So I want to get some feedback about that.\"\n\n\"You should make the game more girl-oriented!\"\n\nHere is why I say this. I've had this conversation a few times, and it's often because women feel that this means \"this thing that I made is too 'manly' for women,\" and/or \"because I'm a creeper, women won't play it.\" Both are incorrect assumptions, and I can tell you first-hand that I get feedback about both. If you are not an old fart, you may be asking what this is all about. In my early 20s, I was a senior development manager on my game studio. A developer at the studio asked me to help a fellow fellow developer in the company build a prototype. This developer, a woman in her late 20s, was looking for advice from a friend. We went into the meeting looking for some kind of advice, but the conversation quickly turned to our game. She was describing her ideas for the game, and I told her that I'd be happy to assist in making it better, provided that she let me help refine and polish some parts.\n\nTo reiterate: The studio I was developing software for had this female developer; it had a female programmer, and a female designer. The game they were making was a sort of multiplayer racing game, with a female protagonist. This woman wanted advice about how she should polish her ideas to get them to work well with their existing team. The studio's development processes weren't a good match for her, and I took that opportunity to be a person who could help her. I said, \"Listen, I want to take you under my wing. You need help because you're new to the industry. You're going to run into a lot of technical hurdles, and I want to help you to the best of my ability. Just talk to me when it comes to your gameplay.\" I went on to explain how to write code that would give her some options on moving the camera a little farther out to the right, or if she wanted a little more distance between you and the car you were driving, or whatever. She seemed grateful, and within a couple of minutes we'd got everything ready.\n\nThat was the first conversation I ever had with a woman developer, and the first one that involved constructive feedback. This woman didn't know me. She didn't know anyone who knew me. I didn't know anyone who knew her. We didn't know what the heck each other was talking about, and that was good. Being young and having fun is a good thing, and the first time that a guy gets to go in and say: I'm going to learn this with you is always going to be better for me than the first time that a girl is handed a book full of rules and told \"you have to follow these rules to be",
      "It will never be clear whether the Obama administration's aggressive response to the Ebola epidemic in West Africa was a \"fiasco\" — though it might not be surprising to see an analyst with such an analysis note just this sort of thing — but one thing is for sure: President Obama and his top aides knew they didn't have a very good handle on the situation.\n\nIn the past couple of years, the White House has been caught flatfooted after taking unexpected and drastic actions. During the 2012 race for the Republican presidential nomination, Mitt Romney was caught off guard by reports that he had lost ground in the polls; the GOP candidate blamed it on his campaign staff being poorly organized. And just weeks ago, the administration was caught with its pants down when it decided to make a major change in military deployment on the Korean peninsula — and also, bizarrely, announced that a major troop deployment from Europe to the Middle East had been put on hold indefinitely.\n\nThe Ebola virus outbreak is no different: The administration was largely caught off guard, and on a moment's notice.\n\nThis seems to happen when the White House believes it's up against odds well in excess of 80-to-1 or so — but this is exactly what happened in the wake of the White House's initial response to Ebola, which had very little to do with the reality on the ground in West Africa.\n\nAs Politico's Gabriel Debenedetti reported before the Ebola outbreak even took place, an internal White House memo — which was leaked to the website just last Friday — had warned against a major outbreak in the United States, which is what took place in Guinea and Liberia in 2013. This memo, which was signed by Obama's closest advisers, made that argument even bluntly:\n\nWhile CDC has been doing an incredible job of keeping our partners on the front lines of the fight, we should not take chances. Our nation has a responsibility to protect ourselves from any spillover of the epidemic into the U.S. …\n\nThe fact that there is a growing possibility that an outbreak in the United States might lead to further spread of the virus in that country is a concern for our nation. So is the possibility that the virus might evolve in ways that pose a greater risk to those who may come in contact with those infected.\n\nIt's not unreasonable to see a major outbreak among Americans as a potentially catastrophic risk. The CDC has estimated that only two cases of Ebola in the current outbreak will \"effectively wipe out an entire population,\" and the risk of an outbreak in the U.S. — with a population as large as the continental U.S. — is enormous.\n\nThe risk to Americans seems especially high given that, as Bloomberg's Eli Saslow reported, there is no cure or vaccine for Ebola and that transmission requires direct contact with bodily fluids. (Those two things are true in the current outbreak — so we can safely say this is an \"effectively wiped out\" situation.)\n\nMoreover, the White House's memo made clear that we need to be preparing now about the likelihood of an outbreak happening in the U.S. — and that the U.S. should be getting ready now for that possibility. As Saslow noted:\n\nThis raises the potential of a \"potential pandemic\" with a \"threat magnitude of potentially catastrophic\" with no known treatment or vaccine for what is already emerging as \"a deadly disease with potential catastrophic consequences for the U.S.\"\n\nThe memo had already prompted a backlash from some high-ranking officials, such as former Defense Secretary Robert Gates, who wrote at National Review that the report \"appears to be based on a misreading of our current epidemic threat.\" Gates called the memo \"ill-informed and overly dramatic.\"\n\nBut as Debenedetti's reporting reveals, the White House was actually quite confident in its ability to foresee the outbreak in West Africa occurring — in fact, the memo itself called it \"a matter of when, not if,\" in an effort to convince the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to move ahead as quickly as possible with control measures such as airport screenings. The CDC director at the time, Thomas Frieden, was skeptical, but the Obama administration pushed hard for the CDC to move forward with its plans so that people could be moved to the U.S. immediately, without delay.\n\nBut even after it was clear that no such quarantine or emergency control measures would prevent an outbreak from entering the U.S., the administration went ahead and moved ahead with its plans. As Politico's Glenn Thrush writes: \"The CDC had to be cleared by the White House and Congress to undertake a public health response to Ebola, and it was only after that step that the CDC announced late on Friday that it would begin travel alerts and testing for an Ebola case on Sunday, giving up on the days it had planned to put on the testing for people who might travel.\"\n\nMoreover, one of the top officials at the CDC who was pushing hard for the travel alert to occur was",

The core guys from last season have all matured into a very good football player and I'm looking forward to working with those guys and having a chance to play with them and grow with them.\n\n\"It's an exciting time to be a Cincinnati Bengal and I want to get back on the field next year. I got a lot of great guys in this locker room that are going to give me all the help I need to get back to our success and we'll be back next year at full strength.\"\n\nKirkpatrick was named Defensive Rookie of the Year by the NFL Network in September. He ranked among the top five players at cornerback during the first two weeks of the regular season in the league for the second consecutive year. He also leads all rookies in interceptions and passes defensed with a league-high nine.",
      "An Ontario Superior Court judge found that a woman has been subjected to sexual assault by her former roommate as part of an ongoing spousal dispute. The roommate, 38-year-old William Zabel, pleaded guilty in October to sexual assault in the third degree.\n\nWilliam Zabel, pictured at the Superior Court in Toronto in 2015, pleaded guilty to sexual assault. ( Carlos Osorio / Toronto Star )\n\nOn Monday, court heard evidence from a third party — a security guard who lived in the basement suite with Zabel at the time of the incident. The court heard that on one occasion in December 2010, Zabel tried to kiss the security guard's girlfriend and pulled her close to him when she refused. Zabel then said, \"You're a good kisser, aren't you?\" when he saw the security guard's girlfriend's face, the court heard. The security worker then testified that she heard a woman cry out in pain before she realized Zabel had penetrated her from behind inside the apartment.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\n\"I was so surprised and confused that I could hardly think straight what happened,\" she said. Zabel said he never touched her from behind and denies that he penetrated him. Zabel was initially charged under the Criminal Code's assault with a weapon charges. A plea deal was reached where he received a one-year conditional sentence and probation. Judge Patricia Findley said she is satisfied there was a \"serious relationship,\" but \"it didn't quite happen according to plan.\" Zabel is required to give up his licence to operate as an electrician, and the court heard he has no ability to work in the community. His lawyer had asked the court to include a probation order and community service as part of any sentence, but Findley ruled that no probation was appropriate in the situation. Findley said that Zabel's history of domestic violence is an aggravating factor which was present when the case was originally charged.\n\n\"The circumstances of the offence do not provide the defendant with a meaningful opportunity to rehabilitate or reintegrate into the community,\" Findley said. Findley also noted there is a great likelihood of an assault of another woman from Zabel going unpunished in the future because of his history of domestic violence.\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nFindley also found that Zabel's record of a driving offence shows that Zabel is unable to safely drive and he has no ability to work in the community. Findley ordered that Zabel undergo mental health counselling and ordered a three-year good behaviour bond. Zabel is to serve half of the time outside the home and the other half in the community.",

      "The Canadian Press\n\n\nVICTORIA -- In a ruling that will likely further stoke controversy over assisted-dying legislation, a B.C. judge has found that a doctor must provide two views to a patient about her decision to die -- in writing -- and that the two views must be \"freely made known\" at the outset.\n\nJustice Ian Donald said the doctor's approach could not be to \"let her face her death alone.\"\n\nA B.C. Supreme Court judges found that the law passed in August 2015 was unconstitutional and could not be changed once it goes into effect next June.\n\nThe Supreme Court upheld the right of a B.C. woman named Elisa Levasseur to die with the assistance of a physician.\n\nShe had applied for an assisted death after suffering an aneurysm in 2014.\n\nThe woman was diagnosed with the disease in 1992 and began treatment in 2006. By 2013, the disease had progressed to the point of no return.\n\nLevasseur's wife and daughter were against the decision to obtain the prescription for assisted suicide and the pair went to court. The couple's three children, aged 20, 19 and 17, were also involved but were not included in the lawsuit against the province.\n\nThe B.C. law allowed for end-of-life discussions with a doctor and the couple was informed of how to approach that process in writing.\n\nThe couple did not agree with how the legislation was drafted and disagreed with a section of the law that said a doctor would not be required to act on behalf of the patient within 48 hours of being requested to do so.\n\nTrumped by Liberals, 'not good for society'\n\nAlberta, Manitoba, Saskatchewan and Nunavut allow physician-assisted death.\n\nWhen it comes to Quebec, which has also passed legislation, a doctor must seek the approval of a senior doctor or a psychiatrist to aid a patient in committing suicide. If all three are in agreement, the patient is allowed to die with the aid of a physician.\n\nLevasseur's lawyer argued that the government had made its decision to impose the law before it was even made final and should be subject to judicial review.\n\nThe lawyer representing the province argued that the Supreme Court had erred in concluding the law violated the Charter of Rights.\n\nA decision from the B.C. Court of Appeal is expected in a week.\n\n\"The law is not good for society,\" Liberal leader Christy Clark said Tuesday after the ruling was released. \"It is not good for families. We need to have a rational debate on this.\"\n\nThe Liberals supported the assisted-suicide law in the previous provincial election campaign and they will now have to reconcile their differences. The opposition New Democrats, however, have said they would have supported the legislation if doctors had had a greater say in who can obtain the drug.\n\nIn Ottawa, Liberal MP Marc Garneau, who was the party's point person on assisted suicide legislation this election, said that while the ruling was disappointing, the government could not change the law once it goes into effect.\n\n\"This is the decision of a judge, the legislature has already passed the law and it will be in effect on June 9. And that is what we have to deal with,\" Garneau said.",

So it won't be a full stop because we do need money to run our budget and to cover administrative costs across our EU-27 member states.\"\n\nMr Davis also refused to rule out paying European countries to continue membership of the European Convention on Human Rights.\n\nAsked by Mr Finkelstein whether Britain could commit to paying some of the £3.9 billion a year that the European Court of Human Rights currently receives for British cases, Mr Davis replied: \"I think the situation with the European Court is not quite as clear, certainly as the Government has made clear, and we're seeking to clarify the position.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Brexit Minister David Davis has said that the Government is still working on its Brexit plan but that Prime Minister Theresa May's speech last week was \"a good start\".\n\nThe full interview will be published in tomorrow's edition of the Telegraph.",
      "On February 19, 2014, the world had the pleasure of watching American Sniper, Clint Eastwood's cinematic retelling of the 2007 Iraq War. It's an easy and compelling film. It's about a tough young soldier (Bradley Cooper) fighting to protect his girlfriend (Sienna Miller), while struggling with PTSD in Iraq, all the while having intense, life-changing encounters.\n\nBut what most people noticed and took issue with was Eastwood's use of the M-16 military rifle. \"I'm a big fan of precision weapons,\" the director told Deadline afterward. \"The military is about precision. It's just how they do it.\"\n\nEastwood went on to elaborate on this point, but didn't make it clear enough for some viewers.\n\nIn the film's final third, it appears the film does use sniper rifles. However, the characters never use them. They simply point them at people and shoot them to death (or they don't have much choice). If that didn't cause a debate, it certainly contributed.\n\nA little background: Eastwood is a lifelong military man. He served in the Air Force and later in the Department of Veterans Affairs before taking a post in the Peace Corps under the Clinton Administration. After leaving the diplomatic position, he continued his military career, earning several medals of honor and, most significantly, serving as a sniper during the two World Wars.\n\nIn his book My Three Lives, a collection of his military writings, Eastwood recounts some of his many exploits during World War II:\n\n\"Early in the war we made a surprise raid on a German bunker. I was about five years of age at the time and a member of Company E in the 25th Infantry Regiment. We went in with a bunch of Marines and was followed by a company of infantry led by Captain Tuck. We spent the night by the bunker and were ready to attack it when the main body of the German defenders returned. In a quick but effective maneuver we broke off and slipped out of the bunker with almost no one being hurt. I was standing with my rifle behind me when a German soldier, whom I knew only as 'Chappie' attacked. My only thought was that I would be next. I shot the bastard in the chest with the first shot I pulled. That man died on the spot.\"\n\nEven with his experience, \"Eastwood did not hesitate,\" CNN writes. In fact, the film's creators tried to have him retell his story for American Sniper, and Eastwood declined. Instead, Eastwood gave the writers the option to write the story according to their own vision. Eastwood's family, friends, and producers all had the same reaction:\n\n\"Eastwood wanted to do it — he wanted to make it,\" he recalls. \"However, it was going to take a while for everyone to write the script and convince him to do it.\"\n\nInstead, Eastwood allowed a different artist to take his place — screenwriter Eric Singer. Singer didn't come up with the original story. Instead, he simply copied Eastwood's style and story-line from the book and edited it.\n\nThis would be a common practice, says The New York Times' Nick Paumgarten, because American Sniper is not very big. \"If you don't have a big script, somebody else will do it. It's that simple.\"\n\nEastwood didn't like the script, though. He was uncomfortable with the idea of telling the story of a soldier who, even though he had an M-16, was still able to kill people without fear.\n\n\"I have to admit I found it a little boring. There's so much more of what Eastwood hates,\" says author Stephen Schulman. \"He doesn't want to see blood and gore; he thinks of violence as the evil that's got to be avoided. It's a very American view.\"\n\nThere have been many critics who have criticized this view. In a New York Times blog post, Michael Korda, former deputy assistant secretary and senior adviser on homeland security during the Clinton administration, pointed out Eastwood's \"unrealistic assumptions about the battlefield,\" like the \"possibility of an enemy who would accept surrender without an elaborate battle plan.\"\n\nSchulman also criticized Eastwood's inability to \"accept that he might not be able to find every enemy soldier, or even every enemy,\" for a number of reasons, from simply not knowing the enemy's tactics to just \"disregarding the fact that no matter how hard you are looking you might be wrong about who's hiding in a trench.\"\n\nBut Eastwood wasn't always so hard on this issue. The director, who has written a number of war movies, made it clear during the shooting of The Green Berets back in 1983 that the weapons used by his troops are not sniper rifles.",

      "From a simple idea to become one of the most recognizable logos in America and the globe, the United States Postal Service logo was born out of a humble question: \"If we don't have a U.S. postage stamp, why not?\"\n\nWith a simple design, a bold new idea, and a fresh start at a new Postal Service in 1913, the \"Mail\" logo became famous worldwide, especially for a company known for its mail-carrying helicopters. With the introduction of the first Postal Service stamp in 1916, the new, now famous brand became a worldwide hit, attracting customers and businesses from all around the world.\n\nPostal Service began as a postal agency founded in the United States by the Postal Reclamation Service (PRS) and in 1861, was acquired by the United States Postal Service. In 1867, the United States Post Office Department was created to promote and develop the Postal Service during its formative years. The Postal Act of 1875 gave exclusive authority over the United States Postal Service to the Post Office Department.\n\nThe first United States stamps with the \"Mail\" stamp were introduced in 1916. By 1929, it was widely accepted that the Postal Service had established a nationwide reputation and a strong bond with the American public. In 1954, a new Postal Service logo had been chosen to replace the previous seal as opposed to a design that incorporated the former design; this logo was also used on the coins that the Postal Service issued. However, a new seal was used annually through 1977 and was finally replaced with a contemporary stamp in 2000, becoming permanently synonymous with the Postal Service.",

I think that the sign-up bonus should be pretty high but if it changes it should be high enough to have a good ROI.\n\nNeteller has a good reputation in the USA but may not be as widely accepted in the UK. I would look at other alternatives rather than this card as Neteller doesn't allow you to pay with cash unless you are already a Neteller cardholder.\n\nThe sign-up bonus offer is pretty good so look at it because it is worth more than buying a regular $15 Visa.\n\nAvoiding Fees\n\nNeteller Cash Back rewards have no annual fee, which is important for credit card consumers. I don't like having a $95 annual fee because this is way more than credit card minimum spend requirements.\n\nNeteller are known for their no foreign transaction fees.\n\nNeteller Cash Back rewards earn at the following rate: 2x points on dining & 1x points on entertainment, fuel & gas station purchases. Both of these rates can be increased from 1.5x to 2x by spending more points or by completing additional qualifying items.\n\nNeteller do not allow you to use cash at a restaurant using your Neteller card, in fact they won't even allow you to pay with cash at a restaurant. It doesn't have to be cash though you can use credit cards such as plastic at any time to make purchases when you are outside of the restaurant.\n\nIf you are going to use a credit card to buy anything in the UK the credit card issuer (Bank of Ireland) is going to charge you an additional 2.5% of each purchase above £30.\n\nOverall I like the Sign-Up Bonus.

      "Mitt Romney is taking new steps to win over African-American voters.\n\nOver the weekend, Romney held eight meetings with African Americans in North Carolina, Ohio and Florida, and is slated for another round in Nevada on Saturday, an aide told ABC News.\n\nAmong the stops, one is a surprise for Romney, who earlier this week declined to make a direct appeal for support from black voters during a speech in Texas.\n\n\"He's going on television to talk to black folks about their problems, their hopes and their dreams. And he'll see how many he needs to make up the margin. And he's doing that without taking any questions,\" said Tim Miller, president of America Rising, a political research and rapid-response organization.\n\n\"It's just an acknowledgment that he needed some help. We'll see how he feels this weekend,\" he said.\n\nWhile that may appease conservatives who were angered at Romney's handling of the \"47 percent\" video that showed him appearing to suggest that 47% of Americans don't pay federal taxes, the strategy does not seem to have gone down too well among Democrats.\n\nMiller said Obama will likely use the comments to push back on Romney's economic policies.\n\nObama on Sunday made sure the Obama campaign was front and center on the issue, in a statement released by the campaign through a spokesman.\n\n\"Mitt Romney's policies on jobs, education, and health care would destroy the jobs of African-American youth, women, Latinos and seniors — and turn our country's back on those most in need,\" the statement said.\n\nThe statement said the video \"hasn't changed the fact that millions of Americans across the nation, including African Americans, are struggling to maintain their economic security.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign is now spending on television, radio and digital advertising in Ohio and Florida over the past week, hoping to use the new focus to rally voters there.\n\nThe new ad, which ran in the Ohio media market in the past week, highlights Obama's plans for economic growth, including tax credits for small businesses.\n\nThe Ohio ad focuses on a quote from a former president, Bill Clinton.\n\n\"It's not that we can't do the things we should do about making the economy grow, but the way to do it, the way we're going to do it isn't by turning the clock back to the very recession and Great Depression era when American families had to tighten their belts, even though they had no choice, but to tighten their belts because government was doing everything it could to crush them,\" the ad quotes Clinton as saying.\"\n\nObama's campaign has begun airing an online ad in Florida.\n\nObama is not making an explicit appeal.\n\n\"It's not a new strategy; we've been using this over the last week in Ohio, Florida, where there are new battlegrounds, where there are new demographics, and this is an important message,\" said Miller.\n\n\"It's a message to remind folks that he thinks the best way to make an economy work for them is to go out and vote on Tuesday and not to focus on these distractions,\" he said.\n\n\"And it's also a message that will remind African Americans they were the ones who were targeted by the racist attacks,\" he said. \"We need to get this behind us as quickly as possible -- because while Republicans talk about Romney's 47% remarks and try to get voters to look past that, their policies are not going to protect African Americans and Latinos.\"\n\nThe Obama campaign will continue to aggressively focus in the battleground states, especially North Carolina and Florida, despite Romney's campaign having cut staff in those states and is now focusing on his own swing states -- Florida, Virginia, Iowa, Colorado and New Mexico.\n\nABC News' Matthew Claiborne contributed to this report.",
      "The best players have the best teammates.\n\nThat's not to say the Lakers are not a strong team. They definitely are, at least offensively. But how do the Lakers' best teammates line up with each other?\n\nAccording to NBA.com, here are the players who are best in their own right:\n\nPG Kobe Bryant – 30.3 ppg, 9.7 apg, 47.5 effective field goal percentage 3.5 rpg, 8.0 steal pct, 2.9 spg, 1.6 bpg, 41.6 eFG percentage\n\nSG Steve Nash – 20.1 ppg, 7.1 apg, 1.5 spg, 5.8 rpg\n\nSF Xavier Munford – 19.7 ppg, 8.5 rpg\n\nPF Brandon Bass – 18.9 ppg, 15.9 rpg, 2.2 bpg, 3.6 apg, 1.5 spg, 1.2 spg\n\nC Jordan Hill – 13.6 ppg, 7.3 rpg\n\nSF Jordan Hill – 12.4 ppg, 5.3 rpg\n\nSG/SF Larry Nance Jr. – 6.6 ppg, 4.1 rpg, 1.5 apg\n\nWhile this was an exercise in looking specifically at teammates, it doesn't really matter that much as far as what you ultimately end up seeing on your fantasy basketball team.\n\nWith these guys on the court, the Lakers should be able to dominate. And to be clear, they are stacked. Of these five, only Nance doesn't really get the chance to play any position on a regular basis (Nance was the best athlete on the team but he was stuck behind Bryant.) This is one of the best group of players to date in terms of their ability to score. They are incredibly versatile and can be counted on to play together in a variety of ways on any given night.\n\nThese players make for quality backups. And of course, with Kobe as the leader, they could potentially be used as a starting unit. They can be extremely aggressive when the game plan doesn't go well and can make for high fantasy scores at times.\n\nIt's also important to understand that the Lakers have three first-round picks in 2019. These will definitely get used, and the two most talented players from their top-five picks (Okafor and Ingram) are already on team.\n\nThere is more upside to be had here than most people realize, and the best fantasy teams should include at least two of these top five players.",
      "\"I don't know,\" he said by phone. \"I guess I'll have to wait to see what happens.\"\n\nMr. Nye did not reply to further telephone messages or social media messages.\n\nAlthough the episode was an embarrassing public embarrassment for the Smithsonian, Ms. Mayne said there were other reasons why the exhibit may now be reconsidered.\n\nThere is no single explanation for the lack of dinosaurs. But Mr. DeMille told reporters Friday that his original vision for the collection — dinosaurs from a time of great diversity and upheaval — simply no longer fits the museum's priorities. \"I could not make a museum out of that one,\" he said. \"It has outlived its usefulness.\"\n\nEven without the dinosaurs, a museum curator, Susan Hendricks, was careful about describing the museum's vision for the exhibition.\n\nMs. Hendricks said that the decision to make the exhibit the centerpiece of an exhibit that includes a dinosaur skeleton and other exhibits had always been her choice. She added that the exhibit was made, in large part, to showcase the museum's research, its collections and its work with science and technology.\n\nThe museum's exhibits are also often meant to represent what the museum believes the world really looks like. \"As a place where people can go to get a deeper understanding of the science and technology that surrounds us daily, and to meet with experts in the field, our exhibitions reflect those core values,\" she said.\n\nMr. DeMille, who first conceived of the exhibit as the centerpiece of a new hotel and shopping center, said he had been told that the museum had no way to afford to build a replica dinosaurs exhibit.\n\nWhen the exhibit was first announced in 2014 he declined to speak about it. But this year he spoke, with Mrs. Smith attending in person. In a Facebook post on Feb. 6 he said the Smithsonian's \"stupid policies\" would not allow for his exhibit.",
      "In this series, I'll be taking a look at each of the top ten prospects with the Philadelphia Eagles for the 2016 NFL Draft. First, let me know if you'd like me to take a look at your top ten. I'm always open to suggestions from my readers.\n\nTop Draft Prospect: RB Darren Sproles\n\nAt 6-1, 208 pounds, Darren Sproles has impressive speed with the ability to turn on the jets and beat linebackers. He is also capable of catching and making things happen after the catch. In his seven games, Sproles has caught 25 passes for 341 yards.\n\nIf you're a Philadelphia Eagles fan who is struggling with the current state of the running game, I'd like to introduce you to one of the top players in the draft. If a team believes he will make an immediate positive impact, they will take Sproles in Round 1. I'm sure at least half of Philadelphia's offense is itching to go out on a limb and get their guy.\n\nWith the potential to make someone else's quarterback look like an enigma, Sproles can also change the game in a lot of different ways. The speed, quickness, and burst is why he's so dangerous. Sproles would also be an amazing complement to Ryan Mathews, who I expect Philadelphia to draft this year. Mathews ran for 1,681 yards last year. With the talent that the Eagles have in the backfield, Sproles could make the Eagles offense look that much more dangerous.\n\nBottom Line: Eagles fans love to debate who is the best player in the team's history, which is kind of silly when you consider how many great players the team has produced in the last 50 years. They still don't really know who is in the top spot on this list, so they're going to fight their rear ends off to try and get their guy this year, even if he's not the best player to ever wear an Eagles jersey.\n\nTop Draft Prospect: WR Breshad Perriman\n\nBreshad Perriman is one of the hottest receivers in college football. Perriman caught 68 passes for 1,621 yards last season and has the tools to be a good slot receiver for years to come. He's a good route runner with above average hands. He also has some punt return ability if he can get over the injury issues from his junior season.\n\nPerriman has just about everything you want in a slot WR. He's athletic with his speed, strength, and balance. He has great hands, good route runner, and speed as his best assets. He has the ability to make plays from anywhere on the field. The Eagles could use some help at slot receiver after losing Jeremy Maclin to free agency and DeSean Jackson to the Washington Redskins. Perriman will be able to fill that role and more with his speed.\n\nBottom Line: This isn't the first time Breshad Perriman is in the top ten. He's a high end slot WR that the Eagles would be foolish not to take in the first round if given the chance.",
      "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russia is that awkward moment with friends, when you look into the distance and think, but no one is there to see.\n\nThe Kremlin-dominated International Civil Service Union (ICSU) says the vast majority of its 1,000-odd employees are loyal to President Vladimir Putin and are loyal to Russia's government. But that may not be true.\n\nWith Putin fighting a campaign of accusations of corruption - part of a broader attempt by anti-Kremlin forces to destabilize his government - the union, in charge of recruiting new workers for state jobs, has been hit by falling recruitment.\n\nRussia's economy is suffering, its security and its image have been tarnished by the conflict in Ukraine as well as the Kremlin's own domestic critics, and the ICSU was seen as a check on corrupt practices by the president.\n\n\"It is an organisation that has become a 'safe space' for corruption. Those who don't agree with Putin could become targets,\" said Andrey Piontkovsky, an anti-corruption activist and lawyer.\n\n\"Even some of the members had a little bit of fear. It's been an interesting time, to say the least.\"\n\n'RISE FOR THE GREATER GOOD'\n\nRussia's economic and political crises made it more difficult for people on the frontline to remain loyal to the country's leadership, and some even tried to defect.\n\nThe ICSU says it is investigating more than 15,000 cases of internal embezzlement among its members since 2010 and has banned hundreds on charges of misconduct in public administration. It also says some 2,000 people have been dismissed for corruption.\n\n\"The Union cannot be accused of an attack on individual workers' rights. We are not trying to make anyone lose their jobs,\" the head of the union's disciplinary committee, Andrei Korotkov, told news agency Ria Novosti.\n\nThe president has also been cracking down on his enemies.\n\nAmong those dismissed and/or who have retired were Mikhail Klyankov, a close Putin ally and former head of the Federal Anti-Corruption Agency, and Sergei Yushenkov, a critic of corruption in Russia's state security services.\n\nBut the pressure on the union has become greater as the Kremlin has attempted to reduce its budget deficit.\n\nLast month the Kremlin approved a new law on the recruitment and firing of civil servants, which would allow the government to dismiss workers for 'serious misconduct' - a move that could include any criticism of President Putin.\n\nThat's allowed the state watchdog, the Federal Penitentiary Service, to issue \"administrative measures against offenders\" and give them a chance to appeal against their dismissal.\n\nSuch a measure could be abused by the Moscow city government.\n\n\"The new law on the application of administrative measures does not say that people can only be fired for crimes, but it leaves a possibility to use administrative measures for other reasons, which could include corruption,\" Mikhail Fomchenkov, head of the Penitentiary Service, said.\n\nThe union is still negotiating with the city to see if it will accept the decision to use an administrative measure against a senior executive of the city if he is convicted of a serious crime.\n\nMoscow would also be required to pay the individual's salary for a year, according to the agreement.\n\n'WITH BOTH FATHER AND SON'\n\nThe law would also allow the government to block the entry of anyone it considered an 'informant' and forbid foreign companies from working in the country - a move that would restrict opportunities for business for some of Russia's most successful companies, such as oil giant OAO Rosneft (ROSN.MM), energy producer Lukoil (LKOHG.MM) and technology firm Rusal (RSI.MC).\n\nBut it would also open the door to allowing foreign companies to set up new plants in Russia, something which President Dmitry Medvedev has long been encouraging.\n\n\"Most of the foreign firms are in talks to acquire factories. This would be a massive opportunity for foreign investors and it would reduce the current tax burden on Russian citizens,\" said Konstantin Fomchenkov, head of the federal department responsible for foreign investors.\n\nRussia's economy, which grew by an annual pace of 6.3 percent in the first quarter, is expected to post growth of just 2.7 percent this year. It will also face an overhang of debt - the total amount of state-backed loans in 2015 is expected to reach $2 trillion, according to a Reuters analysis.",
      "The Department of Homeland Security has \"unwavering\" support for its \"no fly\" list and is willing to accept the information in the list when citizens come to the attention of the FBI about the suspect's travel, a court judge ruled late on Thursday.\n\n\"No one should be on the no fly list,\" said Judge Anna Brown during the oral arguments before the 10th Circuit Court of Appeals, in Denver.\n\nBrown asked whether it was constitutionally permissible to add or remove people from the list based on their travel.\n\n\"No,\" US District Judge Ellen Huvelle told federal prosecutors representing the government of President Donald Trump.\n\nREAD MORE: No-fly list - The ACLU's battle (podcast)\n\nUnder the National Security Entry-Exit Registration System, which requires most foreigners without strong ties to the United States to undergo a full physical pat-down and submit to interrogations, most people on the no fly list are subject to the same procedures and interrogations, though the government makes additional procedures available for certain foreign nationals, including U.S. citizens.\n\n\"The no fly list is just an inconvenience for individuals. It has nothing to do with national security,\" said the judge. \"It's an administrative list.\"\n\nThe judge did not address whether the program was legal because it violates people's first amendment rights to freedom of religion and to free speech.\n\n\"It's like an airline boarding pass system, but with the government,\" said the ACLU's Hina Shamsi. \"No one should be subject to that.\"\n\nThe government says the list of roughly 200,000 names was originally kept secret from the public in an attempt to keep potential terrorists from flying. The DHS is attempting to have the names made public once all the cases have been resolved.\n\n\"Any person in this country who is suspected of terrorist activity is subject to full scrutiny because of the terrorist threat,\" Homeland Security Undersecretary Thomas W. Bossert, the point person on the system, said on the first day of litigation proceedings in April.\n\nThe no fly list includes more than 120,000 U.S. citizens.\n\nREAD MORE: No-fly list: US to 'reconsider' ban against travellers from six nations\n\nThe federal case was brought by the ACLU against the Department of Homeland Security, a case that is expected to be appealed on grounds that it violates the plaintiffs' equal protection rights under the law.\n\nJudge Brown will issue a written ruling by Friday afternoon.",

      "If you were to listen to President Trump on the telephone this Wednesday, you would likely think he was in a different universe than what most Americans hear from the commander-in-chief and his spokespeople — including at the most recent town hall in Iowa.\n\nIn his first-ever interview since the November election was over, Trump told Fox Business in a one on one that he thought Hillary Clinton had won the popular vote, and that while his campaign hadn't focused on the Electoral College when he won, he knew that would likely lead to a large margin.\n\n\"If you look at the popular vote, you have to look at the Electoral College. So what I've been saying is you have to look at both,\" he said.\n\nTrump made similar comments about electoral college wins at the town hall in Iowa last Saturday, and in his most recent media appearance earlier in October.\n\nTo back up Trump's claim that he lost the popular vote, Trump pointed to Clinton's margin over his opponent, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, while saying he lost the battleground states of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin.\n\n\"Her numbers would've been greater had I not gotten out and done what I had to do\" to lose the election, is Trump's explanation, which doesn't quite add up given his margin in the electoral college (9,748,304 to Clinton's 71,964,804)\n\n\"I think we would have won had I not gotten out — and she ended up winning the popular vote by a lot,\" he also said, which makes Trump's comments somewhat disingenuous. His margin of victory was about 2.8 million to Clinton's 1.5 million, but the state he won in the Electoral College — Michigan — is a state that went for Clinton by nearly 2 to 1 in the most recent presidential election.\n\nTrump's claim to have won the popular vote by the largest margin is also incorrect. According to the National Archives, more than 90% of the people who cast ballots in the 2008 presidential election were eligible to do so, and only 14.5% of the eligible voters in 2012 — or about 3 million people — actually voted.\n\nTrump also claimed he had more than 3 million votes more than Clinton, but it's not clear whether the president was referring to the margin of victory or the total votes cast, because a recent analysis by The Wall Street Journal showed that in California and New York, Trump actually had the lower number of votes cast for the national popular vote of around 1.5 million more.\n\nIt is, however, important to note that Trump and his spokespeople are now being pressured by some Democrats and some Trump-hating establishment Republicans to release their tax returns. In an interview with CBS on Monday, he said they wouldn't need to release them again until the end of the year, with his running mate, Mike Pence, telling NBC on Tuesday that Trump would release the tax returns if Clinton did as well.",
      "On the eve of a crucial meeting, it is feared at least 100 of those arrested are Syrian refugees, with families of Syrians making up the bulk of those facing deportation from the United Kingdom.\n\nThe figures were confirmed today in the House of Lords, where the Home Affairs Select Committee heard evidence from MPs and peers on how to deal with the crisis.\n\nCommittee Chairman Mike Gapes pointed out that Britain had an obligation to take in those fleeing conflict and persecution, but said that the impact was not being taken seriously.\n\n\"If you are a member of the British society you are entitled as a citizen to a system that is fair and impartial in its operation,\" Gapes said. \"This means it is wrong for individuals to be treated differently because of their nationality, such as being arrested and sent by the British authorities when there are none in detention cells.\n\n\"The Government is now actively seeking to prevent migrants from claiming asylum when in the United Kingdom. The evidence we heard today suggests the Government is failing.\"\n\nMPs were told there was no evidence that migrants are using the Border Agency to escape persecution in their home countries. Instead, they were going to the North of England to claim benefits and work and then returning to Syria with their children, leading to fears that they will face persecution when they return to their homes outside of Syria.\n\nThe number of asylum seekers who were arrested on Friday and deported back to Syria from the UK will \"far exceed\" the 50 who had their applications processed by Border Agency staff by the end of June. They were arrested on Friday night, just hours after the UN had raised concerns about the situation of Syrian refugees in the United Kingdom.\n\nIn the Commons today, Labour members of the committee, led by shadow Home Secretary Yvette Cooper and shadow Lord Mayor of London Sadiq Khan, said that Syrians and Afghans were particularly at risk of deportation because of the Government's policies in the Middle East, leading to fears for their safety in the UK after they are released from detention.\n\nThe home secretary, Theresa May, has said the UK would only take in a small number of Middle Eastern and African refugees, but not Syrians as they faced more severe persecution by Bashar Assad and his family members. She said she was \"concerned\" by allegations of torture at the hands of Assad's forces, but stopped short of saying all Syrian refugees were at risk of persecution.\n\nShe told MPs on Monday that the UK could not simply close our borders to people fleeing the Middle East, but must \"deal with the issue\".\n\nThe Committee also heard that up to 9,000 people living in Britain who had overstayed their visas could be deported to the Middle East or the Caribbean if their refugee cases were successful - although the Home Office had told MPs it had \"no intention\" to take such a large number of asylum seekers to deport them.\n\nHome affairs committee deputy chairman Baroness Jones of Oldham revealed that a Home Office pilot scheme allowing asylum seekers to apply for family reunion as family members had been abandoned last year because there were not enough family members to consider the applications.\n\n\"I also understand that the pilot's decision-makers have been forced to stop applying at this stage because they are not able to assess the number of relatives each one would get. If there are not enough such relatives, people who did not apply will be subject to removal.\"\n\nThe Syrian case officer who presented evidence to the committee revealed that around 12,000 Syrian refugees would be arriving from Jordan by the end of 2015, and the number was likely to double over the next three years.\n\nSpeaking to MPs, Lord Dubs, the former Lord Chancellor of England and Wales, said Britain could expect thousands of people on asylum seeker visas to arrive back in Syria as early as the second week of this week.",
      "Hannah Foslien/Getty Images\n\nThe University of Florida is the \"first in line\" for a new Florida football stadium, according to a report Wednesday from the St. Petersburg Times. The report states that the Gator Network will be the primary TV outlet for the stadium, as it would be in any location in the Sunshine State.\n\nThe Times quoted a source that claimed that \"UF officials and their television partners have been discussing the possibility of a stadium in St. Petersburg for about six months.\"\n\nThe report went beyond the notion of the Gators adding a football stadium in the Tampa area, noting that any move up to a college football stadium in Florida would likely be a multi-million dollar investment.\n\n\"The university's budget for a football stadium in St. Pete is estimated at $350 million to $500 million, and that price would be covered by the university and its TV partners,\" the report states. \"The stadium would require a roof, but no significant costs are considered for those other features, because the university has not determined those, according to multiple people familiar with the project.\"\n\nFremantleMedia and VisitFlorida.com are the primary partners for the Gator Network as a cable television outlet. Currently the Gator Network airs on ESPN and ABC in the state of Florida. It currently airs on SEC Network in addition to other national partners such as CBS Sports Network, as well as FOX College Sports and SportsNet One.\n\nA proposed renovation of Florida Sports Park is currently underway in the area of the stadium. An updated $125 million update plan for the stadium was put forth by the State of Florida in December 2012. If the expansion plan is approved, the estimated cost could exceed $1.2 billion.\n\nThe site could receive a future NFL stadium for expansion. The City of South Florida could receive an NFL franchise for that city as well, though neither party has made any major moves in that direction.\n\nAs of now the plan is for the current stadium to be kept, but a new, upgraded facility is projected to be ready for the 2018 opener as an expanded, retractable roof could be added.\n\nThe Times also reported that the school is in the process of developing its new facility by making changes to the current stadium.

      "We live in an age when we are surrounded as never before by so many choices and, even more, opportunities. It is often said that \"the marketplace is broken\"; we find it difficult to select the best product or service we could find without getting a bit over-optimistic about the quality and uniqueness of our choice. And it's not only our own choices that are influenced by the choices of others; we all take on the appearance of being swayed by the choices of others. As a result, we are no better than those who surround us; there's no reason to assume that what we are seeing is the entirety of the market and the choices of others. Indeed, it can be argued that we are being deceived—we are actually seeing only a portion of the market and all the choices of others (and of themselves) are actually the ones that make \"good sense\" from our point of view. In this post, we shall see that there is a great opportunity to rethink the way we think about market dynamics, and that's because these dynamics have been profoundly misunderstood by modern economists (and even by a few classical liberals).\n\nThe basic premise of market dynamics is that when two parties want some good, they can agree to exchange it in a way that leads to it. The exchange of good is the exchange of goods, and good, as we have seen, is something that can be exchanged for other goods. This is what economists refer to as \"money\". If two parties agree to trade some good in exchange for another good, then they have exchanged goods. But it is not always the case that one of the parties, the one that receives the good, agrees to this exchange (the receiver). And if he does not agree, then they are just having a barter exchange, and it is not a transaction between two parties. (You have some gold from which you make exchange with someone else because you need some of the other guy's silver.)\n\nA barter exchange is an exchange where neither party, the buyer or the seller, wants to have the goods in question in their possession for long periods of time. For example, you sell your house to a buyer who is willing to buy only until the buyer's income becomes large enough in order to buy you out. But if you sell the house in the market to someone else, then you do not want it for more than a certain period of time. There is the usual exchange of \"goods\"—the goods that one person will exchange for another.\n\nBarter exchanges are also called \"involuntary\" or \"purely voluntary\" exchanges, because what ends up happening is that neither party has accepted the goods that the other party has offered. The seller is the only one who has accepted the goods in exchange for his own services, whereas the buyer has accepted the goods only because it was the buyer's choice that they be bought.\n\nThis brings us back to the basic premise of market dynamics—two parties cannot agree to an exchange unless they want it to be done. A voluntary exchange involves one of the participants intending to accept the goods in exchange for a certain period of time with no intention of holding the goods for a long period of time either.\n\nAnd the problem for the classical economists is that, in all their models, they have assumed that one can always get the goods to be bought by the other party, and have assumed that, for any good, one party can only \"give in\" to the other party. In real life, of course, people often don't want this. Indeed, in many cases people want more than the goods in question. So, in real life, voluntary exchanges are much more common than classical economists would like to admit. What's more, market dynamics often allows for these voluntary exchanges to take place even if that means, or might imply, that people receive goods with which they are not happy. Consider, for example, a situation where the buyer intends to accept the goods but finds himself unwilling to accept the goods in exchange for the house he is purchasing. In such a situation, neither part of the transaction is an exchange between parties. It is instead a voluntary, or exchange of one good for another.\n\nMarket dynamics, as we have seen, leads to an increased number of voluntary exchanges. The key question that remains to be addressed, however, concerns whether the number of voluntary exchanges depends on whether people have a sufficient number of resources to acquire goods before they will take those goods in an exchange.\n\nOf course, there is no simple measure to this—it is something that depends on many things. But the key point here is to acknowledge that it is possible for, say, a family of four who has only one income to live on a dollar a day (or that some people might have to live on very small incomes in order to support a family of 10 members).\n\nIt may be then that, just as in the classical world of barter exchanges, some people might end up living better than others by being able",

      "If I'm being completely honest, I am not even sure why I chose to do this. I have no interest in any other F2P titles, and I hate spending money on games I don't want.\n\nSo why did I want to do this? Well, we've seen some pretty interesting things with F2P in general, as well as a few F2P titles that work well. It would be great to know if a game that would be a good candidate for F2P would have the necessary ingredients to succeed with their business model.\n\nI also wondered: Will this help me get into other games? A lot of people don't have a good grasp of what a F2P game is or how it works -- if I could help some of you get into games, that might be a wonderful thing.\n\nTo that end, I decided to start with a game that has had me engaged for days, weeks, and months. I have a lot of friends who have some good ideas for games that I could consider looking at. Since so many of you like Zelda, the game that is best known as F2P, here's a quick review of how I feel about The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds. If you're not familiar with Zelda, it's an extremely popular series that features some of my favorite games and characters.\n\nThis game is a little different from the Zelda I've played for years. It was a bit of a journey in its own right, and you could certainly see the influence of Link Between Worlds on Legend of Zelda: Hyrule Warriors, but I'm going to focus really just on what it does well. Here are my key things to keep in mind as I put this review together.\n\nIt was fun\n\nI've played games (and other media) all my life, whether they be movies, books, TV, or even music, but with The Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds, I really didn't recognize many games I'm familiar with. Link Between Worlds is a game that requires you to navigate the same areas over and over again, but it has a very interesting story, fun dialogue, fun mechanics, and beautiful art that make you care about what happens next. It doesn't have to be a game that's very good for most people, but it has some things that are special that makes it worth your time.\n\nThe world is gorgeous\n\nThe Legend of Zelda: A Link Between Worlds is a beautiful game, and that comes across in the gorgeous art that is used to represent the entire game world. It was difficult to stop looking at the art for hours! I'm sure that the new screenshots look different, and it's important to recognize that when you're looking at the graphics. For the rest of this review, I'm going to put more emphasis on the good side of the game, as those two will be similar to what I described in the previous paragraph.\n\nThe music is different\n\nThis is something I haven't talked about, but it's something unique to Link Between Worlds. Link Between Worlds follows the Link Between Worlds timeline, and it has a variety of different music tracks from the game that are not in the standard Link Between Worlds soundtrack. This could seem strange to some Zelda fans, since their favorites in Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask are included in the Standard Link Between Worlds tracks. However, if you listen to the two tracks below, you can see how Link Between Worlds is a game with a huge difference between the Ocarina of Time and Majora's Mask soundtracks. Even the same instrument was used to create those two versions of music!\n\nOne of my favorite moments in Link Between Worlds was the ending. What made that moment unforgettable was the music that was used for it. All the different instruments and different parts used to create the music is something I didn't ever imagine would happen to The Legend of Zelda.\n\nSo, where do I give it a 9 out of 10? I'm going to take a pass on that, since there are a few aspects of the game that I absolutely hated.\n\nBut maybe there is something to be had by playing this one. You should consider checking out Link Between Worlds!",

Here I'm mounting the SD card as /mnt and using that directory to store the image.\n\nsudo mount -o loop /mnt/raspberry_pi/raspberry_pi-2016.02-03.img /mnt\n\nNext, we need to install the image.\n\nsudo apt-get update sudo apt-get install raspberrypi-kernel-headers ./boot\n\nWe also need to generate a config file which will tell the Raspberry Pi what to do when it boots up.\n\nmkdir -p /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg nano -w /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg\n\nTo make our config file, we need to tell it what we're going to do with our Raspberry Pi. We've configured the Raspberry Pi before so we don't need to tell it what to do, we're going to create a .txt file here which will be our console file which is used to input commands.\n\necho 'mem = 1024M' >> /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg\n\necho 'memsize = 2048M' >> /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg\n\necho 'cpufreq_scaling = 1' >> /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg\n\nThat last bit of config needs to be changed now and we're telling it to use a value of 1. If you want to use a higher value and you know in advance what it will be, put an \"=\" sign before it.\n\ncpufreq_scaling = 1\n\nThis config file will now be overwritten during the boot process and every time that you reboot the Raspberry Pi.\n\nNow we need to install our tools so that we can run commands with the console file.\n\nsudo gem install wget unzip\n\nOur unzipping program is now installed. We can now set up our wget script to download the img file which the RPi will use as its boot cdrom.\n\nsudo gem install gem3wget\n\nAnd then we can configure the wget script to use the img-file as it's boot cdrom.\n\nsudo wget http://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/2016-02-03/raspbian-disk-full.img -O /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg\n\nNow we can run it by typing:\n\nsudo gem3wget -O /opt/raspberrypi/raspian-disk.cfg /mnt",
      "The Obama administration announced Monday it was rescinding a federal requirement that employers with more than 50 employees provide insurance that covers maternity care, and that they start offering it to workers in January 2013. The contraception mandate, which had been blocked for three years, was not expected to affect the health insurance plans of most women; but it did affect large businesses that employ lots of people, such as retail stores and banks. It also means that even the plans that don't have any contraceptive coverage will likely cost more for women than before.\n\nThe decision is likely to make it harder for companies to offer health insurance that covers contraception. In most states, there aren't any plans that cover contraception, so if any woman goes private, she must pay for it out of her own pocket. There are two basic options – the free plans that allow you to buy pills over-the-counter and pills purchased directly from your doctor's office. Both have a lower copayment and are better for some women -- but if you go without them, you must pay a fine of $250 to the government, and the extra cost of this copeny can wipe out a lot of the advantage the insurance plans have against having no contraception coverage.\n\nIt's not just the women who will be hurt by these moves. For the companies offering the plans, women who want to be covered must now have copays and some extra costs. So for the very large companies the Obama administration is working with, who have at least 50 employees, it does not seem very likely that they will find insurers that will pay enough of the bill without the extra expense. They will probably end up having to give that money back to employees, who are likely to end up paying a whole lot more for less coverage.\n\nIn the new press release explaining the decision, the White House cited a report by the Department of Health and Human Services claiming that the birth-control benefit might prevent 10,000 unintended pregnancies in 2013, compared to 20,000 expected because of the lack of coverage. But those are just the anticipated pregnancies. What about the women who have already gotten pregnant? And what about the families who will be paying for the birth-control coverage out of taxes?\n\nThe Obama administration is trying to claim this isn't really a decision to provide more contraceptive coverage. Obama said this was a decision to \"ensure that women's health rights continue to be protected throughout the country.\" But the press release said that the \"Department of Health and Human Services issued a new regulation on Monday allowing businesses to offer additional insurance coverage of preventive services without the requirement for co-pays or deductible.\" That sounds more like a policy directive, not a decision to provide more contraceptive coverage.\n\nThe White House itself said this decision could cost the government $3 billion, not counting any women who would have to pay more out of pocket to get the free plans. The $3 billion figure would be less than half of one percent of the $3.6 trillion the government spends every year in tax dollars on health care services. It's a drop in the bucket, but it's a good reminder that the government's health care spending is not the largest single chunk of our economy. This means that while this decision is a big deal nationally, it's not the biggest deal that health care does. It will be interesting to see whether some of the larger corporations continue to offer free contraceptive coverage under their own health insurance plans, or whether they look to provide contraceptive coverage to their employees by paying the premium.",
      "The New York Police Department and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) are investigating a breach at the United States Border Patrol's Fort Peck, Kansas, headquarters which appears to have resulted in the unauthorized disclosure of several hundred pages of information about agents and informants.\n\n\"The Border Patrol has no indication that the information provided to unauthorized users was classified,\" US Border Patrol Chief Ron Vitiello told Breitbart News in a statement. \"Based on initial investigation, we believe it was uploaded to a web site by a Border Patrol employee who mistakenly left the password on a terminal.\"\n\nIn a statement, National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) President Mark Morgan said that the breach was \"beyond disappointing\" and called on the White House to \"conduct real investigation\" into the incident. \"The fact is that Border Patrol agents cannot protect American communities and American jobs without a strong partnership with local government,\" Morgan said.\n\nThe breach occurred at the National Training Center (NTC) on March 11. According to Morgan, the breach resulted from an employee of the NTC sharing a password online that gave access to at least five external sites connected to the Department of Homeland Security's Office of Intelligence and Analysis (OIA).\n\nOIA Deputy Chief Mark Morgan said the breach appeared to have been inadvertent, adding: \"The fact is that OIA works closely and cooperates with Border Patrol when it comes to intelligence and analysis. That's why it's so disappointing … We're working on making sure we have an investigation into this.\"\n\nThe documents — which include a copy of the US Constitution and copies of a list of current and potential informants — were not classified documents or sensitive intelligence, according to Morgan.\n\n\"It's a mix of classified and unclassified,\" Morgan explained. \"It's not at all classified. Some of these documents are for agents. There's other documents that are not for agents specifically, but they have access to classified information when it comes to the border.\"\n\nThe breach appears to have affected several hundred pages of information, Morgan said. \"It sounds like someone probably logged in and accidentally got access to some of the OIA website,\" Morgan said, adding, \"We're talking about a handful of people.\"\n\nMorgan said the documents were uploaded to the NTC's main web site and not by an individual employee.\n\n\"It doesn't sound like any one person had access to it,\" Morgan said, adding that the agency is cooperating with Homeland Security's OIA investigation. \"Our OIA team is very aware of the Border Patrol's efforts, especially in terms of the ongoing partnership with the National Border Patrol Council and National Border Patrol Forum.\"\n\nAs the news of the breach has spread, the NBPC has been inundated with calls from Border Patrol agents, many of whom are dismayed, but unsure who to contact. \"I just got a text from an agent who was talking to a supervisor,\" Morgan said of one agent. \"They got their information back … All I know is they're angry and confused and are asking questions.\"\n\nThe leaked information included information about current agents, as well as current and former agents who have moved or retired since 2013. A list of former and current agents who appear to have been targeted or involved in past insider threat investigations also emerged Wednesday. (See below.)\n\nThe border agency is \"very concerned\" about the breach, according to Morgan. \"DHS can provide assistance with information about the breach at NTC,\" he said. \"We are still investigating the matter and looking for a common thread that could tie this incident together with others that are going on throughout the border.\"\n\nMorgan said the NBPC is working with DHS and other agencies to track and investigate the breach. \"We're getting calls daily from agents about what happened,\" he said. \"They're frustrated with this because Border Patrol deserves to have access to all of the information it needs to perform its mission and protect the homeland.\"\n\nDespite the breach, Morgan said Border Patrol agents \"remain the most dangerous people on the border. It's a very sensitive profession and we take it extremely seriously.\"\n\nBorder Patrol officials said they expect the breach will lead to a \"citizen-led, independent, investigative review\" of the incident. \"The FBI will work with Border Patrol and OIA to identify who may have been responsible and how the information was obtained,\" Morgan said.\n\nMorgan pointed to several reasons for the breach in a statement: \"The Border Patrol needs to make a seamless transition from an era of internal IT to a world of digital and digital information,\" he said. \"In the past, our employees had access to classified information through a classified website accessed through the [DHS] OIA. This system was outdated and the password was not reset since the site was only accessible through the [DHS] Web page on the Border Patrol's OIA website.\"\n\nMorgan said the Border Patrol \"is working with [the Office of Inspector General] to create and implement",

      "Barry Diller, chairman and CEO of IAC, spoke with Variety on the future of his media company, which includes NBCUniversal and CNN, in a wide-ranging conversation, in which he discussed the changing landscape of media, digital content, and his future plans — but also talked a little more frankly about politics.\n\nDiller also called out the hypocrisy of many people in the media for opposing President Donald Trump's agenda while calling for Hillary Clinton's administration to be investigated for potential wrongdoing.\n\nWhat would you say to the many journalists and media executives who've criticized Trump and his administration for its alleged ties to Russia, and then said you supported their decisions to investigate Hillary Clinton?\n\n\"What I said and what President Trump said, it's the way the world is going. This is not the way it used to be in a few years ago… And if there were some Russian ties to Hillary Clinton, I would be concerned about it. But it doesn't seem to be to this day. But as I say, I think there's too much paranoia around it. And you know it or not, most people, all kinds of people in this country have an opinion about Hillary Clinton in all kinds of ways.

What can the new media industry offer the public that the old media can't?\n\n\"Well, I think there's a bunch. I think you're going to see in television a different approach from what many people have been doing over the last, say, 20 to 30 years. One of the things I think the internet has made possible is a real ability for people to make their own experiences available to people in this country. TV can be much cooler.\n\n\"There's something amazing about TV, but some people are getting to the point where they say, 'Hey, I've seen 20 or 30 times as much this summer on TV as I've seen in the last four years.'

I'm not saying that's a good thing, but you're going to have more stuff that is that than ever before.\"",
      "A group of researchers led by Professor John McGlashan of the University of Edinburgh has published an innovative study that challenges the common belief that men and women's brains differ when it comes to intelligence.\n\nIn their paper, Men's and Women's Unique Contributions to General Intelligence (2017), McGlashan and his colleagues take issue with the view that there is a difference both between the genders when it comes to how much a person is able to do: men tend to outperform women relative to other people, and men's intelligence is usually higher overall than women's. If there is a real difference the researchers state, it should not be present between men and women, but rather at the individual level, and that is what they have found.\n\nThe work was carried out by an international team of researchers from the University of Edinburgh and the University of California, Davis, led by Professor John McGlashan.\n\nThe researchers have carried out their research to better understand the origins and causes of the gender gap in brain size for the first time. They found that there was no difference in overall brain size across the three genders. However, in the study, a group of women consistently outperformed men across many different tasks, such as number combing, memory speed and reaction time, as well as spatial ability.\n\nThe researchers also discovered that the difference between men and women in general level of 'mental flexibility' is very small, however there were some differences when it comes to spatial tasks. More women were better in spatial tasks, such as tracing the outline of an object, than men and this was associated with greater neural activation. The authors highlight that a large proportion of the sex difference in cognition relates to the male's greater propensity for complex problem solving and this is more pronounced with tasks in which women traditionally have better spatial abilities.\n\nOn a broader level the research suggests that both men and women differ on the basis of gender differences in brain size. In terms of general mental flexibility, the authors write that \"there was no difference in men and Women's mental flexibility.\" However, to demonstrate the point further the researchers tested their hypothesis further – to see if there was a gender difference in cognitive capacity that would provide some evidence for the authors' hypothesis. In particular, the authors measured general mental flexibility (for men) and spatial ability (for women) in relation to the brain size of women and men.\n\nThe results showed that both men and women with larger brains performed better on general cognitive and spatial ability tasks than women with smaller brains. In order to fully demonstrate the effect that brain size had in these tasks, the authors measured a large body of data across both sexes. The results revealed that in many instances, larger female brains were better for these tasks.\n\nThese data suggest that women are better at complex problem solving and problem solving with many variables and that this can be better understood. This does not mean that women will be better in STEM fields; in fact, there will often be differences across different areas in terms of sex in the STEM fields but in general these should be explained by biological differences.\n\nDespite the many challenges associated with the study there do appear to be similarities between men and women at the individual level. Men with larger brains did outperform women with smaller brains on several tasks and this was associated with increased neural activation in their brains. In short, men's brains were faster, better-suited for problem solving and more adaptable.\n\nHowever, it is the large number of correlations between a person's brain size and specific cognitive abilities that provide the strongest support to the hypotheses made by the authors. A small difference such as the difference in brain size between men and women appears to provide no statistically significant evidence for the idea that there is a difference between the sexes. These are the sort of results that are best learned by considering how a person's brain is structured in detail.\n\nIn the future future we will be able to compare people's brains from very old patients to find out which brain structure determines which cognitive ability. However, to do that is not really feasible so it will be important for people to continue to challenge the popular opinion that men and women are inherently different in many cognitive tasks.",
      "Ruth Bader Ginsburg, 83, is still the voice of reason in the US—and maybe the world.\n\nThe 83-year-old justice, the longest-serving living member on the Supreme Court, has been nominated to the high court by Donald Trump. She is currently a justice on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. And she's still kicking.\n\nIt's just the latest sign of her remarkable longevity.\n\nGinsburg has been on the high court for more than a half-century. (Her full name is Ruth Bader Ginsburg.) That doesn't mean she's not the judicial equivalent of, say, a supermodel—that women on the bench still have to contend with sexism.\n\nIn a 2013 interview with New York, Ginsburg recalled that when she first took the bench on the court, she was criticized for not knowing a lot about the law.\n\n\"They didn't like me because I came in with a bunch of credentials,\" she said.\n\nGinsburg is no stranger to sexism. Her early years on the court were tough, too, and she suffered from what she called \"very serious bouts of depression.\"\n\nHer own mother had died when she was in her teens, and her father was a broken man and drug addict. In a New York Magazine interview she recalls that she took \"a look in the mirror at the age of 15, and my own reflection said, 'You've got to get on with your life.'\"\n\nHer marriage to Justice William Brennan went badly, too—but Ginsburg still managed to stay married to her first husband. She told NPR last year, \"I do have a sense of responsibility that I have an obligation to be there for them. And that can be an awful burden.\"\n\nGinsburg still teaches a law course at Columbia, and says she's been known to have students \"come running through the door with a question or a comment about the way I look or the way I speak.\"\n\nIn the interview with NPR, she compared the challenges of teaching at Columbia to being a lawyer.\n\n\"I take it as a kind of challenge like, how am I going to make a living?\" she said. \"This is why in Columbia I teach. You know, it's an adjunct position.\"\n\nGinsburg says that if and when she gets to the high court, she'll be on the left.\n\n\"So it doesn't give me any pleasure to hear someone else—and it's usually a conservative—saying that I'm a radical,\" she says. \"It doesn't give me any pleasure to hear a colleague say that I'm a liberal because I think there should be a difference between the courts of law and the courts of politics.\"\n\nFollow Max Rivlin-Nadler on Twitter.",
      "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Three Russian fighter jets flew within two miles of an American spy plane in international airspace over the Baltic Sea on Thursday, a Russian military spokesman said, a violation of treaty rules.\n\nThe Russian Su-24 fighter jet, escorted by two Su-27 jets, circled the U.S. RC-135 reconnaissance plane off the Estonian coast for 45 minutes before turning off in the closest direction and passing close by twice, Lieutenant Colonel Oleg Petrov said in an internet post.\n\nNATO said it was seeking to determine the details of the intercept and said the Pentagon would evaluate whether Moscow had breached the 1987 flight agreement.\n\nNATO's secretary general, Jens Stoltenberg, called the intercept unacceptable, while the Kremlin said it was a routine activity by both sides.\n\nThe Russian Air Force has regularly violated U.S. airspace in recent years, but in recent years has largely followed the so-called \"red line\" against an aerial attack on a NATO member - which has been largely in Syria and Iraq.\n\nOn Tuesday, the U.S. Air Force scrambled two fighter jets to intercept a Russian military jet that was flying in international airspace over the Sea of Okhotsk and headed northeast toward Alaska.\n\nRussian media said the intercept of the RC-135 aircraft, also an RC-135 with a \"flag of unknown origin\", happened on Wednesday, but NATO said Russia's Defence Ministry told it Moscow had issued no such warnings.\n\nThe United States, which regularly flies reconnaissance missions over the Baltic Sea and other parts of Europe, has a long-standing agreement to conduct overflights and intercepts with Russian planes along its eastern frontier. The military alliance on Thursday warned that any violations of the flight rules could lead to serious consequences.\n\nRussian aircraft have also breached the \"no-fly area\" over Syria. A British pilot said in October that he had been thrown out of his plane after his plane was briefly captured by several fighter jets in the skies off the Syrian coast.",

He is said to be attacking anyone suspected of being an Outsider. As you reach Whiterun, you meet Aela the Huntress, who is investigating the attacks against non-Nords.\n\nAela tells you she will head out and find the Nords. When you ask why, she tells you that Falskaar is apparently targeting Outsiders to collect their blood, and if the Outsiders are not killed by the time she reaches Whiterun, the demon will return again, and again, until it is completely finished killing them. She thinks the city is too far away from the demon to do any good. If you refuse, she tells you the demon is very close by.\n\nAela leads you to Njada's house, where you can meet her in her office. She tells you that she is going to find Njada Incandenza and protect him. As you approach Njada's mansion, Aela will call out to you, asking \"Where's my man?\"\n\nHeading to the Sanctuary of Stendarr [ edit ]\n\nWhen you arrive at Stendarr's Sanctuary, you may encounter Njada in the courtyard. If you want to save Falskaar, you have to save his life. If you try to kill him, however, the demons will arrive. They will chase Njada to the bottom of the stairs, and then you have the choice to either wait, fight, or run and let the demons chase him. If you flee, you will lose your progress; if you fight, you will have to wait for your demon to return, and they will remain. When they get to the top of the stairs, you will fight all the demons at once, and a cutscene will show you their deaths. If you run, you will still have to fight, except that you don't have to wait around for the demons.\n\nAfter you've fought the demon, you will be able to go back to Whiterun and kill him. If you've killed him, you now have to find your way back to Stendarr's Sanctuary via the sewers.\n\nFinding Stendarr's Sanctuary\n\nBefore you get started, you will learn of a way to find Stendarr's Sanctuary, which is not marked on your map. Travel to the entrance of The Rift, which you can find just south of Winterhold. In the first area you will find Falskaar's corpse, along with a couple of his demons. The second area is to the southeast, where the two skeletons and one demon are also found, and you encounter Njada as well. There are only two ways to go, both of which will only take you as far as this area. The one to the southeast gives faster travel (and the quest you wish to complete), but makes the quest Unusual Symbols considerably harder. The route to the northwest takes much longer if you attempt it at your own pace, and is also full of difficult-to-defeat monsters, including two unique variants of the unique Dremora. The way to get to the northwest will take you around the whole map, with a possible stop at both Helgen and Morthal, and it is likely you will need to do all around the map to get to Stendarr's Sanctuary, as the route to the northwest is very difficult. It is recommended that you wait at Stendarr's Sanctuary until the quest Unusual Symbols has been completed before moving to the northwest.\n\nOnce inside the house, you may hear a conversation between Aela, Njada and a ghostly woman named Aela the Huntress. When you are about to enter, the ghostly Aela attacks you and you will have to fight her. You may kill her after she's dead, but you cannot loot her",
      "It can make you feel more like a man and help you maintain a healthy weight as well, but an increased testosterone level may not only reduce your risk of some cancers, it could also help you fight the common cold.\n\nA recently published analysis of data from the Women's Health Initiative, a large-scale study that followed the health of more than 80,000 women, found that women who had higher testosterone levels had a 45 percent reduction in serious colds, compared to women with lower levels.\n\nAnd the benefits didn't stop at preventing mild colds: When the researchers compared men who had higher levels with men with lower levels, the women who had both the highest and lowest levels found their colds to be less severe.\n\n\"That's a pretty substantial reduction in severity,\" says Dr. Jennifer Kuk, an internal medicine specialist at the VA Connecticut Healthcare System and lead author of the analysis.\n\nThe analysis was published August 9 in the Annals of Internal Medicine. It looked at more than 7,000 female participants, and compared how frequently participants had colds and how well the colds were controlled. Women with lower testosterone levels experienced lower-grade colds, meaning people were more likely to have a bad headache and to feel very tired afterward. Participants in the highest quintile of testosterone got three times as many colds as those in the lowest quintile, and were almost twice as likely to take medication to treat them.\n\nThe new findings \"tend to suggest that there are additional benefits of increasing testosterone levels,\" says Dr. Joseph Firth, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Missouri-Kansas City and an expert on hormonal therapy. But he cautions that the results need to be replicated in a larger population of women.\n\nThere's more research to be done to know what exactly is causing lower testosterone levels and whether it relates to other conditions, such as hypertension, depression, anxiety and diabetes, the researchers say. But early signs suggest that testosterone may be playing a role. Kuk and colleagues found that among participants with lower testosterone levels, the more often they slept, exercised or used antidepressants, the less often they had any severe colds over a four-week period.\n\nIn a follow-up study, Kuk found that among participants who reported using any of those supplements, those who reported taking it three or more times a day had a 50 percent reduction in severe colds.\n\nThe Women's Health Initiative was a long-term effort to understand the effects of estrogen, progestin and testosterone on overall health. The study enrolled more than 80,000 women aged between 35 and 55 at three major U.S. medical centers from 1992 through 2005. All participants had been screened for heart disease and a range of other conditions, and the average person in the study period weighed roughly 160 pounds.\n\nParticipants stayed closely watched in the years before the study, and at regular intervals for six years to assess symptoms, and were asked to report any cold-like symptoms each month. The investigators also tested hormone levels in people in the same age range.\n\nThe investigators found that the high-testosterone group got fewer colds than the low-testosterone group, although that difference was not statistically significant, Kuk says. She notes that most participants in the high-testosterone group also reported having more healthy lifestyles. That may have helped prevent the severity of their colds, she says.\n\nKUK and her colleagues were surprised to find that the high-testosterone group was more likely to engage in other healthy behaviors than the low-testosterone group, such as taking an antidepressant or wearing sunglasses or other protective clothing. The high-testosterone group also reported significantly more energy and social interaction compared to the low-testosterone group. \"They have energy and so do many other things. And that appears to make a difference,\" she says. And she adds that, after the end of the study, participants reported feeling more energetic in the mornings after they had taken their antidepressant or wore sunscreen.\n\nStill, the benefits of taking more testosterone are not all that surprising for men, says Firth, a cardiologist at the University of Washington School of Medicine, who was not involved in the analysis.\n\n\"I've also given testosterone injections to men for decades,\" he says. They often improve cardiovascular functioning and other cardiovascular risk factors. And other men have also found that taking testosterone therapy can prevent colds. \"It's the same kind of hormone that stimulates a guy's sexual desire,\" he says. \"Some men may also think it works better than regular cold medicine.\"\n\nThe findings also give new hope to clinicians who prescribe hormone therapy to men, says Dr. Robert W. Smith, a senior scientist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle who did not work on the analysis. It's usually difficult, he says, for clinicians to know whether hormone management works, but for older men who have lost vision or hearing, he adds, his colleagues have used similar",
      "As the Obama administration and the Congress work on health-disparity legislation in the coming months, they want to make it clearer that the money spent on health-care reform, including the cost of subsidies, will be used to provide coverage for everybody. That's a big change from the current law.\n\nBut with the U.S. Supreme Court set to decide whether the health-care law includes an individual mandate that people meet \"minimum eligibility\" standards -- and a federal judge in Philadelphia on Tuesday blocked one provision of the law that would limit federal funds to Medicaid-eligible groups until he rules whether the mandate is constitutional -- what will the new law say about subsidies? Does the IRS have authority to withhold funds from anyone who is not covered?\n\nHere's everything you need to know.\n\nHow will the Obamacare subsidies work?\n\nThe subsidies -- $100 for a family of four and $75 for a person making less than 500 percent of the poverty level -- are optional and they're available regardless of whether an insurance plan accepts federal subsidies. There are also subsidies for smaller employers that don't offer health insurance and subsidies for those covered by other programs.\n\nThe federal Affordable Care Act says tax-credit subsidies will be payable through an employer-based plan, but it won't specify what plans must accept federal credits.\n\nThe law also doesn't specify exactly how to determine who is and isn't eligible for the tax subsidies. And that's where the questions become murky.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court will likely have to decide whether Obamacare, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance, violates the Constitution's \"equal protection\" clause that guarantees everyone equal access to \"benefits, facilities and privileges of life to which they are entitled.\" And that is likely where the IRS comes in.\n\nDoes the IRS have the power to withhold funds?\n\nIf the court upholds the Obamacare subsidies provision in the Obama administration's case against Texas, they could be worth more than $6 billion.\n\nAnd if the court rules against the Obama administration, or even leaves some doubt on the tax subsidies' constitutionality, that could lead to even greater consequences, such as millions of people losing plans that provide tax credits.\n\nHow do all of these things link together?\n\nIf the law is upheld, it could mean that Americans would lose the subsidies they use to purchase insurance on state-based exchanges, such as the state-based HealthCare.gov website where thousands are seeking help shopping for coverage, or on the newly created federal exchange, Healthcare.gov.\n\nAnd if the Supreme Court upholds Obamacare, some people could be ineligible when they qualify for subsidies because they are not covered under the law, according to critics.\n\nBut if the subsidies aren't available, the IRS has a \"robust authority\" to pull funds from people who are not covered, according to the Tax Policy Center (which isn't affiliated with the Republican or Democratic parties), because the law requires them to accept credits. Those credits are awarded as a refund to anyone who has not bought coverage.\n\n\"If you're not on the exchange, you're not eligible for the subsidies,\" said Steve Bell, chief executive of Families USA. As a result, Bell said, \"people who have to buy coverage on the exchange and pay a penalty could find themselves paying back taxes or penalties.\"\n\n\"It might not sound like a big problem, but there are families that could end up with a penalty if they miss a payment,\" Bell told FoxNews.com. \"That means they would have to pay an additional tax.\"\n\nIn the end, when it comes to subsidies, the administration has a better case than the critics have, according to legal experts.\n\nIf the IRS receives a valid claim that someone is eligible for a subsidy but did not purchase insurance on the exchange, only then can the subsidy be denied, according to tax experts. (See this explainer of the law.)\n\nWhat about those not eligible for subsidies?\n\nSome Obamacare consumers who want an Obamacare-compliant plan would be unaffected by the possible loss of tax credits.\n\nThey won't be able to buy a plan or receive health coverage through an exchange that doesn't accept subsidies in 2014, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services. That would exclude everyone and their dogs from the exchanges next year.\n\nBut people who receive subsidies could, if they choose to, opt out and get a \"silver\" level plan for $100 or less to avoid losing the subsidies. A bronze level plan -- about $50 a month more expensive -- would be their best option.\n\nEven those who want only the cheapest Obamacare plan would have to get insurance or find a way to pay the $1000-a-year penalty if they don't get a subsidy, according to the non-partisan Urban Institute. If they don't qualify for an subsidies, or if they choose to pay the penalty, their plans would be",
      "\"You can't build the walls!\"\n\nDonald Trump is fond of saying he's the best builder in the world. But you know what's a great builder? A building that's strong.\n\nOne of Trump's first major projects was, quite literally, a building made of concrete. It was known as the Trump Tower, and it was on Riverside Drive in midtown Manhattan.\n\nBut it wasn't perfect, as I learned after a visit at the current Trump Taj Mahal casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey.\n\nThe Trump Taj Mahal was first built in 1995 and named for then-Major League Baseball commissioner Bud Selig. Its design was by famed Italian architect Louis Sullivan, with concrete construction. So this is the kind of concrete that you're supposed to build buildings out of.\n\nThe Trump Taj Mahal's floors were built almost entirely out of concrete, although concrete was not the primary building material. Rather, the Taj Mahal's concrete floors are made of an ultra-lightweight type of wood known as \"aluminized wood\" or \"A2.\"\n\nThe interior of the building was also made primarily of concrete. That's not to say that there were no furnishings in there from time to time. But, as the Trump Taj Mahal owner once told me in an interview, many of the pieces you see hanging in the hallway from the elevators are actually made out of recycled newspaper.\n\nThe floor in the room I visited was made out of an aluminized wood, and I got to see its insides while standing on it. What you see is a mixture of concrete, wood chips, and cement.\n\nThe floor was made from a variety of materials that were then pressed together to form a composite. In the case of the Trump Taj Mahal's concrete, the concrete is mixed with a thick coating of concrete particles, which were then applied to aluminized wood to form the composite floor.\n\nTo add another dimension of strength, concrete was then pushed into the floor with giant steel-reinforced beams. All these elements allowed the Taj Mahal to be constructed at a relatively low cost, to say the least. So, while the concrete floors were fairly flimsy, they were strong.\n\nNow, that's not to say that the floors were always solid. In some of the lower decks, for example, those floors were made out of glass. But, these floors were made with very little strength in mind.\n\nFor instance, you're standing on an interior balcony. It's possible to walk on that balcony, but there have been some unfortunate accidents.\n\nI can attest to this firsthand. In November 2014, there was a fire in a room that contained four floors, located in the fourth deck of the Trump Taj Mahal's first-floor casino.\n\nThe fire was so intense that the floors collapsed under the weight. The concrete in the floors began oozing and spewing out through the floor. In fact, some of the concrete melted and started shooting fire everywhere. Thankfully, I'm alive, but many of my co-workers were not.\n\nThere was also a gas explosion during the fire, which caused the windows to shatter. This caused the smoke and gas that was already burning to rise up through the building and ignite a fire on the eighth floor.\n\nAll this happened because I was there. I was in the casino on November 29, 2014 while guests were still on the second floor. When I made it back down to the lobby, the walls of the lobby were smoking. And there were flames shooting through the windows of the seventh floor.\n\nIt was only when I got to the sixth floor — the deck in which I had been staying all of that time — that I noticed that there was nobody inside. Not a soul. Except for one person.\n\nThat person was very well-dressed, I might add, in a well-tailored red tuxedo, black shoes with white platform buckles, and a black pocket square.\n\nThe guy was obviously someone Trump had selected to witness the building's construction. And he went in, like the rest of us who had come to witness the building's construction.\n\nBut then all of a sudden, without warning, without time to make a complete adjustment to the building or a fire escape (there were only two escape routes and nobody could have gotten out without making a hasty escape), he started plummeting to the ground and died.\n\nBut he wasn't alone. The same month that Donald Trump visited, the city of Atlantic City had recorded three suicides. Most were the victims of sudden heart attacks brought on by stress. It has also been confirmed that one of the victims was actually killed in an accident in 2008 while trying to break a casino slot machine without breaking its slot. That's an amazing coincidence.\n\nThe other three victims died after the city tried to cover them up. That's not only a big problem in terms",
      "For the rest of the afternoon he held the office which would soon give him the authority of God, and to that hour the Lord continued his work. For a very little while the prophet saw great multitudes gathering on the mountains to hear his word; but when he saw that the people did not go the way he had bidden them, he turned about and fled.\n\nThen Joseph went back again and said to some of the elders that he would go and call them together, and give them a revelation, which they would have to believe, and be faithful in all things. And he did so, and gave them a revelation upon this subject, \"Thy enemies shall be thy footstool,\" etc.\n\nThe following is from the Book of Mormon, page 729:\n\nAnd it came to pass that when he had made an end of announcing the words of the revelation, according to the commandment of the Lord, behold there came over our people a very great and mighty wind, which brought every tree under the power of the wind, which consumed all the woods, and lifted those which had been caught in it, and caused them to fall with a loud lamentation; and it was not until after evening and night that there remained any of the trees which were caught by that storm. Thus the great and mighty wind had carried all the wood and all the wood of the earth upon its wings, where it scattered it upon every side, until it had left all its force upon the dry ground.\n\nJoseph Smith, the prophet, the only living prophet among the Prophets of old, was born about 1830, in Vermont.\n\nThis information is contained in a revelation received by Joseph Smith, the Prophet, at Kirtland, Ohio. It is one of a series of revelations issued by the Lord during Joseph Smith's lifetime.\n\nThe revelation states, \"And it came to pass that when that same spirit which caused the great wind to pass over the face of the earth caused earths to tremble, this same spirit went forth from about the hill of Nephi to Kirtland, and it was a spirit which made all the difference....\"\n\nWe do not know what Joseph Smith told Brigham Young about that great wind and those trees. We do not know if the Father saw the events or not. We do not know if the earth shook under that great wind. We do not know if Joseph Smith's revelation was received by members of the priesthood in Kirtland, Ohio.\n\nWe do know that God has been very busy in the world since the Saints started their journey, and the Lord has called and has sent more than a few messages to those who have not yet heard from those who have gone before. The Lord has kept many of our own prophets in prison, and a few of them were killed in the first decade of the twentieth century, as was Joseph Smith; however, his father and his brothers, and some of their wives, were also killed in a mob.\n\nThe Lord has sent his prophets to earth in a previous dispensation. That revelation contains the word \"saint.\" How could we not call our brother Joseph Smith our \"saint\" when the Lord has made the name so beautiful! This should not cause anyone to feel proud of his own spiritual progress. We just ought to be pleased that God has given us a prophet like Joseph Smith to tell us what we need to know to be successful.\n\nWe also have revelations to tell us who our parents are and how to be born again. If any of us feel that our faith is not in line with his, it is not because we did not seek out the gospel or learn to follow the Lord in the faithfulness we learn. It is because we are not living our faith in every day of our lives.\n\nYou might be a little shocked at this information, but there have been many revelations since the Lord has made it known to us that we have to be saved and that the scriptures and the Lord are our only book. When we get right with the Lord, he will change our hearts.\n\nOne of the things I read in an unpublished essay of David O. McKay is that God gives us revelation about those things that need to be changed:\n\nFor it is evident that the Lord has revealed in the past and will reveal in the future certain problems which men of old knew how to solve to themselves, but which modern times have been able to solve more effectively. For example, as to the use of tobacco and its harmfulness to those of his people who consume it or who use it medicinally. We know that the Lord has given revelation about the use of tobacco and has not been slow to communicate and correct the use of it....\n\nNow, how is it that the Lord will, in this day of miracles and revelations and prophets, come down to us and say you must not smoke, and we will say, but we don't use tobacco.\n\nI say, when you are a prophet",

      "(New York) – Palestinian rights groups on Wednesday expressed deep dismay over a recent decision by the Palestinian Authority's (PA) Ministry of Information to censor a website run by the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem. Under the law, such censorship is allowed under certain terms, such as if the website \"contributes to the distortion\" of Palestinian society.\n\nThe ban came as a result of a recent opinion piece by a member of the Palestinian parliament. The MP, Salam Abu Rahmah, criticized the Israeli government's actions towards Palestinians, suggesting that it was trying to manipulate people by giving them false information about their situation. He argued that Israel was using its position as a democratic state to exert control over the minds of the people.\n\nThe Ministry of Information, which serves as the communications arm of the PA, \"rejected this statement and ordered\" B'Tselem and its members to take part in \"training sessions\" aimed at strengthening the ministry's \"censor\" policies.\n\nThe Ministry also issued an official declaration, known as Order No. 38, that called on members of B'Tselem to register or resign from the organization and that accused critics of the organization of being terrorists.\n\n\"The Ministry of Information was concerned by comments by the speaker of the Palestinian parliament and considers them [the remarks] hostile,\" the declaration wrote.\n\nB'Tselem Director of Legal and Political Affairs Eyal Karim said that in light of the ministry's censorship, he had \"not even imagined the type of censorship that could happen\".\n\n\"We're seeing an assault by the PA as a way of silencing a website for criticizing the practices of the occupation. This violates the rights of the website's participants to freedom of expression and information,\" Karim said.\n\nThe ban comes at time when the PA's security forces frequently harass Palestinians involved in peaceful political activities, and when Palestinian journalists are frequently censored by the PA.\n\nB'Tselem began monitoring human rights in both Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories in 1988. This year alone, B'Tselem documented more than 130 cases of alleged human rights violations in the occupied territories, mostly of Palestinian civilians. The cases included cases of extrajudicial executions, torture, and the confiscation of property.",
      "\"A large majority of the people are in the country illegally,\" he told me at a lunch with a group of reporters last year. \"We don't know what the numbers are,\" and he was not about to share them with a press corps that was in full swing interviewing him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"It's not my job to get you to give a statement on any of that,\" he added, referring to his duty as president to take responsibility for immigration, and, of course, his failure to. I'd written about this before: \"When you're the president of the United States, you should be allowed to have a full view of the facts.\" That didn't do it for the critics.\n\nI pointed out then, at the Washington Post's election-year party, that Trump had been a politician, a reality television star, a businessman, and thus had a view of the facts that he shared with the country. I mentioned that Trump had no trouble explaining to the American public that the Obama administration's 2014 executive order on visas for Mexicans had stopped millions of Mexicans from coming to the United States. \"You're talking about the president of the United States,\" I said, \"not me.\"\n\nNo, he assured me. \"Your opinion does not matter,\" he said. \"We have many, many opinions about these various things, and frankly, you're very unfair.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt wasn't my opinion that mattered anymore. It was my job. That was my mission.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat's surprising is that Trump continues to operate in this manner. One of my favorite quotes from historian Carl Bernstein, who exposed the Watergate coverup, is: \"We do not know the motive, but we know the result.\" And Trump — the man who had been a reality TV star, an entrepreneur, and the president of his own organization — is saying the same thing about Trump University, the one-and-only real-estate seminar business that he ran until this year.\n\nTrump University was one of the most famous and, it's often said, greatest scams to hit the education market since the old \"How to Cook a Fish\" or \"How to Make a Fluke\" books. It's been roundly criticized — in the New York Times and elsewhere. And yet it's still around, and its attorney keeps saying — and tweeting — that it's getting the \"full exoneration it so badly deserves\" from the government; and that \"the federal courts and the media were corrupt to begin with.\" He's also retweeted a post on his Instagram account, posted the day that I covered him in Washington, that read, \"It is now well established that President Obama is the founder of ISIS, and he was the best thing that ever happened to the Islamic World.\"\n\nHere is Trump's version, in his own words:\n\nI am not a politician. I have never run for political office. And my adult life has been dedicated to empowering Americans at every level of our society who want better for their fellow citizens — in business, government, the military, and now in the media. My entire life has been dedicated to realizing that everyone in America deserves a chance to improve their own lives.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt the same time, those \"people\" who \"deserve a chance\" were, he said, Americans \"who love this country,\" and who had \"great courage and great heart,\" and \"are truly committed.\" And \"no matter how they started and no matter where they started, they all came from humble beginnings.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat's not, as I've heard some other people say, \"touting his past\"; that's simply a reasonable, honest take on a large swath of the Trump Organization. If my grandfather, a single father who began with nothing. If my great-grandfather who had to work his own land, just like millions of real Americans who are trying to get ahead in this country; if my mother, who started as a secretary while still a child in my hometown of Flint, Mich.; if anyone who grew up in this great nation deserves a chance, it's those people. And those who don't deserve a chance, they don't deserve a chance, they don't deserve a chance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt doesn't matter to Trump that his program of big tax cuts for \"Americans\" is unpopular — you've heard that a lot. Trump University is illegal, and the Justice Department's case against it is not. It's simply not fair for the president to use his position to help people, and then say: \"I'm not trying to get you to defend my past!\" Or, \"If the courts have already said my past is okay, then you can be damn well sure that mine is not!\" Or whatever. It's not about the past for him. And it's not about the future for us.\n\nI understand the president's need for transparency",
      "A new report has confirmed what we have long suspected: the new, more-expensive Apple (AAPL) iPhone is causing significant churn among iPhone customers.\n\nThe Apple analyst firm Strategy Analytics conducted a study this week and determined that roughly 80% of the people who have replaced their iPhones with the new model and are now on the same plan have been replaced by a new one — with the new model. Some people even had a new iPhone on their account as recently as this month.\n\nWhat's behind this trend?\n\nWhat we already knew is that the more expensive new iPhone is taking away some of the customer's money from other parts of their budget. According to IDC, over the course of a three-month period, each device costs roughly $650.\n\nAnd it doesn't stop at the devices. As many as 14% of those who replaced their current iPhones with the new high-end devices saw their credit card transactions decline.\n\nThat's why this is especially troublesome to investors on Wall Street. Analysts at Barclays, for example, said that even with the high sticker cost of the iPhone, revenue was down 3% by the end of the September quarter.\n\n\"The higher the cost of the device, the higher the decline in Apple's revenues and margins will be going forward,\" Barclays analyst James Davenport said in a research note Wednesday.\n\nApple can handle the impact this is having to it financial results\n\nWhen Apple first announced the iPhone 5s and 5c, it seemed Apple had turned into a high-end device manufacturer that would be a thorn in the side of a company like Samsung (005930). But Apple's stock market performance has been the best it's been in some time, and now many investors are beginning to feel confident in the iPhone, which means they shouldn't fret about the fact that there are people still holding onto older versions of the iPhone as an investment.\n\nAnalysts at Wells Fargo said this week that after the iPhone 5s/S/C's debut, they were able to sell the phone to people buying iPhones and it seems that they succeeded in selling it to an \"extraordinary number.\"\n\n\"iPhone 5s was the best-selling iPhone and contributed to a 16% increase in iPhone sales in Q4,\" Wells Fargo senior technology analyst Brian Marshall wrote Wednesday.\n\nThat's great news, but it's not necessarily the reason why Apple's quarterly profit rose 13%. The company's net income grew in each of the first three quarters of 2014, so it's clear that Apple is able to handle the impact this is having to it financial results.\n\nRelated: How to invest in Apple stock\n\nWhile Apple stock is still up on the year, its price has fallen 7% over the course of the last three years, so there are signs that investors can't get comfortable with any kind of stock move for the stock either. Apple has been an undervalued stock in the past, but given all the factors that helped put Apple on the map, the stock now represents a significant portion of a business and company that many people don't trust — but certainly don't regret buying.",

      "(CNN) — How many are in favor — and who's against — the latest U.S. effort to fight Ebola?\n\nThe new strategy that President Barack Obama unveiled Monday aims to train and equip as many as 4,000 U.S. military personnel, according to the Pentagon.\n\nThe strategy calls for \"the mobilization of as many personnel as possible from the United States military\" in Africa to combat Ebola. The idea, the first time that the U.S. has called for the assistance of the U.S. armed forces, goes in to a range of options that include ground troops, aerial surveillance and medical evacuation, military officials told CNN.\n\nThe training, they added, would be done with the help of West African nations on the front line, while a medical response would include setting up treatment centers in the region of Liberia and Sierra Leone, they said. Obama is expected to discuss the plans with his Cabinet on Tuesday. \"As you know, there were outbreaks in West Africa. We've never seen anything like this,\" he said Monday night during a press conference with French President Francois Hollande.\n\nThe Ebola outbreak has killed at least 2,630 out of 3,630 believed cases, according to the World Health Organization\n\n\"This is our biggest, most ambitious deployment since the global response to the Ebola virus outbreak began. We will deploy hundreds of military personnel from around the world, bringing more than 6,000 military personnel into West Africa to help prevent potential outbreaks of the Ebola virus and stop the spread of the disease,\" National Security Council spokesperson Caitlin Hayden said in a statement, citing Obama's strategy.\n\nRead More",
      "In the second half of the 20th century, much of the world was transformed. Industrialization, the spread of technology, the development of the Internet, the rise of China, Japan, India, and the Middle East, and rising interest in the arts – these are just a few of the major events that marked a period of rapid change in the world. But one thing that was not changing, as the 20th century progressed, was race relations. Racism, sexism, and prejudice existed and still exist in nearly every country; only a few, such as South Africa, actually adopted anti-discrimination laws to combat the issues.\n\nThe change came in the 1970s and 1980s, during the \"Second Reconstruction\" between Japan and the United States. By then, Americans were feeling the effects of inflation and recession. The country, particularly its manufacturing sector, was facing major problems both financially and spiritually. This was also the time of America's first national black president, a change that was particularly noticeable in the country's schools, where more students were starting out at secondary level while older students were finishing higher.\n\nWhat began in Japan as a cultural, political, economic, and social movement in response to political and legal changes in the United States quickly exploded in America. The movement was called \"Americanization,\" and consisted of \"the Americanization of Japanese culture, the Americanization of Japanese politics, the Americanization of Japanese society, the Americanization of American values, the Americanization of American culture, the Americanization of American laws and the Americanization of American language and literature.\" It was \"a national movement to bring Japanese culture and Japanese culture values closer to the American way of life.\"\n\nThe Americanization of Japanese culture included what was originally intended to be the nation's own version of the American cultural revolution – the Hollywood cinema movement. This also included the idea that \"The Americanization of all Japanese life will change the Japanese into Americanized people and Americanized society.\"\n\nThe Americanization of Japanese culture included what was originally intended to be the nation's own version of the American cultural revolution – the Hollywood cinema movement. This also included the idea that \"The Americanization of all Japanese life will change the Japanese into Americanized people and Americanized society.\" The movement was centered in the United States, but other countries experienced it too; in Japan, a \"Americanization of Japanese culture\" also included popular Japanese movies such as Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, the first of which was released in 1954.\n\nA study of the Americanization of Japanese society conducted at Tottori University in 1973 by Yukiyuki Ishihara and Akira Yoshida concluded:\n\n[T]he movement has become quite popular, and it is an important social movement … and one which has created significant changes in Japanese cultural and religious attitudes … It is widely considered as Japanese culture's unique counterattack and counterculture … In Japan, as in a number of other countries, there is a desire for a society at an acceptable level of living.\n\nAnother book published in 1973 by Sakamoto Akiko: \"The Japanese Way Of Life\" made some of the same conclusions as the Ishihara/Ishida study of Americanization in Japan – the Americanization of Japanese society included popular Japanese movies such as Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai, the first of which was released in 1954.\n\nIn an essay written in 1963 for Yomiuri Shimbun, Japan's leading daily newspaper, Masako Nagata argued that the movement was rooted in \"Americanization with a twist,\" citing \"the movie The Great Gatsby\" as an example of this. She argued:\n\nIn the novel, [the character Daisy] and her American boyfriend, Tom Buchanan (played by Marlon Brando), are having an enjoyable visit in New York City, except that Daisy seems to be suffering from a chronic headache. The American insists that it is only the heat that bothers her. The Japanese, however, are convinced that it is the heat that disturbs Daisy most of all — and that it is something she suffers from. They do not feel guilty about it.\n\nThis \"twist,\" which was also mentioned in several subsequent books, was that in many American films, especially the movies from the 1930s and 1940s that focused on the life of the upper class, characters of color were not shown as individuals with full human dignity. Instead, their stories were reduced to caricatures, such as in the 1925 silent horror film \"The Phantom of the Opera,\" where it was not possible to see the actors playing The Phantom – John Barrymore, Barbara Stanwyck, and Richard Burton – as individuals with full human dignity and humanity. The racist and sexist themes of that film were made explicit through a commentary on it by the director Orson Welles, who said:\n\nWelles: \"I don't have a race hatred problem in this film. I've decided that they're a bunch of Negroes, and I've decided that I don't care.\"",
      "How to write a book that can live on for many years? The answer comes from a new study by researchers at Harvard University and Princeton, who examined the impact of age on the impact — not only of a book's content, but of its popularity, too. The results were published as an article in the journal Science in April 2014.\n\nThe researchers found that most popular books that have been around for a long time, like \"To Kill a Mockingbird,\" remain at the top of the charts for a long time. But books like \"Tropic of Cancer,\" written by a woman in the 1920s, quickly fade because of their aging audience.\n\nResearchers are still working to understand why this happens, and how to combat it. But one thing they do know is that older people tend to have much more reading and writing experience than younger people.\n\n\"Some may find it surprising that reading has such an impact, but it's important as we age to take time each day to engage in meaningful intellectual pursuits,\" lead researcher Brian Nosek, a psychologist at the Center for Gerontology, who conducted the research, told NPR.",

      "\"Do you really wish to know?\" The owl whispered. Harry couldn't see what it saw in that moment – his mind could only speculate.\n\n\"I'm not exactly in a lot of luck right now. I have a girlfriend and we're fighting a war that almost killed the last of the Death Eaters. I'm almost out of stuff to eat and I have to survive on whatever I can get. So please,\" the boy begged, \"tell me a story.\"\n\nThe owl lowered its head. The boy swallowed hard.\n\n\"No thanks, I've just been in a tough spot, and I've seen some pretty good stuff. This may not be the best story you ever hear,\" Harry stated with utmost earnestness.\n\nHe was right. Even now, Harry couldn't believe what he saw.\n\n\"Harry,\" an old woman called softly into his ear. \"I don't think I've ever seen a man in that much trouble as you are right now.\" With a soft smile on her face, the elderly woman placed her hand on his shoulder, the faintest of caresses.\n\n\"I'm sure there's an owl there for you, Mrs Evans. She didn't mind my looking around her house and reading all the books in her library.\" Harry paused, staring at the old woman, and she began to smile.\n\n\"Please,\" she asked hesitantly, \"can I introduce you to her? My daughter, Luna.\"\n\n\"It is my pleasure,\" Harry stated.\n\nLuna Evans's eyes were the same brown, with hazel at the ends, as Sirius Black's. Harry's eyes were of the same green, but with the golden tinge, as his parents', and were much more beautiful. Like Sirius, their parents were of an ancient line of pureblooded wizards, their blood almost pure as the moonlight; they were close enough, after all.\n\n\"Luna? Do you know him?\" The old woman asked.\n\n\"I've just met him, Mrs Evans. But I'm sure that all the teachers and other people know him very well,\" Harry replied truthfully.\n\nLuna smiled, touching Harry's nose with a soft, gentle touch. After a brief silence, she continued. \"My only sister, Delphini, who died in your fifth year, taught your father that being a great hero wasn't enough. He wanted to be a great teacher.\"\n\nHarry had never met Delphini, though Harry did know that his grandmother had a daughter with her deceased husband that never became a legend. Perhaps, Harry surmised, Delphini was still alive. After a moment's thought, he nodded his agreement.\n\n\"Harry, I have something that would be good for you to hear,\" Luna said kindly, lifting Harry's chin slightly with one finger. \"It's about Dumbledore.\"\n\n\"Dumbledore?\" Harry echoed in mild amazement, still in shock from the revelation.\n\nLuna leaned closer towards Harry and placed her face against his. Her long eyelashes brushed across his ear. \"Yes,\" Luna whispered with love. \"Dumbledore is a very important figure. He led the war against the Dark Lord.\"\n\nHarry gasped, and she leaned down closer to him in sympathy. \"I know, Harry. You don't know. He's a very good man, and he has done a lot for us.\"\n\nHarry nodded. \"Yeah, I guess that's true,\" he said quietly.\n\nIn a softer voice than before, she said, \"He is very worried about you, Harry, that's why he summoned you to Azkaban. You're the only friend that he knows, and he's scared of what will happen if they see you.\"\n\nHarry shivered, and his scar began to pulsate again. He looked up at Luna, his mind trying to comprehend where all this was going.\n\n\"But why Harry? Did he know?\" The question seemed so obvious in his mind.\n\nShe shrugged. \"He didn't really notice that I was his daughter until we married, and even since then, I've been the only other person he can talk to.\"\n\nHarry's heart beat faster as he wondered if this meant that Delphini was already gone to a foreign country or hiding from some Dark wizard or other.\n\n\"If you're with him, then that means you'll have a chance to see his family again. But his relatives live in the east, away from the public eye. There are rumours that there's some curse that can take Harry from them, if a wizard who was close to them is killed. Now there's only one chance that we have at seeing him.\" She explained.\n\n\"But that won't fix the problem we have now.\" Harry said, tears welling up in his eyes. \"Luna, what can I do to be happy?\"\n\nShe smiled",
      "A New York Police Department officer was seen pushing a 16-year-old teen at the entrance to the Roosevelt Field Mall store where she was shopping on Monday.\n\nThe video, provided to DNA Info by an eyewitness, went viral after it was posted to the Facebook page of a woman who was among many outraged after the officer appeared to push the teen. The video clip was first shared on the page and has more than 800 shares.\n\nAccording to the witness, the officer appeared to approach the teen while she was browsing, and he appeared to push her away from the store entrance.\n\nThe witness described the officer as being both large and bulky: \"It looked like he was about 70 pounds. He was about 6-foot and very heavy set.\"\n\nThe officer is reported to have apologized for his actions, stating \"I am sorry if my actions upset you and that my body language was disrespectful, but that is not the case.\"\n\nThe 16-year-old woman was reportedly accompanied by her friend and father of her child. They were shopping at a New York City-area Target when she was approached by police officers. The friend and father asked the officers for their names, the witness said – when they didn't respond that the officers were there for their child, they followed the teens outside.\n\nThe incident occurred around noon on Monday outside the Target store on Manhattan Avenue – the same store the teen went to after returning from school on Monday.",
      "The New York Red Bulls head to Orlando on Sunday looking to keep in pace with one of the most consistent clubs in the Eastern Conference. Despite being eliminated from the playoffs in 2015, Orlando has earned a reputation as one of the best outfits in the league. The Lions are led by USMNT star Kaka, along with Brazilian duo Romario and Kaká. In addition, 2016 MLS MVP candidate Kevin Molino has scored 11 goals over the last 17 games. They have lost just once since the start of the season and will look to take the next step in their development and put it all together. Here is a recap of the Lions' win against the Red Bulls II on Saturday and their upcoming opponent for the New Year.\n\nPossible Lineups\n\nOrlando City: GK Joe Bendik, D Rafael Ramos, D Seb Hines, D Luke Boden, M Cristian Higuita, M Carlos Rivas, M Tony Rocha, R Junior Jesus, M Cyle Larin\n\nNew York Red Bulls II: GK Ryan Meara, D Tyler Miller, D Connor Lade, M Derrick Etienne, M Mike Grella, M Amando Moreno, M Dan Metzger, F Junior Flemmings (Lance Lewis, 75'), F Cyle Larin (Will Johnson, 73')\n\n\nKey Players\n\nOrlando's Kaka. Kaka has scored 11 times in 17 games this season and it won't surprise anyone to see him lead the Lions once again on Sunday. Kaka's consistency in the attack is what makes up for his defensive issues, and he is the team leader in shots (44) and assists (nine). Kaka will look to score his second straight hat trick and give his team the lead, although they will have to do it against the Red Bulls' strong defense. Kaka had a very successful offseason, getting a move to Orlando City.\n\nNew York's Romario. One of the best defensive midfielders in MLS with 15 assists last season. He is always one of the final two goals scored in games, and he will need to prove to his teammates that he still has what it takes after the summer. If he can, they will have a good chance at victory against Orlando.\n\nPrediction\n\nIf these two teams' defenses are as strong as last season and the Lions' attack is as dangerous, we could see a quick turnaround by the Red Bulls this weekend. If Orlando can put together a strong performance, though, the Red Bulls have to find a solution to the team's offensive ineptitude.",
      "As a former Republican who was willing to vote for a Democrat to end sequestration, I am not comfortable with the Republican tax cut plan put forward by Congressional Republicans. I have previously argued that the Republican Party should not be making any fiscal promises to voters or that there will be no spending cuts required in order to protect programs that have served our nation well for decades.\n\nHowever, the Republican plan to pass a tax cut and end sequestration does require sequestration cuts.\n\nIt simply does not make sense, however, to blame those sequestration cuts on Congress and Republicans when there is the responsibility for that cuts to fall on President George W. Bush and the White House leadership. As is obvious, President Bush did not take any actions to end sequestration; he simply agreed to the reductions which led to the sequester cuts, not wanting to take a chance that he might receive blame if the cuts lead to a financial crisis.\n\nThe Republican plan for ending sequestration requires not just the cuts to defense and nonmilitary discretionary spending, but also the cuts to Medicare by making a separate, across the board reduction in Medicare eligibility. This means we would need to cut the same amount of money for Medicare by another $30 billion, which is far higher than the $10.5 billion cut from defense and nonmilitary discretionary spending.\n\nSo we are now asking the Pentagon to cut $29 billion from its budget if we want to keep the sequester cuts from going into effect. The defense budget is more than twice the size of the nonmilitary discretionary budget, and it is hard to see how we would have enough money in the nonmilitary discretionary budget to support additional military spending while not taking cuts in Medicare that could lead to the loss of the program that has been a pillar of support and stability for tens of millions of American families.\n\nThe fact that the GOP will end sequestration with even more cuts to Medicare than originally planned and more cuts to nonmilitary federal discretionary spending is not a good look.\n\nIt is imperative that President Obama, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senators Bernie Sanders and Sherrod Brown use the powers that they have to stop Republicans' tax plan and end sequestration. Without those two actions, we would have no hope of avoiding the looming sequester cuts.\n\nIf these actions are not taken, President Obama will be forced to give into Republican demands for even more budget cuts and the economy will continue its downward spiral into a Great Depression.",
      "In June, the University of Toronto's faculty associations passed what is likely the first-ever U.S. university divestment resolution on grounds of Palestinian suffering. Now faculty at U of T's other 10 campuses across the country have joined the push, and the resolution is now getting support from student groups.\n\nAt U of T, student union president Jordan Peterson, a professor of psychology, is leading the charge. As of Thursday, more than 585 signatures had been collected on a petition of support. The petition was also on the official student union website for three days.\n\nThe resolution calls for the U of T (U of T/Dalhousie) to \"remain non-invested in companies that profit from the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.\" In its first few days, 1,000 students have signed the petition.\n\nIn the United States, campuses have a long history of political divestment from entities doing business with, or in support of, apartheid South Africa, apartheid Israel, or states and organizations guilty of human rights violations. The debate about U of T's resolution has been largely driven by Peterson, a vocal supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement.\n\nPeterson uses an academic method known as \"dialectics,\" a form of historical analysis that attempts to understand the past to advance a future. In his case, this means he is using the historical context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict as an excuse to say the Palestinian \"victim\" is not a real \"victim!\"\n\nIn June of 2015, Peterson was invited to speak at U of T, and while there, Peterson used his platform to call the Jewish state a \"national embarrassment,\" and defended Israel's treatment of Palestinians as \"inherently righteous.\" Peterson's comments sparked outrage across campus; several students staged a sit-in. Peterson cancelled his speech and the event was later cancelled, only for them to be rescheduled. This time, the university and its faculty associations decided to cancel the event.\n\nIn fact, the administration did so immediately after speaking with Peterson about his controversial positions. In his post, professor Richard M. Ciano, the co-principal of the Social Sciences Faculty and the Academic Dean of the Faculty of Arts and Science, explained in great detail why the university did not want to have a public argument in opposition to a controversial speaker.\n\nWhile Ciano admits that the university is open to free speech and free expression, in this case he says students should not make their opinions known in a manner that could create a disruption or threaten the safety of others.\n\nCiano says he is not speaking out for freedom of expression in the sense that one may say one's own opinion, as he says the university is \"opposed to hate speech (including white supremacist speech by Christian evangelicals) that targets vulnerable groups or promotes hatred, violence, or genocide.\" Nor do Ciano speak for an open discourse. Rather, he says the university should not have allowed the debate to take place if the speakers brought \"negative consequences\" to them.\n\nCiano's logic leads to the conclusion that there would be no debate at U of T if Peterson had brought in the hate speech from his previous speeches.\n\n\"One would not have the debate with someone claiming to be defending human rights if the talk were accompanied by statements which were clearly racist and xenophobic,\" Ciano writes.\n\nIn his remarks on July 20, Peterson argues it is important to make a point about why he opposes BDS from a historical context. While the BDS movement is a legitimate and important one, Peterson writes, it has to be placed in the larger context of violence in Palestinian society, and it's \"only in the context of violence in the world that one can truly assess the situation in which Palestinians find themselves.\"\n\nHe then makes the false claim that anti-Semitism is the only problem Israel faces. In reality, according to human rights activists, many others, including Palestinian civilians, are routinely targeted by Israeli military forces.\n\nProud of this university. Proud! https://t.co/nKiFn5F3Qn — Dr Jordan Peterson (@jordanbpeterson) June 27, 2016\n\nPeterson claims he was only trying to show the U of T's anti-Palestine movement was misguided, and that the university is a \"good\" place to raise concerns. In fact, the University of Toronto has been the subject of numerous criticisms for not doing enough to stop racism on campus, and for allegedly not doing enough to support Palestinian students.",
      "\"Happiness is a choice and choices are made every day.\" [i]\n\"We need to change the way we think of \"being happy\" and how it relates to happiness and its measurement.\" [ii]\n\"To make choices is to have options. To make choices, choices are being made; choices are choices.\" [iii]\n\"When we make choices - consciously or unconsciously - we make choices for ourselves, for our own well-being and for the well-being of those close to us.\" [iv]  \n\"If we don't choose, we are passive. If we don't change our thinking and our actions, we have been set up for failure.\" [v]\n\"When you make choices you take responsibility for your own wellbeing.\" [vi]  \n\"I have the belief that as long as you are choosing between healthy choices or unhealthy choices then this is the way our society is set up with choices, is that it's only healthy or it's only unhealthy, not both?\" [vii]\n\"Choices are what keep us on the road towards living a happy life.\" [viii]\n\"I don't believe in trying to be happier or having a happy life unless you give yourself permission to be happy...\" [ix]\nThe \"choices\" described above are usually thought of as decisions to make, choices you are making. That is, choices you intend to make, choices you made as well as choices you are making now (or not making) that are affecting your life. But let's look a little closer at the idea of choices. Most people think of making a decision as making a decision, making choices. That is, if I decide to buy a blue dress, blue or not, blue doesn't decide I must buy the blue dress, it merely means I can buy the blue dress. But how we make choices impacts not only our choices, but the choices we make in the future. We make a choice about what we will do and how we will do it. It could be to do that job we are hired to do, to take on a new sport, a new project, we make a choice that affects how we will look at ourselves, and the world around us. [x]\nSo, what does it mean to be making a choice? There are many meanings depending on who and what we choose to ask. In our society today, it usually refers to making a decision to do something, whether that is to drink water or not or to go to that party or not, or to get that dress or not.   I think you could find meanings more than one way to interpret the word. Some people use the word choice to refer to having freedom from something (what we are doing) so we don't need to do it for our sake alone. Others refer to having a particular goal that we want to achieve, so we can see it as getting or making a choice that means we can reach that goal. Other people use choice to refer to doing something more than once, so that it will be beneficial and beneficial to us in the long run.   And others use choice to refer to making or attempting something; so that we may be successful in some or many ways.  \nI think, when we talk about choices, we should be referring to what is meant by the word \"choice.\" Choices are not what we make but we have the opportunity to make them. Whether we make a conscious or subconscious choice or something else is up to us. As we can see by using the word choice in my examples, making a choice means a choice to make, to make the choices for ourselves and to choose for our own well-being and the well-being of the people we love. But making choices also means that there are many choices we can make to help ourselves and our families. It means that we can be the ones or the groups that make the decisions, for we all make choices. And so, let's make a choice on who we are and what we are about.   And let's make it for the purpose of living a happy life!\n[i] https://www.barna.com/about/topics/what-is-happiness/ [ii] http://www.health.harvard.edu/news/2010/12/21/being-happy [iii] http://www.health.harvard.edu/news/2011/4/18/being-happy [iv] https://www.wis.edu/healthcenter_research/courses/healthy-living/101/choices-health-4 [v] https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/a-choice-every-day/201012/why-people-choose-some-things-over-others [vi] http://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/a-choice-every-day/201101/life-choices-are-all",
      "The last time you went to a baseball game, you didn't do it to see the game played by one team. In 2012, the last time the Reds were a winning team, they did not play the Padres on Oct. 11. They had won the night-before between Chicago and San Diego, and after the game, the Reds played in St. Louis.\n\nThat game wasn't played by the Mets as in past years, but in a game called the \"Doubleheader.\" The other side of the rivalry has come to be known as \"The Derby.\" We don't know exactly why, but it is a game-day tradition.\n\nOne reason that this year's Reds and Padres game is getting so much attention is that the Padres are the Mets' division rivals. The first pitch of the game, which is scheduled for 8 p.m., has a 3:55 p.m. CT start time. The Reds also have a division rival, the Houston Astros, and they played this year's game in San Antonio.\n\nIt may be that the Reds want the game to be played at night, to give the crowd some time to clear out and then get into the park on time. But it is also possible that the Reds really like the idea of playing in San Diego. But the Padres say the other team has the right to play at night.\n\nThe Mets and Padres played in San Diego in 1980 but that was the last time, according to their history, that they played there. Maybe it will be different this time, in anticipation of a home game on Opening Day, but until we find out why baseball was played at night before in a rivalry that has been played as a mid-day game, it is probably a good thing that the Reds are getting a better night than the Padres.",

      "The FBI has \"been in close contact\" with the city's prosecutors regarding its continuing investigation of the Ferguson, Missouri police department in light of officer Darren Wilson's fatal shooting of Michael Brown.\n\nThe FBI's St. Louis office told reporters, \"The FBI is coordinating closely with the City of St. Louis' City Attorney's Office and the St. Louis County Prosecuting Attorney's Office,\" according to a statement by St. Louis Department of Justice spokesperson Melinda McLaughlin. The FBI and the U.S. Attorney's Office \"have been in close contact regarding the ongoing investigation of police activity by the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department in reference to Michael Brown and the circumstances surrounding his death,\" McLaughlin continued.\n\nThe St. Louis Department of Justice had just released a letter to the Ferguson community that contained a detailed overview of the FBI investigation. It explained how the agency conducted a more than 400-page document review of police activity in the wake of Brown's shooting death on August 9 last year.\n\n\"For nearly two years the FBI has been working alongside the St. Louis Metropolitan Police Department in the investigation of an officer-involved shooting involving an African-American male that left Michael Brown with a fatal injury,\" the letter added.\n\nThe letter also revealed the FBI had received testimony from more than four dozen eyewitnesses to the incident. In September, the FBI's St. Louis branch sent a task force to Ferguson to conduct an in-depth review of officers' use of force. And in October the FBI interviewed the parents, relatives and friends, the report by Bloomberg Businessweek said.\n\nHowever, at the time of Brown's death the FBI was still in the early stages of the case. When the FBI came back with its conclusion last year, Brown's family attorney Benjamin Crump was dismayed by the \"sloppiness\" of the FBI, telling the St. Louis Post-Dispatch that he was \"outraged, disheartened and confused.\"\n\nRead more\n\n\"The FBI is partnering with the local police department now to begin the process of gathering evidence from the site,\" McLaughlin said in a statement, according to Bloomberg. \"The FBI will coordinate closely with the St. Louis City Attorney's office and the St. Louis County Prosecutor's Office to expedite the process.\"\n\nThe St. Louis Department of Justice also has been \"in close contact\" with city authorities regarding the continuing federal investigation into police activity in Ferguson.\n\nThe Bureau of Justice Statistics has estimated that there are more than one police officer killed every week in the US.

      "In the first study to look at the effects of a new drug approved to treat childhood autism, researchers have found it may boost the brain's production of one of the chemicals that has been linked to autism spectrum disorder, according to the journal \"Neurotoxicology and Teratology.\"\n\n\"A high dose of this substance has been reported to increase the brain's levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin and other neurotransmitters and other chemicals,\" said study senior author Michael Rosenhan, MD, an investigator at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.\n\nThis chemical has been linked to autism because of a higher frequency of high-functioning autistic children with low amounts of serotonin in the brain. The study examined whether the use of the drug was associated with brain changes in people with high-functioning autism.\n\nResearchers have examined the drug Risperdal (risperidone) in more than 40 people with autism or other pervasive developmental disorder, a group that can be difficult to treat, according to Richard A. Frye, MD, an investigator at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda, Maryland.\n\nThe new study examined 40 people with high-functioning autism who had experienced the most recent treatment for the disorder. The group was matched with 40 people without any autism and 40 people with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder of childhood (ADHD), a similar disorder whose symptoms generally resemble autism but in which a person may have difficulty controlling their impulse-control issues when they are younger, in contrast to many people with high-functioning autism who show mild symptoms until adolescence or adulthood.\n\nAll participants were given Risperdal for the duration of the trial. They also took a placebo.\n\nAt the end of the trial, all 41 of the people who received Risperdal had experienced a significant decline (15 points, on a scale where 0 means no change and a 100 means a major increase) in the frequency of their symptoms of autism.\n\nSimilarly, all 41 of the people who did not take the drug had experienced the same decline in symptoms.\n\nThe participants also completed a standard psychiatric assessment, including social and communication questionnaires, to assess their severity of symptoms. None of the participants reported symptoms of major depression.\n\nCompared with 20 weeks after taking the Risperdal, the participants' levels of serotonin in the brain were about 20 percent higher, while their levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine were about 10 percent lower. They also had higher levels of a chemical called homovanillic acid.\n\n\"We conclude that risperidone alters the structure and function of the serotonergic system in both children and adults with autism and ADHD,\" wrote the study authors in the journal. \"These results are consistent with previous evidence of reduced serotonergic system function in high-functioning autistic individuals.\"\n\nSome experts have questioned the validity of the study since one group of participants received a placebo and another group received risperidone. The researchers said it is unlikely that an increase in serotonin levels were the reason that was most important, but suggested that an increase in dopamine was also important.\n\nFor example, a recent study showed that dopamine signaling in children with autism has decreased. The study authors suggested that increased dopamine function may be important for increasing the production of serotonin in the brain.\n\n\"If, as we speculate, changes to dopamine function are more closely related to autistic symptom improvement rather than the serotonin changes, we would expect an association between risperidone and reductions in both the frequency and severity of autistic symptoms,\" said study lead author Lenny R. Goldberg, MD, PhD, senior investigator at the National Institute of Mental Health Research Center on Developmental Disabilities Research Unit in Bethesda.\n\n\"Although we do not have direct evidence of such effects,\" he said, because the results were based on just one group, \"we believe that a drug with potentially such dramatic effects on neurotransmission may be of great interest.\"\n\nRisperidone is an anti-seizure medication and a member of the second generation of anti-seizure medications with a newer version of the antipsychotic amisulpride.",

      "[A] large majority of Muslim women in Britain who have undergone female genital mutilation — a practice that is illegal [but] rarely reported due to shame — say they would not have undergone the procedure in their lives except that it was readily accessible, researchers say Wednesday.\n\nThe survey, commissioned by the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), found that 75% of respondents — including 53% of those who were under the age of 18 — said they would not have undergone an FGM procedure except it was readily available.\n\n[W] hile some [British Muslims'] views about FGM appear to be shifting, attitudes appear to remain deeply entrenched amongst many young girls and women. While some [British Muslims'] views about FGM appear to be shifting, attitudes appear to remain deeply entrenched amongst many young girls and women.\n\nBritish Muslim leaders, for her part, stressed on Wednesday that the practice was not a religious choice.\n\nA spokesman for the Muslim Council of Britain told the BBC he felt that the CEOP results \"show that some [Muslim women] really have a hard time accepting that this was a choice done to them at a very young age, in many cases as a condition of marriage, and they would not have ever chosen to have that done to them except for it being done readily.\"\n\nBritish officials are concerned with a spike in female genital mutilation among immigrants from non-European nations, particularly Muslim nations like Somalia, according to BBC.\n\nThe CEOP report also found that \"most British mothers and fathers\" wanted to see British customs, including female genital mutilation, \"returned to their own country.\" They found that more than 80% of Muslim parents said it was OK for their sons to be circumcised (i.e.: they had no negative feelings about it). Only 10% of non-Muslim parents said the same.\n\n\"Many parents also told us that they wanted these laws to be reversed so that they can continue having their daughter circumcised when they want (to) and not just because of cultural reasons,\" said Sarah Green of CEOP.\n\nAccording to The Telegraph, British politicians are taking action.\n\nThe Women and Equalities (Women) Parliamentary Group is considering legislation that would outlaw FGM and child marriages, according to women's rights campaigner and MP Sarah Champion. One of the group's aims is to make the practice illegal across the UK by 2020. It is hoped that this would \"give children an equal right to an education and good health care, without FGM and child marriage, and ensure that female genital mutilation is properly considered in the criminal justice system as well as in all public bodies and educational settings.\"\n\nThe new law would also outlaw female genital mutilation that includes the partial or total removal of the outer part of the clitoris. However, campaigners are concerned that the measures would merely outlaw some procedures and do not include the rest.\n\n\"It is a step forward but not a final solution to the crisis of FGM in the UK and other countries,\" said Baroness D'Souza, Minister of State for Women's and Equalities (equalities). \"It does not outlaw the entire procedure ... and it does nothing to address the reality that so many children remain at risk.\"\n\nFGM, also spelled as khatna and sometimes referred to simply as Female Genital Mutilation (FGM), has become increasingly popular in the UK. Although the practice is illegal, and carries a penalty of up to five years in prison, it is more prevalent in migrant communities than the general population, according to the United Nations Population Fund. In 2005 the UNFPA estimated that it was inflicted on more than 140,000 girls and women in the UK.\n\nThere are as many as 1.5 million women and girls worldwide who are living today as the result of FGM, according to the UNFPA. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that by 2020, that number will be over two million. It is estimated that in the US, one in every 100 girls born will experience the procedure, which is typically performed by cutting away the clitoral hood at two to three months old. More than 90% are left with some degree of pain or bleeding after the procedure.\n\nIn a 2005 report, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated there could be 7 million more FGM victims by 2020.\n\nIn 2007, the UK government set up the National FGM Taskforce which released its report last year in which it recommended that FGM be made illegal, with punishments including imprisonment of up to two years. However, campaigners were disappointed with the report's recommendations and urged the government not to outlaw the practice.\n\nThe High Commissioner for Refugees and the Royal Norwegian Air Force have pledged to provide funding to provide free FGM education for migrant girls in the UK. They plan to educate up to 40,000 girls to date through these efforts.",
      "LONDON, March 13 (UPI) -- After a man dressed up in a red coat and a bowler hat attacked a teenager on a London street, two bystanders decided to take matters into their own hands to calm him down.\n\nThe incident happened Tuesday afternoon.\n\nWhile the teenager suffered cuts to his leg and face, a 23-year-old man wielding a golf club walked up to the attacker, took out a knife and stabbed him in the cheek at least twice.\n\n\"It was basically like a Hollywood blockbuster,\" witness Andrew Molyneux told the Daily Mirror.\n\n\"It was like he was playing a role he wasn't prepared for. He didn't know what to do and he had to defend himself but he didn't do it like a hero, he did it like a man.\"\n\nThe attacker has been identified as 25-year-old Nicholas Thomas who was arrested and charged with wounding with intent and resisting arrest. He was bailed to appear at London's Old Bailey.\n\n\"I just don't think society has a real grasp on how dangerous it is out there,\" one bystander, who identified himself as Matt, told Sky News. \"I mean, he was dressed like he was in a Batman movie, with a full beard and all, but the fact is he's just a normal person trying to go about his life -- and there were people there protecting him. It's just like it's a movie. I wish I was the person that he was fighting.\"\n\n\"It's not like the Joker's coming after you, he's just trying to get home and he has a kid -- there's probably worse people out there but we're all part of society and it's just important for people to be aware of it and keep their eyes open and have the best thing happen.\"",
      "The \"new\" New York Police Department is a lot like the old New York Police Department. There are plenty of bad cops, but in general the police are held to a standard far beyond what would suffice for any other profession. If an officer acts improperly, it is the duty of the NYPD to punish him or her, no matter what the matter is. On the other hand, if an officer does nothing wrong, it is up to the cop to explain why he or she is not being punished.\n\nThere is a tendency to view officers who do wrong as being inherently bad, even if their mistakes are minor or not particularly threatening to anyone. As it turns out, though, there is a lot of evidence that proves that is not the case.\n\nA recent study, though, reveals that the difference between the public perception of a police officer who does wrong and police officers who do nothing wrong is not due to the individual officer's bad behavior. Rather, it's because everyone considers bad cops to be bad, and all cops are good at acting in compliance with the law.\n\nIt is common knowledge that a law is meant to be followed, in the literal sense, and that law-abiding citizens are, in general, expected to act according to these standards. But it is not the same for everyone, and often the difference between the two is not so easy to determine and requires additional thought for even someone familiar with the law. In fact, if there is no law in place that governs the behavior of these cops, we will have to make up one ourselves.\n\nThis is what University of Tennessee's Mark Krasnow, Ph.D., found in a study of an experiment he conducted in which he gave participants a statement containing four different legal terms to read. In one statement, the lawyer told the participants of his profession and told them that people \"often tell me my job requires me to violate your personal expectations\".\n\nIn a second statement, the lawyer did not tell the participants of his profession. Instead, he said, \"You expect to make an arrest every day, you don't want to make one that will result in a fine that does not reflect the value of the act you are policing.\" And finally, in the third statement, the lawyer did tell the participants of his profession and the legal requirement was \"to help people with criminal cases without fear of having them punished\".\n\nThe results of a third statement from all three lawyers were striking. It asked people to judge the lawyer's performance and concluded, \"The lawyer was a poor communicator, the lawyer had a low perceived competence and the lawyer did nothing to address the law they were reading.\"\n\nOf course, the study did not focus on the behavior of individuals, only those involved in the study. Still, even when the test subjects' actions did not affect the legal performance of the lawyers, the study found that every lawyer's performance was judged more highly when he or she acted in compliance with the law. That finding may be hard to interpret, given that the results were not completely independent, but Krasnow notes that it is possible to take his results and apply them to all of them.\n\n\"Some people want an aggressive prosecutor who will make an arrest that will result in a conviction – and that is what a police officer does,\" he says. \"Some people want a competent lawyer who will tell the lawyer's client what he or she should have known and expected in the first place.\"\n\nAnd even if the results of such individual tests may not have a huge effect on officers, they may have an effect on the perceptions of their fellow cops, or more generally, on all of us. After all, Krasnow says, \"We should not assume that the law enforcement agencies that we use are all the same, any more than we are all the same.\"",
      "As I did with my two previous posts, I'm going to go through the three major categories of data from the game. The first three categories are the most obvious: the game's stats, the teams we're up against, and then the players that were on the ice. From here, I'll try to make some sense of the data, breaking it down by player type - and maybe by team! That means I'll try to compare the Corsi numbers against the Corsi numbers for their own team, if one exists, before I go any further. For the sake of this post, I'll be comparing players here, rather than individual teams. But we can still have a discussion as to what these numbers actually mean!\n\nThe main thing that we can say about this data is that it certainly doesn't seem like the Leafs had a tremendous Corsi advantage, the way we might expect from something like the Corsi Against per 60 number. You can go into any Leafs game and see that the Leafs do struggle with shot differential, in large part because their opponents often force them to have a relatively difficult time taking even decent shots against.\n\nInstead, it seems more likely they have a small number of bad bounces that cost them shots and possession time that they otherwise would have had during certain stretches. This can make them look more vulnerable to bad goal chances, but it also may have been part of the reason why the Leafs had a small advantage in Corsi against (even though there were some areas of the game where they did benefit from a small advantage).\n\nIn fact, there's not really any evidence that the Leafs were overly-lucky with the results of shot differential, or shot attempts. This might look weird to most readers. But, we do know from looking at this table, from last week's chart, that the Leafs had the second best puck luck of the playoff teams - second best, in fact, all season. We also know that it is possible to have a great puck luck advantage, while having a terrible shooting percentage in the game.\n\nNow, we'll do some player analysis - and I'll be showing both their individual Corsi Rel and scoring chances for percentage with and without the player on the ice.\n\nCortisol Levels (CB)\n\nFor many people, this is the most eye-opening piece of data for them to take away from this data! For years, we've known that low cortisol levels in athletes are associated with a drop in performance in high intensity exercise (such as sprinting or jumping), but this is new data that is showing us that the level of performance (i.e. the performance drop) goes even deeper than we previously thought.\n\nBasically, if we take a player's Corsi Rel, and use that to estimate his total shot attempts for percentage (or C/60), we're going to get a better measure of how well the player performed in relation to his teammates than a Corsi against statistic without the player on the ice. The idea is to see how a player performs when he's not playing with a good chance of improving his team's results (such as having the puck more often than not, or creating shot attempts to replace the ones the other team is giving up).\n\nWhen a player is on the ice, we assume that these Corsi Rel numbers are the result of team possession on his part. As a result, we'll assume that the CB will be higher in a more defensive hockey club than one where offence is more frequently coming from some other source.\n\nLooking at the graphs above, the first player is a very good forward who was very sheltered on his ice time - so in these situations, his teammates were giving him a lot of opportunity and shot attempts. His CB value is higher because his production was better than what his teammates were handing them. The player on the right is a defenseman that had some strong luck on the shot attempts for percentage for the team, but was able to consistently turn those opportunities into good scoring chances for himself. The CB for this player was lower, but he's an all-star level player. While the defensemen are playing against weaker opponents, they're also playing a smaller percentage of their games at even strength.\n\nWhile CF% Rel and CF% Corsi values should be the same for any player, there is variation among individual players. This allows you to start to see how players are affected by their teammates. While the CF% is the same, the CF% Rel varies for every player. The same can be said for CF% Corsi vs. Score% and GF% vs. GA.\n\nThe bottom line is that a player can have a very high player effect where they are playing for a team that is giving them better chances, while also playing for a team that is giving them poorer opportunities and creating fewer chances themselves. While many will argue that this makes them a bad hockey player, that's not really the case - some of them, with a high score effect, are",
      "\nIn this article I'm going to discuss a few ways to go about generating and managing a git repository.\n\nFirst of all, this article isn't about the git command. It's more about using a git submodule.\n\nThe article series covers:\n\nHow to install git-cli\n\nHow to generate a submodule for a project\n\nhow to keep these submodules updated\n\nhow to make your own submodule\n\nhow to commit your own submodule\n\nHow to commit a git submodule\n\nIt gets even bigger than that. I'll be showing you how to use git-receive-pack\n\nI'll also cover how to do the git submodule push\n\nLet's get to it.\n\nInstalling git-cli\n\nFor a new user of git, the easiest way to get started is to use the \"make\" command in the repository root root of your project. This will do everything for us, and we can work in isolation from the rest of the world.\n\nIn this case I downloaded from http://git-scm.com/downloads/ and set up a new virtual directory in it:\n\nmkdir git && cd git\n\nThis will use the git submodule system to allow me to interact with my current directory. Let's call it \"git_root\".\n\nWe'll start off by writing a little script that creates and installs a file called git_root directory.\n\ncp -f git_root.sh git_root && chmod +x git_root.sh\n\n#!/bin/bash mkdir -p /path/to/git/root/ cd /path/to/git/root/\n\nWe're then going to use the mkdir -p option to create three new lines in the /path/to/git/root/.git/hooks/local.example.sh file:\n\nadd-on-hooks: --add-to-local-submodule add-on-hooks: git_root\n\nThis is where we'll install \"git_root\", also called \"submodule\", we created in the submodule section above.\n\nFirst, we'll run make and install it:\n\nmake install clean\n\nThen we'll write our first script:\n\n#!/bin/bash mkdir -p /path/to/git/root/ cd /path/to/git/root/ git submodule init git submodule update --init --recursive && exit\n\nThis will tell the make process to install and configure the submodule. To exit the script with a non-zero exit code we just execute the exit command.\n\nNow the above script won't do the work for us - we need to do that ourselves...\n\nGit using a submodule\n\nIn order to use our submodule, let's first create a directory in our current file system for Git to use. To get the current file path, we must invoke ls command.\n\nThis can be easily accomplished by providing two arguments to \"ls\" like so:\n\nls -l | more -l\n\nThe directory that the ls command lists will be the directory we want to use for Git to store submodules.\n\nNow git can take care of adding the files we wish to our submodule with \"git submodule add\" command.\n\n#!/bin/bash cd /path/to/git/root/.git rm -rf git_root git submodule update --init --recursive && exit\n\nWe now have a submodule for our current file.\n\nFinally, if you want to update the submodule (to keep your files up to date), add the git update command to your \"git submodule add\" script like so:\n\ngit update --init --recursive && exit\n\nNow we can use git submodule info to check if the submodule is up-to-date with our latest copy of our project.\n\n#!/bin/bash ls -l | more -l git submodule info --recursive\n\nIt's just as easy to list out all the files in our submodule by running the following command:\n\ngit submodule ls --recursive\n\nIf for any reason you run into an issue with the submodule or you want to get rid of it from the subdirectory, delete it.\n\nrm -rf git_root\n\nIf you just want to create a new folder named \"git_root\", we can do so with the git submodule init command.\n\ngit submodule init git_root\n\nHow to get your git submodule up to date.\n\nFor each new commit added in our project we should also run git submodule update --init so the submodule is up to date. If we run this command every time we push our changes, our \"git_root\" will grow",
      "This is a story about the relationship between the human mind and science fiction. It begins in the late 1930s, when the science fiction writer Frank Herbert published A Dance with Dragons. Herbert writes in a fictional country of mysterious, ancient ruins called the Land of Always Winter where dragons inhabit large, floating cities that are protected from the cold by magical rings of fire. Dragons are mysterious creatures with many fascinating attributes, and their existence is not in dispute.\n\nA Dance with Dragons tells the tale of Jon Snow, one of the last remaining dragons still living in the North of Westeros. He has only one regret: he cannot fly. His brother, who is also a dragon, gives him a dragon egg in order to help Jon live. Jon tries to raise the egg, but the magic rings that surround the egg keep it from developing and he falls in love with the dragon egg itself.\n\nThe dragon egg grows, and Jon learns to fly. The story takes an unexpected turn when an agent of the Night's Watch, Samwell Tarly of Winterfell, sees the egg grow and realizes it contains a child. He brings the dragon back from the cold and offers to be Jon's guardian.\n\nIn this way, A Dance with Dragons portrays the first great age in the history of fantasy fiction where humans and dragons coexist in a fictional world. The book also introduces new magic in the world and new races. It was widely regarded as one of the best books of its time. However, one writer who hated the book is Stephen R. Donaldson, author of the widely imitated children's poem, \"Dragonflight,\" which is frequently recited in the middle of the night by children in the US. His resentment and hatred for Herbert and the book stems from his deep dislike for the fact that dragons are extinct and the human race has been extinct for a long time.\n\nDonaldson, who was originally a fantasy author, later claimed that the poem is about Herbert's love for dragons and his desire to help save them from extinction, i.e. make them non-existent. As Donaldson wrote in an essay entitled \"Dragonflight,\" \"It was my own desire to create dragons (and the dragon egg) that inspired my poem, and it may give it a deeper meaning than I thought it would.\"\n\nIn A Song of Ice and Fire, a great fantasy epic fantasy novel by George RR Martin, we encounter dragons in a new way. We never see them grow, but in many ways they have a life that is quite distinct from ours, and they help humans. In such a way, dragons and humans interact in a meaningful way that goes beyond the scope of the human mind. I'm going to explore in this article several ways that dragons play a role within the world of the A Song of Ice and Fire series.\n\nHow dragons help us in the story\n\nThe most important lesson we can learn from dragons and from other aspects of fantasy fiction is that what happens to the human world doesn't have to have any lasting effect. Even if the stories were based in real history, humans and dragons can coexist and exist in the world just fine. In fact, it probably would go better if we didn't exist.\n\nWhen writing the story of A Song of Ice and Fire, George RR Martin wanted humans to survive the First Men invasion. He wanted people to have a future, and dragons played an important role in his fantasy world, because they helped people survive the invasion. The First Men invasion also showed how humanity can deal with even massive disaster. It would have been more difficult for humans to survive the Ironborn's assault against them had there been no protective force called the Night's Watch. It seems that we can survive even something as catastrophic as war, warlords and dragon attacks.\n\nThis brings up another important point: we don't need a magical dragon to make our story realistic. Even fictional characters from fiction and other aspects of history are capable of making our world better. It's a point that the writer Stephen King made several times in his blog post, What is the Most Important Thing I Don't Know about the Story? King writes that even fictional characters can make our world a better place:\n\nI find it amazing that in the real world, in 2017, people still discuss \"realism\" or realism to mean that something should follow from, or be more or less realistic. It's almost as if realism is something we're told can't be achieved or that something will always be false. I never want to argue that things shouldn't be realistic in fiction because then it becomes a moral judgment about fiction, but if a writer doesn't work backwards from the facts, but instead tries to make their work seem \"realistic,\" then I say that's fake.\n\nA more subtle way that dragons help us in the story is through metaphor. In the world of A Song of Ice and Fire, magic is an important character: in many stories, magic is presented as a good and a power that needs to",
      "Famous for its distinctive, hard-to-pronounce sound, P-Funk was the most influential funk and jazz band of the 1980s and 90s, and remains one of the top three most beloved musical groups of all time. The group, led by trumpeter James Jamerson and funk guitarist and singer-pianist Sonny Rollins, formed in 1980 in New York City at the behest of producer Clive Davis . The group's name — slang for \"P\" in slang terms — came from the phrase \"pigs in a blanket\"— slang for a large body of people. The group's first full-length album, P-Funk, was released in 1983, and their 1991 album, No More Mr. Nice Guy, marked the group's first Billboard Hot 100 hit.\n\n\nNo More Mr. Nice Guy was the group's seventh top 40 recording, and the first from a member of the group. Rolling Stone listed the album among its greatest tracks of that era . Rolling Stone's \" 100 Greatest Songs of All Time ,\" ranked the album No. 40 in its list of \"The Best of the '80s.\" In 1989, the band appeared on the cover of Rolling Stone and later that year released the compilation P-Funk: The Best Albums of '81.\n\n\nThe band's live shows became an international phenomenon. Beginning in the late 1980s, live albums of classic albums played at venues such as the Forum, Radio City Music Hall, the Fillmore East, Madison Square Garden and New York's Irving Plaza proved influential. P-Funk became a fixture at such shows and became known for its rousing, loud dance-y, dance-rock theatrics.\n\n\nIn 1990, Davis moved to an apartment on Central Park South with the rest of the band. When he died in 1999, he was survived by the P-Funk band, a handful of family members, a few close friends and countless musical influences who passed on wisdom, wisdom gleaned from the band's performances and the experience of being there. The band performed its final concert on October 27, 2000 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles to close an era. During that performance, Jamerson and Rollins dedicated the album to their friend and longtime manager Dennis \"Thumper\" Jones, who died the day before.\n\n\nRollins and Jamerson left the group in the mid-1990s but returned in 2006 to perform with the band as members and to perform on the album P-Funk Forever. They later released the reissued P-Funk album. A live album recorded between 2005 and 2010, No More Mr. Nice Guy Live, featured Rollins and Jamerson alongside a host of other P-Funk artists and musicians. The band was again reconvened in 2010 to record P-Funk Forever 2, and Jamerson left the group for good in 2015.",

But as of July 19, the group will also take a larger role.\n\n\"What has really come as a surprise, really, is that with the help of some very successful entrepreneurs in our community, we are going to be able to offer a full range of care to those who are needing it,\" says co-founder Michael McCarron. \"With all the people involved in the video community, we're going to be able to reach out to hundreds of thousands.\"\n\nThe group also will offer a website for individuals to log on and see what resources are available to them, and to take action.\n\nA $250 donation and a code can get a person enrolled in services such as dental, acupuncture, yoga, massage therapy, weight loss, nutrition counseling and psychological counseling.\n\n\"There's also a lot of support out there and it doesn't have to come from people you know or people who know what you do,\" McCarron explains. \"So, we want to offer people a way in to a community where they can get help.\"\n\nOther videos and resources have become popular.",
      "The new \"The Walking Dead\" will have a lot less blood and guts at Comic-Con on Sunday.\n\nAs AMC announced last month, \"The Walking Dead's\" Steven Yeun will be taking a break. That means the new season will be slightly darker for fans and slightly lighter for creators showrunner Scott Gimple and stars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus.\n\nWhen \"The Walking Dead\" returns in April, Yeun will return in a small role as Rick's best friend and traveling companion, Daryl Dixon. Season 2 has already introduced a new villain, a group of walkers that pose as people, and several new characters, including an FBI SWAT team investigating a \"humanity-killing virus.\"\n\nMTV News sat down with executive producer Scott Gimple at Comic-Con. What did he say about Yeun's absence on the show? \"We've got some things planned with a couple of characters, but there's really very little that we have to show you this year.\"\n\nThere's another way to look at it: The new season will have fewer death scenes.

      "\"I'm not the world's greatest detective\"\n\n-Alfred Hitchcock, 1955\n\nHow did Alfred Hitchcock become a Hollywood legend? And what did he think about?\n\nHitchcock made his first and greatest name on the screen with a string of iconic films, from Vertigo to Dial M for Murder. His most successful and influential film, his first in over 40 years, was the 1953 suspense classic Psycho. This week, we'll delve into Psycho's fascinating and mysterious origin, and it will take us all the way back to 1954. Here is Psycho: The Movie - A Historical Documentary in the Making.\n\nWhat if you took a time capsule from Hitchcock past and set it on the set of Psycho? A time capsule that would tell us how this masterpiece came to be? A time capsule that would explore his relationship with the film and Hollywood itself? The answer, amazingly, is nothing short of fascinating.\n\nAnd if Psycho isn't the definitive interpretation of Hitchcock, that doesn't mean his genius wasn't felt everywhere. Throughout American cinema from the 1940s on, Hitchcock's influence on film has been vast and profound. Hitchcock's films are so influential that not only has his name been incorporated into the design of major buildings throughout the world (such as the Empire State Building), but his iconic black outline has been used and appropriated by a host of films, from The Lion King to the remake of The Thing.\n\nYou could spend an entire year and never see a Hitchcock film again, and yet their influence in film history knows no bounds.\n\nHere's a look back at 20 films influenced by Alfred Hitchcock, including not only classics like Psycho, but classics that might not be so well known. We'll explore a few of Hitchcock's most famous films before we conclude the essay with two of the most underrated films ever made, and then look at two more not-so-obvious Hitchcock influences. We hope you enjoy a walk through this fascinating and colorful cultural history.\n\nThe Psycho Story\n\nHitchcock was born on November 28, 1927 in London. His father, a London solicitor by day, was an avid photographer who shot hundreds of thousands of photos during an annual six-month contract work that enabled him to travel as often as he desired.\n\nBefore Hitchcock had turned 3, his father moved the family to the village of Saffron Walden in the English countryside. Hitchcock attended all-boy Edwardian Montessori school and then became an assistant to a photography assistant working at the local newspaper. As a teenager, Hitchcock attended the local grammar school and then, at the age of 17, enrolled at Ealing College for Boys in London. From there he joined the RAF to work as a photojournalist.\n\nWhen he was 21 years old, Hitchcock married fellow Ealing College student Marion Davies (daughter of writer Robert Fulghum) and lived with her in London before they decided to move to Australia to settle in Australia. Two years after settling in Australia, Hitchcock married a fellow Ealing College student, writer Agnes Varda.\n\nHitchcock's first notable film was Lolita in 1959, a film that would go on to win an Academy Award for Best Picture. Despite that accolade, the public at large reacted poorly to the film. It grossed only about $10 million at the box office. It was widely hailed as a disappointment and a failure, and while this certainly wasn't the intention when Hitchcock wrote-the film was meant as an allegory as much as a critical success.\n\nAs director, Hitchcock was in a period of turmoil. He had just been fired from two of his three previous films while the other two were released in 1964 and 1965. After the director's third screenplay flopped in the eyes of the public, he decided to retreat to the country to write a better script and film-the film he wanted to make.\n\nIt wasn't until his fourth screenplay, The Man Who Knew Too Much, that Hitchcock returned with much higher results. As director, he won several Academy Awards, including his only Filmfare Golden Lion award for his final effort.\n\nThat one win in 1962 still has Hitchcock so depressed that he considers it a career low point. The film was a failure in America, not only making only about half of Hitchcock's projections as a distributor (which is no big deal), but also the most profitable American production of all time.\n\nHitchcock made only two more movies in the subsequent six years (and his last two films in the late 1960's and early 1970's), and then he retired from Hollywood.\n\nDespite the two failed attempts at producing horror classics, Hitchcock has become synonymous with suspense films. Even at age 86, Hitchcock still makes some of his most effective films, such as The Man Who Knew Too Much and The Birds. His greatest contribution, perhaps, of course, has been his influence in filmmaking.\n\nHitchcock's Influence on the American Academy\n\nHitchcock",
      "\nThere is a bit of the new wave to the new age! As I write this, there is yet another wave of '90s kids to have made themselves comfortable in the \"I wish it was a year ago\" category. This means that the next time I see them it will probably be in college. With no idea as to what to do, they tend to spend their time either being socially awkward or making themselves look good to fit in. I, in particular, do this the worst and I apologize in advance. I spend too much time trying to be cool in an ever-changing world. I am looking at you, social media.\n\nWith all due respect (you can say I haven't changed), you guys have an interesting way of making it seem like anything is more important than you actually are. This is actually a great example of something called the \"halo effect,\" according to which people feel the need to justify their social interactions with others, so that eventually they become more motivated by that validation rather than the other way around. This is pretty obvious to most people that are even cognizant, but is often forgotten about by those who are not.\n\nIn other words, I can't wait to meet them one day. Maybe you guys will be there or maybe you won't. But one thing is for sure: my first impression of them after a few seconds on the sidewalk (or whatever the equivalent is) is that they are just as interesting. It's just that I've been so focused on how to not look like a total shithead and have all of you be as interesting as possible throughout the day that I'm having trouble connecting with them on any level, and I definitely don't want to be that asshole looking for a \"friend.\"",

The potion must be within 1st level.\n\nDetailed Walkthrough [ edit ]\n\nThe Potions [ edit ]\n\nDurnehviir's Pot and Pile [ edit ]\n\nNote: As of Patch 1.5, Durnehviir is not the owner of the Durnehviir's Pot and Pile. The owner has left the house, but not the containers themselves. The owner may have been stealing the gold from the house. See \"Durnehviir\" below for more information.\n\nAs you travel from the Temple of Kynareth to Markarth, you are told that there may be a few bottles of Durnehviir's Pot and Pile in the cave near the house.\n\nFind Durnehviir's Home [ edit ]\n\nAs you approach the house, a blacksmith on the street in front of it, will yell at you \"I think I sold that to Durnehviir some time ago.\" Follow the blacksmith to the cave, in the southeast of Markarth. The first section of the cave is fairly narrow, with no enemies in sight. There are some small tables, a bed with bedroll and an ash pile on it, and a container with some gold. You will see some bandits in addition to these containers.\n\nNext, you'll go through an opening at the bottom of the cave to enter the second section. On a raised platform in the center of this section, a table in front of you holds a Durnehviir's Potion of Health, a bottle of gold, and two samples of Durnehviir's Poison. The poison should be marked \"Durnehviir's Poison (x=450, y=500). The potion is marked \"Durnehviir's Poison (x=200, y=300).\" If you wish, you can drop the potion on the table and pick it up again to re-use it. The potion will be marked \"Durnehviir's Potion\" on your map. After you pick it up, continue forward into the next section of the cave. You will now find a room to the south with a few beds and a table that holds a Dwarven War Axe. Another table in the room holds a sample of Orcish Battle Axe and a sample of Dwarven Battle Axe, each marked with a sample of Orcish War Axe. A large chest in the middle of the room holds two more Orcish Battle Axes and a copy of a Potions of Superior Healing (which you probably don't want to mess around with now). There is also a locked chest at the end of the room, containing a sample of Dwarven War Hammer and another Orcish Battle Axe. There is a small tunnel leading to the west with another sample of Dwarven Battle Axe and an alcove containing a sample of Dwarven War Hammer.\n\nAt the end of the tunnel is a dead-end section of the cave with another small room to the south containing three benches, two chairs, two barrels, and a table. On the tables in this room are two Dwarven Battle Axes, and two bottles of Durnehviir's Poison, each marked with a sample of Orcish Battle Axe. Across the room from the two chests you can drop a sample of Orcish Battle Axe on to the table to pick it up again, and keep the potion. The chest to the south holds more Orcish Battle Axes and a random potion.\n\nYou are now ready to continue onward. Once you have moved along, be sure that you turn off your map, as you'll need to return to the Durnehviir House.\n\nFinding Durnehviir [ edit ]\n\nHead down another tunnel, through a passage and into a large room with a large statue and a locked cage on two of the walls. There is an Unrelenting Force spell on a table in the eastern corner of this room. You can drop the potion from the cage and pick the cage, and from the cage drop it back into the cage. Then, use your pickpocket skill. Once done, you can take the container the cage contains. There are also two potions on the table, one a Potion of",
      "\"He's going to do what the president does best of late, which is to bring his family to the White House,\" said Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist and an informal adviser to Mr. Trump's transition team who has been deeply critical of the president during his primary campaign. \"He has to have something of value to talk about. It's going to be a lot better than a bunch of speeches about his election.\"\n\nBut Mr. Trump's comments in front of the group of military commanders, many of whom he called heroes, suggest that a message about unity, and the need to build relationships with the military, is at stake.\n\n\"Thank you, everybody,\" Mr. Trump said to applause. \"We have to show the world, Europe, and the whole world that we are strong, we are great, we are safe, we are prosperous, and we will take care of our vets like they've never been taken care of before. Thank you.\"\n\nMr. Trump's speech on Wednesday was clearly intended to signal his shift toward a more military-friendly posture, and it ended much the way he started: with an invitation to his audience to enlist in the military. His decision was first reported by the Associated Press.\n\nThe president did not take questions from the crowd, as he often does. Asked whether he expected to receive a positive recommendation from the Pentagon, Mr. Trump replied, \"Oh, I think they're going to want it, but I can't tell you that for sure.\"\n\nThe meeting ended with a standing ovation, a reflection of the deep confidence Mr. Trump expressed about his military advisers' judgment. His staff had said as much in the days before, saying that the president would consider the advice of the generals even without any formal meeting of the chiefs of staff, who typically receive regular briefings.",

      "In February of 2011, The New York Times reported on a study by University of Michigan researchers looking at how many people were dying of heart attacks as opposed to strokes and heart disease. The survey indicated that, from 1978 to 2006, heart attacks resulted in more than 600,000 deaths per year.\n\nNow a study out of University of Alabama-Birmingham shows that, from 2004 to 2007, deaths by heart attack in the U.S. increased by more than 300 percent. That's a large increase.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately 12.9 million Americans, or 24 percent of adults, suffer from cardiovascular diseases, which include heart attacks and heart failure. The risk for the latter is considered high.\n\nThis new study also indicates that death rates from heart attacks and other cardiovascular disease declined by more than 10 million since 1999.\n\nThe CDC report shows that more than half of all deaths in the U.S. were due to cardiovascular diseases in 2013.\n\nThis is a big deal, especially considering the fact that cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the U.S.\n\nIn this article, you will learn what causes cardiovascular disease, why it's important to make a change in your life, and then how you can achieve a healthier lifestyle to reduce your risk of heart disease, your risk of death from heart disease, and to save your family and loved ones.\n\nWhat Causes Heart Disease?\n\nIn short, cardiac disease, or heart disease, is caused by the buildup of plaque within a particular area of the heart – the coronary arteries. It's caused by a variety of factors, including high blood pressure, cholesterol, and diabetes. These factors can increase the risk of heart disease in a number of ways.\n\nYou are also susceptible to having heart disease if you have other diseases that predispose you to cardiovascular disease. This is why, for example, the development of a heart attack is more frequently linked to a family pattern or shared characteristics between two people. You can read about these shared risk factors in a previous articles entitled: What are the Top 3 Common Correlates of Heart Disease and Cancer?\n\nThe number of heart attacks increases in direct proportion to the number of people who have heart disease.\n\nHeart disease is the #1 cause of death due to cardiovascular disease. This is a significant change; previously, in 2014, cardiovascular disease was leading cause of death. If the new mortality study from University of Alabama-Birmingham was representative of the entire population of the United States, we could potentially expect to see 600,000 additional deaths per year.\n\nThis suggests that, in the U.S., death by heart attack is a significant health issue – in our aging population, heart disease accounts for 10 percent of hospital deaths.\n\nIn addition, heart disease is responsible for 80 percent of premature deaths, so cardiovascular disease also accounts for an inordinate amount of lost productivity. For example, researchers from the American Heart Association found that cardiovascular disease contributes to the development of the first 7 symptoms that cause symptoms of heart disease: upper back pain, chest pain, shortness of breath, shortness of breath due to chest pain, chest discomfort, shortness of breath due to coughing, and shortness of breath due to anxiety.\n\nWhy Has Heart Disease Increased?\n\nThis increase in heart disease deaths was associated with two things:\n\nA decrease in overall mortality, which is good.\n\nA decrease in the number of patients who had cardiometabolic complications (heart failure, myocardial infarction, or stroke).\n\nCardiometabolic complications are those conditions which affect your heart.\n\nHeart Failure: One-third of American adults suffer from heart failure, a condition in which the heart is no longer able to pump blood to the body efficiently, resulting in low blood flow.\n\nA heart failure is often related to a build up of fatty deposits (lipids, plasma, and especially platelets) in the heart muscle. These build-up is a condition referred to as atherosclerosis, or hardened plaque. Fatty deposits block the flow of blood, but are not toxic in low-to-moderate amounts. When the cells that surround our heart start to die off because they can no longer perform their function effectively, these deposits are left behind. Once that happens, a heart failure is set in motion.\n\nThe disease is considered more common in people with diabetes.\n\nThe number of deaths from heart failure rose from 0.12 per 100,000 in 1997 to 0.28 per 100,000 in 2007, which suggests that rates remain relatively static.\n\nOne study published in the journal Circulation in 2007 compared blood tests to see how people's cholesterol, LDL-C, and triglycerides were changing over time. The study found that overall rates of heart disease had increased in the U.S. between 1972 and 1998. While the rates had decreased between 1998 and 2008, the increase between",
      "The US Navy has was planning to install a new generation of cruise missiles, capable of carrying an actual warhead, on aircraft carriers over the next five years.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, the development is being delayed by a year, following the embarrassing failure of a missile system from the first stage on the USS Michael Monsoor.\n\nThe Navy originally planned to deliver a total of eight of the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air (AMRAAM) missiles to its Nimitz class carriers by 2019.\n\nHowever, the missiles failed to fire from the test platform in a sea trials at Naval Air Station Long Beach, California in October, according to USNI News.\n\nA second missile failed during launch in a separate test in November, leading to an additional delay.\n\nA US Navy spokesman told Jane's Fighting Ships that a \"systems engineering delay\" was being taken into account while the Navy works on a possible solution for the problem.\n\nIt also confirmed that the missiles are still in development, with \"nothing\" imminent at present, according to a Navy statement.\n\nThe delay is not a serious issue, according to Navy experts, however.\n\n\"They're just trying to figure out the kinks,\" Robert Manning, programme director of the Center for Naval Analyses' Integrated Warfare Program, told USNI News.\n\n\"The Navy likes to build these missiles as close to flight-ready as they can, and the system has a lot of testing and training ahead of it. I don't think it's going to be a long-term thing.\n\nThe AMRAAM can operate from short, medium or long ranges.\n\nFor the test firings, the US Navy launched two missiles from the USS George Wash, a cruiser with a range of around 230 nautical miles.\n\nTwo other missiles were fired from the USS Carl Vinson aircraft carrier, which is armed with the same guided missile system.\n\nThe Navy and Lockheed Martin, which developed the system and which is the prime contractor for the system, did not comment on the issue.\n\nREAD MORE: US Navy's new guided missiles fail in tests, 'cause for concern'\n\nWhile the US and other countries use cruise missiles to attack surface ships, the US Navy has also recently begun testing its potential long-range air-to-surface missiles.\n\nLast month, the US deployed a new air-to-surface missile called the Paveway II.\n\nThe missile can take out hardened targets as far as 2,200 miles away, according to Lockheed Martin.\n\nBut the Paveway II's high flying speed and capability of carrying an actual nuclear warhead may raise concerns among policymakers, particularly those in the US, whose allies are not pleased over the deployment of the system to Europe.\n\nIn July alone, Russia shot down a US reconnaissance drone over the country's own airspace, amid a heated debate about China's increasing military presence in the Western Pacific.\n\nChinese government officials have defended the country's right to patrol US airspace, including airspace over the South China Sea, saying Beijing is protecting its sovereignty.\n\nChina has accused the US of using the deployment of cruise missiles in its naval deployment in the Western Pacific as a \"serious provocation.\"",
      "A team of researchers from McGill University and Canada's Memorial University have developed a new technique for the detection and classification of bacterial DNA after screening more than 500 samples for the presence of a particular DNA pattern called plasmid.\n\nA plasmid is a short DNA sequence that functions as a \"carrier\" for a DNA genetic \"packet.\"\n\nUsing this genetic payload, a plasmid can carry information between the bacterium that encoded it and a nearby plasmid, or bacterial cell, in a way that allows for the transfer of genetic payloads like viral genes, among various species, said Peter Halkjaer, an associate professor in the Montreal Neurological Institute who is co-author on the paper that was published in PLOS Genetics.\n\n\"If we find this kind of bacterial DNA in a sample, we then know for sure that it came from the bacterium that is the carrier,\" Halkjaer said. \"It's the difference between a person giving you a letter of a cheque or you giving a cheque to the person and knowing the person wants it.\"\n\nPlant pathogen causes cancer\n\nThe finding highlights the importance of microbiology, Halkjaer said, in an area that has been neglected for many years. In the 1950s, studies in plant biology led to the discovery of the bacteria that infect plants called yeasts, the researchers noted. Many plant pathogens are known from this research.\n\nAfter sequencing the DNA, the researchers found the distinctive plasmid pattern in almost 500 of the 600 bacterial samples. The discovery led to the creation of a database of human bacterial plasmids that can provide an invaluable glimpse of what bacteria are found where.\n\n\"If we can detect the plasmid in an infected plant, we know that this particular plant is probably infected by this bacterium. This information will make our work a lot easier,\" said Paul Stacey, a postdoctoral researcher in Halkjaer's lab.\n\n\"There would have been many more problems in detecting these pathogens in the '60s and '70s had these scientists not been looking at plants,\" he said. \"What was really remarkable in this study is the discovery of a universal microbial pattern.\"\n\nBacteria are common\n\nMost living bacteria are bacterial pathogens that can cause disease in humans as well as in other mammals. But more than 60 per cent of bacteria found in soil are non-pathogenic, non-cancerous bacteria that are essential for supporting the ecosystems that host our bodies. They also protect the environment and other organisms from disease.\n\nPlant pathogen and bacteria are found all around the world including on plants. Scientists have been wondering for sometime if they could find a way to identify bacteria on plants and whether those bacteria also can infect other plants and cause disease, Halkjaer said.\n\n\"Plant pathogens have always been under the radar because they're so rare in plant ecosystems,\" he said. \"You rarely see them in the field. The question was, can you find them on the field as well? We discovered that in this study, yes, you can indeed detect plasmids on plants and other plants.\"\n\nOther collaborators on the research included Michael Vaudreuil at The Centre of Applied Biotechnology at the University of Neuchâtel and the Netherlands Research Council Center of Excellence, the University of British Columbia and the Canadian Centre for Microbial Genomics.\n\nThe research was funded by the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council and the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada.",
      "\n\"The fact is when people are going to be given this choice it has to be the most affordable choice. And the fact is this has been a very, very good deal for a small group who is trying to take advantage of the people who really need insurance. And it's still not perfect.\"\n\n— Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius' interview with ABC's George Stephanopoulos, Aug. 1, 2010\n\nStephanopoulos posed two questions aimed at Sebelius: Does she think the law's premium subsidies are fair, and if so, to what extent should government subsidize insurance premiums?\n\nSebelius responded that some would see premiums as too high if they could not afford coverage, but that was not what is at the root of the ongoing insurance law debate.\n\nFact check: In a word, yes.\n\nSebelius' claim that the average health insurance premium is rising because of the law's subsidies has been widely debunked. In fact, it has been debunked many times, and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services has said it is outdated and misleading. And as a recent article by PolitiFact Georgia pointed out, the premium increases are falling. (That was true in 2009 as well.)\n\nNevertheless, Sebelius has stuck to this talking point.\n\nHow We Did the Research\n\nOur rating\n\nStephanopoulos told Sebelius the average health insurance premium increase in 2010 was not because of the Affordable Care Act, but because people in some states \"aren't ready for this. They might have the money to buy it but they just haven't learned how to use it.\" PolitiFact Georgia has looked at the issue and found that Sebelius is on target.\n\nBut there is no dispute that Sebelius is in a tough spot. With premiums rising faster than expected, millions of Americans are looking for cheaper options and the law has helped some.\n\nThat said, most of these subsidies are coming from taxpayers, not consumers. And many consumers have no reason to believe the amount of subsidies they are receiving is going to increase even more.\n\nSebelius got it wrong; we rate it Mostly False.",
      "A lot of people have asked me what kind of system I use. I've used a variety of platforms: Windows, Linux, Mac OSX and more. Here's how I have setup my computer to be able to run everything I can handle.\n\nI can't stress enough that this guide is for the absolute most modern of laptops. It's not necessarily going towards laptops from 10 years ago; however, you can easily find a laptop that meets or overcomes my requirements. I'm going to give you a full breakdown of all my system specs to ensure that you can achieve the best running experience. But the good news is that every system can be configured to run Ubuntu.\n\nCPU\n\nMy hardware is a 3rd Gen Intel Core i7-3520M. This is the newest i7 CPU out there. What this means for me is that I can run all my favorite games and programs which utilize a lot of cores.\n\nSince the newest versions of Photoshop, Illustrator, Lightroom, etc. are designed to use up to 6 cores, I need at least 6 CPU cores on my machine. That doesn't mean that the operating systems require an 8-core processor. They do however require more core than the 3-core CPU I have. So you can run Photoshop, Photoshop CS5, Illustrator, Illustrator CS5, etc. The advantage of having a 6-core CPU is that you can have 3 separate apps running simultaneously. In comparison, a 2-core CPU will only run one app at a time.\n\nRAM\n\nAs you know, I have a 16GB RAM. RAM is the most important component you can add to your laptop. Without a big enough amount of RAM, you won't be able to keep up with your games and programs. In fact, I run my OS on my desktop, which I have also installed a SSD-less drive in my machine. I have plenty of RAM to keep my games running and you also can add two gigs by making sure that you are running the latest version of Windows (Windows XP SP3 or later).\n\nIn closing\n\nThere are several parts to consider when buying a laptop. You can spend a lot more money and get a better device, but won't be able to run everything that you would like. If you are shopping around, I encourage that you spend the money and get a good laptop. I have spent a bit less than $1000 on my system.",
      "In the late 1990s, I was having a drink with John Ritzheimer, the Arizona-based leader of the American-born separatist movement, which is trying to make the US a \"Celtic nation\" that includes Utah and most of Arizona. He had just returned from a pilgrimage to the city's holiest place, the Báb's mausoleum, where he read the first few verses of the Koran (\"There is no God but God.\"). Ritzheimer showed me the stone cauldron from which he'd brought his cuppa. \"It was his choice to burn the Koran,\" he said at that moment.\n\nRitzheimer, who is now in his 60s, made his name in 2003 when he and a group of anti-Muslim white supremacists, including his brother, were acquitted of all charges in connection with the deadly shooting of two police officers. But he's much more famous now for his hate-fueled, \"draw Muhammad\" campaign. He and his allies call for the execution of every \"Muslim terrorist\" who comes to this country from their native countries. They also call for all Muslims to be banned from entering the US under a plan they call a \"total ban\" or, in its harshest iteration, a \"Jihadist Islamic state,\" or IS — and for anyone who dares defy it to their face, the police and FBI will kill them dead.\n\nThis has been a staple of the right-wing anti-Islamic movement for more than a decade; there are now three main strains. First, there's the \"jihadist Islamic state\" version. Second, there's another version focused on Muslims killing non-Muslims in the name of Islam. Third, there is the non-Islamist version that is far less extreme, although it still considers some American Muslims radical. The third kind has had a long history in right-wing think tanks, often with a connection to the far-right Norwegian terrorist Anders Breivik — although the idea of a Norwegian Breivik is a stretch. These ideas got a big boost last May, when President Donald Trump announced that his administration would be taking a more hard line, and last month, when he signed an executive order temporarily banning immigrants from several Muslim-majority countries for 90 days, all of which will now be implemented. Many on the right have condemned the action, but they're not the only ones.\n\nRitzheimer is a man who knows a thing or two about hate. He was the organizer of a rally protesting at the 2008 Democratic national convention in Denver and also helped lead anti-Muslim rallies in Arizona and Colorado, often in the shadow of the mosque. He told me that he and his people will continue to organize until their goals, including the elimination of \"terrorism\" and \"jihadism\" everywhere, are met. We talked about the current wave of Islamophobia and the threat it represents. Below is a lightly edited version of our conversation.\n\nJI: The backlash against Muslim Americans has been going on for a long time. You've been involved for nearly 30 years. What is the current iteration of that?\n\nJR: For most of my life, since the early 1970s, you had a very strong right-wing nationalist movement in the United States, and you had a very well-funded movement that was dedicated to preventing immigrants coming into America. If anybody has been able to defeat Islamophobia in this country for over 30 years, I know we've still got a long way to go. The people who are the most vocal about it are the people who have the money and the power and people are scared to talk about what's wrong with the American Muslim and immigrant society.\n\nJI: As an example, I would love to talk to you about the case of Akayed Ullah, the Bangladeshi man who was killed in New York. Is it fair to say that right-wing anti-Muslim groups were behind that?\n\nJR: For years, Akayed's family was a victim of a campaign of bigotry for not talking about Islam and not doing all the right things. That's not their fault. It's been a long history of anti-Muslim bigotry and Islamophobia. You could argue that the anti-Islam movement in this country started much earlier than 9/11.\n\nBut I have to say, in this era of political correctness where everything is about sensitivity, and everyone thinks they are being an anti-racist, they're not. If you just say \"There is no Allah\" and nobody even bats an eye, we know who's behind this. They want to silence Muslim Americans, to silence the debate about Islam, and to silence everyone who dares to be different.\n\nJI: There's been a big push for a \"Trump Effect\" since Trump took office.

Enterprise, a symbol of American power.\n\nContents show]\n\nService history Edit\n\nAlthough the Enterprise, along with many other U.S.S. vessels, was commissioned in 2161, most of the original Constitution-class design did not enter service until 2265 and 2267 respectively (although some of its components went into service as late as the year 2378).\n\nOne of the first new ships to enter space in 2265, the U.S.S. San Francisco was seen in a holographic simulation for the first time over a decade after the first Constitution-class starship. (TNG: \"Encounter at Farpoint\")\n\nSeveral new models of Constitution-class ships were in service from 2275 to 2999. (TNG: \"The Arsenal of Freedom\") In 2344, the Enterprise-D and U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701-D were upgraded and took their place on the new Defiant class starship. (DS9: \"The Way of the Warrior\")\n\nOne month later, Starfleet commissioned their newest Constitution-class starship, the USS Enterprise-E. (Star Trek: First Contact)\n\nAppendices Edit\n\nBackground information Edit\n\nThe design of the original Constitution-class vessel was devised by Richard James Morton and was developed alongside the production of the first two Star Trek films in the late-1960s. The design was initially approved by Production Designer Herman Zimmerman in the late-1960s but did not reach final approval until early-to-mid 1970s. When the design was finalized for filming, it differed in several key areas from the final version created by Herman Zimmerman and Michael Okuda, including the saucer section – which was larger than originally envisioned – and an unfinished nacelle section that would have added to the ship's overall length, as well as an overhanging, two-level \"broom wing\" in the nacelle section, due to the production's decision to trim the length of the saucer so that the ship could be filmed and filmed on the studio lot rather than have the ship filmed with full effects. As a result of the production team's decision to shoot on the studio lot, however, many of the original studio model components for the Enterprise-D and the U.S.S. Enterprise had been lost and only limited access was given to the model shop during the shoot. The newly constructed set for the USS Enterprise had access to all the original studio model elements from the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture.\n\nThe original design also differed in that it was to carry two phasers along its aft warp nacelle, a modification made solely for the third season episode \"Star Trek III\", which featured a flashback to one of the original film's most famous set pieces (an encounter between the U.S.S. Enterprise and Klingon Bird-of-Prey), and it was ultimately decided the Enterprise-E would not be upgraded to carry phasers as seen in Star Trek: Generations.\n\n\"Star Trek III\" was also a significant reason for adding new warp nacelles to the Constitution-class for that episode. In that episode (and all later productions), the nacelles of a Constitution-class starship were made of a light alloy and had no internal workings. It was only when the light alloy was replaced with the darker alloy (made to match the original nacelle structure) in 2266, that new phaser banks could be integrated. The replacement phaser banks were not featured in any Star Trek television production from that period. (Star Trek Encyclopedia (4th ed., vol. 1, p. 242))\n\nThe original design was retained from the first draft script of Star Trek: The Motion Picture to the end of production and the final version of the film – which was also the final production model – was built with that design. It was used for a number of filming elements from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, in addition to the set for the USS Enterprise in \"First Contact\", and the model was also seen in a number of stills from Star Trek: The Motion Picture, in addition to the film being referenced in the final draft of \"The Child\". (Star Trek: The Magazine Volume 1, Issue 13, p. 44) However, the last use of the original design came in \"Contagion\" during the destruction of the Constitution-class USS Enterprise:\n\nThe Enterprise-E saucer is revealed as a large warp nacelle in the shot from the main viewscreen at right.\n\nThis is actually the saucer of the Sovereign-class starship, which was destroyed in the same episode, with the Enterprise-E as the missing nacelle.\n\nAs a result of the USS Enterprise-E's destruction,",

      "1. No. 6: Michael J. Fox\n\nThe former teen heartthrob (and Oscar winner) has some serious movie cred, starting with this 1991 movie. It won a few awards for stars Michael J. Fox and Danny Glover, but Fox's performance wasn't the talk of the town. He was a supporting character in the movie, but he had some amazing lines in the film, including \"I know your name is Will and you can't stop me.\" Afterward Fox said, \"I was just one of these movie stars who can't take any time off. We had to make a movie so fast, it was impossible for me to have downtime,\" he later explained. Fox was a fan of the Fox and Dale character, too, which is why he was great as a cameo in the 1980 movie \"Bad Boys and a Little Hell.\" (Watch it here.)\n\nBut back to \"Pootie Tang.\" Fox was a major talent even before he had the mumps on top of his throat that almost killed him in 2000. As he told \"Entertainment Tonight\": \"I was very active in the acting community. The mumps didn't happen overnight. [Before that] it was called glandular fever, but then it went viral. It was a terrible, terrible thing. We are always looking for an excuse to put a mumps outbreak of some kind out there.\" So that's another reason the character of Pootie Tang was so important to Fox.\n\n2. No. 5: Muppets\n\nAt this point in the \"Frozen\" franchise, \"Muppets\" already boasts a series of great sequels, but the first, which opened in theaters in 2013, was particularly amazing. In it, Frozen's Anna (Isabella Rossellini) and Elsa (Idina Menzel) get back together, and they fall in love immediately with each other. But it turns out they aren't compatible and go through a huge breakup. But instead of being in the \"Frozen\" storyline, this was one of the scenes the most important to the movie. \"It was so important to the story to say that this woman loves a man and so he doesn't love her back at first,\" director Chris Buck told Entertainment Weekly. It worked because the movie has a love triangle of its own and a major theme about love versus the desire for friendship.\n\n\"When Anna fell in love with her sister Elsa, everyone thought it would go great,\" said Rossellini about the breakup. \"The moment Anna realized, 'Oh boy, this is not going to work out,' she was devastated by it, but at the same time also very determined. She didn't quit on anyone, or the movie. And I love that because it shows her tenacity, strength and intelligence that she's overcome.\" After their breakup, Elsa left Elsa to search for a home for herself. Meanwhile, Anna and Kristoff look for the truth about Elsa's sister, Anna's parents, and they get help from the snowman Olaf (Kristoff Stafstrom), who ends up becoming one of the movies most beloved characters. It's also where \"Muppets Most Wanted\" star Bobby Moynihan got his first career leading role.\n\n3. No. 4: Robin Williams\n\nIn a way, Robin Williams, now 84, was always a fan of \"Beauty and the Beast.\" (He was a writer on the original screen adaptation of the \"Beauty and the Beast.\") He talked about it in a 2003 interview with Stephen Colbert and \"Funny People\" star Zach Galifianakis. \"If you had a time machine and could turn back 50 years, you'd go and see 'Beauty and the Beast,' right after 'Django.'\" Williams went on to say: \"I always say that it doesn't hold up very well, it's just a terrible story. But it didn't matter, it still was good. So you were right, we had a better story, though it took place 50 years later.\"\n\nWilliams was also a big part of the Broadway production, along with the likes of Danny DeVito, Judy Davis, James Earl Jones and Tim Curry, while he won an Oscar for the performance of Maleficent in \"The Princess Bride.\" In fact, both plays were adapted for the silver screen by \"Beauty and the Beast's\" Tony-winning director Bill Condon.\n\n\"The show's magic was in its very simplicity, and it was its perfect balance, in my opinion,\" he said. \"We all felt we were the actors, just the characters. And that's always the way it was at Disney. It really is the same feeling in every film,\" he later added. \"We all just played the roles, and we had an enormous amount of fun doing it, not a lot of money had ever been invested.\" Williams got to play the lead male character in the new sequel, too, which was a favorite of his.",
      "Kurt Schmoke was in the right place at the right time to make the right play with a big block on a goal against the Chicago Fire.\n\n\nThe Columbus Crew won the Game 3 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals with a 2-1 victory over the Chicago Fire on Saturday night. With the victory, the Crew moves head-to-head record to 3-2 against the Fire in the postseason.\n\n\nThe play started with just seconds left in the first half when a loose ball went into the box. After midfielder Alex Crognale was brought down by defender Brandon Vincent, the Fire were given a penalty kick to make the score 2-0.\n\n\nHere's a look at the play:\n\n\nAs with any other play, there are times when a defender or goalkeeper makes a great save and a good run by another team can result in a goal. But there are times when defenders or goalkeeper make good blocks that the attackers fail to score.\n\nSchmoke's block on a goal was certainly the latter. After a long run by midfielder Pedro Santos, the ball came to Schmoke on the left side of the field.\n\n\nAs you can see in the second video, Schmoke stayed on his feet after Santos' initial run. He was able to keep his balance and block the shot before getting up and going all the way to the goal line.\n\n\nAfter the shot blocked from the edge of the 18-yard box, Schmoke was able to run back to the area for the assist.\n\nThe assist on the Crew's second goal also took place in the 18-yard box. Santos was able to slide a pass to Crew midfielder Ethan Finlay just outside of the 18-yard box but Schmoke was able to get a hold of the play and get his hands on it to get a shot on goal.\n\nThe assist on Finlay's goal was also just a block and not an assist.\n\nSchmoke was named to the MLS All-Star team in 2011. He will look to continue his postseason contributions in the next couple of games in the Conference Finals.\n\nThe Game 2 win is the first one the Crew has gotten against the Fire in the playoffs. With two straight wins over the Chicago Fire this postseason, the Crew looks to advance once again to the Eastern Conference Finals. Chicago will host the third and final meeting of the Eastern Conference Finals on Wednesday night.",

The Flames will look to gain valuable points in the playoff race and will need to rely on goaltending to save them. That's a tall task at the moment and any points the Flames can get will be the result from the stellar goaltending provided by Karri Ramo.\n\nProjected Starting Goaltenders\n\nKarri Ramo – 39 GP, 5-6-0, 2.57 GAA, .906 SV%, 3 SO, 12 PTS\n\nJake Allen – 22 GP, 3-3-0, 2.67 GAA, .920 SV%, 14 PTS\n\nDavid Rittich – 6 GP, 1-1-0, 0.75 GAA, .908 SV%\n\nInjuries are going to be a factor in the Flames season. Jonas Hiller and Michael Ferland will both go down for varying lengths of time with injuries.

However, the Blues are going to be tested as they are still without the services of Paul Stastny. He is likely to miss the start of the season and will be replaced by Dmitrij Jaskin.

With the return of Jaskin, I think Allen will make it out of this mess.\n\nOttawa Senators\n\nOttawa is in first place in the Atlantic Division and look to be in great shape going into this off-season.

      "In a statement on Sunday, US state department spokesman John Kirby said that the US \"has determined that the Syrian government carried out the chemical weapons attack.\"\n\n\nHowever, he added, \"We believe that the responsibility for the chemical attack in Syria resides with the Assad regime and that the United States is prepared to provide assistance to those seeking to relieve the suffering of the Syrian people.\"\n\nKirby said it was too early to know whether the weapons used in the attack had been delivered by Syria's air force. However, he added, the US assessed with \"high confidence\" that chemical weapons were employed on August 21.\n\n\nThe UN team had \"concluded beyond reasonable doubt that the Syrian government conducted a chemical weapons attack,\" Kirby said. \"It has confirmed that the chemical was a nerve agent, consistent with its practice.\"\n\nIn another development on Monday, US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel said the alleged Syrian chemical weapons use amounted to \"a war crime.\"\n\nHowever, he added, an attack did not seem to have a military component.\n\n\"We do not believe that this gas attack can be attributed to the regime of President Assad, and we believe they would regret it,\" Hagel told a briefing in Washington. Assad \"is killing his own people and hurting his own people\" by using chemical weapons, Hagel added.\n\nHagel noted that the US military has taken \"immediate action\" to bolster the defensive capabilities of Nato allies against any similar threat.\n\nHe added, however, that the US is still awaiting confirmation, from Russia and Assad's government, that the Syrian chemical arsenal in its current configuration was used in an attack.\n\n\"If there had been anything else going on that we could determine, but we don't have any additional information to provide at this point, then certainly we will look into that to determine what was done in Syria, where,\" Hagel said.\n\nKirby warned that the US is keeping a wide berth on the issue of military options.\n\nThe spokesman said the US is \"considering carefully\" a range of possible military responses to a new chemical attack in Syria, but he made no mention of the possibility of any direct intervention on Russia's or Assad's behalf.\n\nHe added that the US is keeping a \"wide berth\" when it comes to potential intervention in a dispute within the Syrian opposition, between moderate and extremist groups.\n\nKirby also confirmed that President Barack Obama had personally approved the strike.\n\nHe added that the use of the gas can often trigger a response from Russia and China's leaders, even if it is carried out by al Qaeda militants, and suggested the US may also seek such a response in case Assad's forces were targeting its intelligence assets.\n\nObama has vowed that \"any country that uses chemical weapons\" will be held accountable. Kirby said the US did not have \"sufficient information\" yet to make any firm determination either way on who was to blame.\n\nAlthough the US has had military targets identified for weeks in opposition territory in the outskirts of the Syrian capital Damascus, it has yet to move any aircraft or bombers there.",

Tuvok arrives, asking T'Pel to open the main hatch. When T'Pel asks who is watching them, she states that the only person with a computer is Tuvok, and that the security officers are looking through it for her. T'Pel states that she did not mean to eavesdrop and that she's just trying to make sure that everything is running smoothly. When the security officers realize that she is watching them, she reveals she has a computer, but she only downloaded the database of some other ship recently and doesn't know what it could reveal. When the security officers try to enter the ship, Tuvok stops them and states that it is a trap, and T'Pel can't enter. They go on board the ship and Tuvok checks the computer.\n\nAct One Edit\n\nKirk, Spock, Scott, and Chekov are taking a tour of the vessel when an angry Vulcan says that the Enterprise crew is \"an embarrassment to your race.\" They continue on with some Starfleet officers, including the new Vulcan High Command, and Kirk explains to T'Pel about her relationship with the High Command. She is offended and orders the others off the ship with two officers. She tells Kirk he has insulted the High Command, and says their entire purpose is to be outcasts. When the other crewmembers enter T'Pel finds her husband sitting at a round table having a private conversation with a woman.\n\nSuddenly T'Pel is attacked and she has to help her husband out of the way of two guards. She and her husband are escorted to a cell and she is questioned. She is forced to tell them that the information she downloaded was about a vessel that had visited the Beta Quadrant, and that it was destroyed by the Klingons and not the Dominion.\n\nAct Two Edit\n\nT'Pel refuses to let the guards search her and takes her bat'leth off her table and hides it in her jacket. When T'Pol asks her where the bat'leth is, she responds that it is hers to take when she is in need of it. Kirk demands to know where the bat'leth is being kept. T'Pel responds that it is in the brig and that they can go back when he is not looking. Kirk tells the guards not to touch her and threatens to break the guards' legs. T'Pel tries to stop him, but is restrained and leaves the cell through an airlock. Kirk takes her bat'leth while T'Pol is stunned by the security guards.\n\nKirk brings T'Pel back to the brig through the airlock and they discuss the plan to retrieve the Enterprise from the Jem'Hadar ship using phasers. He asks \"Do you know the warp core from your cell?\" T'Pel says she was in her cell for three years, and now she says she has the memory of a bird, and asks what would happen if she died.\n\nWhile Kirk is in the brig, T'Pol continues to resist the security officers and says they are threatening her. When one of the officers points his phaser rifle in her direction, she tells him to aim for someone else. Before he can shoot her a blast hits her and she collapses.

She says that the crew is making fun of her. The officers tell her, \"Go back to your cell. We'll see you tomorrow.\" T'Pel says that they can't let her be out there alone, and she wants to go see Kirk herself. Kirk says they have no place for her to go, and that she will not leave on her own.

      "The U.S. State Department on Tuesday reiterated that a Palestinian unity government with Hamas was an obstacle to peace as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke at the Brookings Institution in Washington. Photo: AP\n\nWASHINGTON—The United States warned Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday that his country must act to prevent Palestinians from declaring statehood under U.N. auspices at an upcoming referendum if it wants to continue a peace process.\n\nUnder the circumstances, Mr. Netanyahu, said, Israel will have to determine how it would react, \"whether it will be constructive or counterproductive,\" to the referendum, as it seeks to win support for the deal President Barack Obama reached with the Republican-majority Congress.\n\nMrs. Clinton, speaking at a Brookings Institution forum on Middle East security, also told the audience that the Israeli-Palestinian peace process had failed. \"The Palestinians have a right to self-determination. And, unfortunately, that right is not being recognized in Israel,\" she said.\n\nThe comment marked a striking departure from a message that the Obama administration has delivered repeatedly in recent years. The Palestinian Authority is the U.N.'s chief observer in the Middle East, an important step in the two nations' ability to work together to bring an end to a six-decades-old conflict in which more than 1.5 million people have been killed.\n\nStill, Mr. Netanyahu, who has been among those calling for the recognition of Palestinian statehood, has complained that the Palestinians are unfairly singled out. His government has also called for a review of the U.N.'s role in the peace process.\n\nPalestinians in the West Bank voted in January to ratify the U.N.-backed process and create a Palestinian state. The U.S. had been expected to block the move at the Security Council, but U.S. officials have said they are now working to ensure no such action occurs.\n\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said the vote would mark the \"birth and a celebration of the Palestinian State,\" but that the Palestinians should refrain from taking unilateral steps without approval from the international community. Photo: AP\n\nMrs. Clinton said the vote would mark the \"birth and a celebration of the Palestinian State,\" but that the Palestinians should refrain from taking unilateral steps without approval from the international community.\n\nThe administration's push to win support for Mr. Obama's signature foreign-policy achievement has been met with skepticism among U.S. Arab allies who fear it will weaken the U.S.-backed coalition in the Middle East to confront Islamic State militants, who have taken control of parts of Syria and Iraq.\n\nMrs. Clinton urged the Arab nations for greater support to Mr. Obama, saying the United States must \"unite the entire world against ISIL and we have to do it before it's too late.\"\n\nThe U.S. diplomat was referring to a video clip that was released Tuesday showing the beheading of journalist James Foley by the Islamic State group. The video also showed a dozen masked men burning alive six Kurdish hostages, including two Americans.\n\nIn a nod to the region's growing anti-Western sentiment, Ms. Clinton said that Mr. Obama and \"the entire administration\" support a new global coalition.\n\nDuring an opening ceremony at Brookings, the secretary of state also made clear that Israel faces an uphill struggle in persuading lawmakers to make funding levels dependent on a change in Israeli policies.\n\n\"We've put very clear in the past that we are opposed to funding for settlement activity, we're opposed to support for the Israeli military occupation of Palestinian territory,\" she said, citing the Obama administration's own support that has fallen short of the U.N. mandate.\n\n\"That said, if the Israeli government chooses to choose another path, that would remain its own choice,\" she added, saying it would be up to members of the U.S. Congress to decide whether to reallocate funding based on the Israeli government's actions.\n\nWrite to Yaroslav Trofimov at yaroslav.trofimov@wsj.com",
      "What will a world without climate regulation look like?\n\n(NaturalNews) If you're not familiar with the term \"climate change activist,\" you are in the midst of an amazing experience. As a result of the ongoing efforts by activist groups like the Greenpeace and 350.org to undermine government efforts to cut pollution from all sources such as coal, oil and natural gas, we're now witnessing what will undoubtedly be the biggest threat to the lives, well-being and futures of the people of the United States.As reported by Mother Jones, over 50,000 people are expected to protest the global warming agenda and stop the United States from reducing its carbon emissions that are causing climate change. The protest is being called by activists as \"The Climate March,\" which has been endorsed by over a dozen environmentalist organizations, which includes 350.org, the Sierra Club, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the Natural Resources Defense Council and Greenpeace.The event will be held in Washington, D.C., and is expected to draw the most people outside of the Capitol Building and other government buildings in Washington, D.C. It will take place on the steps of the Capitol Building, as well as throughout the streets surrounding the Capitol Complex, to ensure that the voices who are most impacted by the environmental apocalypse can be heard loud and clear.But it's not simply being done to stop the EPA under Barack Obama from implementing new pollution controls. In fact, it's much much more than that. It involves the entire idea of government, which seems to be in its death throes. As you will soon witness here, there doesn't seem to be an ounce of sense in Washington, D.C., these days.You are not only witnessing the death of a government that seems increasingly unable to get its act together, but you are also witnessing a complete and utter disregard for the future of future generations as well. You are witnessing an environmental movement that looks solely to its own self-interest in ignoring the concerns of future generations and those living in remote areas.You're witnessing a movement that doesn't seem to care about your future, just the present and your comfort.In other words, you're witnessing what many are now referring to as \"climate crisis activism.\"In a recent interview, Paul Watson, a spokesman for Greenpeace USA, stated that people have the option of either embracing the \"false premise\" of \"climate change\" and moving forward with policies that will worsen the issue of pollution (i.e. a carbon tax), or to keep trying to stop the spread of this \"hoax\" that would destroy society. He explained that if the current effort to push a climate change agenda isn't successful, \"we've seen that we can move on.\"And with those words we are seeing the true face of those that are really behind the \"climate crisis protest\" by being nothing more than self-serving, self-indulgent, self-absorbed, and self-centered individuals.You can bet that those who are planning this march to stop climate regulation aren't interested in your wellbeing. If you're one of those who are joining the protest, you're the problem. You are not an issue. And you're not going to be.The entire reason that these kinds of activists would rally behind a false premise and a movement that doesn't even know where or why our world is becoming less hospitable in the first place is because they are totally dependent on your funding to do their dirty work. They absolutely care not about how the environment is destroying your way of life, but are instead obsessed with the financial benefits of those who have the money to donate to them, and the environmental damage they're causing.The true reason behind this march is actually nothing more than a money grab, the true goal of which is to destroy environmental regulations in order to continue to profit off the destruction of the environment while destroying the lives of everyone in America. They are looking forward to this being a success, and the people who don't share their radical agenda is the \"threat\" they fear.And when we speak of how the \"climate crisis\" is being used to justify drastic budget cuts, we must understand that a massive financial collapse is not to be feared. As stated by Dr. Kevin Trenberth in 2005, \"All we need to do is wait a few years without more human-caused climate change (a few years! I can't wait that long!) and the financial crash will be over. There are plenty of good ideas in the global warming debate that are very feasible and have been put forward.\" (Trenberth, 2005)If we allow the so-called \"climate disruption\" agenda to proceed, we will not only be at risk to the loss of life and property in our immediate future, but the future is so bleak we can already see the future in our current state. You don't have to look any further than our current political system, where politicians are already lining up to push for more budget cuts that are designed to further gut our budget and environment through the imposition",
      "I was really looking forward to getting back into playing this game (after almost a two years of no games) but that's all over now.\n\nI can't get into this game because I get so mad each time a girl says out of her mouth stuff that I want she to clarify.\n\n\nAs soon as you press X to open up a dialogue it turns into a monologue which I know is supposed to be fun, but it's really hard for me to concentrate because it's really hard to do so if she's talking about herself.\n\nAlso, you're not even allowed to ask questions.\n\n\nI have a hard time staying positive and not just being mad, and just want a new game.\n\n\nEDIT: This game is a joke.

      "I was at an \"interviews\" with someone who was doing a book project for the university. I wasn't a \"guru\" (as in, an expert), but I did know a lot about the topic, which was the history of the human race. His project entailed reading a lot of books on the subject and writing a book about it.\n\nI am a person who is very familiar with my subject (a professor of history and social studies), so naturally I did not know the history of our race well. We did do some research though and I ended up feeling comfortable enough to tell the interview person that I did not think it necessary for him to teach his students who had not studied the history of the human race. When they began to debate about it, I ended up defending that opinion and asked him why he thought it was necessary to teach anything to his students about a science which already \"knows\" everything about us. He said that he knew \"things\" we did not know because of the human genome and that his job was to show that this knowledge should be taught to our young people so they would be prepared to learn about issues beyond themselves. His reasoning seemed reasonable, though my own knowledge of the history of our race was a very long way from his own.\n\nHe was not a Nazi, yet we were having a serious conversation about his job as an educator.\n\nWhat was my mistake?\n\nI had no idea in the first place which side of history was in favor. (When do you think the last two major U.S. political parties were in favor of Hitler and Nazi Germany? In which of the modern world world would you place yourself?)\n\nThat conversation and its response was just one example of my failure to learn from the experiences of others. I have learned the hard way that in order to learn a new topic well, I must first learn as much about that topic as possible about where other people stand in the process of understanding the subject. The best way to learn this is directly from the source, which is how I ended up learning German.\n\nIt goes without saying that \"learning to think\" means learning all your arguments and all your perspectives from a broad audience. This is a huge undertaking, since you need to be able to \"think out loud.\" This requires learning in a variety of ways. This is how you build a strong foundation: being willing to ask the tough questions, asking your colleagues as well as yourself hard questions, giving credit where it is due (that is, take criticism), and being willing to change your minds about things. As you go along with your learning, you will have to start answering for this behavior, which is something you will have to do consciously with the purpose of teaching you something you didn't know. But, as soon as you do know something, it's important for your students to help you learn and share what they know with your colleagues so that all of your colleagues can learn and build. In order for your students to help you learn, you can be very demanding of them and teach as many problems as possible to them. In other words, if you're going to ask someone else to teach you something that is hard, do it in a way that is very interesting, challenging, and engaging.\n\nWhen I hear a lecturer (or any instructor) complain about students asking questions in class (or elsewhere) in order to improve their own understanding, it's a good idea to listen. However, sometimes students will not get answers out of the teacher because the professor does not understand why the students are asking questions. It is not the teacher's fault that we students do not understand that sometimes a challenging discussion, involving difficult things such as the evolution of species and human behavior, requires asking questions and challenging one another. I have never seen a class in my field that cannot benefit from questions. When they are not asked by the teacher, students are always more willing to ask questions when we learn more about our subject.\n\nTo be fair, there are also plenty of times when professors will not learn how to teach when students bring questions to the table. But these are just as necessary and just as important as questions for learning in order for the professor to do his or her job, because these teachers learn what it is to teach not too long after they do it. I've had enough of students complaining that there are not enough \"tough\" questions during a class in my field. We have too many good ones! And I have to say that I am willing to listen to the reasons students use for their complaints. However, we will not be able to change the course of history if we cannot change the very nature of the human race. To change the human race, we must change us as individuals as well.\n\nI do not want to sound like I am suggesting that all of the students in my history class or at that university are morons. In fact, I have found many brilliant, highly intelligent, and hardworking students at that",
      "I think most people would agree that the original \"Frostgrave\" had its highlights. It was fun and exciting but also contained many little things that make a big difference in the overall experience. One of those little things is the ability to pick a side in a skirmish. To do that, you first need a deck, which is very easy to get ahold of (as usual with Frostgrave). You can find all the current decks on this website: http://www.frostgrave-labs.com/\n\nOnce you have the deck, you need a deck-builder that provides cards for your deck. The most popular deck-builders are: http://www.darth-vader.net/, http://www.thesourcegame.com/en/mods/frostgrave/ (or click \"Custom\") and this one: http://www.kiranico.com/mods/v1d8-frostgrave.html (or click \"Custom\") I recommend choosing \"Custom\" as we'll be creating my own deck. Now, click the deck-builder interface that you chose and in the next dialogue box, under \"Pilots\", choose \"Select a Character\" (or \"Select a deck\") You will now be presented with a new screen that looks like this:\n\nOnce you have all the necessary cards included, click \"Create Deck\" (or right click on the screen and select \"Create Deck\")\n\nA new screen will appear with a lot of \"information\". In my example the deck will look like this:\n\nYou can now pick your faction, name, background, faction color and card type, and click \"Next\". You can now see all the factions available in Frostgrave.\n\nOnce you're satisfied with the faction, color and color-pairings, you're going to get to the interesting part. You need to assign decks to your cards. So far I've only assigned my characters to a single deck (for a single round) and have found it to be an easy task. One thing is for certain though. You're going to need a good, long time for your account to have to be in your hands for you to get the full benefit of Frostgrave.\n\nThere are a lot of things to choose from in Frostgrave. The three main choices are:\n\nOne: Cards\n\nYou first have the cards in your deck. The first card you can get is the character card. It will contain the character's stats and their \"starting\" stats. So, for instance, in my example, I can choose the Han Solo character card on my deck, which includes 2/2, 2/3, 2/4, 3/1 and 1/2 of each of the six stats.\n\nThe best thing about this is that you can give any character card to multiple characters (so long as they are within your faction and have the same faction color).\n\nTwo: Dice\n\nDice are another important part of the game. Dangers are dealt at the beginning of each round based on the number dice in the pool. There are three kinds of dangers:\n\nThe number of dice that come into play at the beginning of the round, which is called the dice pool total The number of dice that are flipped between players at the start of each round, which is called the dice roll total The total dice in the pool.\n\nNote that dice pool total depends greatly on the factions of the players.\n\nTo deal with dice, you first need to get your first four dice into the pool. You can do this with two cards (like this card) and it will make it easier.\n\nAfter you get the four dice into the pool, you will draw four new dice (four times, depending on your faction). After you have drawn all eight dice, draw 4 more. You now have 24 dice in the pool and can play all those cards. If you draw something with a certain number of dice, you can immediately add all the dice in the pool (as long as you have enough dice in your pool to replace it).\n\nFor instance, if you have a Han Solo character card and a Han Solo dice, you can play Han Solo dice (but not the Han Solo character card) as many times as you have the dice to replace it. So, to compensate for having less dice in the pool, you can draw more dice (or use a second Han Solo card).\n\nAll in all, that makes the game a lot easier.\n\nThree: Characters\n\nNow at the bottom of the screen there is a list of all the characters in your deck. You can click on a character and see all its stats. You can also just hover your mouse over a character and see it's \"name\" and its color. If you scroll down to the bottom of the screen you'll see the amount of energy your characters have remaining.\n\nAs you may already know,",
      "A Florida man was arrested for throwing a water balloon at a cop. The incident took place last month near the University of Central Florida campus.\n\nThe victim is Michael K. Martin, 23, who works at the University of Central Florida.\n\nAs Martin was about to get into his car when he was approached by an unknown man, he told WKMG News. The man, who was standing outside a car, told Martin he had a \"water balloon\" to throw at the officer and asked if he could see the officer's badge number. While talking, the man threw a water balloon into his eye, and Martin screamed.\n\nThe suspect then got behind the cop's car and threw another water balloon from a distance. Both objects struck the cop's patrol car, causing minor injuries to the cop. The suspect was still in the victim's rear view mirror, as he got out of the car shouting obscenities at the officer. The suspect ran away and took off, but returned to the scene and got back into his car and drove away from the scene.\n\nPolice arrived just a few minutes later and arrested an unknown suspect for the offenses of resisting arrest, malicious destruction of property and battery on a police officer. The suspect was taken to Central Florida Central Detention Center where he awaits his court date on Tuesday.\n\nAccording to officials, this is the first water balloon fight ever recorded for the UCF Police Department. They say they have never recorded this type of offense before.\n\n\"Our officers do have some aggressive, forceful people, but they do have a few good ones. You're not going to see any running away out there, because we'd like that too.\" said UCF police officer Paul Shafer.\n\nCopyright City News Service / NBC Southern California",

      "\"We're going to be the world's richest country,\" he boasts.\n\nMr. Trump's campaign staff has often boasted about how the Republican would make America rich again. Yet even those closest to Mr. Trump acknowledge he lacks the discipline required to succeed at the corporate job required to turn a profit.\n\nHis father was a tycoon, but his business style was not the same. Mr. Trump does not have to run his own company. He does not have to be the kind of corporate strategist that George W. Bush often played. He does not have to be the kind of executive with the necessary interpersonal skills and empathy to build long-term relationships. His brand, though, is built on that allure. And the brand's biggest supporters are his own followers.\n\nAs he has ascended in the polls to the head of the field, Mr. Trump has begun making a number of proposals that would fundamentally change American life for the better, and that would have to be executed — at great political risk — to move him from second place. And yet, no matter how many times he tells them, voters are unwilling to make those concessions.\n\nOn the stump, Mr. Trump has been able to use his charisma to grab the attention of a large audience with his one-liners and the sheer force of his emotions, not his policies, and to appeal to people who would never ordinarily vote for a Republican.\n\nIn the past three weeks, those supporters have begun to turn their attention away from his policy ideas, which most mainstream voters regard as misguided, and toward his personal qualities and personality.",

      "Marijuana use among Americans ages 18 to 64 has dropped about 20 percent since 1996, but new research indicates it is possible that teen use in recent years has been much higher than previously thought.\n\n\"Our study is a bit ambiguous in that there's no evidence that we found a very big decline in teen cigarette use\" since the early 1990s, study investigator Paul Armentano, deputy director of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, told Reuters Health.\n\nFor the new study, researchers analyzed the National Longitudinal Survey of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data between 1995 and 2013. The report included 9,063 respondents — about 13 percent of which were between the ages of 14 and 17 at the start of the study. The teens were asked about how much marijuana they had smoked in the previous 30 days.\n\nAfter controlling for various socioeconomic factors as well as social support at home, and other factors associated with marijuana, the researchers found that teen marijuana use dropped from 23 percent in 1995 to 13.5 percent in 2013. In the past decade, teen use has been cut in half.\n\nThe new report suggests that teen use may have been even higher before 1995.\n\nThe new findings are not completely clear, however. The researchers did not control for marijuana use among people who were not teens. \"We are not sure whether the drop in teen marijuana use was due to teens who went on to smoke cigarettes or not,\" Armentano said.\n\nThe researchers also did not examine whether marijuana use declined among teens who became smokers later in life or in the past 10 years.\n\n\"But even if it was about the same rate, it's more likely that the decline was due to smoking than it was to quitting smoking,\" Armentano said.\n\nCigarette use has fallen dramatically since 1999, according to the CDC. The rate per capita has fallen to the lowest level in nearly 20 years.\n\n\"There are reasons to think that there may have been some decline in the total number of cigarettes smoked or used in the past 30 days among adolescents, and that's true even if the percentage of teens who used marijuana has declined,\" lead data analyst Melissa DeSena of the CDC said in a press release.\n\nPrevious research has also shown a decline in teen cigarette use since the early 1990s. A 2015 Centers for Disease Control report concluded that rates of current smoking \"fell for all age groups between 1999 and 2013.\"\n\n\"Overall, the findings suggest that the decline may have been a response to the large decline in cigarettes,\" the authors concluded.\n\nThere are several potential reasons why younger teens may not be smoking cigarettes at the same rate they once were.\n\nWhile teens were less likely to smoke cigarettes as early as the 1980s, there also was a decline among teens who were less politically conservative, as well as a decline in smokers' health or educational backgrounds, according to some researchers, who said the reasons for these declines should be investigated further.\n\n\"It is too early to make any big conclusions but there are some interesting patterns we should be paying closer attention to\" the next time data from a similar study becomes available, said Michael Collins, research director at the Center for Tobacco Control Research and Education at the University of Illinois at Chicago, who was not involved with the new research.\n\nMore broadly, the decline in teen smoking may have affected the broader population as well, Collins said.\n\n\"As far as the general population is concerned, I am surprised and not terribly surprised that the decline has really begun to affect adults,\" Collins said.\n\nSOURCE: bit.ly/2c4vF4P JAMA Pediatrics, online September 28, 2016.",
      "As I noted, my colleague Dan Graziano's article about why the Rams are interested in Brian Price (and why the Browns seem less inclined to let him hit the open market) caused a bit of a minor stir, but not in the way Dan intended.\n\nAt first, I didn't think he was actually referencing the Rams at all, although I did check in with a few others who were familiar with his story and, in turn, said they never imagined the Rams would get involved, too. If Dan was only referring to the Rams via that particular piece (for example, the fact that they are willing to spend $12,500,000 to acquire Price in 2016 and 2017, which is at the upper limit of what the Saints would have to pay for a cornerback last year), I'm not sure how serious that was (and if he was just joking, which I doubt).\n\nI do think it's important to keep in mind, however, that Brian Price was the only cornerback on the market. If he were available with the Rams in January, when they have a new regime in place, I doubt a team would balk at offering a high price without any real indication (either way) of the Rams going after him.\n\nHowever, the Rams did sign a contract with Trumaine Johnson during free agency – which, I should also note, I thought was not particularly noteworthy. The idea that the Rams would only pursue an established player to fill a need at the position is simply not true. It's not likely that the Rams would sign a new player like Johnson and pay him about $8 million, as they've done with some other players over the last year, but as you can see, it's not the norm for the Rams to pay big money to free agents. It's more of an exception that has happened a few times in St. Louis, most notably where the Rams used a third-round draft pick to draft receiver Chris Givens almost three years ago.\n\nThe Rams are not in a position to pay big money for a free agent this season because of the significant cap space they have available and the fact that they are already over the cap. It'll be interesting to see how they handle their cap as we move into the offseason, and there's obviously a lot of potential options for them (I will have more detailed views on the cap situation and other team needs in future posts).\n\nThe biggest thing that makes a lot of sense to me – besides, you know, signing Brian Price - would be getting a player in the draft that could potentially be a solid replacement for Prince Amukamara/Trumaine Johnson – a slot cornerback with good size who fits the Rams mold. One potential candidate on draft day could be Michigan defensive back Jourdan Lewis, a very good player who is 6-0 and has some athleticism as well. Lewis was productive at the Senior Bowl and could be a guy who gives the Rams an immediate upgrade over Amukamara, who was awful last year, and should not be signed at a high price.\n\nThat said, I don't see Lewis as a possibility at #8, so the Rams would probably have to draft a corner with their first-round pick (or possibly late in the fourth round) if they believe they need a cornerback like that at #8. And with the Rams having several needs (a puncher with good quickness, another cornerback and a kick returner, a cornerback-type) I could see them looking to go with a player with a different skill set with their first pick in the round - something like a defensive end or linebacker (who probably would also need to fall in the later rounds of the draft) who could help fill a need but who could also be an instant-impact player that would be a good fit in Sean McVay's system.",
      "The video that led to the arrest of the man who went on a shooting rampage at a Florida church was posted to Facebook and YouTube and quickly went viral. Now, details of his violent rant against \"sinners\" are becoming public.\n\nThe video, obtained by the Tampa Bay Times, shows the suspect's rant before the gunfire starts. The rant, which continues throughout the nearly a minute length of the video, focuses on the dangers of \"sinning\" and how anyone \"living a sin life\" must face God's judgment.\n\n\"For those of you who live a sin life, you are going to Hell,\" the man says. \"And I'm going to tell everybody in this church that goes home. I'm telling you that if you have a gay son or daughter, you have to be ready to send them to Hell. And if you live a gay lifestyle, you're going to burn in Hell forever in their presence. And that's the truth. That's the whole truth and nothing but the truth.\"\n\nHe further explains why sinners should be punished: \"We have no sympathy for sinners. We are very merciless. We forgive people with sins. Sinners must be put to death because they're sinners. They are animals. They can't even care about God. They don't care about their own bodies. We are going to execute those animals.\n\n\"We have no compassion for the least of these... they deserve to be killed.\"\n\nThe video then cuts to a man holding a gun outside the church. It is unclear whether he fired the shot that killed the five people inside. But the man tells the news station he \"just shot up the church\" and says, \"You know what? It was God's judgment.\"\n\nHe says he was \"very sorry for the families that lost their loved ones\" and \"hopefully we're going to start healing the divisions within our communities.\"\n\nAccording to a police affidavit, the suspect was being \"intoxicated\" during the shooting. Police said he was shot by an off-duty police officer, who had pulled up beside him and told him \"the church was being shot up.\"",
      "The United States is ready to send ground troops to Iraq and Afghanistan if necessary to combat the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). That is according to a US Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel, who said the United States wants to take action in Iraq and Afghanistan by the end of the year.\n\n\"I do believe the Iraq train and equip mission is on track,\" Hagel said when asked by a reporter on Wednesday whether the United States would send additional forces into that country. \"I know the president is fully committed to that mission. It's on track. It'll be here in the coming months.\"\n\nIn response, White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Obama had \"been clear that the president would authorize the Department of Defense to move forward as soon as we have the capacity and there's a need.\"\n\nHagel said the United States was \"very concerned by ISIL's actions\" but that ISIL has no real power in Iraq and that the United States was doing all it could in Iraq to help stabilize the country.\n\n'Not a joke'\n\nHagel said that \"we don't need to be at war with them\" but he acknowledged they were an \"aggravating factor\" in Iraq. As for the United States military presence in Afghanistan, Hagel said it was \"not something I'm announcing.\"\n\nThe Defense Department, which has about 8,000 active soldiers in Iraq and a similar force in Afghanistan, has about 5,700 military personnel in Iraq, including about 1,500 Army soldiers, who are advising and assisting Kurdish forces fighting ISIL on the ground.\n\nThe Pentagon says the United States is conducting about 30 airstrikes in Iraq in the last two days against ISIL targets.\n\nHagel expressed confidence that ISIL has lost much of the territory it once held in Iraq and was now in Syria fighting in a battle that does not look likely to end soon. ISIL has taken control of large territories in Syria such as Raqqa, the IS group's de facto capital in that country.\n\nThe United States has also conducted more than 2,000 airstrikes in Iraq and Syria since Obama ordered those missions in August. The administration says that more than 1,200 of those have been in Iraq.\n\nHagel said the United States also was pursuing a more formal diplomatic strategy to confront ISIL.\n\n\"It is time to have a real plan on how we can counter the ISIL threat,\" Hagel said.",
      "This story is a sequel to Last Light. You may also be looking for The Walking Dead (Season 3, Episode 6).\n\nContents show]\n\nSynopsis Edit\n\nis a video game made in 2008 by Telltale Games\n\nIn 1989, the city of Los Angeles was under siege by a man-eating horde led by a former boxer named John Fitzgerald Kennedy. Now, armed with a crossbow and a backpack full of ammo, a lone survivor of the zombie apocalypse, a teenage girl named Clementine, and an army of zombies, our heroes set out on a journey to find Clementine's father and a weapon powerful enough to fight their way through this new world.\n\nMain Characters Edit\n\nClementine: She's sixteen years old. She's an American-Indian girl who is from a small town, and she comes from a long line of hunters. When she's not out running around for her family's sake, one thing Clementine seems to always find is trouble. She is, however, a strong, courageous girl who always fights her way through whatever situations she's thrown into, and she's pretty much the polar opposite of Nick.\n\nFalk: He's a young man with a tattoo of his grandmother that he's trying to get removed from his back, while simultaneously being a member of the local gang. He's a member of some weird religious cult and seems to have no concept of who he is.\n\nZombie: He's a huge, vicious, disgusting, disgusting zombie in a white hood. In the game, he was the leader of the Los Angeles Police Department's zombie army before his defeat. One of the more annoying types. He would often throw his zombies (which were his human allies) at Clementine and use his command over them to make them do his bidding. If Clementine was spared and the player killed her father, it would seem that the zombie could die, which leads us to...\n\nClementine's Father: The man who was named Clementine was actually a police officer named Frank Horvath, and he was killed by zombies shortly after being named Clementine. While he wasn't a good guy, he had strong principles about protecting Clementine and keeping her safe, and he would often stand his ground despite any provocation. Unfortunately, he is the only known person to have really shown concern towards Clementine because of her and the others' survival, and he is the only one we meet who seems to know the exact nature of the mysterious \"zombie epidemic\" that's ravaging the world.\n\nA Gun of Their Own Edit\n\nIf you choose to keep Nick alive, he'll mention that he'd had a couple of different guns to shoot with on the ride to Atlanta to get his son to safety. After that, there will be numerous zombies outside a store. The store owner will suggest killing the zombie with a gun. If you pick up Nick's Shotgun before talking to the gun store owner, he'll mention that you got all the guns for him right away, so you don't need any more.\n\nIf you don't manage to pick up Nick's Shotgun before talking to the gun store owner, Nick will say something about needing a gun \"for self-defense.\" The story continues as if you did decide to take a gun when you arrived in Atlanta, except that you have to go back to Los Angeles to collect more guns by following Nick's directions. After you get back from Los Angeles, you'll find a guy named Jake at the Gun Shop in the mall.\n\nAsk what he's doing here and Jake will tell you about a zombie epidemic in Los Angeles and suggests that you go to the Gun Shop and pick up what you need. While you walk through a side door, you'll meet Jake, but he won't acknowledge you and instead says that you need to save your game.

      "New Delhi: Union minister Piyush Goyal on Friday said that the NDA government would not like to go the way of the Indira Gandhi-led government in 1975 which fell in six days. Goyal, who is the minister of state in the home ministry, was referring to the \"disaster\" by which Indira Gandhi forced a \"peaceful\" transfer of power with her party. Gandhi, who was in the Opposition at that phase, was blamed for her \"dire mistake\" of not taking Congress vice-president Rahul Gandhi and other party leaders into account as she resigned.\n\nThe BJP, which won the elections in 1975, was in opposition while its leader Narendra Modi was the Prime Minister. It was the third government led by Gandhi and the first to be voted out by her.\n\n\"We have not come in for \"disaster\" like Indira's government. If in 1975, Sonia Gandhi had failed to realize that her Cabinet Ministers had misbehaved with her, we would have made the same point,\" he said. He also said that Goolam Vahanvati will be a \"legacy\" of the first government under Indira, while Modi will be \"legacy of the second government\".\n\nReacting to what he called a \"pivot\" by the Congress leadership in the Union budget, Goyal said, \"They have decided to go the way of their own government in 1975. I believe Congress is in a sorry way. Rahul Gandhi is very unhappy and wants to get back. When he was in the Opposition, people who liked him, like (Narendra] Modi, were not part of the policy-making.\" Modi is a close confidant of Gandhi. He is also slated to take up his first assignment as PM on Saturday.\n\nGST and Coal blocks\n\n\nThe Union budget for the financial year 2017-18 aims at bringing down the budget deficit to 4.9% of the GDP in the coming fiscal year (FY) which ends in March 2018 from 7% in the previous year. However, it will be significantly higher — 9.2% from 4.6% — because of non-tax measures and provisions for capital expenditure.\n\nGoyal said that the government will seek to bring back a surplus in GST and coal blocks revenue collections after it completes seven years of demonetisation. He said the government will seek to reduce the current fiscal deficit by Rs 6.5 lakh crore from the previous budget. The government will achieve this through measures like tax cuts, tax incentive measures and reduced expenditure on public sector undertakings (PSUs).\n\nThe budget for the current fiscal has a fiscal deficit goal of 3% of GDP in FY18. The revenue deficit target has been set at 3.4% of GDP in the next year. The government will seek to meet this by raising tax collection and reducing expenditure.\n\nThe ministry had earlier said that a budget proposal has been made after examining the economic and financial situation for one year. These are the proposals which were received from ministries and agencies while preparing the budget.",

I've made this and am going to give it away to whomever wants it.\n\nSo I'm asking:\n\nIf you've ever had a problem with something you've created, and it just wasn't working for you…\n\nAnd I'm giving you three things:\n\n1. To give away the pattern\n\n2. To give someone the pattern\n\n3. To let someone else know they need to make this and it might solve their problem.\n\nThat's all. (The three are not mutually exclusive of each other. You just choose which one to apply to.)\n\nYou can make it a pattern, a free pattern for personal use, or an open license for all to use.\n\nIf you make this pattern and sell it, I'll take a 1% cut of the profits. I know many designers can't work with this, but I'm not. Also, if you want someone to make it for you, let me find out about that. I'll contact them and see what they can do.\n\nIf you don't make it and don't give it away, I'll make the pattern and give it away if I get enough signups.\n\nI'm also looking for people who have been wanting to sell their finished products, but haven't done it because they didn't want the hassle. If this is you, or you find your pattern to be so wonderful and easy that you need to share it, I'll send you a free PDF of the pattern so you can sell it your own way if you want.\n\nAll you need is one person to register through this page.\n\nThen I'll send your pattern out to you through this email:\n\nYou'll have your link in your email in a few minutes, and you're ready to sell it!\n\nIf enough people sign up, I'll release the details of the signup here on the blog. I'll just let a handful of people know through email before I do.\n\nAnd if there are too many people, I'll just print out the pattern and give them out to everyone. It's so simple. I just want to sell it to people who want to buy it.\n\nI made the pattern for free on my own free pattern site for all to use, but with permission from the designer, but I have the pattern permission.\n\nHere it is.

      "For weeks, the Obama administration seemed bent on ignoring an emerging and troubling story involving the Justice Department.\n\nAccording to an internal report, the Department used tax dollars to fund, at least partly, a political attack against an Obama opponent in 2010, an effort that resulted in six Democratic lawmakers refusing to fund President Obama's health care overhaul.\n\nThe internal investigation, which had originally been conducted solely as a civil action in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, was first disclosed by Sen. Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who said it was \"deeply troubling.\"\n\nIt was also confirmed by Justice, which refused to publicly disclose its contents. And though Obama administration officials have declined to discuss it further, and despite an apparent effort to get the Internal Revenue Service into \"damage control\" mode, it appears at least some of the IRS-led effort involved a political campaign to target conservative critics of Obamacare, rather than a legitimate effort to scrutinize tax-exempt organizations in a way that was consistent with its mission.\n\n\"This is a pretty big story,\" said Adam Jentleson, a Justice spokesman, who said that while Justice won't \"take questions on the specifics,\" the investigation had been \"thorough and objective\" and was \"not motivated by politics or discriminatory purpose.\"\n\nYet despite this evidence of a politically motivated attack, the administration apparently decided not to act to stop it.\n\n\"The White House could have told the IRS to stop using tax money to run a political campaign against political opponents and it wouldn't have saved the Obama administration anything,\" Jentleson said.\n\nThe Internal Revenue Service is an independent federal agency within the executive branch, and the Justice investigation into it appears to have been an effort to determine whether the IRS had engaged in politically motivated activities.\n\nFederal laws on using tax dollars for campaigning and elections vary by country. In the United States, most federal agencies are subject to laws that prohibit using federal money or resources to promote or oppose political candidates, ballot measures, party policies, and legislation.\n\nThough the IRS was not under federal law prohibition at the time the targeted groups were subjected to \"be on the lookout\" inquiries, they were also not under the general prohibitions of using tax dollars to influence elections, campaign finance disclosure laws say.\n\nThe IRS \"has no authority to use funds for political purposes nor would there be any constitutional concern if the IRS had sought the help of third parties to assist in the process,\" Richard Neal, a lawyer and professor from American University, told ABC News. That is because the IRS' mission is to \"administer and collect fees and taxes ... by law, not for electioneering.\"\n\nIt's not clear why the DOJ never acted.\n\nThe investigation into IRS tax-exempt organizations, \"which was initiated by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, was initiated pursuant to the provisions of Section 304 of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974,\" Jentleson, the Justice spokesman, said in a statement.\n\nSection 304 of the act, the so-called \"CBOA Act,\" allows the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, which oversees the IRS, to investigate the organization of any independent federal department, agency, or instrumentality and any officer or employee thereof.\n\nAnd the IRS \"is a federal instrumentality with federal tax-exempt status,\" Neal told ABC News.\n\nWhile the investigation was initiated by Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the investigation appears to have been an investigation of the IRS in and of itself, not a separate inquiry into the agency as a whole. This was a case in which the Justice Department began by \"investigating how to bring a case against the IRS for violating the Constitution,\" Jentleson added.\n\n\"It's a violation of the spirit of the constitutional separation of power,\" he warned.\n\nThe issue at Handelsblatt began in April 2011 when Jorgen von Berg, from the Christian Heritage Foundation in Washington, D.C., received several inquiries regarding the organization's application to receive certain types of tax exemptions, called 501(c)(3).\n\nAccording to Jentleson, the investigation was in an initial stages at the time of von Berg's initial query. Then, Jorgen von Berg was contacted by a man who said he was involved in a tax-exempt group that, among many other things, was \"seeking IRS compliance\" by being on the lookout for a \"political bias.\"\n\nThe man described itself as having been involved in \"political activities\" throughout his time \"with this group,\" Jentleson said, and went on to describe how his group had been \"targeted\" by the IRS based on political activity. He was directed to an Internal Revenue Service employee, who sent an email to him in September claiming the IRS was conducting an investigation of his group on political grounds.\n\nThe investigation was launched, and at von Berg's urging, he filed suit against the IRS, alleging",
      "It's been a good week for people who think the right can't be allowed to win.\n\nThe first is that Donald Trump has been forced out of the Republican presidential race, after losing three straight primaries, with the latest defeat coming on Tuesday night. The Republican National Committee (RNC) has also stripped the billionaire real estate developer of its access to its fund-raising network, which has since poured huge amounts of money into Trump's rivals.\n\nThe loss in Wisconsin will make it impossible for Trump to make the necessary 1,237 delegate-slots on the election's first ballot at the GOP convention in Cleveland.\n\nTrump had been expected to make it, even after trailing Cruz in some states and coming from behind in others. It would have been his first win in a primary or caucus since New Hampshire on February 9.\n\nInstead, it was Cruz, who has benefited from a divided state party that sees a contested primary as good for Cruz, a former governor. The Wisconsin loss will also have serious consequences for Republicans' plans to reach an accord in Cleveland over the party's rules.\n\nIt now seems very possible – if not likely – that it will be forced upon Paul Ryan, the speaker of the House, after the state party's decision on Tuesday night.\n\nRyan is in negotiations with the governors of five states that are still voting, most notably Pennsylvania, which holds its primary on April 26, and Michigan, next week, on its primary day.\n\n\"With the Wisconsin primary results, we are working with both the Trump Campaign and the Republican National Committee to determine the path forward for all involved. This includes working with states that have already voted, and those states scheduled to vote between now and the Republican Convention. Once those conversations are complete we will communicate accordingly,\" said Ronna Romney McDaniel, a senior adviser to the Trump campaign, to the Associated Press in a statement.\n\nA Trump spokeswoman said they remain \"focused on winning the nomination.\"\n\nTrump and Ryan were supposed to meet in private on Thursday. Trump's campaign has since tried to downplay the talks between the two, and said Ryan will hold campaign events for him in Indiana and New York. Ryan's campaign has not replied to a request for comment as of Tuesday afternoon.\n\nAs the primary in Wisconsin played out, the RNC began a major drive on the state campaign trail. The state party gave the Trump campaign access to the money it raised on its behalf up to March 29, then cut a check for the remaining $13.3m to the campaign, according to the RNC.\n\nTrump's Wisconsin loss came after his strong wins in Michigan, which votes on April 5, and in his home state of New York, the other of the five states voting in that contest on April 19, and after a strong showing in the states that vote after that, starting with Texas on Tuesday and ending with the southern states on April 26. Trump leads with delegates awarded through contests in Florida on May 6, although Cruz, having won most of the early contests, does not need to win the big prize to beat Trump.\n\nTrump also appeared to catch back up in states like Kentucky, Minnesota, Washington and Texas on the campaign trail on Tuesday, pushing up his delegate lead to 1,600. But then came Wisconsin.\n\nA Republican source said on Tuesday night that Wisconsin, a state that traditionally leans more Republican than most, turned out to be \"one-on-one race\" between Cruz and Trump. On the same night, Trump also lost the Oregon primary to Cruz.\n\nRyan has been campaigning around the country for months for the GOP nominee, and his presence there on Tuesday could not have hurt he Republican's chances.\n\n\"I am pleased that Governor Scott Walker and Senator Ron Johnson are running as Republicans for President,\" Ryan said in a statement Tuesday afternoon. \"But I can't vote for a Republican candidate for president who loses a nomination fight. That is why I am endorsing Ted Cruz for President.\"\n\nIn his concession speech, Trump blamed the \"system\", saying that he had been the \"least opposed\" to the party establishment and the \"best party guy\" in the field.\n\nTrump, who has built his campaign on controversial statements about immigration and national security, also accused Cruz's campaign of being controlled by \"Washington insiders.\"",

      "Mitt Romney (Rick Warren photo)\n\nWith the presidential debate scheduled for Thursday evening in Denver, here are 10 questions to consider about social issues from the Republican candidate, Mitt Romney.\n\n1) Do you believe that marriage should remain the union of a man and a woman or that it could change over time? How would you make that happen? Romney: In my family, marriage has existed from the beginning. My Dad was born in a Mormon mission and had two wives of his own choice and I got to know him and I understand that. The fundamental principles we believe in were in our family for many generations. And as I know the President of the United States understands, these things are eternal. And that it's important for our country to have an understanding of that. It's also important for our church, which is called the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, to understand and teach people that. I'm very supportive of the church and believe in family values.\n\n2) Do you support the death penalty for those who are found guilty of murdering a law enforcement officer or for rapists, those who abuse children or persons with disabilities? Romney: Yes, I do, and I'm confident that Americans across this country also support the death penalty for those who would take the life of another human being. I believe that the state has a right in this case to do that. And, if a person is convicted of murder, no matter the circumstance, he or she has a job to do and that job is to make that person accountable and the state has the ability to do that with a capital punishment mechanism.\n\nAdvertisement",
      "\"In his own way, the writer is part of the social fabric of American society.\" These words could not have been written by any U.S. author, or any U.S. writer for that matter. And yet, they were. These two words—\"in his own way,\" and \"of his own species\"—are as indelible as the phrase \"every person a star\" or the phrase \"all life sacred.\" I believe that these words were written and spoken by an American author.\n\nI know that this sounds ridiculous. An American, who is part of a society that, over the last half of a century, has done very little to change this. There are three points I would like to make, however, that may put the question of whether or not the United States of America deserves to be called a \"Christian country\" to rest for a moment.\n\nFirst, \"Christian\" for that country has been defined by virtue of its political system, in which religion plays only a minor role.\n\nSecond, for nearly a millennium, people in the United States have identified their country as a nation \"sovereign\" of God's law.\n\n(A note: To clarify this definition, a sovereign nation must have a written and recorded constitution that establishes itself as not merely a legal entity, but as a national or international government, or a system of government that is created by people with all the rights of human beings, even the right to have a religious belief. The existence of such a state system is a fact that cannot be ignored.)\n\nWhat is the definition of a sovereign nation?\n\nThe answer to this question is simple but startling: It is the nation that has taken God's law as its basis for its laws, and this national law, the Constitution, is the law of this nation. If a nation exists whose laws are grounded in the God of the Bible, then it possesses a sovereign legal position (as I will show later) in an international setting (an international setting, mind you, in which the U.S. has no constitutional obligation to maintain).\n\nSo just why would God's law seem to hold sway over American law? I believe that a big part of the answer lies in the nature of American society today.\n\nI believe, for example, that it is this society's embrace of the individual's choice of religion that has given rise to an atmosphere of intolerance toward religion and the observance of religious laws: the practice of religion being seen as antithetical to a society that strives to be free of religious laws. This is the source of the separation between the Christian faith and the legal system of this nation.\n\nWhen American law says that God's law is superior to anything else, it becomes the foundation on which it stands. I've heard it argued that, if the Constitution were not a religious document, the nation would not have existed. Perhaps for that same reason, the Supreme Court should not have been founded on an act of Congress. If the Constitution were not religious, the nation is not a Christian one. But why is the Constitution a Christian document?\n\nThe fact is that the United States is a Christian nation, and that, in the eyes of some Americans, that fact is enough to grant its existence an unwavering religious legitimacy.\n\nI believe this answer to be right. In fact, I hold that it is the source of the United States's \"unwavering religious legitimacy.\"\n\nThe answer lies in the way in which our government has chosen to \"legalize\" and \"legalize\" itself (to borrow a term from the law). In the case of the United States Constitution, it is through the process of legal drafting and \"construction.\"\n\nThe process of legal drafting and construction is one that is usually done with the aim of simplifying and simplifying law.\n\nIt is the same process that is employed when a person builds furniture or changes their clothing. The construction of all furniture in the same way is used to bring home to the homeowner and to himself the idea about the way he expects to present his home to his guests, and how he intends to dress for each occasion. Such \"construction\" is essential if there is to be any sense of unity in a furniture-obsessed person.\n\nBut in the case of building the nation's code of legal principles, there is no such unity to be found, and it is this lack of unity — the lack of unity that our political system has come to exemplify — which I believe is the most important lesson about the nature of this government.\n\nI have noticed in all societies that I have known that the law, as they understand it, can have quite different meaning to different people. The meaning it has to certain people may be different to others; it may even be completely ignored altogether to the point that many people will no longer recognize it at all. In this way, the law and the law's definition are constantly fluid, to say the very",
      "The American Civil Liberties Union has raised the hackles of the Israeli government.\n\nThe organization has criticized Israel's arrest of a 17-year-old Palestinian in the occupied West Bank for tweeting about the latest Palestinian bus fire that killed a three-year-old Israeli child.\n\nThe government contends that the teenager could have been convicted of a hate crime and faces up to 10 years in prison for \"inciting terrorism,\" which is a crime in Israel.\n\nSPONSORED\n\n\"The U.S. government has urged Israel to exercise restraint on its Palestinian citizens. The Israeli government has instead sought to prosecute a young person for tweeting,\" said the ACLU of West Virginia in a statement Monday. \"The detention, interrogation, and prosecution of Palestinian youth on security charges for peacefully exercising their rights to freedom of expression and association violates decades - even centuries - of American law and policy and has dire ramifications for the democratic progress in Israel and Palestine.\"\n\nThe teen was held in an Israeli jail for more than two weeks before being released on Sunday, according to Israel's Channel 10 News. A local Palestinian human rights group says the teenager was arrested in a \"shady operation\" that was meant to smear him.\n\n\"He went to school. He was not in school when he was arrested,\" the Palestinian human rights group said. \"They say there was a rumor that he sent an email to a [pro-terror] website. He's only 17 years old. This is a shame.\"\n\nA spokesperson for the attorney general's office told the BBC the teenager posted nothing illegal on his Twitter account.\n\nIt's not the first time the ACLU has lashed out against the Israeli government over the arrest of Palestinians.\n\nThe organization has long called on Israel to cease its detention of Palestinian children.\n\nThe group also criticized the Israeli government for arresting a number of Palestinians on Twitter for allegedly inciting to violence.\n\n\"It is wrong to criminalize a teenage boy for tweeting about a fire that killed and permanently disabled three innocent people for having a political view that some perceive as dangerous,\" the ACLU statement added. \"This law has nothing to do with preventing terrorism and everything to do with demonizing the Palestinian people, and targeting and prosecuting innocent teens for peaceful speech.\"\n\n[Image: Twitter, Flickr Creative Commons licensed; CC BY-SA 2.0]",
      "SACRAMENTO — With his campaign in financial peril, and facing a tough Democratic challenger in the November elections, Republican U.S. Sen.

But we're going to give them a name to run scared toward — Dean Heller.\"\n\nThe ad is part of a $550,000 ad buy by The Heller Campaign Committee, whose treasurer, Mike Solomon, is a longtime Adelson associate.\n\nSolomon has served as a key fundraiser, bundler and general manager for Adelson's casino empire. They were partners for more than two decades at Adelson's Venetian Hotel and Casino Las Vegas. Solomon also served as the former president of Caesars Entertainment.\n\nAdelson has pledged $10 million this election cycle to his political action committee, which he said he has reserved to take with him to other Senate races.\n\nAdelson's spokesman, Jonathan Spingarn, said in a statement that the Review-Journal and its owners are \"very thankful\" to Nevada voters but added that \"there are too many people in Washington, D.C., that are out of touch with Nevadans' real needs.\"\n\n\"We think having a leader in the Senate who's independent of special interests and who can work to get things done for Nevadans will be a huge asset to Nevada,\" the statement says.\n\nSolomon declined to specify the amount spent on this ad campaign, referring only to \"the substantial resources that Dean's campaign has reserved.\"\n\nOn Oct. 29, the Review-Journal published a story about Adelson's efforts to lobby for legislation that would bar travelers from some countries — including Iraq, Iran and Syria — from obtaining visas to enter the United States.\n\nAdelson's group spent $25,000 on lobbying efforts on the matter and has raised at least $5 million from Adelson's political action committee since 2010, according to the Center for Responsive Politics.\n\nThe newspaper's coverage of the bill was described as inflammatory and inaccurate by the Adelson group and other opponents, who called on Adelson to stop funding the newspaper.\n\nBut Heller's campaign has tried to attack the paper and its owner. Heller's ad shows clips of Adelson defending Trump on the campaign trail and making inflammatory comments about Latino Americans and Muslims.\n\nHeller's campaign also pointed to an Adelson-related investigation in 2011 that found the Review-Journal failed to pay its bill for an Adelson's private Caribbean island when he owned it. An editor of an editorial board resigned amid the revelations and was later fired.\n\nHeller's ad also shows clips of the Review-Journal's owner trying for years to remove Adelson's influence.\n\n\"The Adelson family doesn't want me running for office,\" Adelson said in 2013 in a radio interview with The David Pakman Show. \"They want somebody who is in sync with them.\"\n\nHeller campaigns in Las Vegas Oct. 26.\n\nContact Colton Lochhead at clochhead@reviewjournal.com or 702-383-4638.

      "The two sides of the border, as always, feel uneasy, both with each other and with the people and things living around it. While some say that the border and this uneasy feeling is part of life on the border, some say it's a problem caused by a lack of democracy and human rights on the north side.\n\nThe Canadian border town of Hemmingford (population 1,200) is one of only about four outposts of the military in Canada, despite the fact that it's far north. Hemmingford maintains the fourth-highest percentage of active duty military in Canada – 13.7 per cent – out of the country's 16,400 armed forces, the Canadian Armed Forces Association reports.\n\nMany of the soldiers come from rural areas on the other side of the Canadian border: B.C. and Alberta, for example.\n\nThe border between Canada (Canada Border Services Agency) and the United States of America (US Customs and Border Protection) is seen at Hemmingford, Que. on March 25, 2017. (Photo: Graham Hughes/CP)\n\nBut it's not just that. Canada's military is also the largest in NATO, Canada's main international security partnership. That means it is the prime provider of the nation's security.\n\nThe Canadian military has been in a constant state of expansion for decades. When the United States and Canada finally signed the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994, the U.S. military was already bigger than Great Britain. Today, the military is almost twice as large as the British defense force.\n\nMilitary spending has expanded every year, growing more than $4.5 billion between 2004-2014. While military spending tends to shrink when economies are growing, it still stands around 2.5 per cent of all Canadian tax revenues. This year it will likely rise to 3 per cent of all tax revenues.\n\nThis means that a large part of every Canadian taxpayer's income is going to something called defense.\n\n\"For most Canadians, the government is the main employer,\" says Colin Robertson, an international economist at the University of Victoria and a senior fellow at the Conference Board of Canada. \"It creates most jobs.\"\n\nCanada has also spent tens of billions to fight various wars at home and with American troops. It has a history of spending and investing in equipment. While many people in the U.S. were familiar with the armoured vehicles and ships of the Canadian navy, few in this country could name a single Canadian warship.\n\nCanada's navy's biggest assets are its frigates; the Royal Canadian Navy's (RCN) aircraft carriers have seen more combat flight hours than any other ship in the navy. When Prime Minister Justin Trudeau began his government he took part in the ceremonial transfer of HMCS Fredericton from England to Canada's navy.\n\nThe navy also has the largest fleet in the Atlantic; its warships often patrol between Africa and North America. This year, the navy has a total of 18 warships stationed in the Atlantic Ocean area.\n\nCanada has a history of spending and investing in equipment. While many people in the U.S. were familiar with the armoured vehicles and ships of the Canadian navy, few in this country could name a single Canadian warship. (Photo: CP)\n\nIt's also a place where the military has found itself fighting wars against extremist groups such as Islamic State. Canada has had \"a long history of defending Canada's sovereignty, which is why Canada is often one of the first countries to take action in a conflict that could affect our sovereignty,\" says Stewart Webb, a professor of international relations at the University of British Columbia who specializes in Canadian foreign policy.\n\nThis hasn't always worked to Canada's advantage. In 2003, Iraq's Kurds launched an attack on Iraq's oil facilities, including a major refuelling station, which set off a chain of events in 2011 that ended in Canada joining the American-led bombing campaign against the extremists. The resulting chaos forced Canada to open its doors to refugees.\n\nCanada is often one of the first countries to take action in a conflict that could affect our sovereignty, like the one in Iraq. - Stewart Webb, professor at UBC\n\nIt is often forgotten that Canada was on the wrong side of this war – or on the opposite side. Its role in a conflict where so many others were calling for more restraint, more democracy and more human rights seems to have become the stuff of legend. It's a story that's become part of Canadian political and religious culture, as Canadians try to deal with a country where Canada is at war and yet still manages to be a peaceful and prosperous country.\n\n\"I think we have this weird myth about this brave but often stupid, sometimes violent, force in our midst which is sometimes referred to as the Canadian army,\" says Robertson.\n\nFor decades, historians and political leaders have argued about how Canada was at war when Canada was at war. It was seen by many as an embarrassing mistake, which",

      "CALGARY, Alberta (Reuters) - The first U.S. coal export terminal is scheduled to open in South Carolina on Wednesday, in a deal struck between Canadian producers and an affiliate of Duke Energy, the largest U.S. electric company.\n\nA new coal export terminal in South Carolina will allow coal companies to ship their surplus coal from the Powder River Basin into North America.\n\nCoal companies say the increased export of coal should have minimal impact on U.S. power stocks, given demand for the fuel to fuel cars and power plants.\n\nStill, they have said new export terminals will boost exports of coal to Asia, allowing them to tap into growing demand there even before President-elect Donald Trump moves into the White House next month.\n\nThe United States is the world's largest producer, exporter and user of coal and there are plans to add new terminals to allow for more exports of black coal in the future.\n\nU.S. President Barack Obama has been seeking to slow the decline of U.S. coal production and export revenue.\n\n\"This announcement brings the first U.S. coal export terminal on track for construction,\" said Jim Ritterbusch, a senior analyst at the coal futures group the Minerals Information Service.\n\n\"With the increased availability of natural gas and renewables, there is more pressure on coal to supply electricity into a market with increasing constraints and a dearth of natural gas.\"\n\nU.S. exports of thermal coal have stagnated at around 300,000 tonnes a year since the summer of 2002. Coal accounts for about 4 percent of U.S. energy production, or around 200 billion cubic feet, or the equivalent of around 1 percent of U.S. gas supply.\n\nThe project is expected to deliver around 20,000 tonnes per year and is estimated to create between 2,000 to 3,000 new jobs in the state while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and generating revenue for local governments, according to Duke Energy.\n\nThe new terminal's owners - a Calgary-based affiliate of Duke Energy - will ship the coal to a processing plant in Ohio. The company expects to sell it on the world market. The Ohio plant will receive around 15 percent of its coal from South Carolina.\n\nEnvironmental groups, including the Sierra Club, have criticized the plan, saying it does not take into account that the carbon dioxide emissions from the process of burning coal to generate electricity will increase, as will the emissions from the coal itself.\n\nA Duke Energy spokeswoman did not respond to messages seeking comment on the impacts of climate change or the impact of the construction.\n\n\"In general, there is nothing to prevent other coal exporting countries from following in America's footsteps,\" Brian Massey, the head of Greenpeace USA's climate program, said in a statement to a reporter. \"We can't just sit back and watch as carbon pollution from coal plants takes hold.\"\n\nThe terminal's owners have worked with two environmental groups to put in place the agreement.\n\nThey are concerned the company's $2.4 billion expansion of its open-pit Lea County coal mine next to the terminal may damage wetlands. However, an Illinois judge ruled in 2013 that Duke had been properly notified of a potential impact from the expansion and issued an environmental permit.\n\n\"If it has any impact at all, we would expect it to be minimal and not be greater than the emissions reduction that can be achieved with other energy sources,\" Ritterbusch said of coal exports.\n\nU.S. coal mining company Murray Energy Corp has said it expects the U.S. coal industry will be in full recovery by 2018. It is adding new mines across the West, including two mines in Wyoming, but it has yet to expand the Port Arthur export terminal.\n\n\"It seems like they did a lot of research to know where their resources were going to be located,\" said Paul Buechner, the managing partner of the Calgary-based consulting firm Environmental Defense Fund. \"If you are the largest energy producer and you are planning to expand your facilities, you may need to look at how it impacts the environment.\"",
      "The following is adapted from an earlier piece for the Daily Beast, \"Inside the New, Anti-Gay War on Kids.\"\n\nBy David F. Greenberg\n\nFor every family who has experienced firsthand the joys of raising an adopted child or two, there are likely hundreds who have lost a child to an otherwise senseless act of violence.\n\nThese victims comprise \"child victims of homicide\" whose cause of death is unknown if they were killed by a gun or another means of death, according to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children. \"It is not known whether a child victim was taken from their parents' care by a stranger,\" the group states on its website. \"Most homicides of children are not reported to police. But for those who are, the report is made to the NCMEC. It is then entered into the NCMEC's database. It is also reported to the Child Fatality Reporting System (FARS); it is a national system that provides information on all child fatalities in the United States, regardless of the location where the child died.\" \"Child victims of homicide\" are children under 5 years of age who die in an accident, homicide, unnatural death, and homicide of child by a person who does not care for them.\n\nWhen children who've left their home or carefree childhoods are reported missing, the NCMEC \"is quick to enter the report in the NCMEC Victim Identification and Notification Program (VINAP). For example, VINAP logs every child report of a missing child over the 1st 9 months of 2014. If the child is the result of a homicide, the NCMEC assigns that report to our Special Victims Unit (TVU). The NCMEC, together with TVU, then responds to each report to seek information about the child victim, locate the family and locate a potential suspect.\"\n\nYet, for several months now, the NCMEC has been silent on a particularly gruesome, yet most likely unnoticed, story, concerning a \"child victim of homicide,\" in Maryland's Prince George's County.\n\nOn March 9, 2015, a 12-year old boy was found murdered in his home in the town of Severna Park. His body was discovered by his mother, who was cleaning out the closets. She left a note on the chest of the body. She also left behind a cell phone charger.\n\nThe victim was named as Jaleel Williams. That same day, Prince George's Sheriff Mike Lipps announced that his department had taken \"several leads\" in the case of the unidentified boy's murder. Lipps described the killing in terms of a \"murderous rampage. When the little boy came home he was found in an extremely violent state.\"\n\nWhile Prince George's Department of Forensic Sciences (DPFT) had been conducting autopsies on the body, a second autopsy was scheduled for the following day. The next day, April 21, 2015, the Prince George's County Police Department announced on a local news broadcast that preliminary autopsy results came back on the body that matched the profile of the child taken from the family's home in September 2014. The body was then identified as Jaleel Williams.\n\nTwo autopsy results are sufficient for a death investigation under Maryland law. The first is an autopsy of the body, which gives investigators information on the cause of death, and the second is a death certificate. Under Maryland law, a cause of death is a \"coroner's finding.\" A finding that comes from the autopsy is in keeping with standard practices in forensic matters.\n\n\"Coroner's findings,\" as defined by Maryland law, refer to information about the manner of death, if any. In cases where a person dies in the hospital, a coroner's finding of death must be either the cause of death or a cause \"reasonably to be related to death,\" with more on cause of death requirements below. A coroner can not only determine the cause of death, but also determine whether it is by suicide, homicide, accident, or natural causes.\n\nThis is not an anomaly. According to the Maryland Department of Forensic Sciences website, coroners in Maryland can also determine \"the manner of death\" for certain deaths. The website further defines this as \"the final disposition of death.\" According to the DFS website, the manner of death is a finding of \"cause of death or \"by the standards of common human decency as defined under Maryland law, including the practice and policy of applying death by natural causes to accidents, homicides and other specified causes of death.\" The terms \"cause of death\" and \"final disposition\" are also in line with standard practices in Maryland homicide homicide investigations and coroners' inquests.\n\nAs in any such case, forensic pathologists can help provide \"the final disposition of the death,\" which includes the cause of death and a detailed description of the manner of death, if any. They, like coroners, can also rule out \"other causes.\"\n",

      "We all have a favorite restaurant. Mine is Pies'n'Cakes. In the mid-1800s this business was located right at the center of the town. Pies'n'Cakes was owned by James D. Darden and was one of Philadelphia's major employers.\n\nPies'n'Cakes was the first restaurant in the United States to serve pie. It was founded in 1850 on Spring Garden Street by Joseph Bicknell, a well-known baker whose reputation was spread by local newspapers. Darden opened four more Pies'n'Cakes eateries over the years. They were all near the center of Philadelphia. In 1868, Philadelphia changed the names of street names in the center of town. The old name of Spring Garden Street was changed to Race Street. James Darden and the Darden Restaurants were now called \"Rough and Ready Pies.\"\n\nIn 1895, Darden opened Darden's Food Mart a two story building on Spring Garden Street directly across from his restaurant. Darden built an addition on the back of the building in 1895 and added an elevator in 1902. In this addition, the Darden Restaurant and other shops and restaurants were situated and housed. The original building on Race Street was demolished in 1905 by the City.\n\nThe Darden Restaurant was built in 1916 on the north side of Race Street. Darden's Restaurant was an early American establishment with all the trappings that came with it of a fine dining restaurant. However, Darden's Food Service was a family style establishment and not as fancy as some of the finer establishments. The Darden Restaurant was a pioneer in the use of fresh fruit and vegetables. It also had a large salad bar, coffee shop, and a restaurant bar. Darden's Restaurant was considered a landmark because its original location was only three blocks from a streetcar station named after it.\n\nThe Darden Restaurant is an historical landmark at Spring Garden and Race Streets in Philadelphia and it is the oldest surviving restaurant business in Philadelphia.\n\nDarden's Restaurant has been the subject of many stories and is also a museum site. On my recent trip to Philadelphia, I made a pit stop at Darden's Restaurant.\n\nAt Darden's Restaurant, I met with Mary Korn, who ran the Restaurant for many years. I learned about the history of Darden's Restaurant and Mary Korn's family and about all of Darden's Restaurants. Mary Korn served her entire family of 18 children and they enjoyed the Darden Restaurant. Darden's Restaurant still operated after Mary Korn retired in 1982. She ran the restaurant on Race Street and the Race Room on Spring Garden Street. She still owned the Restaurant, but took care of the family who ran the restaurant.\n\nDarden Restaurant is located on Race Street at 3801 Race Street in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. One block west and a block north of Darden Restaurant is a building that used to house a jewelry shop and a saloon. The restaurant is across the street and one block northeast of Darden Restaurant. It is easy to see if you are driving down Race Street from the Darden Restaurant. To my north side, you can see the old Pies'n'Cakes that was here during the 1960s or 70s. The saloon is the last brick in the wall in what used to be the Race Room.\n\nAs I have always felt about Darden Restaurants, the Darden Restaurant, with its great name, became a business that was loved by its customers.",
      "Hannibal Buress's \"Bitch Sesh\" has been a little overshadowed by his stand up comedy career, but it would be foolish to ignore his latest effort. \"Bitch Sesh\" is, according to Buress, \"a story about being black and not being allowed on a basketball court,\" but he makes it his mission to educate white people about the racism and inequities in our society.\n\nWhen discussing the struggles of people of color in a racially divided America, a white person is the only one who doesn't truly understand, because they haven't actually had to deal with it firsthand. Instead of using the white perspective (which has long been the norm), Buress uses the stories of black writers, artists and comedians to tell an intimate view of what it's like to not only feel the wrath of white society, but, sometimes, the same vitriol from the people who should know better.\n\nHere are five scenes in which Buress gets to share his personal experience and tell a story that's all too real.\n\n1. \"Racism vs. W. E. B. Du Bois\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs part of his \"Bitch Sesh\" tour, Buress met w.e.b. doubles.\n\n\n(Source: Bitch Sesh)\n\nA few nights before the show, Buress got a call from a friend of his, who told him he was getting a lot of hate mail, but also told him that the show got a great reception at a show in Atlanta. \"What do you think of Atlanta for having black people there?\" a fan asked. \"It looks like a ghetto to me,\" Buress laughed.\n\n2. \"Don't Touch My Hair\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this clip from \"Bitch Sesh,\" Buress is interviewing a white woman about how much she enjoys having a straight hair style, telling her that \"straight hair is the black flag. The black flag has always been our flag, and straight hair was the black flag until the white folks decided to paint a white flag so that we can all hang our black flags up.\"\n\n3. \"I Love White People, Don't You?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn this scene from an interview with a white female interviewer, Buress has a heated discussion about her relationship with her white boyfriend, her experiences of racism from white friends and her struggles with her race.\n\n4. \"How Do You Sleep When Your Soul in Pieces?\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAn interview with a white guy who doesn't think his black friends like the \"black bitch\" joke and his relationship with his black ex-girlfriend.\n\n(Source: Bitch Sesh)\n\nBuress explains that after his ex-girlfriend dumped him for a white guy, he started dating her new white boyfriend, but things didn't work out as he planned. During one particular exchange, he told the guy that because he didn't think her friends liked the joke, it's possible they didn't like him after all.\n\n\"Do you know how much energy I put into this joke?\" Buress said. \"It was like one of you saying, we love you. 'Black bitch. Black bitch. And don't touch my hair.' That's one of the things that's gonna die if you don't give it time. You don't see me giving it time—and you know what that means for me? That I'm gonna stop. That makes it very real, very clear, and they see me and I'm not gonna let them walk all over me anymore.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n5. \"I Don't Know Where to Go from Here\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere's this interview, from \"Bitch Sesh,\" where Buress is on the phone with a black woman. The first thing she says is how white people think he's racist for \"calling white people n----rs.\"\n\n\n(Source: Bitch Sesh)\n\n\"Oh, I don't think there's anything wrong with calling white people n----rs,\" Buress quips. \"Let's go straight back to calling me black. You're gonna keep telling me that you don't like that.\"",
      "\"The president of the United States\" can become a synonym for \"The President of the United States of America.\" In that sense, it has become common to make fun of our nation's chief executive; to dismiss him as \"The Boss,\" as if he was some sort of disembodied, omnipotent entity.\n\nBut if we are to take the most literal approach to the president of the U.S., he was born within an electoral district of the United States in the year 1844, and he never relinquished his duties on the battlefield during the Civil War.\n\nThat leaves only one question. Who was the first president to not live in the territory of the nation he served during his term in office?\n\nI would wager it was Abraham Lincoln, who was the first president to not make himself resident of the United States during his administration.\n\nAs a student of Abraham Lincoln, I found the following passage intriguing. An American citizen, he had taken his home to Springfield, Ill., and used it as a summer home. It is said that in his day, the most common occupation of a lawyer was that of presiding over the trial of a client accused of crimes. The judge, or a local attorney, would then return to another home to write a judgment and issue an arrest warrant for the defendant. But the president had chosen Springfield as his summer home, and he stayed there for much of his time there. According to one source, he \"laid out\" his summer home \"every evening while he was having his breakfast at his hotel room.\" It seems fair to say that Lincoln is far from a lawyer to \"lay out\" his home.\n\nLincoln's residence is described as \"a three-room frame house on a wide and shady acre surrounded by pine trees and a pond\" where, after leaving Springfield, he \"used his morning hours, when not traveling, in studying\" and \"went to bed at 8 o'clock in the evening,\" and, \"at night he would rise at 8:30 and take a short walk to the church where he used to have a weekly or more intimate fellowship with friends.\"\n\nWhy did the man who was to become the 20th president not live in the United States during the time he was actually in office? After all, during the Civil War he was a Union soldier, and that was in an era that had neither the currency of today nor the technology of today to allow the government to forcibly conscript the president and his family into serving in the military.\n\nSo, when Lincoln took his family on a horseback trip through Iowa, he did not \"lay out\" his property, nor did he \"hurry back\" to serve in the military. He was a common man, just like any of us. He simply did not have the means to take his family to another country.\n\nIn some ways, Lincoln was more a product of his era than the rest of us. The majority of Americans did not come of age until much later, so their views about the \"president\" — who he was, who he represented — did not enter their minds until much later in their lives. When Lincoln came to the national stage, he was, by most accounts, in his early 30s. If he were one of us, he would have been much older than that, with a lot of \"first world\" problems to deal with.\n\nLincoln is best characterized as a \"regular\" citizen, who knew the rules of the game: you needed a government-issued identification card (often an I.D. card) when you were outside of town in order to pay the \"furtherance of state\" taxes or to do business with people who could, and who did not believe that he or his friends could ever violate those rules. (Of course, the idea of a president going to court or fighting a court order like a \"regular citizen\" has some truth to it, since the U.S. government does try and protect its citizens and their property from arbitrary government action.)\n\nWhile it might seem that it was \"common knowledge\" in 1849 that an immigrant could become president, there is scant evidence on record that the president of the United States was even born overseas. Lincoln did not meet his parents until 1810, and as a young man was already married with a daughter before he took office. It seems clear that the only connection he had to his parents' home country was the fact that they were \"locals.\"\n\nThe most compelling circumstantial evidence I have seen came from a letter to Abraham Lincoln that was written by one of his friends, George H. Harrison, a prominent New Englander who lived in Springfield in 1859. In this letter, Mr. Harrison wrote: \"Mr. Lincoln had his father's name from birth, and was born in the State of Illinois in February of 1812. His mother came from Virginia—but was not one of those who made the Constitution.\"\n\nIf he",
      "\"It's very simple: In my opinion, my country doesn't take care of its own people.\"\n\nWhile Donald Trump has frequently accused Mexico of cheating on trade agreements, he's also promised to pay for a border wall — a point Trump has repeatedly backed off of since his campaign announcement last year.\n\nTrump has been particularly hard on immigrants to this country from all over the world. But the New York City billionaire hasn't always been so blunt. In 2005, Trump told Howard Stern \"I think Mexico is going to end up paying\" for the wall, which Mexico emphatically and repeatedly deny they'll pay for.\n\nNow a new biography of Trump, The Truth About Donald: Who He Really Is, claims the billionaire and reality TV star wasn't exactly serious on his comments, and went to great lengths to make them to be taken seriously.\n\n\"I was very open about this,\" Trump told Stern in an appearance that aired in July 2005 and was first revealed by The Washington Post on Friday\n\n\"Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, as president,\" Trump continued.\n\nWhile Mexico hasn't officially announced it will or can't pay for the wall — though one of its former presidents has already promised it would be paid for — Trump has repeatedly accused Mexico of doing the nation's economic dirty work.\n\n\"What they're doing to us is a disgrace,\" he told Stern — as evidence of that, he pointed to a Pew Research Center report that showed Mexicans' per capita income is just over 22 percent of the U.S.\n\nTrump then cited a report from 2013 that showed the Mexican economy has become so strong that it has surpassed the U.S. as the world's largest consumer of goods.\n\n\"If we do not protect our jobs, companies like you are going to have to shut down and move back,\" Trump said. \"There are 35 to 40 companies that have left the United States.\"\n\nTo back up his point, Trump cited the latest numbers on corporate taxes that show Mexico has eliminated a whopping 75 percent of its corporate tax rate in the last decade.\n\nTrump's boast about Mexico's economic power is similar to a 2014 book he wrote about the country titled \"The Art of the Deal,\" which called Mexico a \"great country, the greatest business country in the world.\"\n\nAnd as The Post's Paul Farhi reported, Trump made repeated suggestions that his company would build its first foreign-designed, non-American branded building — something he never actually managed to do.\n\nFollow Danielle on Twitter\n\nContent created by The Daily Caller News Foundation is available without charge to any eligible news publisher that can provide a large audience.

      "In response to the ongoing public and corporate opposition to the \"No on 624\" proposition in Michigan, which would permit only a 5-decade moratorium on new oil and gas drilling in the state -- and a permanent moratorium on existing wells -- a new non-profit organization is organizing citizen activists and allies to stand up on the campaign trail to support what is in fact the most environmentally responsible and economically viable option that could help keep the climate in check.\n\nMichigan Citizens to Stop Fracking (MD624) is an umbrella organization aimed at galvanizing Michigan voters to defeat ballot initiatives that would prevent fracking from becoming more widely available in the state.\n\nThe group says that even though people have been debating the issue for almost 10 years now, the public remains largely in the dark. MD624 asserts that the anti-fracking campaign launched this year has brought forth a new group of people into the political debate.\n\n\"We've built a large network of volunteers and grassroots organizations. They are not always able to speak openly about what [they are] doing. We're bringing a much more unified voice to the debate about Michigan's energy future,\" said Michael Bell, co-founder of MD624. \"By starting to campaign on a common message, our people and organizations are speaking their minds and making the same argument that everyone else is making.\"\n\nMore than 120,000 Michiganders have now signed a petition in support of the MD624 platform that can be found online at http://www.mi624.org/\n\nMD624's stated mandate is to \"increase public awareness and influence of the policy and environmental debate.\" According to Bell, the group's goals are to:\n\nEducate state and national legislators, and the public at large.\n\nEncourage and equip citizens to become better informed, activists and concerned citizens.\n\nCreate an organized and effective political force.\n\nMaintain a clear focus on a specific policy proposal, without losing sight of more general goals.\n\n\"We're going to need a strong and dedicated grassroots force. We're going to need activists and leaders who are willing to lead efforts,\" said Bell. \"We are now making the next step in establishing a state-based, nonpartisan organization that will educate, organize, educate and educate, and we're going to make sure that the energy of Michigan citizens are a strong and effective one.\"\n\nTo that end as the group begins the next phase of organizing and educating, MD624 is currently reaching out to community organizations who hold grassroots power, such as churches, businesses, unions, and community organizations, to establish a working relationship with the organization and be a part of its strategy. \"We really want every group to be a part of this. We're going to need them to be,\" said Bell.\n\nTo better reach out to the state's elected officials, MD624 is calling on all concerned citizens to sign an \"I Voted\" petition and submit the signature through the organization's official website at http://www.mi624.org. Once signatures have been processed, MD624 will have the petition on its site for other groups and supporters to see. \"We would like them to know that MD624 is a statewide campaign and, when you sign an MD624 petition, you are also signing for all the groups and organizations nationwide that have been working hard on the ground to defeat the oil and gas industry,\" said Bell.\n\nWhen signed by more than 10 percent of registered voters in Michigan, the \"I Voted\" petition requires that a statewide referendum on Michigan's fracking ban be passed for it to be certified. The deadline is June 30. Bell stressed that MD624's goal, as stated on its website, is to \"make sure those who want to make sure the energy of Michigan continues to be a clean and safe one make it to the ballot.\" He believes that if everyone in Michigan joins together to support this pro-environment, pro-health and job-producing initiative, they have a great shot.\n\n\"The public is not educated about the issue,\" said Bell. \"When you get into the political debate on this issue we're making it clear that the debate is about [protecting the] people and environment of Michigan over the very short term pursuit of profits for the corporate state. The public is now being drawn into the debate. We're building a grassroots force.\"\n\nTo learn more about MD624, visit its official website: http://mi624.org",

      "In the wake of a new lawsuit about U.S. health care and health insurance, the New Hampshire Democratic Party held a forum at a senior center in Goffstown Friday morning.\n\nParty Chair Ray Buckley said the forum was a chance for people to hear from former Gov. John Lynch, who is on a book tour promoting his new book, \"A Better Way: A Better Balance Between Life & Business.\"\n\nLynch discussed the Affordable Care Act, which has been a hot-button topic of late, and its effects on Americans, as well as his own experience as governor.\n\nLynch said the new health care law is good for the economy and good for people because it's providing access to preventive care.\n\nHe described the new laws as bringing costs down.\n\nFormer Gov. John Lynch talks about the national health care law.\n\nBut he said he also knew it would have benefits for business, which is why the health care law required insurance companies to provide more coverage.\n\nLynch also spoke about what he called the \"bend over backwards\" that health care and health insurance companies have had when it comes to offering health insurance benefits to people with pre-existing conditions.\n\n\"When the insurance companies want to deny the insurance coverage for any reason. they say, 'oh, you've got a preexisting condition, no matter how much medical knowledge was provided with you when you applied. Nothing's going to happen,'\" he said.\n\nThe Republican National Committee says those statements are offensive.\n\n\"The insurance companies have a responsibility to their employees. That's not what this act says. In fact, that's a clear violation of the law by the federal government,\" the RNC's Chris Carr said in a statement. \"New Hampshire stands side-by-side with the rest of the country in calling these companies out for their outrageous behavior.\"\n\nLynch said the health care law is working perfectly so far, and he said the insurance companies will be there when you need medical care.\n\n\"If you have a preexisting condition, you have to have it covered,\" he said. \"We're going to be there and it'll happen in about four months out of every year. It's going to be just like that.\"\n\nLynch says it is unfair for a family to lose $200,000 when a single person with no health care coverage loses $5,000.",
      "For some, one of the great things about being a child is that they don't know where they are in the vast universe. You can find the answers to all your questions about the world in the smallest details you are given: in the color of the sky, in the shape of a tree, in the shape of your friend's hair, even in the shape of your body. I've learned these things as I've grown, and they have given me power and a sense of self-awareness to be able to stand with the other heroes and learn new skills.\n\nBut that's why I'm a superhero—the powers I have are just so easy to use and the world around me is so vast that I can see it all at once. When I get that power that shows me the world as it is made of matter and energy, I see it as a living, breathing thing, and I see the world through the eyes of my body.\n\nThe world isn't as big as I used to like, so I don't have as much power. But somehow, my body has become a part of the world in a way I never thought possible. I've found a little universe—a realm where my body just happens to exist—and in this little universe, I have gained power so great that I don't know how much of a superhero I really am. I have enough power to fight the villains that have been working against me from the start and have saved us from all these crises. I've managed to become a force in my own right in a world where no one else can understand or see my powers.\n\nBut I'm afraid. I want to help, I want to save, but I can't. I have so many responsibilities to myself, and I can't be the one to do all of this work. Instead, I look at my sister, and she looks at me. She looks at me tired and confused, and she tells me that I have to help save this world. I try to ask what I have to do, and she says that we have to leave it. So I say goodbye to my friends and go into a new world where I have a better chance of doing good, but it's not the one I want. I want to go home, and to say goodbye to my siblings and dad and everyone who has done so much for me and given me this chance.\n\nIt's so hard in a world that doesn't care about me, when there are so many people who have no problem lying, cheating, and stealing, and we live in a world where we are expected not to cry, when we can't even smile at just the right moment to be accepted. I don't understand it at all, and I know that I'm just as much of a failure as my sister.\n\nBut just as she gives me my power to fight, her power is a power of survival. As I grow into adulthood, I find that I've taken the role that she gave me. I try and do all the little things that I was told to do by my parents, but I don't even want to try. I'm not strong enough to help my family with things, I'm not strong enough to stop my siblings from ruining my world in every way possible. I have to let go of that. That's my power. That's my destiny.\n\nIn my world, we're not supposed to cry. I can't cry, and my life isn't any better, because there's no one to cry with. I just want to go home… but I don't know how.\n\nSo on one last day, before we leave our hometown, I'm going to cry before we go. Because as my sister said, I'm not strong enough to save this world alone. I'm not strong enough to save us from all my stupid, awful, terrible friends. I'm not strong enough to save my parents from being murdered by my siblings, or a random enemy in an adventure that has no plot. I'm not strong enough to save my parents from me. I'm not strong enough. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.\n\nI guess I'll just cry, just once. I hope it'll do her some good.",

      "An investigation by an international team led by the New York State Museum has unveiled new evidence that a mysterious Egyptian figure discovered in 1901 was the head of an ancient Egyptian god.\n\nThe figure, called the Koh-i-Noor, or \"Royal Treasure,\" was found in the tomb of a royal boy, Amenhotep III, in 1901, the last pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, who lived between c. 2513-2524 B.C. at the time of the Egyptian Old Kingdom. It represented a snake with wings and the head of a bearded deity. Scholars think that the Koh-i-Noor was the symbol of Amenhotep III; but the ancient Egyptian word for \"koh,\" which includes the koh-i-noor's name, might also be pronounced \"kuh.\"\n\n\"At first, some experts were skeptical,\" says Kathleen Sikes, curator of Egyptology at the New York State Museum. Today, that skepticism has been replaced by awe: \"Today, when we see the Koh-i-Noor, we feel that this is a very important discovery. And that's why we have decided to make it.\"\n\nThe new evidence supports a theory that previous theories of the Koh-i-Noor's identity are incorrect. Scholars have long hypothesized that the Koh-i-Noor could be a symbol of Osiris, the Egyptian god who has been worshiped since ancient times as a god of the underworld.\n\nBut Sikes says this is wrong because Osiris may have been thought of as an Egyptian god who ruled the underworld, so he would not have been represented as the deity of the dead. The Koh-i-Noor was found in a tomb of the last pharaoh of the 18th dynasty, but it is not certain when its owner died; it also had the name \"Amenhotep,\" but scholars argue that it was a name borrowed from a royal predecessor, whose tomb was known as the \"tomb of Amenemhet II,\" says Sikes.\n\nThe team's analysis shows that the Koh-i-Noor is neither an image of Osiris nor the deceased royal ancestor but is in fact the head of a deity whose cult was worshiped for about 2,500 years, a time when Egyptian art depicts the cults of Thoth, the god of writing, and Ra.\n\n\"So far we know absolutely nothing of these deities except that they were in the pantheon of the gods,\" says Sikes. \"We think they are the same.\" Ra is known only from the cult sculpture in Karnak, at the northern end of the Nile River. Thoth is better known in biblical texts, but his importance during the ancient Egypt was often forgotten in their focus on the cult of Thoth's more important patron, the god Isis.\n\nThe research also suggests that the Koh-i-Noor represents the god of the underworld, the mysterious \"black spirit\" identified with the deity known in Egyptian texts as Set, the god of chaos and chaos gods. But these ideas have not been formally connected to Set, according to Sikes.\n\nThe theory linking the Koh-i-Noor to Set is supported by a study of the figure. Sikes has found that the Koh-i-Noor's arms are bent into a cross, which has been interpreted in some studies as symbolic of Set. The team's work also suggests that the Koh-i-Noor was carved into its box and its box lid was attached to the Koh-i-Noor by means of four nails, called a \"cubit,\" which are believed to be related to Set.\n\nThe Koh-i-Noor is the only burial object ever to appear at the American Museum of Natural History and the only object ever found in Egypt whose name includes the pharaoh's last name. The pharaoh's name is lost at that time.\n\nNow it is at the New York State Museum.\n\nCynthia and Bruce Smith have been working at the New York State Museum for almost 30 years and are among its most experienced Egyptian experts. They are passionate about exploring the unknown, even when they are faced with extraordinary challenges.\n\n\"Cynthia has the kind of courage and openness that it takes sometimes to do what you think is difficult,\" says Bruce Smith. \"I think that's the most impressive, to me, part about her: how she deals with difficult questions. She can't give up.\"\n\nFor further information about the Koh-i-Noor, contact the New York State Museum, 215-677-5855, or by e-mail at info@nyse.org.",

I was looking at the top-ten lists on reddit and a few other places (it's all here) about people that \"deserve\" to win the title.\n\nI figured: \"I really like a lot of these people and the idea of being the world's most popular person is something that would make me extremely happy; it would be a dream come true for me.\" So I started to consider the \"people that I'd most want to see win\".\n\nFirst up: Reddit's own /u/kardashev. As far as I'm aware, he is the only person on reddit in history to have \"completed\" a marathon. (I also think he's the only person to have done a marathon that included a 4 hour race as an extra-large mile.) His achievement was getting to run and finish The Boston Marathon in his hometown. The Boston marathon is one of the biggest events in the world and it's a huge deal, so I mean, kardash is a true legend.\n\nKardash was a big favorite going in and it looks like he'll have the final say in deciding the winners on June the 9th. As far I could tell he's the favorite by around half a point, but even with that he probably isn't going to win. I'm sure that there are several other candidates that will probably also make it far, but for me, they're just not as good as him so I'm going to stick with my pick (okay, his top-six, but I think I'll probably be the third on that list and that will definitely be the lowest of the top-six picks).\n\nSo, who's next?\n\nOk, so this whole thing is probably going to turn into an essay on this subreddit, but you get the idea. There are at least three other people in that top-six I like better, but I'm not sure who they are. They just look like they should be on there with their huge fan bases – but none of them will make the final cut.\n\nThe other reason that I'm putting my money down for my top-six candidates is that for me, as someone that does not like winning a lot and doesn't have much sense of competition, finding someone who's going to beat me in a marathon is fun. I am a big fan of not really winning (I've said it many times) but I think there are plenty of people who think their running is better than mine so I'll probably enjoy the competition.\n\nThis whole thing reminds me of when I was in high school. We won a lot of basketball games and that was a big point of pride with the football team. So one night in the middle of a football game, we went in the locker room and the head coach decided that for the entire game the team would try to dunk the ball into a basket. This seemed like a really fun and stupid way to play football but it was also hilarious and so much different from what we were doing. I liked it!\n\nThere's like 10 or 11 of us running around on the basketball court and it was fun to do that! But also, we were all trying to dunk the ball and this was the thing that I thought was fun and interesting about running. We could do that! I was a big basketball player, so I'm sure everyone did. But that was our game.\n\nWell, that didn't last long. It just wasn't very good.\n\nRunning can be an interesting way to test out the limits of the human body and brain, because just because you can do it doesn't mean it should be taken that seriously. That's not to say that the rest of the thing doesn't matter, in fact, it is important, but running isn't actually very competitive. And I've always thought running is a way to be a part of a community, and I'm sure there are runners out there that appreciate the community that goes along with it.\n\nI'll write more about my reasons why I'm putting my money on this in a future post, but there's just a lot of excitement about the idea of the top-ten, because it is something that I want to be involved in.\n\nUntil then, I will probably stick to my favorite pastime of writing essays and reading a LOT of the internet (or reading a ton and writing a ton of essays).",
      "\"It wasn't me.\"\n\nThat's how David Lee felt after the Clippers announced he'd be out for the season. It was also how the rest of us thought, given the reports that Lee had fractured his right foot. But Lee has since explained that that was not the case, because it wasn't something he'd seen coming.\n\nHe had surgery after the season. But the truth now is that the injury didn't occur until Lee was getting ready to do some heavy lifting. After getting his left foot popped back in the socket a couple times, Lee decided to get a second opinion: Dr. James Andrews, the orthopaedic surgeon who's performed over 2,600 surgeries on athletes. On Monday, Lee had his left foot popped back in the socket once more. And what's more amazing, he was able to get it back with nothing more than his normal work boots.\n\nAccording to sources, on top of his surgery, Lee also underwent two weeks of rehabilitation, working with members of the Cleveland Cavaliers organization and Dr. Phil Scripps to get himself back on the same running program that he was on before his leg injury. That's what makes Tuesday's news so extraordinary. He has been able to start working with a full set of football cleats for the first time in two years, without the added pressure of playing for the Clippers before he can even train properly.\n\nLee went for the ankle specialist's opinion after the surgery, but he was already off to a slow start to his training. According to the Lakers Insider, some of Lee's team-mates told him, \"You have to take one to two weeks off, because you can't do heavy lifting until you get back, and you're back to square one.\" Lee took that advice, because getting out from under some of the pressures of being the Clippers' leading scorer, most valuable player and leading scorer for a team that already was on a hot streak with his play, wasn't a realistic option.\n\nHe'll start in some limited situations, perhaps as a reserve point guard behind J.J. Redick and Jamal Crawford. There are other options in reserve for the reserves, though, too. He'll need to find his place, but this setback, while difficult, will hopefully help in the longer term.\n\n[Follow Ball Don't Lie on social media: Twitter | Instagram | Facebook | Tumblr]\n\nLee's situation is one that will be discussed for years to come. In February 2015, the Clippers gave up two second-round picks to acquire Lee, and for a year, they watched as he led the Clippers to the league's best record with some of the best play on the team. Then he was lost to injury for the rest of the season, which led to the Clippers trading him to the Lakers last summer. At the time, the Clippers had made it known they were unhappy with the way the deal was structured -- with only $8.3 million left on his contract this season, it was impossible for the Clippers to move him without taking in a significant portion of his salary.\n\nThere were plenty of reports that the issue with the Clippers, for the most part, wasn't with the trade itself, or that the players weren't happy, but the way the Clippers had handled it. Clippers coach Doc Rivers publicly said he was happy for Lee after he agreed to the trade, and Clippers owner Steve Ballmer and General Manger Doc Rivers publicly said some of his injuries were due to trying to play through the discomfort of the injury. The players were unhappy with the way they weren't consulted during the process. And there were reports that the Clippers had other injury concerns that kept them from fully evaluating Lee.\n\nUltimately, according to sources, the players got more than they bargained for in the trade. For now, Lee will continue to rehab his sprained ankle and figure things out behind the scenes. He has said he's focused on getting back to where he can get involved in the offense, but the team, in its current state, won't have room for him right away. And if Lee gets his ankle right and begins to play like the guy who led the team last season, the Clippers are in decent shape. The team will need a lot more work this summer, but they have enough talent and will have the assets, including the No. 2 selection in next June's NBA Draft, to be more active in the draft pool in 2018 and get a player who can develop into an integral piece of their franchise in the coming years.\n\nIf Lee can stay healthy and return to his former self, that's when we'll really see him and the Clippers together. But for now, he's taking things step-by-step, and his ankle doesn't seem to be the issue.\n\nMore NBA coverage from Yahoo Sports:",
      "An explosion at the entrance of the St-Nicolas neighbourhood of central Paris has killed four people, including two French policemen, the French interior ministry has said. Several others remain in hospital.\n\nThe explosion in Saint-Nicolas, known as the district of the Jews in Paris, occurred shortly after 11.30am local time (3.30am Irish time) when authorities believe three men tried to enter their apartment block.\n\nThree of the men carried a suicide belt, and there was a third man who threw a heavy object at a police patrol and injured two officers.\n\nOne of the officers is in critical condition, two have been discharged from hospital and the third policeman has sustained minor injuries.\n\nTwo of the men were arrested, and the third, believed to be the suicide bomber, was arrested nearby.\n\nThe area is close to a synagogue in the building which was reportedly the target of an alleged anti-Semitic terrorist attack on Saturday.\n\nIn the aftermath of the explosion, which caused damage to one of the apartments nearby, a police source told Paris Match that the apartment-building was hit by a gas canister bomb, with the men \"probably hiding in this building\".\n\nOne resident of the apartment block has told the site that he heard two explosions and thought it was the beginning of a fire drill, but soon discovered the body of the fourth victim, a French policeman.\n\nFrench Prime Minister Manuel Valls confirmed the casualties, saying in a tweet: \"I am shocked by the news of the explosions in Saint-Nicolas. We will do all that is necessary to find the perpetrators.\"\n\n\"Three men have been arrested while a fourth person can't be named because of his injuries,\" he added.\n\nThe president's office also confirmed the news of the explosions, while François Hollande called an emergency meeting of his cabinet, which was held at 2pm.\n\n\"There is a real threat. The police authorities are doing everything,\" he said.\n\nFrance's interior minister Bernard Cazeneuve said early on Sunday the government would increase security resources at Jewish sites, after the arrest of the suspects.\n\n\"I have asked to increase the activity of the security services and in particular we will put more resources in the Jewish neighbourhood of Saint-Nicolas in Paris,\" said Cazeneuve.\n\nFrance has the largest Jewish community in Europe, with several hundred thousand members around the country. The French embassy in London said it had been working with local Jewish organisations and police in order to maintain safety.\n\nAt the scene: Peter Clarke, BBC News, Paris\n\nSeveral local children were seen gathered around the police tape around the building on the Rue St Nicolas, waiting to be reunited with the relatives they have not seen for months.\n\nOne man was clearly distraught; the other one simply held his hand up for silence.\n\nA large fire was started in the courtyard of another apartment block where several people had been hiding.\n\nThe area is notorious for having been the target of two anti-Semitic attacks in recent years. They were carried out by Muslim radicals against the Jewish community there.\n\nIn December of 2015, a suspected Islamist attacked the head rabbi of the French Jewish community, Jacques Hamel, in front of his daughter's school.\n\nThe men responsible for that attack and the latest incident are still at large.\n\nPrime Minister Valls said anti-Semitism had \"no place in France\", adding \"Jews have no security\" in France.\n\nThe Jewish community in France has been on high alert after an alleged hate shooting in Vélodrome d'Hiver on 13 July which left a rabbi and a Jewish teacher dead.\n\nAt the time, French leaders pledged to intensify the police and security presence in the area.",
      "This article was written by David M. Hughes and originally appeared on Waging Nonviolence. It was adapted by Dan Berger from his new book, Beyond the Matrix: An Anarchist Theory of Truth and Justice for a Revolutionary World.\n\nThe United States is a highly ideological society, with a strong emphasis on the state and its legitimacy, on the American experiment, and on the ideal of freedom. This has allowed for the development of a sophisticated propaganda machine, a network designed to educate, organize, and mobilize the masses.\n\nThere's simply no way the US could have been the global power it once was, or even the largest, without creating and sustaining an ideological environment, and an ability to mobilize masses of people for political gain.\n\nBut the US isn't the only country capable of doing this.\n\nThe world was in danger of slipping into a state of permanent war. The US was ready to use force if necessary to achieve its objectives. The American media was in a frenzy of fear—and no one was more prepared to take advantage of it than the US government.\n\nOn October 29, 2001, the United States launched attacks on Afghanistan and on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. A year later, on September 11, 2001, the US initiated an illegal assault on Afghanistan and on the Twin Towers and Pentagon. Six days later on October 16, 2002, the US did the same thing in Iraq.\n\nThe September 11 attacks were used to justify an invasion of Afghanistan and to launch a war on Iraq. They were followed by a war on Iraq, which was used to justify a war on the Muslim world.\n\nAt the same time, US aggression against Afghanistan and Iraq produced a great surge in US power. The US had invaded Afghanistan and occupied it as part of \"Project X\" to support the Northern Alliance against its Russian overlords.\n\nBut Russia refused to allow anyone to invade the northern part of Afghanistan. So Russia invaded Afghanistan again, in 2001, and occupied it, killing about one million mostly civilians. Russia, however, had a different goal. The new US secretary of state, Condoleezza Rice, claimed at the time that the Russian invasion was \"a great strategic blunder by the Russians,\" because it created an open door for Al Qaeda. This, she said, had been Osama bin Laden's goal all along, since he knew that Russia was prepared to invade Afghanistan.\n\nThis was the justification President Bush used for going to war against Afghanistan and Iraq in the years following 9/11, and the justification President Obama used for going to war against Syria last year.\n\nThese two countries were the central targets of the American propaganda machine during the entire decade of war. There was the Iraq war, which was led by Colin Powell, then Secretary of State under President Bush. There was the war in Afghanistan. And there was the war on Pakistan.\n\nThe main target was Iraq. The main goal was to topple Saddam Hussein and install a US puppet. So the propaganda made clear that US-led military attacks on Iraq constituted self-defense, that the invasion was necessary, and that the US and Iraqi regimes had no rational reasons to attack Iraq.\n\nThe propaganda also said that Bush had an \"unquestionable\" right to invade Iraq, a right recognized by the United Nations (under Article 42, Section 2) and confirmed in a number of resolutions of the UN Security Council. Most of these sanctions against Iraq were designed, at least in part, so as to prevent its \"military dimensions\" and to prevent an invasion of Iraq. The US-led war against Iraq was justified so convincingly by its propaganda that even some people in the US government admitted it was \"necessary.\"\n\nIn the Middle East, the US propaganda machine went even further. It claimed that Saddam Hussein had nuclear weapons and was developing them. He was an \"existential threat to his neighbors\" in the Middle East. In Iraq, the government the US supported was corrupt and in a state of collapse. The country's military was in shambles.\n\nThese are all things the UN Security Council said about Iraq before the war. The media in the US and other countries, though, made no effort to verify the claims that Saddam Hussein had weapons of mass destruction or that his government was corrupt.\n\nThe US had a similar propaganda operation against Libya (under the leadership of Gaddafi), and had waged covert \"regime change\" wars in numerous countries. These were wars of aggression. All were based on the assertion that Iraq had weapons of mass destruction, that the Libyan \"rebels\" were a threat to their neighbors, and that NATO ought to invade Libya.\n\nWhat was the US government willing to do to further its goals? It was willing to launch war on Iraq. It was willing to launch war on Libya. It was willing to launch war against Syria. It was willing to launch war against Iran. And, of course, it is willing to launch war against Russia.\n\nHow does US propaganda compare",
      "The U.S. Chamber of Commerce launched a political action committee Thursday in its fight to defeat Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.).\n\nFlake, who broke ranks with his party to oppose a Senate GOP health care bill, was one of nine primary challengers to the GOP leader announced by the Washington-based organization Thursday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe U.S. Chamber of Commerce spent tens of millions of dollars campaigning in 2016 and will spend almost $90 million on the 2018 midterms — in addition to the millions that other groups have already invested in the races.\n\nThe group plans to focus on the House and Senate races where Republicans will face tough reelection battles, the group said.\n\nThe group said Flake's votes against the Senate health care bill in July helped sink its tax reform effort and hurt his prospects of winning reelection in 2018. Flake announced his opposition to the Senate healthcare legislation in July.\n\n\"No senator is more susceptible to losing to a Democrat than Jeff Flake,\" Bob Barnett, president and CEO of the group, said Friday. \"The people of Arizona are not looking for a third Obama term.

      "In a recent interview with ABC, Dr Neil deGrasse Tyson answered the same question over and over again and offered no evidence to explain why the universe can't be 13.82 billion years old.\n\nThis answer was the subject of much discussion on our Facebook page, but I wanted to see if we could find any support in the science or religion communities for this seemingly outlandish proposal.\n\n\nFor starters, I know this video is out of date by a few years, but this was taken during a talk at Yale University back in 2013, so it's still a pretty recent answer.\n\nIt basically boils down to the idea of a \"bubble\" in a liquid, with a density difference between the two parts of the \"bubble\" indicating their age. The \"bubble\" would theoretically exist for 13.82 billion years, but it doesn't in that specific scenario because the density difference between the two parts might be too great. Or, in that scenario, the universe is too young to contain any \"bubble\" at all.\n\nAs Tyson said in his interview, this concept is \"not so crazy but it's not so well supported\".\n\nFor example, if you're reading a paper on the density of the early universe, there might be some equations describing how much the density would vary between the two parts of the universe if they were that \"aged\", but that's the only piece of mathematics that would suggest their ages would differ too much between the two parts of the universe.\n\nYou also have to take into account the amount of time that has passed since the very first moment when the universe was created. While the universe contains all of space-time, with no spatial separation, it also contains a \"density\" of matter that determines its density as in, \"How density and time interact\". This density is what is measured in units like billionths of a meter per cubic meter of space-time. Therefore, in a tiny little universe, a certain density of matter cannot exist, so we would know that at the present time, space-time is dense and the density of the universe is the same as you see around you in real life, and at the farthest distance away, the density of the universe itself is nearly zero.\n\nThe Universe is just about the only thing in all of space-time that is a perfectly smooth space-time space-time. There is absolutely no way to make the space-time around one part of a bubble larger than the other, which means a \"bubble\" must simply explode at the very smallest size of a single molecule!\n\nI'll also point out that even if \"bubbles\" are so simple to explain, they don't explain many of the known constants in the universe. The constants of the universe are all quite \"stiff\" and are actually a measurement of how much energy the universe is receiving from its surrounding.\n\nSo the universe was created at a very high energy level, and then it has been continuously expanding ever since. So it is still constantly receiving \"energy\" and the constant expansion and contraction (the Big Bang) is just a part of the whole phenomenon.\n\nSo in order to make a \"bubble\" in a liquid, you have to make it so hot that it starts burning all of the molecules in there! It is not possible to do a \"bubble\" in any liquid for very long times (you'll quickly get a \"flame!\") so the universe was probably not \"born\" from one of those tiny molecules. In order to sustain that sort of a thing for billions of years, you would need to do extremely rapid chemical reactions.\n\nAs Tyson also noted in his interview:\n\nSo you might make a liquid, but you may have something very different, which you'd see if you took one minute to go through an entire year of time, you know, to see what all the atoms and molecules do. And you would see that this system is a very complex combination of different molecules that in turn produce compounds. And that makes sense, because it requires very different chemistry than you see in the chemical reactions in your kitchen, or in your house. So that's why we need the laws of physics of chemistry and physics.\n\nOf course we can talk about things like the decay of the radioactive elements that form our radioactive elements as opposed to the elements that form other elements, but that's another topic altogether.\n\nThe problem with all of this is that there really is no \"smoking gun\" scientific evidence behind this claim. So if we're going to talk about science in general, we can at least agree on the fact that we need evidence before making an \"assumption\", so to speak.",
      "I have always liked the use of the word \"carpetbagger\" when referring to poor quality foreign workers. Here we have another word, \"carpetbaggers\", and the same kind of thing. For my part, I can certainly sympathise with the frustration felt by some of the \"carpetbagger\" people; after all, some of my friends were carpetbaggers. My own life story was an interesting one. My first job in Australia was as a porter at a hotel in Queensland, after a few months of work I was invited to join the army. My military training and some family history came in very useful, as I later served in the army, air force and navy, and was the only English speaking person to have served in those services.\n\"I don't really care what you say, let's have a piss\" \"I think we will start with a piss\" We've been down to an abattoir here already, and are going to a slaughterhouse next door. \"Oh, so what do you think? A pig? A sheep?\" It's not all that bad. I like what I do. It's nice to be able to speak English. I enjoy having my own car and being able to drive it. There's a lot to get your head round, even from living in Australia for many years. This time I'd be happy to take the whole country with me. This is our country, why should we be treated like that? I think people here make it too easy for us. I do not have one of their fancy cars, but I drive a Nissan Maxima and I get around pretty well. It's very difficult for me to understand things that other people can understand. I just see our problems, not theirs. We have just come here so we can make our lives easier. We don't understand this country, we don't have the proper skills. We get the job done, but to those who come from another country, they have it much easier because it's less expensive and the work is often harder.\nCarpetbaggers \"I don't know where you get all your ideas\" I used to work on the front desk of a hostel. When they started taking away our parking spots it was quite obvious they weren't going to hire us or our friends anymore. I would never have been hired there and I'm actually pretty proud of the fact that I managed myself. For a while I lived in a hostel called \"The Guesthouse\", it was not my idea to take over the place, it may not have been my idea to be the only English speaking person there either, but we didn't have much choice. Then we went to a different hostel, it turned out there was nothing like the other one. After living in an illegal camp for 4 weeks a few years ago, we discovered there was nothing like them either. We just have to make do. We don't want this job; we know how much money we are costing the government in fuel and all of our bills, so we don't want to go through with this. As I said before I really like what I do but it sure looks like a lot more work would be needed to earn enough money, I suppose it's like a lot of things in Australia, whether they are the government or what, it is difficult to compare. I can see how someone like me can make enough money doing something else, that it does look hard work, there must be a lot of problems with this country. \nThe \"Carpetbagger\" problem is not exclusive to our \"big cities\" either. In fact, it is a problem in the country as a whole. When we are talking about the \"carpetbagger\" problem, it refers to people who come here with the idea of being able to \"earn a living\" and then fail or even end up being unable to live in Australia. This is not an isolated problem. Many countries deal with them by restricting their access to the welfare support and other assistance they may need. In Australia, our system of welfare benefits to encourage people to move to Australia is broken. The Australian unemployment benefit is a good example of this. The fact is, when people look out for a job, and look to find a \"job\" they are looking to move around the country; the idea of a job is never the main focus, it is only a means to find a job. That means the Australian welfare system is simply not designed to target the people who are looking to move to Australia. Our system also tries to do a lot of good with its \"incentives for migrants\" but in reality people are not happy to be put to \"work\". I've been to one of the jobs Centrelink is looking to find for me and it's an absolutely horrible experience. It's just not an environment for me to do my job, I like helping people but if your job is a stressful job I am not willing to",

      "(written from a Production point of view Real World article\n\nBrock's family and friends find themselves in danger when the Cardassians attack and destroy their home on Cardassia.\n\nContents show]\n\nSummary Edit\n\nTeaser Edit\n\nCaptain Benjamin Sisko is on his way out of the conference room when his chief of staff, Commander Harry Kim, informs him that his former Chief Engineer, Commander Chakotay, has been killed by the Cardassian military. Sisko takes Kim's advice to go to a nearby hospital, though the senior officers quickly realize a more important problem is about to emerge.\n\nIn Quark's Bar on Deep Space 9, Odo is watching the news when a woman named Leeta enters. He invites her to join him after closing, but she declines out of annoyance, stating that she doesn't care to get involved in Cardassian politics. Odo says he wouldn't care either, but he does anyway, inviting her to join him for breakfast. Leeta grumbles at the idea, but Odo is intrigued when he asks her about the Federation and whether anyone in it is in love with her.\n\nLater that day, a Cardassian shuttle approaches Deep Space 9, carrying a group of Cardassians on high-level diplomatic duties. Sisko arrives, and Leeta follows shortly thereafter. While she is standing outside the window, the shuttle passes an asteroid field; the crew is forced to turn around. Sisko reports the incident to Quark, who is still in the process of fixing the elevators, and asks Odo to find out from Starfleet what the Cardassian ship was trying to accomplish. Odo is unsure of what he should say to the senior officer since everyone on the station knew what happened shortly after he went missing, but he quickly realizes that Starfleet will have no better information.\n\nSisko brings Leeta to his quarters, where the two are interrupted when Dax calls from Ops, informing the captain that, though the first wave of destruction has been repelled, the attack has brought down the station. With the station in ruins, Sisko and Leeta are forced to take shelter at Ops.\n\nAct One Edit\n\nThe USS Prometheus is also on its way out of DS9, but with no intention of letting its former crew members go. It heads toward the surface and is intercepted by the new Cardassian vessel, the Choriak. The Choriak is under the command of Commander Sisko's former chief engineer, Gul Dhonn Jhegor.\n\nIn Quark's Bar, Jhegor informs the bar patron Odo that Sisko had a run-in with the Choriak during Starfleet's last mission to Bajor, when Sisko's crew was nearly killed by the hostile Changeling ships that emerged from the caverns in the Bajoran system.\n\nJhegor has discovered that the Federation vessel was not a Bajoran ship, however, and is now hoping that Starfleet won't find out about Sisko's encounter with the Changeling, or worse at least, that Starfleet will be on his tail. Jhegor also states that Starfleet has discovered no survivors, which is not all that surprising considering the Choriak is still traveling through space and could easily destroy the Prometheus. Dax suggests the ship be returned immediately, lest Starfleet discover it was still on station the day before.\n\nJhegor is in no hurry to return the Prometheus. For the first time since he saw the Federation vessel on Bajor, he is proud of his ship, despite the loss of one of his crewmates; he intends to give it the full honors it deserves, something he thinks Starfleet can never know or understand. Jhegor also makes a comment about Sisko using a Dominion defector as part of his crew as they approach DS9. This is not true, though; Sisko has a second Jem'Hadar crewmember as his helmsman.\n\nJhegor then reveals a secret from his past; the Choriak's vessel was once a Federation starship named USS Reliant, which the Choriak is now attempting to restore to operation. Jhegor asks Odo why he didn't come forward sooner, but Odo insists that he did not come forward because he was afraid of revealing classified information. Jhegor retorts that Odo can do the work Jhegor did when he was under the influence of the Defiant. Jhegor then tells him to tell them why he needs to be rescued, though Odo says that Jhegor is in no condition to assist Starfleet; he only has time to be rescued before the Jem'Hadar board. Jhegor decides that it is time for him to leave.\n\nAct Two Edit\n\nOutside, Dax and Sisko have been working on fixing the elevators for the past hour. Dax is frustrated because Sisk",

Premier Christy Clark has declared a moratorium on resource development on Burnaby Mountain and in Metro Vancouver. The Mayor of Vancouver, Gregor Robertson, has promised to veto the project. And B.C. Greens leader Andrew Weaver, in a rare appearance on the national stage, declared that the project should be stopped until the federal government has more time to properly review it.\n\nYet the project, which will be one of the biggest infrastructure projects in history, is not yet stopped. The big opposition is just beginning.\n\nThis week, some members of Canada's green movement, including Weaver, issued an open letter on the climate impacts of the pipeline before it was even approved, warning that an expansion would dramatically contribute to climate change. The letter was signed by a range of organizations ranging from Greenpeace, ForestEthics Advocacy Society (FEAS), the Climate Action Network (CAN), and others.\n\nThe letter was released as the British Columbia legislature debated the issue of climate change policy. Here's an excerpt from the letter:\n\n[W]e all know that climate change is real and it is man made. It is happening right now. Most scientists agree that if we continue business as usual, the average temperature of our planet will almost surely be a few degrees Celsius higher by the end of the century than it would otherwise have been.\n\nWe are deeply concerned that expansion of the project and its associated tankers, which are expected to carry up to 760,000 barrels of oil daily, will significantly and irreversibly increase the oil production and global warming emissions that would otherwise be the result.\n\nWe need to be taking seriously the role that our transportation infrastructure plays in contributing to climate change, and the fact that climate change is the first and foremost environmental issue facing us here in Canada. As noted in Chapter 7, \"Oil and our Politics\" of the BC Report on the Climate and Energy Sector – we know that Kinder Morgan's expansion will have a major impact on GHG emissions by increasing oil production in Alberta or in the U.S. Gulf Coast region, thereby adding to climate change emissions over the long run. If we fail to act now, by the end of this year we could be contributing up to a trillion dollars and a million British Columbians to climate change emissions.\n\nWhile some organizations have recently recognized the risk climate change poses to our communities, infrastructure, and economy, this is the largest project in Canada's history, so the risks of climate failure have received less attention. We need to act now to keep our communities secure and protect our economy from the risks associated with our rapidly changing environment, whether climate change causes them or not. We need to act now to mitigate the impacts of the pipeline on our climate and on our economy before it's too late.\n\nAs Weaver rightly notes, the B.C. government is already taking steps to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions by a significant amount. On Tuesday, the province announced it would require new fossil fuel power plants by 2030 to meet more stringent renewable energy target than was in place under BC's 2009 carbon tax, which requires a 10 per cent renewable energy target.\n\nThe federal government's review of the project will almost certainly lead to an agreement that will require BC to either reduce emissions per unit of energy generated or receive compensation from its international partners. The Trans Mountain expansion will likely be one of those. It is unclear if the government will require this agreement before the federal government approves the project.\n\nWe need a coalition that puts the interests of Canada's most oil-dependent province, where a fifth of our GDP is provided by the petroleum industry, at the forefront. This is also a coalition of Indigenous communities, who are disproportionately affected by the pipeline, and all of us who depend on safe and clean transportation to get to our homes, stores, jobs, and school and work.\n\nIt's true that the B.C. Greens are unlikely to block the pipeline outright, given that they are currently opposed to Enbridge's Northern Gateway, and that they are in favour of the development of the province's shale gas industry. But Weaver suggests he'll try to \"persuade\" the B.C. government to oppose the pipeline. We need a strategy to convince British Columbians to support the construction of the pipeline. We need something like a referendum. The B.C. Greens need to stop playing on identity politics until there is a proper debate, and support Trans Mountain, the only responsible way to move forward with the expansion of Alberta's oil industry.\n\nFollow Adele on Twitter.",

This means that an initial error, which resulted in a Star Trek item in one of the content filters failing to load, has since been corrected by Sony.\n\nOriginal Story\n\nStar Trek: Bridge Crew recently found itself in the crosshairs of the PlayStation store for what is seen by many as pornographic content.\n\nThe game was found to receive an adult-themed filter that was not properly applied to adult-themed content, but the PlayStation store is still reporting that the filter is active and that the game still supports it.\n\nWhen attempting to play the game, many users found their filters on – with the option to switch them off. While some were able to circumvent the filter entirely, others reported they could not because a content filter was incorrectly applied to Star Trek content.\n\nUsers were quick to point out that the filter's name is \"AdultStarShip\" and that its use should not be accepted as normative.\n\nThe video below gives further indication as to why the Star Trek filter should not be accepted, and it also contains the offending item in question and a discussion on how to bypass the filter.\n\nThe video ends with a comment from \"Gentlemen, come on folks, this is wrong\"\n\nMany have since moved to complain about the issue on the Steam forums and to request that their purchases be refunded.\n\nA representative for Sony responded to concerns at about the adult filter (and is not affiliated with PSVR at all), saying it wasn't being applied correctly.\n\n\"We continue to investigate the matter and have a game update to deploy to correct an error seen for some.

      "A study of over 2,000 German soldiers who served in the United States during World War II revealed a correlation between veterans' PTSD diagnoses and exposure to the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiment. After the U.S. government contracted 300 black men for the study, and administered syphilis to thousands, the results were publicized as a \"parallel experiment\" in which black men suffered the same health risks as their Caucasian counterparts while the government collected blood samples and urine.\n\nBut some of the 300 were subjected to the experiment for much longer than the study's researchers had intended, and some of the men tested still have physical deformities from the untreated and untreated strains of the disease, researchers say. Researchers believe those deformities could have been a symptom of the untreated infections.\n\n\"Because of the high incidence of deformities, we believe that all of the people involved in this experiment were affected by their illness,\" lead researcher Dr. Joseph Tash said in a statement. \"Even in the case of those who were tested after the experiment, no evidence of syphilis infections was found.\"\n\nTuskegee began in 1932, but the U.S. government didn't begin to administer vaccines for the disease until 1950. The researchers noted that \"the treatment of syphilis was abandoned before the vaccine had reached epidemic levels,\" according to a University of Michigan News release.\n\nThe study found that only 21.5 percent of those affected by the disease in 1944 had had their disease diagnosed. The study does not say whether those without diagnoses had physical deformities after their diagnosis.\n\nDr. Kenneth B. Fisher, who has conducted clinical trials on a number of experimental drugs in mice, has also worked on the Tuskegee study, according to the News. Fisher told the News the U.S. government did a poor job of investigating the Tuskegee experiment.\n\n\"The U.S. government conducted research projects that resulted in the deaths of innocent, unknowing and unwanted human beings,\" he said in a statement. \"All kinds of studies were done with people without their knowledge in the name of science.\"\n\n\"I think the results are interesting because they clearly show that the research was based on unethical conduct, and that there is no reason to believe the results would be any different today,\" Fisher told the Associated Press.\n\nThe Tuskegee Study was published in this week's issue of the Journal of Psychiatric Research.",

      "HARVEY MARTIN - A former teacher from Texas is in the headlines for all the wrong reasons after she was fired from school for having sex with an underage student in her class. The 25-year-old woman was one of five teachers that was fired after it was discovered that she was having sex with the underage pupil on at least two days. But the teacher had a secret that the school district had little interest in finding out: She is the mother of a 10-month-old child.\n\nThe former teacher's name is Katherine McKeon. The woman had two 10-month-old children, when she started having an affair with a 15-year-old boy in her third-grade class in South Padre Island. The child is the biological son of her lover and the biological daughter of a pastor. The teacher later admitted her affair to investigators and was fired after one of her students filed a sex abuse report with the school.\n\nThe incident allegedly took place in February of 2013. The teacher has been suspended since May 2013, but the charges against her were not sealed and she was placed on paid administrative leave until she is acquitted on the charges.\n\nHowever, not only did the school district discover it before the mother had the chance to explain herself for the incident, it also discovered that the mother had a child fathered by another man. However, the man in question has already been identified and is now in custody.\n\n\"We were very surprised at the information that was found during the investigation, but there is no evidence that suggests that the sex occurred between the two students,\" said Superintendent, Mike Lydon (via the Houston Chronicle).\n\nThe woman's boyfriend has not come forward and claimed that he was forced to pay child support if he ever wanted to see his daughter again. And when the child was removed from the mother's care, the school district had to pay the mother half of her salary, as well as paying for her and her boyfriends legal expenses (if any), and she was not allowed to have any contact with the child until all legal matters are done.\n\nThe father of the child has not revealed his identity, but is quoted as saying that he supports the sex with his ex-wife in a letter to the Chronicle.\n\n\"The school district is doing the best with the situation they have put me in. I've talked to them and I'm OK with whatever happens to my daughter,\" said the father.\n\nThe Chronicle also points out that the couple is only on half of their divorce settlement, since this case is the second time an adult has had sex with the same school teacher and had their unborn child taken away from them.",
      "\"Fifty-five years ago today, the first female lawyer ever admitted to practice in any US state was sworn in in Virginia by a President of the United States. That same day, the US Congress was dissolved, and the president of the United States issued his first Executive Order requiring that all businesses be run by men,\" author and history professor Robert J. Dallek writes in his new book, The Power Broker: JFK, Richard Nixon, and the Rise of a President.\n\nDallek examines President Kennedy's life and legacy in the opening passage of his book, which was released Wednesday. JFK's historic first steps into the White House \"had an immediate impact on women in the administration,\" while the most memorable inaugural address may very well have been JFK's. In his book, Dallek writes, \"[JFK] challenged not only her own status, but the status of women in America.\"\n\n\"The first thing he did when he got there … was to bring in five women to testify before a Senate subcommittee in February, 1963,\" Dallek says about JFK's first 100 days in office. \"I've never seen anything like that in modern times. Women testified in droves about the abuses in the administration.\"\n\nFor the first time in US history, three major newspapers, including the New York Times, endorsed his policies, which included ending the draft in the US military and giving rights to women and African Americans. JFK's presidency marked the beginning of a new era for women's rights.\n\nThe first lady, Jacqueline Kennedy, continued to speak at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, while her mother's daughter Caroline Kennedy campaigned for JFK as an intern.\n\nJFK would remain one of America's most popular presidents for the rest of his life and is often credited with instigating women's suffrage. He signed and passed the Equal Pay Act of 1963, allowing women to sue for equal pay for equal work. The President also signed the landmark 1963 Civil Rights Act. In an interview with PBS in 1993, George Washington Carver, a Kennedy appointee on the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, recalls his personal connection to Kennedy, citing \"the president's compassion\" for African American voters. \"He was an advocate of civil rights for African Americans who worked hard and came out overwhelmingly for him,\" Carver said, according to the PBS NewsHour documentary, \"In Search of Jacqueline Kennedy: Our Last Living President.\"\n\nThe book is a must for anyone who celebrates JFK's legacy. Here are eight reasons why:\n\n1. Women, Civil Rights & Women's Empowerment:\n\n\"When a man goes to war, he's not thinking about the wives or the mothers or children he left behind, or even the ones who can hardly speak,\" says Dallek. \"When he goes into battle, he's just trying to protect the women along his path.\"\n\n2. Kennedy's 'First Lady':\n\nThough he only met her for a few years, Jacqueline Kennedy on some level was his idea of what a president should be. The Kennedy family had two homes—the White House and their home in Bethesda, Maryland. Jacqueline made sure that the women of the White House got a fair share of the privileges and work responsibilities under the presidency.\n\n\"She was a great advocate of the White House staff, particularly those women who got to sit in the Oval Office with the president,\" says Dallek. \"In fact, she would go out of her way to see that their efforts were noticed.\"\n\n3. The Kennedy Center is a Place for Women:\n\nThe Kennedy Center is a monument to the life of this historic President, which is now on view in the National Archives and Records Administration. It has the largest space dedicated to women's representation at the White House and other federal agencies. \"A lot of the women who served there did it out of conviction,\" says Dallek. \"But Jacqueline Kennedy was very much looking for the good of the institution. She saw the way in which women were underrepresented in Washington—it was hurting their credibility in the eyes of their colleagues at State and elsewhere.\"\n\n4. Kennedy-Lugar:\n\n\"There isn't one day in the life of a woman with Kennedy, it's all of them all the time; they're women,\" Dallek tells The Daily Beast. \"The First Lady was just as much a woman, if not more so, than the President,\" says Jackie Kennedy's grandson, President John F. Kennedy, Jr. \"There's a reason [JFK] put her, like, first,\" Kennedy's grandson told The New York Times. \"It's not necessarily because it was her time to shine.\"\n\n5. Women's Equality & the Supreme Court:\n\nWhen JFK's Supreme Court nominee Robert Bork was nominated, Dallek writes in The Power Broker, \"many conservatives considered Bork too left-wing for the court.\" When Kennedy nominated",

      "In the wake of the tragic events in Orlando, Florida, we have been asked more than ever: \"What has the media been doing about Islam?\" It is a very serious question, one that has been asked by many of our colleagues, particularly in the United Kingdom (UK), where the mainstream media has, unfortunately, been less than critical or even dismissive of the faith of the victims of a hate-related mass shooting. And it is understandable that questions like this would be raised. As a media institution, the BBC has a special responsibility to report the news without fear or favor. It is imperative that we do just that.\n\nBut, in addition to this responsibility, it is also our obligation to reflect accurately on the faith of our readers, viewers and listeners and to use our public platforms to dispel misconceptions, not perpetuate them.\n\nThat's why, as one of the BBC's main news bulletins this weekend, we did what any decent journalist would in such a situation: we interviewed the leader of ISIS, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi; and the imam of al-Azhar, the foremost Sunni Islamic institution in Egypt; and both spoke to the media of what the Islamic world was hearing about Orlando this weekend.\n\nWe did so in a manner that was fair, informed, unerring and appropriate from a journalistic standpoint. And we did so in a way that put ISIS and Islamists on the same footing with the mainstream Muslim community in which their views are accepted – sometimes with outright hostility – by many in and around the Middle East.\n\nIndeed, it was only after the BBC's first report on the story was leaked on Tuesday that the mainstream media had picked up the story, and the BBC had no choice but to follow suit.\n\nThe BBC was absolutely correct to do what it did. As one commentator wrote on Twitter, \"You can't be an Islamist extremist in a Western city and not do it on TV.\"\n\nThe BBC's coverage of the attacks – which was, it seems appropriate to note, far more responsible than mainstream media's coverage of the Charlie Hebdo and kosher supermarket attacks – was fair and accurate. It was also fair and accurate in its use of context and expertise on both sides of the issue. Indeed, there are certain issues that the media cannot do justice to, but the BBC has done its homework and its job right.\n\nIn the words of BBC's director general George Entwistle: \"We know from our viewers that they want to know what, if anything, is going on.\"\n\nThe BBC's coverage on the day was not only fair and accurate: it was timely and relevant to the issue of international terrorism. As I stated in an editorial following the terror attacks in Paris last Friday, while we should not take the incidents in Paris on the same footing as the attacks in Orlando, there is no shortage of legitimate grievances to address in the fight against extremism. This is not one of them.\n\nInstead the Islamic world's major Sunni institutions – which has long been a target of Islamist terrorism in Egypt, and elsewhere in the Arab world – and especially the moderate Muslim community they represent are rightly receiving disproportionate condemnation from the West.\n\nThe BBC has been rightly criticized and attacked for airing interview transcripts of ISIS leader al-Baghdadi with an English-language reporter – and one with no previous background in or training in the Arabic language.\n\nBut that wasn't our editorial decision. The BBC is a member of the World Service, which broadcasts in 30 languages, which means that BBC World Services staff in London can translate for its journalists in the Middle East.\n\nSo does that mean that their correspondents in the region know Arabic, don a niqab or hijab, and are regularly interviewed by native Arabic speakers at the behest of the BBC? Absolutely not.\n\nBut that doesn't mean their translations are wrong. In fact, the BBC is well-aware of the fact that it may be doing things that aren't consistent with the language used by Al Jazeera when it reports stories on the Middle East.\n\nIndeed, on Monday, one of the BBC's Arabic-language journalists told me: \"At some of the moments you can identify the point of view of the Al Jazeera producer, but generally not as well as the World Service.\" At one point, an interview between al-Baghdadi and an Al Jazeera producer ended abruptly when an Al Jazeera producer interrupted.\n\nThis is where the BBC's expertise is very much in evidence – the fact that its Arabic staff don't really know what they are saying when they go on air on Al Jazeera. One of those Arabic staff, for instance, did a live report from a Cairo hotel on Friday in which he talked to a woman dressed head to toe in black.\n\nAl Jazeera's English production team would have immediately thought, \"This one might have a problem; she's dressed differently to other people here.\"\n\nWhen al-Baghdadi made a similar mistake on the same day, he was soon",
      "When news broke in December that a video showed Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton admitting that her presidential campaign \"hasn't been good at selling\" her, it was widely presumed at the time that this admission was indicative of the campaign's overall inability to motivate voters.\n\nHowever, the video itself has been called much worse than that. So what really happened? In an exclusive interview with The Daily Caller, a former high-ranking staffer for former Vice President Joe Biden revealed the real reason behind Clinton's decision to admit defeat and quit the presidential race: The campaign was plagued by internal corruption and a complete refusal to let their grassroots volunteers organize.\n\nAccording to Matt Bennett, who served as senior adviser to Biden's presidential campaign and is now the vice president of policy for the Alliance for St. Baldrick's, what many are now calling Clinton's \"victory lap\" wasn't a successful strategy.\n\n\"People should look at what [Clinton] actually said. Hillary did not say, 'We're going to start winning again. I'm going to start organizing again and get back to the grassroots.'\"\n\nBennett said the reason Clinton's leadership and \"organizing\" campaign failed was precisely because of the lack of campaign structure.\n\n\"No single person, no individual, no political committee, no local or state organization, no federal organization, no super PAC, nothing had that big of an impact on this thing.\"\n\nThe reason for the failure of the campaign's organization was the fact that none of these \"organizing units\" actually existed. What does Bennett think would have happened had there actually been an effective organization to help her campaign?\n\n\"We all know, we all agree that she would have won. The only question is if she would have won,\" he explained. \"And again, that is where the real problem was.\"\n\nBennett said there was an \"insatiable level of self-doubt\" that plagued Clinton from the beginning of the presidential campaign while she herself was still running for Senate against Beau Biden.\n\n\"She had a certain arrogance – that she was the only one who stood a chance,\" Bennett said. \"It was, 'I am so much better than you.' I think if she had had the right people around her… she would have been far more successful.\"\n\nBennett also said that at the beginning of the campaign she was so confident that she \"looked in the mirror\" and saw \"self-doubt.\"\n\n\"I believe her story. I think she was looking in the mirror at that time,\" Bennett told TheDC. \"But she always had the confidence that she was going to win. She had the confidence that she was so much smarter than everybody else.\"\n\nDuring the 2016 presidential campaign, the Clinton campaign received criticism when Clinton suggested that half of Donald Trump's supporters were in \"blossoming adolescence.\" However, Bennett said such remarks about young voters is \"a complete fabrication,\" noting that Biden's own campaign staff, for example, were much older than Clinton's.\n\nWhile Bennett is skeptical that Clinton will ever regain the White House by being more likable, he did tell TheDC that she is \"better than she's ever been professionally\" for now. But, he said, \"she is not the right candidate and there will be no miracle that we've seen yet in the American psyche about the need for a president who will actually be able to govern.\"",

      "The latest round of protests in Turkey against President Erdogan's heavy-handed foreign policy and his authoritarian rule has led to the arrests of at least 3,000 police, the closure of dozens of media outlets, and a total blackout of Turkish TV, radio and print media since Sunday.\n\nThe protests are the largest direct challenge to Erdogan's rule to date. Many activists say they're demanding an overhaul of the country's system of government and the establishment of a more effective opposition.\n\nIn an effort to defuse the situation, the government has sought to present the demonstrators as agents of a foreign enemy. On Tuesday, Foreign Minister Ahmet Davutoglu said such actions as protests against Erdogan show \"they are paid by foreign powers.\"\n\nThe latest round of protests began after police violently dispersed peaceful protesters. In an act of violence and violence, Erdogan's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, said three police were killed.\n\nAs protests escalated, Turkey's stock market crashed, the country's lira currency jumped to a record high against the dollar, and its stock indices dipped to their lowest level in 20 years.\n\nThe country's prime minister, Ahmet Davutoglu, blamed the Turkish protests on \"terrorists\" and \"terrorist organizations.\"\n\nMore protests are expected this week.\n\nHere's how things unfolded to get this information.\n\nSunday, Aug. 28\n\nA few hundred people rallied at Taksim Square in Istanbul, the nation's biggest square, for the first direct anti-Erdogan rallies to go off since March.\n\nPolice responded with tear gas and water cannons, which some demonstrators threw back toward the police lines. It soon became clear that they would not disperse peacefully, forcing officers to use excessive force.\n\nDemonstrators responded by hurling bottles and rocks at police, and protesters smashed the windows at nearby shops before breaking through the lines. There were clashes for hours between police and the demonstrators.\n\nAbout 1,500 police officers, including special riot police made up of armored vehicles, were dispatched as reinforcements to Taksim Square.\n\nAt least 3,000 police have been arrested as the protests spread across the country.\n\nMonday, Aug. 29\n\nThe Turkish Parliament approved a series of tough measures against Turkey's opposition protesters, including a law criminalizing \"insulting\" words to the president.\n\nThe law criminalises insults against foreign leaders, but Erdogan claimed at a press conference Tuesday that the opposition was responsible for the passage of it, and he vowed there would be \"chaos\" if their supporters did not \"stop that action\" once again.\n\nTuesday, Aug. 30\n\nOpposition protests spread to Ankara, Istanbul and several other cities, with police using tear gas, water cannons, clubs, and tear gas again deployed at Istanbul's main Taksim Square.\n\nProtesters smashed the windows of several stores, including the Zorlu Cinema and the Aski shopping mall. At the Zorlu Cinema, which was partially destroyed, some protesters hurled insults at actor Mevlut Mert Altintas and actress Ildikó Atalay.\n\nAn estimated 50,000 people gathered in Istanbul's main Taksim Square. In the capital Ankara, protesters broke up shops selling alcohol and smashed some windows.\n\nOn Twitter, a group called \"Demokrasi\", which translates to \"without party\", called for the establishment of a democratic opposition.\n\nMeanwhile, Erdogan's AKP party took advantage of the protests to blame the opposition of \"terrorism against Turkey\" and \"foreign agents.\"\n\nIn a heated speech Tuesday morning, Erdogan accused the protesters of \"hurting our people and the country\" by calling for the resignation of his government.\n\nThe ruling party also seized on the possibility that \"terrorists\" were behind the uprising, vowing a \"total response.\"\n\nMore demonstrations are planned from late Wednesday on Wednesday, the anniversary of the failed coup against Erdoğan's government.\n\nWednesday, Aug. 31\n\nProtesters once again clashed in Istanbul.\n\nPolice responded with water cannons and tear gas again deployed in order to disperse the protesters, but this did not stop them.\n\nAround 2,000 protesters were detained Tuesday night, according to Turkish media reports. It remains unclear how many were released and how many remain in detention.

      "On the night his family had come under attack, a woman in Kupwara had called 911. \"I'm at my neighbour's house, she's on the floor bleeding from the stomach and the man is outside,\" she told the operator. \"There is a man here and he's attacking her with a knife.\"\n\nBut by the evening, when Kupwara and her family were sleeping, the couple had gone to the police station to file an FIR. They had been forced to call a third time in the days since, as the man continued to stalk and harass them.\n\nThey had no idea at the time that they had been the next target. While other women in the village in central Uttar Pradesh, in what is India's most populous state, were receiving police protection, Kupwara and her family were left with nothing but their phone.\n\nThree months later, her family, like the thousands of other rape victims in India in 2014, have no redressal mechanism.\n\n\"You cannot file a complaint and there is not an organisation where you can go,\" said Kupwara. \"The police have said they are not equipped to handle this kind of complaint and you cannot file a complaint at home, the police station must take it.\"\n\nHer husband, Ajit, said that police officers asked him, \"are you doing something about it?\"\n\n\"If you have not done something, why are you calling me?\" they later told him. \"I don't know, why are you calling me? Are you really saying that you are doing something? I have not killed anyone; what do you mean,\" said Ajit. \"So you don't even know if a policeman is alive or dead,\" they added.\n\nFor years, successive Indian governments have denied women the basic rights of a sexual assault. The government has, for example, failed to fund medical facilities to treat victims with rape or ensure that survivors receive redress from local authorities.\n\nMore than 400,000 rape cases were reported in 2014, and most of those went unreported at times and places where women are least likely to report such a crime to police. In Kupwara, that lack of accountability is particularly obvious.\n\n\"The police will do nothing for you,\" Kupwara said. \"You cannot report such a crime without any help at all, and the police have said they will not ask for directions to take you there.\"\n\nKupwara's story is a case in point. Her uncle had been raped several times in the past. After this latest attack, on New Year's Eve last year, he decided he had had enough, so he called his sister.\n\nBut her uncle, Raja Singh, did not stay dead. In December, he contacted the police after a local man threatened to rape his daughter for \"not having enough daughters\". It was then that the police intervened and her uncle finally told them about his niece.\n\nThat night's call to the police made Ajit and Kupwara realise that they were not alone, according to Shanti Bhushan, a lawyer with the Delhi-based Association for Democratic Reforms, one of several organisations and NGOs working to raise awareness about sexual violence.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Shanti Bhushan, who is providing redress for Kupwara's case. Photograph: Arun Sharma/AP\n\nAfter the Kupwara's family made the call, the police took their statement. But according to Bhushan, when the police later called Ajit to tell him they had recorded his statements, they told him that \"if they did not register the FIR they would be in trouble with [the police superintendent]\".\n\nPolice have yet to investigate the case, or even the reports of attacks across India in December 2013, which the association has demanded be investigated. The report also highlights the systemic failure to tackle violence against women.\n\nAccording to the United Nations, about 60% of reported rape cases in India are not even reported and only 5% of women in India, where more than one in three women is raped, go to the police.\n\nAccording to the UN, the proportion of women who go to the police within 24 hours of sexual assault increases from 40-50% to between 85-95% when the victim has been in an intimate relationship with their attacker, which is believed to be a common problem in India.\n\nThe government is aware that the lack of adequate law enforcement is causing alarm and has commissioned a series of national commissions and a large range of groups to address the issue.\n\nThe UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, described this as a \"watershed moment\" for the fight against sexual violence last year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The UN secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, speaks in Kolkata in January.

      "\"The government says it wants to move forward for the children... but the reality is this system is designed largely to cover up rape and murder,\" said Sarah Binder, who has been following the case and who has spoken out in the past about issues at juvenile correctional facilities. \"Children in detention have no rights. They don't have legal counsel. They're denied medical care.\"",
      "\nWhen it was all said and done, the U.S. Senate voted to approve $10 billion in new aid for Egypt after an Egyptian revolution. Now, Congress is gearing up to debate what to do about it: how much could go to Israel, Egypt, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the Palestinian Authority, and how long would Congress continue to keep the money flowing.\n\nWith many lawmakers already calling for an end to the aid, U.S. legislators are scrambling to come up with some kind of compromise, or else risk the aid being cut completely. What's really at play in Washington is not whether Egypt will be a reliable partner, but whether the U.S. will feel confident in its commitment to aid to Arab countries.\n\n\"Egypt remains important, [but] there is no question that it has to be a good deal,\" says Michael Oren, who served as Israel's ambassador to the U.S. for five years. \"We need to make sure that the Egyptian revolution ends up helping us in the end.\"\n\nBut, Oren points out, \"it's not enough for an Arab country to have the U.S. on its side — it needs to understand that we're on its side.\"\n\n\"The Egyptians are aware of America's interest in Egypt,\" a senior U.S. State Department official says, noting \"they did not expect what happened [on October 23].\"\n\n\"They did not expect their revolution to be hijacked through the internet [and] used as a recruiting tool for terrorist actors,\" the official says, describing how the Egyptian revolution is being used by regional terrorists to gain wider support. \"Now many of those same terrorists are calling us\" to demand that we cut aid.\n\nThe U.S. may keep most of the aid, but that's about where the funding ultimately leaves it. The U.S. sends a \"proportional share\" to the Egyptian government. In other words, we give the Egyptian government about the same amount that we send a country in Iraq, Afghanistan, or Pakistan — even a country that has done bad things.\n\nThis is all to say that to continue to make aid promises to Egyptian President Morsi, Egypt needs to commit to being a reliable partner. If it does not, and the U.S. decides to cut the aid by two-thirds or more, then the U.S. would be cutting off every aid commitment as a matter of policy.\n\nEgypt might be a small country, but it's important. Even if we're not the most stable country in the Middle East, Egypt helps keep the region together. It's not just because of its location on the Mediterranean. A successful and stable Egypt might help the Palestinians, who also have a lot in common with us.\n\nThe U.S. is the most important nation in the region, but we need Egypt to be successful. Otherwise, there would be very, very serious consequences with potential implications for our interests.\n\nU.S. taxpayers want to believe that we do what's best for the people living in the Middle East. In fact, that's why we do our business there. That is why America spends more on foreign aid to other nations than any other nation in the world.\n\nThe U.S. cannot and should not try to run Egypt on our standards. Egypt should be responsible for its own security, and it should be capable of standing on its own two feet if and when it has to rebuild after an event like the Arab Spring.\n\nIt would be in America's best interest to put Egyptian security before U.S. interests.\n\nBut what do we really get out of it? Is the investment in Egypt worth it? Here's why the U.S. shouldn't.\n\nFirst, if the U.S. isn't going to make those promises to the Egyptians, what's left to guarantee our interests there? No one expects the United States to guarantee that there will be peace in the world. After all, President Obama has said he won't have any boots on the ground in Iraq until the Iraqis themselves decide to take them. But the U.S. can't just keep pouring arms and troops across the world. We've proven time and again that we won't follow through on our promises. It's better if we keep our commitments and then, if we do have to use force, follow through with the policies and principles that we said we would.\n\nFurthermore, if we put our trust in Egypt through aid, it would be very easy for us to be taken advantage of by any nation on the globe. Egypt is just one country. The U.S. can't count on just giving an aid package to just one country. It can't rely on the Egyptian revolution to solve all of its problems. It should also know that any government in the region is capable of using money to its advantage, whether the money comes from Egypt or from other allies. We need to be",
      "It took some time, but we finally got the update to Windows 10 Mobile devices as of last week. The changes on Windows 10 Mobile are relatively minor and don't require you to be overly concerned about privacy. We're still waiting on news about new features as per the new Windows 10 Mobile operating system. Today we're going to take a look at how to restore your device from backup as well as the update itself.\n\nRestoring Your Windows 10 Mobile from Backup\n\nMicrosoft has been pretty mum about the process of restoring your iPhone, Samsung Galaxy S or Nexus to Windows 10 Mobile, so far. You could use Microsoft's Mobile Device Recovery Tool, or perhaps you could resort to a third-party tool such as Mobile Backup Backup or ClockworkMod. Either way, to restore your phone from backup you have two options, restore from the backup you already have or buy a fresh one. Below we'll try and explain how to restore and why you should bother.\n\nThere are a few advantages to buying a fresh Windows 10 Mobile device from China. Microsoft has a great warranty service that includes phone replacements. That is one of the main benefits when buying a device from China, which is much cheaper than other Asian markets.\n\nWhat if you buy a new phone and later find out that it's running on Windows 10 Mobile? Well, you would still be able to use the device in its original form. To do this you would need to transfer the operating system and any applications that are installed on the Lumia device to the new device. There are a couple of ways to transfer the operating system.\n\nYou can use either the built-in Windows 10 Recovery Tool or a third-party tool. The tools below will show how to transfer your data from the original Lumia model to a new device running Windows 10 Mobile.\n\nWindows 10 Mobile Backup Tools\n\nLumia Backup Backup is another great tool to help you manage your device, restore it from backup at any time, and transfer applications and data. It works in the background with full automatic protection when your device powers on or off. With it you can easily backup images, videos, and music for offline storage and restore directly on your new device.\n\nYou can create a Lumia backup directly on your new device with the help of this tool or purchase an app to export images. If you need a quick way to backup the important stuff on your device including all the data and settings, it's worth picking up a free trial.\n\nWindows 10 Mobile Backup by Wuala is an extension of Windows 10 Mobile Backup by Wuala. This handy tool makes it super easy to back up your Windows 10 Mobile, but also your photos and videos. This is great for those who want to back up their data from one phone to another and also to share them with family and friends. It's also perfect for those who want to keep up with new updates to Windows 10 Mobile without having to do it manually. It can also backup a file at an arbitrary location with the help of a GPS location.\n\nThere are some limitations on the way you can save files with this tool. The free version allows you to save two files at a time, which is the only limitation with these tools.\n\nIf you're after a more powerful and versatile backup tool, you could consider this app: Windows 10 Mobile Backup by Wuala and Windows 10 Backup\n\nLumia Backup Plus\n\nLumia Backup Plus is probably the most useful backup tool for anyone seeking to transfer their data on Windows 10 Mobile from one computer to another. This handy app is capable of working with multiple Windows 10 mobile devices and syncs all settings and images. It also supports automatic backups to cloud storage services such as Dropbox and Google Drive. Windows Mobile Backup by Wuala can also sync with this app, though that requires the developer to update the app on a certain schedule.\n\nLumia Backup Plus has the following limitations:\n\nOnly allows you to back up to OneDrive.\n\nCurrently does not have cloud upload capabilities. Please take note of your network connection settings when using this app.\n\nNo image upload capability.\n\nLumia Backup Express\n\nThe Lumia Backup Express is another backup tool that has a few similar features to the other two. But it lacks the ability for uploading images, does not offer cloud sync, and instead supports uploading files with a simple image upload interface. Microsoft has also given this app a great name but it's not free to download. There is a Windows 10 Mobile version available for Lumia devices but it's only available for a limited set of users, so we recommend you not waste your time. You can read the reviews of this app at Windows Phone Central.\n\nWindows 10 Cloud Backup Tools\n\nThe cloud backup services are becoming much more complicated as time passes, and no one seems to have a clear guide that gives you easy instructions on how to back up your valuable content, including photos and videos.\n\nHere's a handy list of the best cloud backup services.

      "\"There was a real sense of excitement going into that one,\" she said.\n\nThe first of five debates between Democratic and Republican presidential candidates is a high-stakes contest that will be watched closely by a very conservative audience.\n\n\"They're going to watch carefully to see, 'Is this the most dangerous candidate or will this be somebody who actually gets things done if they're elected?' \" Ms. Wasserman Schultz said. \"You can see they're looking for a little more substance.\"\n\nBut the debate-watching public in a swing state is a much different group than in the days preceding 2008 — a group drawn by the idea of a battle between an unconventional candidate and a traditional front-runner.\n\n\"What I'm seeing at this point, I think, is a lot of uncertainty, a lot of fear and concern, even excitement,\" Ms. Wasserman Schultz said, adding: \"The more I think about it, the more I really do think this is the moment to start a process.\"\n\nMrs. Clinton, the likely Democratic nominee, is not expected to debate until early October, and the Democratic candidates are scrambling to book their own town halls on the days leading up to that showdown.",

      "By the time the last of the world's elephants are wiped out, the species may be gone entirely.\n\nThis week's issue of the journal Science reports that scientists have found evidence that the world's remaining elephants will not live into their next century, and that conservation efforts are inadequate to help them on their way out.\n\n\"As the number of animals threatened to be lost to poaching increases, and extinction has become the accepted norm in many parts of the world, the question of how we can save these animals and manage them in the future is more pressing than ever,\" says co-author Dr. Robert Watson, an academic in the Centre for Conservation Biology at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. \"We have not sufficiently come to grips with this existential threat.\"\n\nUntil now, most experts had assumed that elephants would be able to weather one more extinction. Now, for the first time, scientists are saying that this is not a realistic possibility.\n\n\"The extinction rates have just kept climbing,\" says Dr. Ian Stirling, senior research and policy officer of the Elephant Listening Project. \"It makes you wonder whether we can actually stop the elephant from disappearing or when it will arrive. These elephants are like the Titanic, and every day they are more and more at risk.\"\n\nThe cause of the elephant crisis is a mix of habitat destruction, human encroachment, and poaching. Conservationists estimate that a minimum of 30,000 elephants could be lost to poaching each year.\n\nResearchers estimated that 90% of the remaining elephants are concentrated in 10 nations in Africa. The largest elephants include the African savanna elephants (Loxodonta africana) in North West, West, Central and Central Africa. These include the savanna elephants that roamed the savanna forests of Central Africa for millions of years between 5 Million and 35 Million years ago. These elephants were the dominant mammals after mammoths and were largely wiped out by humans.\n\n\"It's an extinction crisis that's happening simultaneously everywhere,\" says Dr. Martin Naidoo, senior lecturer in conservation at the University of Edinburgh. \"Elephant populations have been reduced by 80% or more in the last 30 years in many countries.\"\n\nIn South Africa today, nearly a quarter of the country's 1,000 elephants are threatened with extinction. The largest elephant range in Africa is also in South Africa: the Karoo, a region of rugged hills, deep gorges and shallow ponds in the East African country. This area is home primarily to the endangered White-rumped elephant (Loxodonta cyclotis).\n\nOne of the most compelling things about elephants is that they remain a major part of the animal world today. They can live in harsh environments that many mammal species prefer to avoid. They make excellent bushmen, foraging up to eight kilometers a day in search of food. They eat up to 3,600 kilograms of fruit and vegetation each day.\n\nIn addition, they're great explorers, foraging into dense forest or savannah for food and shelter.\n\n\"Elephants are one of the last of the great species that are not threatened today, even though we are losing them,\" says Watson. \"They are not only fascinating but have extraordinary senses.\"\n\nElephant populations are falling mainly because the population size of mature males is increasing. In many areas, a herd will consist of 50 mature males, but today as few as 15 mature males are found there. This is due to poaching for ivory, which is used in traditional medicinal and ornamental uses in Asia. A recent survey in East Africa revealed a 40% increase in elephant numbers across the continent in the last 10 years.\n\nThis is because ivory poaching has increased dramatically in the last 10 years and elephants have not been able to adapt. Elephants are nocturnal, stay awake for days if they find no meal, and sleep as little as 1-2 hours per day to conserve energy. The older, healthier elephants can also survive long periods of poaching without succumbing to starvation.\n\nYet elephants are not the only elephants facing extinction. Their relative abundance will also suffer from the decline in prey.\n\n\"Elephants tend to graze more on grass and shrubs than on plants that prefer them,\" says Stirling. If grass and shrubs go, so will elephant populations.\n\nElephants will also be threatened because they're becoming less intelligent each day. The loss of habitat, poaching and habitat-destroying fires is taking a huge toll on cognitive ability in elephants. Researchers are beginning to see the effects in captivity.\n\nDespite the threats they face, elephants enjoy significant international commercial value. From the Chinese to the Mexican restaurant, there are many restaurants specializing in food consisting of elephant flesh. Some restaurants even sell elephant-skin rugs.\n\n\"The problem with elephant meat is they're too expensive because of the demand for ivory,\" says Stirling. \"A piece of the meat costs $200 to $",
      "For an overview of .44 magnum revolver models in the Fallout series of games, see .44 pistol.\n\nThe .44 magnum revolver is a weapon in Fallout: New Vegas, Fallout 4, and Fallout Tactics.\n\nContents show]\n\nBackground Edit\n\nA standard .44 magnum round is fired as well as magnum buckshot, which is useful for eliminating opponents while wearing armor with lots of HP.\n\nCharacteristics Edit\n\nThe .44 magnum revolver (and magnum rifle) are the most common revolver in the Fallout universe, with more powerful rounds than their weaker counterparts. These are also the most frequently seen guns, used primarily as a backup in emergencies, such as when the player character has an injury but cannot repair it.\n\nDespite its size, it has the highest damage of any handgun in the game.\n\nGameplay attributes Edit\n\nThe .44 magnum revolver is a bit easier to handle than the other revolvers due to its smaller size, making it easier for the player character to handle a weapon. However, being a revolver, it is less accurate than other revolvers.\n\nDespite being small, the .44 magnum is surprisingly powerful. With the right mods, the weapon (like most .45 autos) will do over 500 damage, meaning this small gun can kill almost any critter with one headshot.\n\nVideos Edit\n\nCall of the Wild - .44 magnum revolver tutorial The Black Vault The .44 magnum revolver in\n\nLocations Edit\n\nFallout: New Vegas Edit\n\nIt is found in the Mojave Wasteland near some abandoned camps. In the camp west of Old Mormon Fort, the player can find a revolver, pistol, and ammunition for the weapon at the front desk.\n\nFallout 4 Edit\n\nIt can occasionally be found around the Mojave Wasteland.\n\nNotes Edit\n\nIf all the .44 magnum revolver's mods are combined with the laser sight and suppressor, a rifle with a similar appearance to the .44 magnum revolver may be formed. This rifle possesses almost exactly the same stats as the revolver, but is able to reload twice as fast. This rifle does appear in some game files as the \"magnum rifle\", though it's not listed in the console or weapon descriptions.\n\nThe magnum revolver has the highest base damage in the game by over 20 points, making it a very potent weapon if it is used correctly, but it is relatively slow. Players using this weapon should use the gun sparingly (and, possibly, only against creatures that are not as tough as the characters wielding it), or they will likely run out of ammo before they can get into a real fight.\n\nBugs Edit\n\npc ps4 xboxone The player will automatically pick up another one as soon as they take it back from the junkheap. With a quick enough hand, the player can then reload the revolver back to a loaded state as soon as it is back in the player's inventory. [verified] On PC , it can be fixed by leaving and returning to the settlement where the weapon was obtained and the player character immediately pick-up another magnum. [verified]",
      "It's a story that's been running through the minds of some NBA fans on social media, like many other NBA stories: the Knicks were set to trade Kristaps Porzingis last summer but the deal wasn't final until his mother, Wanda, gave birth to a healthy baby boy. Wanda and her husband, Denis Porzingis, were married in March 2016 at the end of his second season with the team. Wanda Porzingis is reportedly expecting their third child, a girl named Alaina.\n\nBut Wanda is not a real person, according to a New York Daily News investigation. The paper says the birth records have been falsified and Wanda's actual identity was stolen by someone who used it to obtain a passport to travel to France and obtain a birth record. The birth certificate, the Daily News says, was actually issued to a woman in California. Wanda's mother, by the way, is Wanda's real biological mother.\n\nThe Daily News did an exhaustive search of the birth records that were used to secure Wanda's record in 2016, and they found that two people, and perhaps more, had a close relationship with the man behind the Porzingis family.\n\nThe Daily News was able to determine that a woman identified as M.C. had been the woman of interest to the Celtics before their first-round pick was traded for Porzingis during the 2015 draft. The Daily News has learned there was also a relationship between the Porzingis family and a woman identified as M.L. who has lived in Florida and used the name Wanda Dias since 2004.\n\nNeither Wanda Porzingis nor M.C. were actually Wanda Dias, according to the Daily News story.\n\nOn Tuesday, the New Orleans Pelicans reportedly sent the 31-year-old Porzingis to the New York Knicks as part of a deal that sent Buddy Hield to the Thunder. Porzingis is still a free agent and the Knicks are not expected to exercise the five-year, $124 million contract he signed last summer.",

      "Citizenship by birth is one of the fundamental parts of Canadian citizenship. It is a vital link to Canada's history, values and traditions. Citizenship for a child born to a Canadian citizen or permanent resident is based on a parent's connection to Canada and that child's right to be a Canadian and to participate in its government and culture.\n\nCitizenship by birth can also provide Canada's children with a special bond of belonging to the country they call home. It is only by giving birth to a Canadian child that a mother can make sure that her child comes into the world with a strong ties to Canada. With this in mind, Canadians cherish the opportunity of welcoming a child into the Canadian family and the broader Canadian community.\n\nCitizenship by Birth – Canada's history\n\nCitizenship by birth goes back to the founding of the Dominion of Canada by the King of England in 1776. To become a resident of Canada, a child born in Canada to a Canadian male was required to have a Canadian father and an English mother. Children born to female residents of the Dominion were allowed to be either Canadian or British to ensure that they were brought up in the same ways as Canadians. In 1867, as a result of new immigration rules, the law was amended to allow children born to Irish-born mothers to be either Canadian or English. This change ensured that the children of immigrants were fully assimilated into Canadian society.\n\nCitizenship by birth was also applied to the children of non-immigrants in the years following Confederation. In 1882, all male children who were born of a Canadian mother or Scottish mother in Canada, or who were born of an immigrant parent, were automatically Canadian citizens and could enjoy all of the rights and privileges that come with citizenship.\n\nCitizenship by birth is still considered a fundamental principle of our country. Every Canadian child is entitled to be a person of full citizenship, but it also means that they are guaranteed every opportunity to have the best chance to become a part of Canada. Citizenship by birth enables families to be close to each other and to contribute to the well-being of the country.\n\nAs well, citizenship by birth gives children a tangible link to Canada's history, traditions and values. Canadian children of British parents have a deep connection to Great Britain and feel a sense of belonging for their heritage, education, and social networks. They know that as long as they have British roots and are loyal to Britain, they will always have the right to stay and enjoy full membership of their own country.\n\nCitizenship by birth – special bonds to Canada\n\nThe special bond of citizenship that comes with citizenship by birth encourages those born in Canada to feel part of the family and take pride in being a part of the country that they live in. Citizenship by birth also means that children benefit from the full benefit of Canada's social, economic, and political institutions, including the provinces and institutions like the public service and schools, because they can be sure that their communities are built around them.\n\nCitizenship by birth also encourages those born in Canada to identify with their Canadian heritage. They may identify with their mother's country of origin or with their father's nation. In fact, these two ways of identifying can reinforce each other. As a result, children of immigrant parents are more likely to become citizens or permanent residents of Canada and are less likely to end up being outside of the country.\n\nCitizenship by birth also fosters inclusion of immigrants and children of immigrants in Canada's economic, cultural, and political life. Citizenship by birth is not limited to those who are born in Canada to immigrants, it is also extended to children born anywhere within Canada, at all stages of life.\n\nCitizenship by birth is one of the pillars of Canada's Canadian identity. As the population of Canada grows, the value of citizenship by birth grows along with it. This gives all Canadians an opportunity to celebrate Canada in their own way.\n\nCitizenship by birth – Canada's future\n\nToday, citizenship by birth is not as common as it once was. In some families, a child's citizenship by birth is still a basic principle. However, many more families are beginning to celebrate Canadian citizenship by choice.\n\nThe citizenship process has evolved over time to a point where citizenship by birth has become more optional. Most states require that a child is born in Canada to someone who had previously resided in Canada and in turn a child must be born within a 10 year period of this relationship. Some states allow a conditional right to citizenship for parents of children born before they attained permanent residency.\n\nWhile a child is born in Canada to a Canadian father or mother, the child may eventually become a permanent resident by virtue of being a parent who has been recognized and admitted for permanent residency.\n\nCitizenship by birth can change and can be a long, difficult, and uncertain journey. It can be a wonderful experience for children and a source of great pride. A proud parent can ensure",
      "This isn't to say that the United Kingdom is any more or less safe than Australia, with both countries having had attacks last year.\n\nBut security and political leaders in Australia are more confident about their country's ability to fight terrorism.\n\nThe United Kingdom's foreign secretary, Philip Hammond, said the country had a more robust counterterrorism program.\n\n\"They have a much more robust and well thought through counter terrorism programme, as well as a security service that works much more effectively, that takes a much larger approach to dealing with terrorism,\" he said.\n\nThe United States and Australia share a history of the fight against al Qaeda.

Australia ranked 26th in the list, with Australia's closest competitors being Canada and Brazil.\n\nDespite the two countries being in a similar security and political region, Australia's prime minister recently said the country is more confident about its ability to combat terrorism.\n\n\"As far as Australia is concerned I think we are much more confident that we're able to counter terror than we were a few years ago,\" Abbott told the Nine Network.",
      "PASADENA, Calif. -- A NASA spacecraft's recent discovery of water ice near one end of our solar system has given us fresh insight into a puzzling puzzle: how we got so much water during the birth of the solar system 4.6 billion years ago.\n\n\nThis water ice was identified not by any of the traditional methods we can apply to detect it -- including radio telescopes, X-ray telescopes or even the Hubble Space Telescope. Instead, researchers relied on Cassini, NASA's flagship spacecraft operating in the outer solar system, and an instrument it developed to measure gases called infrared plumes.\n\n\nOne plume in particular caught their eye. It appeared at the northern polar region of Titan, where Titan's thick methane atmosphere is thickest. Cassini and the infrared instrument -- called THEMIS for Titan Infrared and Sounder System -- detected a jet of dense liquid methane escaping from the surface of one of Titan's ice caps. The findings are published Dec. 7 in The Astrophysical Journal.\n\n\nThe plume probably formed when methane rain fell on Titan's surface and dissolved a bit of ice, researchers said. The methane was heated and ejected from the surface.\n\n\nTitan's thick atmosphere and its frozen polar lakes make it a fascinating place to study. Scientists are still trying to figure out what happens when water evaporates from liquid water on Titan's surface. \"One theory is that the methane evaporates and winds up vaporizing,\" said Thomas Zurbuchen, associate administrator for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. \"Another theory is that the methane vaporizes into a gas that flows into the atmosphere, or gets trapped in small ice particles and forms these tiny bubbles and then escapes through the plume.\"\n\n\nThe discovery of water ice near a plume was a surprise, and its composition has been studied since the mission began in 2004. Now that a few additional months have passed, scientists will use the knowledge from these studies to determine how widespread and varied water may be in Titan's atmosphere.\n\n\n\"Our observations were a surprise to us -- we didn't expect to see water,\" said Paul Schenk, associate project scientist for Cassini at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena. \"We didn't know how abundant it is. We weren't sure if it was in the atmosphere, or the liquid outer surface that makes the water, or somewhere in between.\"\n\n\nTitan is an ocean-covered world about the size of Earth with a global water budget about 50 times as large as Earth's. It is also the only moon of Saturn that has weather systems active year-round. The moon's vast lakes are fed by liquid hydrocarbons and frozen methane. Titan's surface is covered with cracks that likely formed because methane has escaped from its surface. The moon has a thick haze of water vapor that clouds its skies in the morning and evening hours when the sun sets below the horizon. Its gravity and thick atmosphere make it a challenging place to explore, but Cassini will learn more about how the moon's surface and climate operate in future orbits.\n\n\nCassini is scheduled to end its mission on Sept. 15, 2017. The Cassini-Huygens mission is a cooperative project of NASA, the European Space Agency and the Italian Space Agency. JPL, a division of the California Institute of Technology, Pasadena, manages the mission for NASA's Science Mission Directorate in Washington. The Cassini orbiter and its two onboard cameras were designed, developed and assembled at JPL. The imaging operations center is based at the Space Science Institute in Boulder, Colo.\n\n\nFor more information about Cassini, visit http://saturn.jpl.nasa.gov and http://www.nasa.gov/cassini.

      "\"That makes me so angry!\"\n\nThe moment that had been hanging in the balance slowly disappeared.\n\nHe was definitely very powerful indeed.\n\nBut that meant this was also his mistake.\n\nThe fact that he had lost to someone who had just entered his realm, it was truly a pity!\n\n\"I'll take those things from the palace!\"\n\nThat's right!\n\nIf he was still in his realm now, would he not find those small treasures to be treasures?\n\n\"Master! Could it be that the princess has already entered the stage right at this very moment? Or…is that something that can be achieved in this lifetime?\"\n\n\"That princess has already completely passed the stage of an ordinary woman!\" The man looked very unhappy.\n\n\"It can still be possible to see her.\"\n\nHou Fei nodded his head and continued with a strong voice.\n\nThat princess was probably like the two women in the crowd…\n\nShe was also very powerful and was extremely intelligent…\n\nThe two women in the crowd had been extremely impressive too, although they were just people from the crowd and could only be described as spectators, they could actually kill the person of their choice and could take a treasure from him on the spot!\n\nThat was why, although he felt extremely depressed, he still said to Hou Fei.\n\n\"Let's go.\"\n\nWithout changing his expression, Hou Fei nodded.\n\nThe moment they left the palace hall, the scene suddenly changed.\n\nA group of people with white masks and black cloaks charged toward the palace hall in a hurry. In the meantime, they were waiting and watching the situation outside. As they watched the scene, they were surprised to see the princess already walking toward the arena. In just a few steps, the whole crowd was unable to endure the pressure and began to move.\n\nThe spectators were also able to see that in just a moment, the figure of the princess had already entered the arena. In this one single stage, it was already a pity that she was at a disadvantage because she was still extremely young.\n\nIn fact, for the first time, all the spectators' gazes were pointed at this beautiful woman. Everyone had a feeling of envy and longing.\n\nThis was an opponent who had already been considered the absolute champion of our Zhou Dynasty.\n\nShe was actually actually taking part in the match?\n\nAs the spectators saw this spectacle of a beauty that had just entered the stage, their minds finally calmed down.\n\nNo matter how strong a woman was in this world, the first step in becoming a warrior of the Zhou Dynasty is to marry. The more a warrior married, the more powerful he'd be and the more beautiful his wife would be. In the eyes of the common masses of our country, the ideal woman in our Zhou dynasty should be a very beautiful and strong woman who could easily overpower every man in her life!\n\nAs for the man and his wife, in this world, even as royalty, their spouses must not be anything less than the royal's maid. It's very important for royalty to be a man's dream bride, and in their previous life as nobles and warriors, this was the very foundation for their family's fame and happiness! With her being a warrior of our Zhou Dynasty, their happiness and prestige as the royal family would not be diminished!\n\nEven the emperor who had his hands tied was a man's dream bride.\n\nFor the Emperor to have a beautiful and strong woman as his wife, who would dare oppose him?\n\nThe eyes of the spectators were finally fixed on this girl from all of five centimeters away.\n\nThis girl was only the fourth princess of our Zhou Dynasty, but she was actually a warrior of our Zhou Dynasty?\n\n\"Princess! Do you still need to enter the arena?\"\n\nOne of the people sitting on the frontlines suddenly cried out.\n\nThat person was the one who had stood outside the palace door and kept watching the competition until now. He was only in his fourth year of senior high school, yet he was already sitting on the sidelines watching the entire scene.\n\nEven though this person was only in his fourth year, he already was capable of holding a high standing in our country.\n\nAlthough he did not know it at present, he'd already been sitting there a few minutes ago.\n\nAt the moment when the person who had just entered the arena was about to fight with the opponent, as her opponent stood in front…this person immediately jumped up as if he'd found the solution to everything.\n\nBoom!\n\nThat person's body collided with something. When his body disappeared from the ring, the white mask on that person's face was already very dirty. When that person reappeared, his body had already become a mess.\n\nAt an even greater distance, a figure had appeared behind the white mask. An",

      "Kaworu Nagisa is a mysterious man who appears as a dreamy figure in his dreams, and is often depicted as a young girl.\n\nContents show]\n\nPersonality Edit\n\nKaworu is quite enigmatic, and in some ways very dangerous. He shows a great deal of trust in others, even those who may not deserve it. His emotions manifest in the ways he speaks and acts; sometimes he appears as someone to be trusted, but this is a facade, and is only used to manipulate people. He possesses an intelligence far beyond his own age, having studied human behavior for many years. In the end, though, it all came down to his trust, and the fact that people are often more trusting in the presence of other people who seem equally intelligent, or at least more honest.\n\nDespite being more intelligent than most of the characters in the story (aside from SEELE), Kaworu displays a kind of childlike confidence in others, frequently praising and looking up to people in a condescending manner. He sometimes has an uncharacteristic tendency to use an overly-exuberant manner in order to gain sympathy, even in the presence of those who he may have previously doubted. On other occasions, he can be quite cruel. At other times, he seems very mature. He has a great ability with machinery, and can also fly despite not being very skilled at walking on water (due to the fact that he has no swimsuit). Despite his youth and his apparent lack of maturity, he is actually a very caring and honorable person at heart, and is very concerned for the well-being of those around him.\n\nKaworu also has some form of psychic ability, and can interact with other souls in the same way the main characters do. The abilities Kaworu develops as the story progresses is mostly restricted to seeing things that are not normally visible, and hearing voices. A key aspect of Kaworu's character is the way he interacts with others. He interacts with the characters in a child-like manner, but, with time, he may grow more mature and more trusting, even when the situation calls for it.\n\nHistory Edit\n\nKaworu was born on April 28th, 199X while his mother, Mitsuha, was on an exploratory mission, and his father, Shinohara, was the commanding officer of the research vessel that made contact at the Jupiter Station. (The story begins with the Gendo Ikari piloting the Eva Ayanami to the Jupiter Station.) During the early years of the first expedition, the team was captured by the Gauna as a result of the attack on the Jupiter Station, and Mitsuha was kidnapped as a result. They were separated and Kaworu was abducted on board the vessel while Shinohara was left behind on Earth. Mitsuha became the center of Rei's affections, the most powerful Eva pilot of that time period, but she was also taken by her mother, and, due to Kaworu's age, she was left with no other future than Shinji. Kaworu, however, did not abandon her. It was the other pilots, as well as the NERV staff, who had little idea about her background or her feelings regarding Gendo, when they all assumed that Kaworu was Shinohara's illegitimate child, and they used that ignorance to their advantage. They used the fact that he was very young relative to his mother at the time and believed he had no choice but to serve their needs.\n\nShinohara had intended from the very beginning to make Kaworu a suitable pilot, and he knew that he would be the one for Gendo. In order to get Shinji to pilot, he needed to make Shinji see himself as unworthy, and not fit for piloting Eva. When Shinji was fourteen, he was taken off of Earth on Shinji's mother's command. After Shinji had had little contact with Shinji's mother since his father's death, it became clear to him that Mitsuha had never loved Shinji, and that Shinji's mother had become nothing but a burden to him from an early age.\n\nShinji began to question himself constantly, until he reached the height of his emotional volatility, believing that all of the adults around him were conspiring against him. Eventually, he began to hate the adults around him completely and developed a deep hatred towards Gendo, his parents, his friends, and the other people who were his family. He grew so intense that he grew physically ill and was sent to the medical facility at Area 11 and, while Shinji and Mitsuha stayed behind in Area 2, Asuka was allowed to stay with them.\n\nWhile he was hospitalized at Area 11, he met Asuka, and the two became close friends, though they still remained somewhat distant, much like Shinji did with Rei. After Kaworu's mother died of leukemia, Kaworu and Shinji became very close, even though Shinji saw the death of his mother as a great loss, and would often cry for his mother",

It just took me a little while to figure it out!\n\nSo let's do a little review to see how we can get started.\n\nTo add a picture, just drag and drop a picture from your computer's desktop into your picture folder on your phone. This will open its own app for you so I used that.\n\nIf you are uploading pictures of your face, just drag it right into the picture folder and make sure the check box at the top is ticked. Now the checkbox will only be checked when you choose a photo for display.\n\nLastly, to add a color to the picture, just click on the gear in the right corner of the picture. This app allows you to upload 3 photos at the time. You can scroll around inside the picture folder, and when you're ready pick the pictures you want to use.\n\nI have uploaded 5 pictures so far, they are the following:\n\nSo far I'm really liking using the app because I really like the way my pictures look, and they are really easy to add.

      "It was no surprise when Sony's President of PlayStation, Andrew House, announced on Twitter that the next PlayStation would cost $399. A few days later Sony's Senior Vice President of Hardware, Scott Rohde, announced that the PlayStation 4 would begin shipping in November. It was the next two announcements that, when coupled with the previous, seemed to confirm that the price of a console in its first year would come in at $399.\n\nThe following week I got an email containing not one, but three $699.99 PS4s. (Thanks, anonymous).\n\n$699.99 isn't exactly $399, but it is at the top edge of the price range we've been seeing for entry-level consoles in the last couple years. At first glance the PS4s on display did look a whole lot like the PS3 ones, but if you look closely you won't see a $25 price difference at all. While they were identical in size, they also looked to be identical in build quality.\n\nI was told the PS3 Slims are being sold for around $599, but it's possible they've priced them that way only after they had made all the machines they needed for Sony's Holiday 2013 event. My email also said Sony is in the final stages of designing the slimmed down PS4S, but it wasn't clear what the device would look like when Sony showed it off.\n\nIt was pretty easy to imagine that a slimmed down PS4 was going to offer much of the same experience and play experience as the $399.99 PS4. But, it seemed even more obvious after my tour of the PlayStation 4s that Sony wasn't planning on making all the slimmed down PS4s look exactly like the PS4s shown for this week on stage at E3.\n\nIn fact, while the thinness of the PS4's aluminum chassis made sense in a sense, the PS4s I was shown last week all felt like $699.99 models.\n\nThe PS4 will ship with a quad-core 1.7GHz Jaguar CPU, 320MB of RAM, two 32GB SSDs of SSD-like performance, and a Blu-ray drive, among other accessories. It will also ship with an 802.11n Wi-Fi, Bluetooth 4.0, a front-facing camera, 4 USB 3.0 ports, HDMI 1.4a, and an audio jack built in.\n\nYou can view a gallery of these new PS4s below. Sony is also giving away 10,000 units of the low-end PS4 Slim console in the U.S. for Christmas.\n\n[gallery]\n\nIt seems fairly clear that if Sony wanted to ship a $399.99 PS4 that it would probably choose white as its primary color, with silver accents on the corners and bottom like we've seen on the PS3 Slim. The $699.99 PS4s that Sony showed out on stage last week were black with silver accents on the sides and bottom.",

      "As the New York Times reported Sunday, the CIA, with help from the FBI and \"an outside research group,\" has concluded that the Russian government directed the campaign and that Moscow may have intervened in the election to help Trump win. These claims came one week after the FBI concluded that there had not been enough evidence to bring charges against Clinton and more than 18 months after the Democratic National Committee was hacked and thousands of its emails stolen. In its final assessment, though, the CIA found that these intrusions were \"intimately tied to the Russian Government.\"\n\nAt the White House press briefing Monday morning, senior adviser Kellyanne Conway responded to questions about the CIA's conclusions by insisting that \"we have never had a foreign body steal emails\" from Democrats. \"That is not what we know about,\" she added.\n\nBut that wasn't Conway's only error, which she compounded by refusing to answer direct questions on whether Trump was being \"coerced\" by the Russians — even though he clearly was. Conway was pressed by reporter April Ryan about \"coercion\" within Trump campaign circles.\n\nAt one point, the journalist attempted to ask whether this would mean that all campaign staffers could be subject to this sort of communication monitoring. As Conway has repeatedly claimed, this was an incorrect use of the words \"coercion.\"\n\nIn her own defense, she said that, \"As I said earlier, I think we're all on the same page.\" She made no direct distinction between the CIA analysis and the CIA report presented publicly, but her comment that they're all \"on the same page\" was clearly a reference to both.\n\nThat, at least, is a claim of accuracy that is worth believing. On the other hand, her argument about being \"on the same page\" suggests that she was referring to the White House's statements earlier in the day in which the president and Conway were, at best, ambiguous in suggesting that both sides of the divide in the campaign were not working together to subvert the democratic process.",
      "This article is from the archive of our partner .\n\nMitt Romney and his wife Ann have been the subject of a lot of attention lately, because they won't say whether they believe the president believes in Creationism. It was the subject of some of the most contentious questions during last Thursday's debate, and Romney still won't say whether he believes in it.\n\nIf Mitt Romney's \"theories\" about the president's religion remain the same as they were Thursday, he is a lying liar. There are plenty of reasons why he could be lying about the president's religion. He could be lying about a secret agreement with the president to withhold information about his religion from the public (a story that would be particularly good for Gingrich to bring up). Romney could be lying because he's so concerned about an independent investigation into Bush's faith that he'd only give it to him if the president gave him the information. Or he could just be lying that the president's family is as devout as his.\n\nOne theory being offered by one Republican operative thinks that Romney may have a secret deal with President Obama to not reveal his religion. The theory is that the Republican candidate is afraid that if the public sees him as a practicing Christian then he and his party stand to lose, so he wants that to be kept quiet. For his part, Romney thinks this theory is totally ridiculous. Romney said that the president does believe in Creationism, but it's so bad that there's no point in discussing it.\n\nWe've heard more than our fair share of theories about why Romney won't discuss his beliefs with the public. First, Romney is simply so conservative that he is averse to discussing his religious beliefs. The only exception that he's ever been compelled to make, when asked about his faith, was during a CNN interview for Meet the Press.\n\nThen there are those people who think that Romney is ashamed of his personal faith and has spent his entire life denying it. Perhaps he's a closeted Catholic. Perhaps he even wears a cross around his neck like his father did when he was governor of Michigan. (His father has said that he wore the cross in order to \"keep it out of politics.\")\n\nStill, that's a lot of reasons not to go out on a limb and speculate about why he wouldn't reveal his faith. Maybe Romney's just lying. But it's very likely that Romney does not believe in the \"young earth creationism\" theory, the one that his opponents like Gingrich (and Rush Limbaugh and Richard Mourdock) have all parroted for weeks because it's supposedly a conspiracy theory. It is a theory that does not hold up to any kind of scientific argument. The evidence is overwhelming: according to a review of a number of studies by the International Research Institute for Creation Research and other scientists, \"Scientists have repeatedly demonstrated that the earth contains no evidence for catastrophic, catastrophic 'recent' geologic processes.\" That's not to say that it hasn't happened, but there's pretty good evidence that it has not.\n\nNow all of that might mean that Romney has no problem with saying that he is willing to take a lie detector test in order to prove that he is a practicing Christian: after all, it is a reasonable and common tactic for those who do not have a strong religious belief to come before a judge and present themselves in a neutral manner. In fact, a Republican congresswoman who has recently come to Romney's defense on this issue, Michele Bachmann, made a similar argument last year in a debate with Obama. Now that will be interesting to see whether Romney will do the same.\n\nThis article is from the archive of our partner The Wire.",
      "The first thing I want to know is what exactly are you doing to that tree?!\n\n\nHow the hell are you supposed to cut that tree down?!?!\n\nPosts: 1139\n\nLocation: Seattle, WA, USA\n\nThe first thing I want to know is what exactly are you doing to that tree?!?!\n\nIf your tree is in very poor standing, then there might be several things you can do to save it\n\n1. Cut back to the point where it has the least growth, then remove the whole top of the tree (if at all possible), to the main trunk. (If not possible, cut to the ground)\n\n2. Remove the upper branches (the ones with the trunk still attached) and hang them to let them rest on a support or something sturdy such as a post or post, like that one they are hanging on.\n\n\nIn other words, don't cut everything down (unless your tree is in the best of shape!), just leave the top as is (and be very careful to make sure to leave the tree intact with the trunk intact). This will keep any decay from coming out of the tree.\n\n\nTo really get the most out of the tree, you need to remove the most leaves and allow the roots to do their thing. So, make sure you remove all of the dead tree leaves and branches and let the tree do what it has to do with as much water and air as possible...\n\n\nIn the tree, you may find:\n\n1. Roots - If you are finding roots going everywhere in the soil, it is a good sign your tree is going to take a long time to come back, and maybe even be replaced. (You may need to remove more than just the roots, to get to the roots you need to remove the tree part)\n\n\n2. Stomates - (the stumps that come out of the trees) can sometimes reveal damage caused by diseases and insects such as root rot, scale, and scale eggs. Stromates also harbor bacteria and other organisms that cause disease in the soil.\n\n\n3. Insects - Insects can cause damage to your tree's roots and leaves (and sometimes even the bark too) in many ways, it varies by species.\n\nI found out from another expert's comments that tree bugs can be found under a root ball, and may be able to be spotted by the appearance of a black circle under the trunk.\n\n\nI also found out just from studying the top of a trunk that it has a lot of damage that would not normally show under the tree because of the size of the tree itself, it is a good idea to check the leaves, roots, branches, etc when you are looking for the problems on the top of the tree!\n\n\n4. Dust - Sometimes it is obvious as you look for it, and sometimes it can only be noticed in a bad state. Dust is debris that accumulates on the trunk and trunk tips. It is just a type of dust, and is just a little bit hard on tree trunks and branches, it is just the small pieces left over after a hard rain or snowstorm has kicked the dirt out of them.\n\n\nI have also found dust when I was digging around a root ball, you might need some kind of dust mask or something to help filter out the dust.\n\nHere is a picture of a tree that has been affected by something, and a picture of the exact spot in the dirt/plaster/sand that I dug up the Dust.\n\nAs you can see, the exact spot is in full sun and it is also a little dusty. The spot is so hard to find because of how tiny, little dirt/sand is.\n\n\nHow do you remove it all?\n\n\n1. Wash the trees and branches with water to remove all the dust and debris.\n\n\n2. Make dust masks for the guys that will remove the rootball and then place them in your trunk or the soil surrounding it (you might have to get rid of the tree part first so they don't get splinters in it). Let the tree take as much air as it can, but the best way to do this is to let it sit in your trunk for a few days (or a week at the longest)\n\nIf you wait too long, some of the dust would get inside the tree and not be able to get out, so don't want to wait too long (I did).\n\n\n3. Once the tree has gotten the most air it can handle, place the dust mask on it right over the area, and then take the next step and place your gloves on and then just let it sit out there for a few days, not moving it.\n\n\nOnce your tree has had as much air to breathe during the next few days, you can move it by itself if you wish. To move it by itself, you need to use some kind of shovel, or possibly a tree",
      "Guns And Ammo\n\nIn the United States, guns are used by a little more than half of adults, but they also account for more than 90 percent of homicides and nearly 50 percent of all accidental deaths. In fact, the CDC reports that guns are among the most deadly of all household tools – contributing to nearly half of all deaths and injuries (and more than 90 percent of accidental deaths) in American homes.\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, approximately half of the nearly 33,000 people who died of gun-related suicides in 2012 had a history of mental illness, and more than one third of these individuals reported having suffered from depression or a mental disorder in the year before attempting suicide. The problem is much worse for those who attempt, survive, and attempt again.\n\n\"There's not a single state in the country that doesn't have some form of law that we consider to be overreaching in some shape or form,\" former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords (D-Ariz.) recently told a crowd of about 500 people at the NRA's annual convention in Houston. \"And that's unacceptable.\"\n\n\nIn the past few years, a handful of bills have been introduced in Congress and federal agencies designed to regulate the sale and distribution of firearms in the United States. If they become law, advocates say they will make gun ownership and use safer – though they differ about how they might accomplish that goal.\n\n\n[This story contains graphic elements.]",
      "A study of over a thousand young people in a university hospital has linked drinking at college parties to increased suicide attempts.\n\nThe study has been published in the American College Health Journal.\n\n\"If a group of young people are drinking and doing things that are not associated with alcohol abuse, their chances of being suicidal increases,\" researcher Tuan Tran said.\n\nA third of all students at the University of Michigan Medical School admitted to binge drinking in the year leading up to graduation. At the end of their six year service people also made up more than half of all those taking their own lives.\n\nThis is despite the fact that alcohol is a legal medicine, with a long history of safe use and long-term benefits.\n\n\"There's a lot of evidence that people are drinking their way to death,\" Dr. Tran said.\n\nA recent World Health Report found that young adults who binge drink regularly are four times more likely to die of alcohol-related illness and four times more likely to die from cirrhosis of the liver.\n\n\"People are consuming far more alcohol and far more risk factors are involved,\" Dr. Tran said of students at U-M.\n\nA significant factor is the number of college students who drink heavily, the researchers say, with men and women equally affected.\n\nCollege students are also more likely than students in other age groups to do things that can lead to suicide, such as drug abuse, getting into fights, and smoking marijuana frequently.\n\nThe study indicates the importance of creating campus environments where young people can live together sober and where there is better support for students struggling with substance abuse problems.\n\n\"There is a huge amount of work to be done to address alcohol abuse and alcohol misuse among young people in any setting, at both the University and high schools,\" said Dr. Tran.\n\nDr. Tran is a research fellow with the Centre for Health and the Environment at The University of Michigan, where he studies social determinants of health for youth and adults with disabilities.\n\n\"The research is relevant to a variety of settings. We see it in the military and we see it in universities – where these are major sources of health inequity among the under-represented and disadvantaged.\n\nDr. Tran also has a private practice in Toronto specializing in addiction and related disorders.\n\nThe research in the American College Health Journal was supported by the William and Flora Hewlett Charitable Foundation.\n\n\"Students have a number of things that can make them more likely to engage in risky behaviors like alcohol and other drugs – from peer pressure to alcohol-related problems.\"\n\nAccording to the College of Physicians and Surgeons - Chicago chapter, alcoholism impacts nearly 40% of students in the Chicago region alone with a lifetime prevalence nearly seven times higher than for the U.S. population.\n\nAbout the University of Michigan\n\nThe University of Michigan is the flagship public university of the state of Michigan. In the fall of 2013, U-M became the first university in the country to be designated as a Major League Baseball \"Successor School\" by the Collegiate Baseball Association of America. The \"Successor School\" designation provides the University with a pathway to admission to the Big Ten Conference, while also assisting the University in its ongoing development as a major academic research institution. The Michigan Athletic Department is the oldest continuously operated athletic department in the nation, and is ranked within the top five athletic departments in the country by USA Today. The Department has been recognized for academic excellence in nine consecutive years by the National Collegiate Athletic Association. The largest and most comprehensive student academic health center in the Western Hemisphere offers a dynamic range of comprehensive health services to more than 32,000 students on more than 150 acres in Ann Arbor. The Center for Mental Health & Addiction Medicine is known by the medical community for pioneering groundbreaking research efforts for the prevention, diagnosis and treatment of mental health conditions. Additional university services offered include an interdisciplinary undergraduate degree granting program through the College of Letters & Science and more than 200 student organizations and organizations. Ranked among the top 100 private universities, U-M is home to more than 10,000 student members and more than 90 academic departments serving more than 50,000 students. More than 12,000 graduate students are under faculty direction. The College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LLSA) and College of Engineering & Applied Science (SEAS) are two of the more than 100 universities in the U.S. ranked in the top 100 by U.S. News & World Report.",
      "If there's one thing that's important to understand about the future of the Internet, it's that it's far too early to pin down what we can all expect in terms of the infrastructure that will come to bear on the Internet. In particular, it seems that the future of mobile services like Skype and Google Hangouts is still up in the air. As the FCC prepares to vote on its Open Internet Order, you may recall that just before the debate on the Commission's proposal for Internet regulation, both proponents and opponents of net neutrality were pointing to the fact that mobile had become a vital service for Internet users' need to communicate using the internet.\n\n\"The mobile Web is now crucial to millions of business transactions and is growing more than five thousand percent to support an estimated ten billion mobile-phone users,\" argued Michael Powell, in the opening statement for the Telecom/Internet Association (TIA) at its June 3, 2009 hearing. (p. 7-8) \"The U.S. is rapidly becoming the global leader in broadband service,\" commented Google's Eric Schmidt, adding that \"mobile Internet access is growing faster and is now reaching nearly 1 billion smartphone users.\" (p. 8)\n\nBut by the time the debate on the Internet came to a close in October 2009, there were conflicting views on whether or not it would be possible to bring the mobile Internet to all Americans. According to a report by Michael Powell for the Council on Foreign Relations (CFR), \"the Internet is still most popular in places that had no formal infrastructure: places without the luxury of a fixed cell tower, as well as in developing countries where telephone lines may remain antiquated....[The mobile Internet in 2009] will continue to remain a niche service, a fact which will probably be an obstacle to scaling up to commercial levels.\"\n\nThe CEPI report, released a year later — in October 2010 — also suggested that mobile Internet access would take a huge step forward when both the iPhone and iPad was introduced to a consumer market: \"It is estimated that as the iPhone launches into the mainstream market, mobile Internet consumption will jump significantly,\" wrote CEPI. \"Based on estimates from ComScore, there are currently approximately 200 million subscribers across the United States who are iPhone owners and more than 2 million of them are active users of the device.\" (p 25)\n\nToday is the day to put your bets on the Internet of Things\n\nToday, with the FCC's Open Internet Order as well as its proposed reclassification of broadband as a Title II common carrier service, it seems safe to predict that we'll be seeing some major change to the way the Internet will be accessed and used. After all, it's not like the Commission is sitting back taking this chance to just let everything sort out itself. The Open Internet Order was just the first step, and it seems we're in for plenty more to come. And so, to start the day, we've put together a few predictions about just what the Internet of Things (IoT) will look like in another several years.\n\n1. Google Hangouts, which started as a free messaging service in 2003, will become a paid service, though it will continue to accept texts, pictures, and emails at no cost.\n\n2. The YouTube Red subscription service will become a full-fledged video streaming service, with full access to the entire YouTube content library as well as access to more channels and more editing tools.\n\n3. Facebook Messenger will continue to be one of the most popular services online, even when it stops being a messaging service. Google, which owns the search engine and is a major investor in the messaging service, will decide to merge its two services as the result of the merging.\n\n4. Microsoft's Skype will become a completely free \"personal cloud\" service that allows individuals to connect to others in real time, and other services will eventually work directly under the surface of Skype.\n\n5. As an example of the Internet of Things becoming important over time, many devices will now be able to talk directly to each other, using mesh networking, which allows them to connect to one another over short distances in the same way WiFi does. The mesh network will also enable devices to communicate using the same Wi-Fi channels as the other devices.\n\n6. Apple's iMessage will be the only messaging service that will work over both cellular and Wi-Fi networks. (iMessage is not actually available to consumers, though it was available to iOS 4 users in 2010.) The iMessage app will become the first free voice chat app — it will also be the only one that doesn't require a Wi-Fi or data connection to work.\n\nAnd while the last part is admittedly just a bit of wishful thinking, we have to wonder: What's the big holdup?\n\nThere are a lot of questions, but perhaps the biggest one is exactly when Google Hangouts and YouTube Red will be a paid service.\n\nHangouts will have a",
      "In the early 1950s, the U.S. Army tested a version of the \"Mk.III\" nuclear missile, the war-winning weapon that was put on top of a U.S. missile in the Cuban Missile Crisis of October, 1962. The Mk.III—developed by the Manhattan Project—had been given the code name \"Red October\" because of the color of its exhaust.\n\nIt's no surprise that the U.S. is moving closer to its own nuclear weapon. A nuclear-armed Russia is a reality threat—to be contained, of course, but not eliminated. The United States and Russia have been engaged in a series of nuclear tests from 2010 to 2013. One recently concluded that the U.S. and its nuclear-armed allies could have killed the world by early October, even before Moscow ordered the cessation of the tests.\n\nWhat is surprising is that North Korea, where the country's nuclear ambitions are less advanced than those of the United States, hasn't yet developed its own highly destructive deterrent weapon. While North Korea is capable of delivering a nuclear warhead on a missile, it hasn't yet developed nuclear warhead delivery systems that would allow it to do so, says David Albright, president of the Institute for Science and International Security, in Washington.\n\nNorth Korea and the U.S. are not in full treaty compliance—and neither the U.S. nor North Korea has signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. So for their first-strike nuclear capabilities, the two nations do not have to abide by international treaties that ban nuclear weapons. That is due to a 1968 provision known as Article VI, which states that \"nuclear weapons shall not be subject to general or special international agreement, whether in time of peace or in time of war.\"\n\nThe problem is that an agreement limiting nuclear weapons does not come cheap. It costs around $700,000 per piece of hardware—not including the cost of constructing the weapon delivery systems. Thus it's unclear how likely North Korea is to develop nuclear warhead delivery capabilities, says Albright.\n\nThe question, then, is how far along a nuclear program North Korea is. The only way to find out is to follow North Korea's progress. But doing so is impossible, because of restrictions on the flow of information out of the country.\n\nSo for the past decade, most of the information about North Korea's nuclear program has come from defectors based outside the country and from North Korea's own nuclear scientists. For about two years it has been impossible to obtain this information because the secretive regime restricted who could leave the country.\n\nIn March 2015, though, the International Committee of the Red Cross, the humanitarian agency whose members are allowed in North Korea, was able to gain access to the country, allowing the organization to provide the first detailed analysis of the level of activity in Pyongyang's nuclear program since 2006.\n\nThe report concluded that Pyongyang had conducted only three nuclear tests in the past decade. It also concluded that the Kim regime had only one operating reactor for power generation, adding that it was in \"critical condition, as a result of severe restrictions on the fuel supply to the nuclear-power-plant.\" A reactor could produce plutonium as a source of nuclear weapons fuel, the report concluded, though the report did not reveal what the source of the fuel was.\n\nThis information, says Albright, is important for determining the timeline for the country's nuclear program.\n\n\"We know that all of the other [nuclear] tests that North Korea has conducted—and the other seven tests it is purported to have conducted—were either test launches from an operational missile or tests of a system that's designed to carry out a first strike,\" says Albright.\n\n\"That was all that North Korea's program had been going for two or three years.\"\n\nThat timeline puts off-schedule the country's most recent tests. On Oct. 20, 2014, North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ordered the country's nuclear weapons program to go on full display.\n\nThe test, the result of a two-stage, liquid-fueled ballistic missile, was launched at an altitude of 600 miles, a move designed, experts say, to maximize the missile's range.\n\nIt is believed to be North Korea's first operational and combat-ready nuclear weapon.\n\nThe missile, by all accounts a \"long-range bomber\" similar to U.S. and Russian B-2 stealth bombers, was launched from a test range. North Korea's first-strike capability is believed to be a modified version of the missile—which, if launched from ground launch facilities, would have a range of roughly 14,000 miles—the full extent of North Korean missile program that has not been announced publicly.\n\n\"I have no way of knowing if it's even in the hands of Kim Jong Un yet,\" says David Wright, a nuclear researcher for the Union of Concerned Scientists in Washington who has closely",

But, as of Tuesday, we have a big one!\n\nA group of prominent figures in the games industry and entertainment industry are accusing Sony of gaming them, including GameSpot's own David Jagneaux – in a lawsuit.\n\nThe suit alleges that Sony's new PlayStation Plus game-purchasing service, PS Plus, requires Sony's PlayStation customers to sign contracts that effectively make users sign away their rights to any game from any developer.\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, the lawsuit is currently being filed in Los Angeles – just in time for the PlayStation 4's launch…\n\nThe suit's plaintiffs include The Los Angeles Times (two of its reporters and a writer for the website have signed on), the Associated Press, IGN, Polygon, GameSpot, and The Washington Post.\n\nThe filing alleges that PS Plus has forced game developers to pay Sony a fee in exchange for inclusion in the free-to-play service's games-only free pool. The suit also alleges that many games are available for free – without any required download. In other words, the lawsuit is asking for compensation for games that PS Plus doesn't require, and also for the extra fees charged by developers for \"premium\" games and \"full-priced\" games.\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, this fee was originally $9.99 a month, before dropping to $4.99 a month last May. Sony has argued in the past that users are actually paying only $4.99 – not $3.99 or $2.99 per month – for PS Plus, though the lawsuit says that the fee is actually more.\n\nSony has not yet responded to requests for comment from the Daily Beast.\n\n(Note: This is one of a series of articles we're publishing on Monday detailing major, and sometimes controversial changes in the way that games are being produced.

      "The two parties will have their final debate on Tuesday before the election, with a number of polls predicting a tight race. Photo: AAP\n\nAfter years in the political wilderness, the Aam Aadmi Party today won the first elections to the Delhi Assembly in which it fielded a woman. The results, announced by the lieutenant-governor after an hour-long count at 9am, put the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) ahead in 49 of the 70 seats with its candidate Preeti Sharma Oza securing 31 of the 70 seats in the Delhi assembly.\n\nThe Congress was leading in 28 seats, the BJP in 15 and the other parties in two seats.\n\nAn hour-long count of the votes led by Deputy Returning Officer (DRO) Rajeev Kumar concluded at 9am.\n\nMs Oza's election victory, coming as it did just a month after she was elected as the AAP candidate from Karkardooma constituency in south Delhi, also saw the number of women elected in the first Delhi assembly election in eight years going up two-fold to 11.\n\n\"There is massive participation of women voters in the Delhi assembly polls. They have now made it a double-header in politics,\" Prashant Bhushan, one of the co-founders of the AAP with Yogendra Yadav, told The Hindu. \"We won more than 50 percent of the women votes. This is a historic day.\"\n\nThe party had fielded Ms Oza last week and had claimed that she would be its election campaigner in Delhi.\n\n\"I have made the commitment to fight for the people of Delhi and I look forward to being their voice in the assembly,\" Ms Oza said. \"There was a lot of negativity and we have come out to counter that. We believe that a big change is possible if people are empowered and have a true alternative. I will work hard to make Delhi a better place for all.\"\n\nMs Yadav described the result as a \"historic day\" for the AAP and added, \"This is a victory for the common people. It is an election where our campaign had to be taken seriously.\"\n\nMr Bhushan said his party was happy with this election, which it said was a rejection of \"fear mongering politics\".\n\nThe AAP claimed that it had fielded some of the fewest candidates in the coming assembly elections.\n\nIn the last Delhi assembly election in 2012, it fielded only six candidates.\n\nDelhi's BJP government took a huge drubbing in the polls. It won just 22 seats that year, a significant drop down from 67 seats won in the 2009 Lok Sabha polls. In the 2012 assembly election, the BJP, with 45, had fielded 27 candidates.\n\nFor the Aam Aadmi Party (AAP), the result comes two days after the release of Ms Oza's book, 'Aam Aadmi-Pedi'. The book has come at a time when the party and other new contenders like the Akali Dal, the Janata Dal and the Dalit Maha Dal had been accused of having come up just to make headlines in Delhi.\n\n\"People of Delhi have given a blow to the fear mongering politics of both the Congress and the BJP,\" said the party's Sanjay Singh. \"There was a big difference between the party and the government. It was a matter between hope and action and the people of Delhi took a decisive decision.\"\n\nThe AAP will now try to form government with support from the Congress and BJP.\n\nThe poll has led to a lot of debate in Delhi.\n\nFor those who want to see the AAP become the party of Delhi, the party's success has to be a cause for celebration, but with that comes criticism.\n\nAAP supporters have been demanding a \"zero-tolerance\" policy towards corruption.\n\nMeanwhile, while the Congress and BJP are both facing the prospect of a hung assembly, the BJP's Manish Sisodia said they could take pride that the Delhi assembly poll was being contested in the first general elections in Delhi since the Partition.\n\n\"Delhi is the biggest democracy, not just because it was divided in two but also because of the strength of democratic ideals,\" Mr. Sisodia said.\n\nHowever, the Congress is likely to make the most of its success, especially with women voters ahead of the Assembly polls.\n\n\"People have spoken and we have not done much to meet their expectations. This is the only election in the country where women will vote. We welcome this,\" said Delhi Congress chief Ajay Maken. \"We are not going to take a backward step by making a political compromise. On the contrary, we will put together a positive and united front. There is a very big promise for the next government.\"\n\nThe BJP is also likely to feel the electoral weight of the Delhi Assembly polls with the party hoping to pick up an",
      "We were very excited to read the following today from USA Today.\n\nThe city of Charlotte, North Carolina, has chosen a pedestrian over a light-rail train as its preferred transit option for its downtown area. It's not a total surprise—charter schools like Charlotte School of the Arts and the University of North Carolina at Charlotte are great examples of how public-private partnerships can be used to save money and create more affordable public transit systems. But in this case, it was also a move, like all good decisions, that prioritized community-driven decisions about what the district wanted to do. In fact, city officials say that's what made this a no-brainer—it might have cost them a few extra votes on the Transportation Commission.\n\nAnd, it works. The pedestrian- and bicycle-friendly, four-county network will connect two downtown-area neighborhoods that are among the poorest in the state. There's even room for a bus line to take people to neighboring schools.\n\nAnd here's the good news: this was one of the projects that the Transportation Commission had looked at before moving on to other projects. (The other one was for a light-rail system in the center of the city.)\n\nThe question we'd like to ask here is this: given that America is a relatively poor country with a large urban population, what kind of society do you expect people in the suburbs and exurbs to live in?

      "A Texas woman who allegedly told her 14-year-old daughter that she wanted to be a sex worker after they had sex because she \"didn't want to get pregnant\" was a \"sexually sick human being\" who should have never been allowed in the first place, a Houston prosecutor said Tuesday.\n\nAs KPRC reported in February, Cynthia Ward, 39, was accused of telling her daughter, who is seven years old, that she wanted to be a sex worker because she didn't want to \"get pregnant.\" Ward's trial for alleged child molestation also heard testimony that her daughter had told the younger teen how much she wanted to work in the adult entertainment industry in order to make money to pay for college when she grows up, according to the Houston Chronicle.\n\nNow Judge John Hurley said the testimony provided enough evidence to conclude that Ward, who faces charges of sexual assault of a child under 14, acted with \"reckless disregard\" for the truth. The victim also told the court that as a result of the incident, she suffered \"post-traumatic stress disorder\" for years after the alleged incident, the Chronicle reported.\n\nBut Hurley also said the trial also highlighted the importance of parental consent for such matters, as he pointed to the case of one of his own daughters, which resulted in manslaughter charges being sought against a young man charged with killing her.\n\n\"No parent wants to have an issue arise with a child that they cannot control, whether it involves a child who needs help, or whether it involves a child that has to be restrained,\" the judge said. \"The law is there for those situations, and the responsibility is that you must do everything that you can to keep those situations out of those situations.\"\n\nDistrict Attorney Devon Anderson said she is grateful for Ward's apparent willingness to admit her crimes and also has expressed the hope that her plea deal will put an end to what she called a \"horrendous case.\"\n\n\"It's a relief to have her face the music on these charges,\" Anderson said during Tuesday's hearing.",

He was wearing a yellow t-shirt and a black baseball cap, and his back was towards us, so he could sort of smoke and shoot up in the open where he could see what was going on.\"\n\nWatch the video.\n\nOne can only imagine what it must be like to patrol the streets of Downtown Eastside every day, and yet have to take a hit out of your pocket to pay your way and keep the peace.\n\nWhat has been happening with police there?\n\nIn the wake of the Vancouver Police department's response to the Vancouver Sun, several social media forums have sprung up on social media – one of which is called \"No More Dirty Tricks!\"\n\nThe thread was started earlier this week by Vancouver Police Deputy Chief Roland Wells. The thread was in response to an article by the Sun that reported Vancouver police were being told of several recent drug busts where police allege the addicts were being forced into dealing.\n\n\"The public doesn't want to see it,\" Wells says in the video. \"I say to myself, how do I say no to this, but that's part of the job and I have to do what's right and legal.\"\n\nWells claims that even \"dirty tricks\" are allowed. \"I've done that in the past. But we all have to look at ourselves, and the community looks at us too,\" he says.\n\nAs for the videos he shared on his Facebook page today of police officers on the streets? Well, Wells thinks the videos may have been filmed over a year ago. But, in case you want to believe him, he also posted the YouTube video of his exchange with the VPD on Thursday:\n\nVancouver Police Const. Brian Montague, for his part, said police would like to see some sort of \"training\" given to officers who go to the Downtown Eastside, which will include having them know that addicts are a part of the community and not \"them.\"\n\n\"Drug dealing is really a crime, it's a criminal matter. And I would say that it's unfortunate that we all hear about that stuff, and it's unfortunate for that community, and obviously we have to deal with it, but I think training could be done to hopefully assist,\" Montague told CTV news.\n\nBut, with Montague, I'm not sure whether this is just another attempt by him to prove himself and his rank and file are all up front, or whether he's really willing to tackle this problem. But, when you put someone in charge of a police service, you expect that person to have their best interests at heart, and at least attempt to help those who work for him, be it in uniform or off the grid.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on is that police need better training to better deal with these issues. But what do you think? Are you surprised by the police on the ground's lack of experience in the areas they patrol every day of the week?\n\nIf you're going to be policing in the Downtown Eastside, what do you think it might take to get the police to realize that they do have a responsibility to look after and support the area's residents when it comes to drug use and dealing?",

      "The new season will be another big one for the Miami FC, as it looks to improve upon last season's record of 2-16-7. Last season Miami FC was a bit of a mismanaged team, but this season there is a lot of optimism around the team. The NASL has improved so much since 2010 when they were last in the league, but there are still some glaring holes in the overall organizational structure as well as the team itself. Miami FC is still looking for their first win, but with a strong front three, it is difficult to imagine the same scenario happening again this year.\n\nThe New Season Is In View\n\nThe Miami FC is a brand new team, and this season is their sixth in the NASL. That is a pretty huge turnover. When the team was purchased in 2013, there were only two NASL teams, with the Jacksonville Armada and San Francisco Deltas the other two. But after the league's expansion to 20 teams, the teams were all split up. Now there are three teams competing in the NASL in Miami, Ottawa, and a new, up-and-coming team in New York.\n\nIf Miami wins their first, and hopefully only one game in the NASL, then it is fair to assume that they will earn entry to the NASL playoff tournament. Then, the only question will be how far they can go in the playoffs, because only the top two teams will be playing in a playoff for a spot in the championship match.\n\nMiami has improved from last year's disastrous start, but if they want to make a playoff run, they must improve in all facets of their game. It is hard to find any weaknesses in a talented team like Miami FC, but they can certainly use some improvements in defense and goal-scoring in front of goal.\n\nA New Look for the Miami FC\n\nThis spring, in a new stadium at Miami International Airport, Miami FC has had their first real chance to show the public what their organization is all about. Miami FC is starting their second season in a brand new stadium, which should help them in a lot of ways. First off, fans will have a much better chance to see and interact with players and front office. They can actually see how the team plays, and that is something that fans in other NASL teams can't always do. The stadium itself is a lot more than just a bunch of empty seats.\n\nThere are a lot more fans than there used to be.\n\nThe stadium has been very well-tended, and there have been quite a few improvements made. This has definitely been the most aesthetically pleasing stadium that Miami FC has had. There is a bar in the end zone where fans can hang out, and there is some landscaping in front of it as well. There is a scoreboard in the corner of the stadium for players to look up to, so that they can see the score when they are out on the field. There are some new turf fields. The seats are brand new, and are more comfortable than they used to be. The seats have actually been improved for this season, and the crowd looks nicer than last season.\n\nThere are lots of other improvements that Miami FC makes on the field as well, and they have spent a lot of money this off season. This makes them not look like a scrappy struggling minor league team anymore. The new kits will not change Miami FC's look.\n\nMiami's Starting XI\n\nIt is also a little weird to see Miami FC's starting eleven in the preseason, while most teams tend to only start their first few games. It has been a long time since Miami began playing as a team, and so it feels a bit strange to see them play in a team that started up last season.\n\nCoach Alessandro Nesta has a strong track record of coaching young sides, and has been in charge of the youth teams as well as the under 20 team. Nesta is bringing something new to Miami FC, which he hasn't really done before. Miami has a lot of youth on their team, but a veteran coach that has been around the league for a while. There is an air of calm around Nesta that has impressed many young players playing for Miami FC.\n\nOne of Nesta's first things was getting players into training. The players had never spent any time with Miami FC prior to this season, and many of them have been coming to training almost every day for the first few weeks of practice. There is a sense of camaraderie and team spirit with this squad, which is a first for Miami.\n\nMidfield of the Year\n\nThe midfield was not the same last year. Miami had a big hole at the top of the midfield, and they did not find a decent replacement, although the new signings did fill that role quite nicely. This year Miami will not have that problem again, because they have signed a player that will be the first player in Miami history to play in the NASL without having played any",

Streaming content requires a lot of bandwidth, which can be expensive for the TV station. Additionally, the TV station may have contracts with cable and satellite providers that allow those companies to carry the TV station's content in exchange for a fee. If the TV station streams its content for free on its website or through a streaming service, it may violate these contracts and risk losing this source of revenue. \nAnother reason why TV stations may limit streaming is to protect their content from being pirated. If the TV station makes its content widely available for streaming, it may be more difficult to prevent unauthorized copies from being distributed online.

Dogs are domesticated animals, which means they have been bred and raised by humans for thousands of years to be our companions, not our prey. Dogs are also social animals, and they are very attuned to the body language and behavior of the humans around them. When a dog sees a human, especially a baby, it will often recognize that the human is not acting like prey, but rather like a member of the pack or a caregiver. This helps the dog understand that the human is not something to be hunted or eaten. Additionally, dogs are often fed and cared for by humans, which helps to strengthen the bond between them and reinforces the idea that humans are not a source of food.

The speed of electricity depends on the material that the current is traveling through. In some materials, the speed of electricity is very fast, while in other materials it is slower. The speed of electricity also depends on the frequency of the electrical current. In real life, the speed of electricity can have some consequences. For example, if you have an electrical device that is far away from the power source, it might take a little bit of time for the electricity to reach the device and turn it on.

      "Dollar cost averaging is a strategy that involves investing a fixed amount of money at regular intervals, regardless of the price of the investment. This can be a useful strategy when investing in a single investment, such as a mutual fund, because it can help to reduce the impact of volatility on the overall value of the investment.However, when moving investments between fund families, dollar cost averaging may not be as effective because you are essentially selling one investment and purchasing another, rather than simply adding to an existing investment. In this case, the strategy would involve selling a fixed amount of the original investment at regular intervals and using the proceeds to purchase a similar investment in a different fund family. This can be a more complex process, and it may not provide the same benefits as dollar cost averaging within a single fund.It's worth noting that there may be other considerations to take into account when moving investments between fund families, such as taxes, fees, and the specific characteristics of the new investment. It's always a good idea to consult with a financial advisor or tax professional before making any significant changes to your investment portfolio.",

You can look at a company's past earnings, as well as its earnings projections for the future, to get a sense of its financial health.Revenue: Another key factor to consider is the company's revenue. Companies that generate a lot of revenue are often more valuable than those that don't. Look at the company's revenue growth over time to get a sense of its financial performance.Dividends: If a company pays dividends, this can be a good sign that it is financially stable and able to return value to its shareholders.Valuation metrics: There are several valuation metrics that analysts use to determine the value of a stock, such as the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, the price-to-book (P/B) ratio, and the price-to-sales (P/S) ratio. These ratios compare the stock price to various financial metrics, such as earnings or book value, to determine whether the stock is overvalued or undervalued.Industry and market trends: It's also important to consider the industry and market trends when evaluating a stock. If the industry is performing well, it could be a good time to invest in the stock. On the other hand, if the industry is struggling, it might be a good idea to avoid the stock.It's important to note that these are just a few of the many factors that can impact a stock's value.

      "Factors Which Impact Barclays Bank Coursework\n\nIntroduction\n\nBarclays Bank is a leading multinational financial services provider. The bank’s core business activities include retail banking, wealth management, corporate, as well as, investment banking. The bank’s headquarters is located in London in the United Kingdom. Barclays Bank was founded over 300 years ago in UK, and has since expanded its operations to other parts of the world. Currently, the bank operates in over fifty countries across the globe. Barclays is the third largest bank in the UK by market share and the fourth largest bank in the world by asset base. The vision of the bank is “to be one of the premier globally integrated universal banks, providing superior benefits to each of its stakeholders” (Barclays Bank 2012). The firm’s commitment to realize this vision is reflected in its mission. The firm’s mission is “to help individuals, institutions and economies to progress and grow” (Barclays Bank 2012). By the end of 2011, Barclays Bank had assets worth $ 2.33 trillion. The bank serves over 48 million customers in UK and other parts of the world. Currently, Barclays Bank has more than 140,000 employees. In 2011, the firm’s income increased by 3% to 32.2 billion pounds. However, the firm’s profit before tax decreased by 3% to 5.9 billion pounds over the same period (Barclays Bank 2012). In this paper, three macro-environmental factors that influence the performance of Barclays Bank in UK will be analyzed.\n\nPESTEL Analysis\n\nPESTEL analysis is a framework for analyzing the macro-environment or the external environment of a business. The macro-environmental factors (PESTEL) include “political, economic, social, technological, environmental and legal factors” (Richards & Gilligan 2005, p. 43). Thus, PESTEL analysis examines how each of these factors influences the performance of businesses in a particular market. The analysis aims to enable businesses to take advantage of available opportunities, as well as, to mitigate the effects of threats in the industry. The macro-environmental factors can be explained as follows.\n\nPolitical factors refer to the government policies that affect businesses and the extent to which the government intervenes in the economy. The government policies that affect businesses include the tax policy, labor policy and trade restrictions (Loudon, Stevens & Wrenn 2004, p. 68). Government intervention may include price controls, provision of merit goods and bailing out financially distressed firms. Finally, political factors also include the political stability of the country.\n\nEconomic factors refer to the economic variables such as interest rates, inflation rate, as well as, exchange rate. They also include factors such as GDP growth, income per capita, unemployment and availability of credit. These factors affect the performance of businesses, as well as, the decisions made by firms (Nisbet, Thomas & Barreti 2003, pp. 245-259). For instance, interest rates affect the cost of capital. Thus, a business intending to raise capital through external sources must take into account the prevailing inertest rate.\n\nSocial factors refer to the cultural and demographic aspects of the community in which the business operates. Some of the social factors include health consciousness, attitude towards work, population growth, and level of education (Richards & Gilligan 2005, p. 44). The social factors determine the type of products and business activities that are acceptable in a particular community. They also determine the availability and productivity of employees.\n\nTechnological factors describe the influence of technology on businesses. The main technological factors include the level of research and development (R&D), internet usage, technological transfer, patents and copyrights. These factors determine the level of efficiency, barriers to market entry, innovation and productivity of individual firms (Brousseau 2002, pp. 353-374).\n\nEnvironmental factors refer to the ecological, as well as, climatic and weather changes (Richards & Gilligan 2005, p. 45). They also include natural phenomena such as volcanic activities, earthquakes and floods. The increasing awareness on the impacts of climate change has forced companies to produce environmentally friendly goods. This has resulted into the emergence of new markets, as well as, elimination of some products.\n\nLegal factors refer to the laws and regulations that guide business activities in a given country or industry (Friesner & Rosenman 2001, pp. 437-450). Such laws include consumer laws, antitrust laws, labor laws, as well as, health or safety laws. Legal factors determine the business activities that companies can engage in, and how they perform such activities.\n\nThe benefits of using PESTEL analysis include the following. First, it helps businesses to understand the growth or decline of the market, their position in the market, as well as, the threats and opportunities in the industry. Second, the results of PESTEL analysis provide useful information for strategic planning (Loudon, Stevens & Wrenn 2004, p. 73). Third, it ensures that the performance of the firm is strategically aligned to the main forces that drive change in the industry. Finally, PESTEL analysis provides important insights that inform expansion decisions. In particular, it enables businesses to avoid assumptions that can lead to failure in new markets.\n\nSome scholars criticize the application of the PESTEL model due to the following reasons. First, the usefulness of PESTEL analysis is limited due to the fact that it covers only the external environment. It ignores the internal and the competitive environment which must be considered during strategy formulation. Second, the macro-environmental factors often change rapidly, thereby making it difficult to anticipate their future impacts on businesses (Loudon, Stevens & Wrenn 2004, p. 75). Additionally, lack of information on the relevant macro-environmental factors can limit the application of the model. Finally, the assumptions associated with PESTEL analysis may limit its usefulness.\n\nMacro-environmental Factors that Affect Barclays Bank\n\nEconomic Factors\n\nAccording to nominal GDP measures, UK’s economy is the seventh largest in the world and the third largest in Europe. UK has been experiencing dismal economic growth since 2007. In 2009, the country entered a recession due to its huge public debt and the effects of the 2008/2009 global financial crisis. The government and the Bank of England took remedial measures that enabled the economy to leave the recession in January 2010. In 2011, the Bank of England reduced its lending rate to 0.5% to encourage economic growth (HM Treasury 2011, pp. 5-104). The government also implemented austerity measures and plans to reduce public borrowing to stabilize the macroeconomic environment. Consequently, GDP grew by 0.8% in 2011, while unemployment rate reduced to 8.1%. The country’s GDP per capita in 2011 was $39,604 (Sawyer 2011, pp. 13-29). UK’s inflation rate decreased from 4.2% in December 2011 to 3.6% in January 2012. These statistics indicate that UK’s economy was on a recovery path in 2011. However, the country reentered a recession in the first quarter of 2012. GDP reduced by 0.2% in the first quarter of 2012. Median income earners constitute 60% of UK’s population, while 14% of the population still lives in poverty.\n\nThe economic factors have affected Barclays Bank and the banking industry in the following ways. Currently, banks can borrow more money from the Bank of England due to the low interest rate. However, the poor economic growth has reduced the demand for loans from commercial banks such as Barclays. Additionally, the default rate has increased, thereby increasing the losses made by commercial banks (Sawyer 2011, pp. 13-29). Thus, Barclays has been forced to limit the amount of loans it can offer to avoid losses. The reduction in inflation rate is likely to stimulate demand for loans offered by Barclays. This is because interest rates tend to reduce as inflation rate reduce. Finally, the recession has reduced investor and consumer confidence in UK. Consequently, Barclays is losing its customers and investors to overseas banks. The bank is likely to make huge losses if the economic crisis in UK persists.\n\nPolitical Factors\n\nThe government of UK has been able to maintain political stability for a long time. The government of UK is based on a constitutional monarchy system. Previous governments have been able to promote political stability by upholding the rule of law and enhancing democracy. The government of UK intervenes in the economy by providing merit goods such as health care, education and infrastructure (HM Treasury 2011, pp. 5-104). For instance, in the 2011 budget, the government allocated more than 300 pounds for the construction of railway systems and enterprise zones to promote exports. The government began to implement tax reforms in 2011 to make tax compliance easier and cheaper. The government reduced the corporate tax to 26% in 2011, and intends to reduce it further to 23% by 2014 (HM Treasury 2011, pp. 5-104). The government is, currently, implementing a progressive tax system to enhance equality in income distribution. Local businesses are also supported by the government. For instance, Barclays Bank received financial assistance from the government during the 2008/ 2009 financial crisis. The current economic crisis has forced the government to implement austerity measures. This involves reducing expenditure on welfare and reducing employment in the public sector. Additionally, the government has been forced to reduce borrowing from the public to reduce its debts.\n\nThese political factors affect Barclays in the following ways. The tax reforms are an opportunity for Barclays to reduce its tax compliance costs. Additionally, the reduction in corporate tax will enable the bank to increase its after tax profit margin. The initiatives to promote economic growth by investing in infrastructure will increase demand for credit in the private sector. Thus, Barclays will have a high demand for its credit and savings products. As the government reduces its borrowing from the public sector, commercial banks such as Barclays will be left with more deposits. Thus, Barclays will be able to increase its revenue by advancing more loans. The austerity measures such as job cuts in the public sector are likely to affect Barclays Bank in a negative way (Baker 2010, pp. 3-14). This is because the demand for personal loans and deposit products such as personal savings accounts tend to decline as the level of unemployment increases.\n\nLegal Factors\n\nBusiness activities in UK are guided by an effective legal framework. An effective legal framework is needed to facilitate legitimate trade and competition. For instance, a person who fraudulently obtains money from another person can not be prosecuted if the legal system is not effective (Stone 2010). The antitrust laws ensure that businesses engage in fair and legal business practices. For instance, the antitrust laws prohibit activities such as insider trading (Stone 2010). This is because insider trading benefits investors with classified information about a company at the expense of other investors. Additionally, the antitrust laws prohibit using personal influence to prevent others from accessing services such as financial bailout from banks (Stone 2010). The consumer laws ensure that clients are supplied with safe and high quality goods. The labor laws ensure that workers in UK are not exploited by their employers. UK’s banking industry is one of the highly regulated in Europe. The high regulation began after the 2008/ 2009 financial crisis. The industry is highly regulated to prevent the collapse of banks in the event of a financial crisis (HM Treasury 2011, pp. 5-104). The regulatory capital requirement was significantly increased to enhance the stability of banks. The liquidity of banks is also regulated to stimulate investor confidence in the industry. Additionally, the governance of bank boards is subject to regulation. Risky investment products have since been prohibited. Restrictive terms and conditions for accessing loans have been introduced to reduce private debts.\n\nThe legal factors affect Barclays Bank in the following ways. The high regulatory capital requirement means that commercial banks such as Barclays can not hold investments that increase the chances of default (Eichengreen, Feldman &Liebman 2011, pp. 25-164). However, it also limits the banks’ ability to advance loans using deposits. Thus, it is a threat to Barclays’ plans to increase revenue through advancing loans. Restrictive terms and conditions for accessing personal loans also reduce the demand for Barclays’ credit products. Finally, regulating the investment products offered by commercial banks limits Barclays’ ability to develop new products.\n\nConclusion\n\nBarclays Bank is one of the leading commercial banks in UK and the rest of the world. The bank’s success is, partly, attributed to its ability to align its operations to the macro-environmental factors that drive change in the banking industry. The macro-environmental factors include “political, economic, technological, environmental, social and legal factors” (Richards & Gilligan 2005, p. 43). The impact of these factors on the performance of businesses is often assessed using the PESTEL framework. The framework enables businesses to identify the threats, as well as, the opportunities in their industries (Richards & Gilligan 2005, p. 43). The main macro-environmental factors that affect Barclays in UK include economic, legal and political factors. These factors are associated with both positive and negative effects on businesses in the banking industry. For instance, the austerity measures reduce demand for credit products, whereas the tax reforms reduce the banks’ expenses. Thus, Barclays Bank should continue to align its operations to the macro-environmental factors to take advantage of the opportunities brought by these factors and to avoid the threats associated with them.\n\nReferences\n\nBaker, D 2010, The Myth of Fiscal Austerity , Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington D.C.\n\nBarclays Bank 2012, 2011 Financial Report, Barclays Bank, London.\n\nBrousseau, E 2002, ‘The Governance of Transactions by Commercial Intermediaries: An Analysis of the Re-engineering of Intermediary by Electronic Commerce’, International Journal of the Economics of Business , vol. 9 no. 3, pp.\n\nEichengreen, B, Feldman, R & Liebman, J 2011, Public Debt: Nuts, Bolts and Worries , Center for Economic Policy Research, London.\n\nFriesner, D & Rosenman, R 2001, ‘The Property Rights Theory of the Firm and Mixed Competition: A Counter-Example in the US Health Care Industry’, International Journal of the Economics of Business , vol. 8 no. 3, pp. 437-450.\n\nHM Treasury 2011, Budget 2011 , The Stationery Office, London.\n\nLoudon, D, Stevens, R & Wrenn, B 2004, Marketing Management , Cengage Learning, New York.\n\nNisbet, P, Thomas, W & Barreti, S 2003, ‘UK Direct Investment in the United States: A Mode of entry Analysis’, International Journal of the Economics of Business , vol. 10 no. 3, pp. 245-259.\n\nRichards, S & Gilligan, W 2005, Strategic marketing Management , McGraw-Hill, New York.\n\nSawyer, M 2011, ‘UK Fiscal Policy after the Global Financial Crisis’, Contributions to Political Economy , vol. 30 no. 1, pp. 13-29.\n\nStone, O 2010, Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps.

      "Aqueous HCl Solution Preparation Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Safety precautions\n 3. Essential calculations\n 4. Mixing HCl and water\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is often necessary for a chemist to understand how to make chemical solutions to the appropriate concentration. This paper describes how a chemist can make 500 grams of a 5% aqueous hydrochloric acid (HCl) solution from a 37% (by mass) HCl stock solution.\n\nTo prepare 500 grams of a 5% aqueous HCl solution, the chemist must have some basic information about the solute and the solution. The chemist must first determine the amount of solvent and solute needed to make the solution. In particular, the chemist must determine how many liters of solvent (water) and moles of solutes (HCl) are needed to make the solution (Hill & Finster, 2010, p.90). It is worth noting that the concentration of a solution is the number of moles of a substance divided by the number of liters of the solution.\n\nSafety precautions\n\nIt is essential to take safety precautions when dealing with potentially harmful substances like concentrated HCl. The safety precautions to take while making the aqueous HCl solution include wearing protective gloves, a lab coat, and an eye protector (Nielsen, 2010, p.98). It is also important that the solvent, in this case, water, is added first before HCl is added. Adding water to concentrated HCl solution often results in a violent reaction (Hill & Finster, 2010, p.5-4), which can cause harm to the person preparing the solution. The HCl acid should also be handled carefully. In addition, an acid-resistant fume-hood should be used to carry out the mixing. In the case of acid spilling on the skin, the victim should wash the skin with a lot of water.\n\nEssential calculations\n\nIf the chemist requires 500 grams of a 5% HCl solution, the mass of HCl needed is as shown below. Note that,\n\n  * HCl / (HCl + H 2 O) 5% = 0.05grams, and\n  * HCl + H 2 O => 500 grams.\n\nTherefore, the amount of pure HCl needed is 25grams (500g * 0.05g), while the amount of water needed is 475 grams (500g – 25g). However, since the stock solution contains some water, the amount of water needed must be less than 475 grams.\n\nSince the HCl stock solution is 37% by mass and contains some water, HCl / (HCl + H 2 O) is 0.37. The amount of solution to take from the stock solution so that we can have only 25 grams of HCl is determined as follows. Let s be the hydrochloric acid (HCl) and water (H 2 O) mixture.\n\n25 / s = 0.37\n\ns = 25/0.37 = 67.57g\n\nTherefore, we should get 67.57 grams of the HCl and H 2 O mixture from the HCl stock solution. The amount of water in the 67.57g solution is 42.57 grams (67.57g – 25g). Since we have 25 grams of HCl and 42.57 grams of water from the stock solution, we only need 432.43 grams (475g – 42.57g) of additional water to make 500 grams of the 5% HCl solution.\n\nMixing HCl and water\n\nAfter taking the necessary precaution and knowing the amount of solvent (water) and solutes (HCl) needed, the next step is to do the actual mixing of HCl and water. The equipments and tools needed include a fume-hood, a volumetric flask, a beaker, and a glass funnel. The steps involved are as follows:\n\n 1. Ensure the fume-hood is efficiently ventilated and operating properly.\n 2.

      "Confronting Gender Stereotypes Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Where is our society headed?\n 3. Is it too late for change?\n 4. What are we going to do?\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne can argue that there are three major social issues plaguing America’s youth, and these are cyberbullying, addictive behaviors, and teen suicide. It is interesting to note that all these problems share common ground as indirect outcomes of how teenagers view themselves either through media representations or peer pressure. At the heart of the matter is an invisible process of shaping identities, expectations, and behavioral outcomes through male and female stereotypes. It is critically important to redefine gender concepts in order to stop the current social decline, as evidenced by the significant increase in the number of victims of violent and desperate behavior as a consequence of poor self-image. It is imperative to confront the careless use of male and female stereotypes in order to preserve decency, community, and the lives of children and teenagers.\n\nWhere is our society headed?\n\nIn the absence of an effective intervention strategy, the statistics on teen suicide, violent deaths, and addictive behaviors will continue to rise unabated. In a film entitled The Mask You Live In , the producers were able to focus the spotlight on the destructive impact of false gender conceptualization (Newsom, 2011b). The film’s purpose is to document how popular culture and mainstream media are shaping a boy’s worldview when it comes to socially accepted behavior in a world of men. It was a disheartening occasion for the viewer who valued the importance of respect and honesty, seeing images of adults pressuring boys and teenagers to disconnect from their emotions (Newsom, 2011b). Viewing the film was not a pleasant experience for those who are opposed to the practice of objectifying or degrading women. Nonetheless, the production team was able to capture the ugly truth of how boys are unconsciously trained to adopt values that are counterproductive in the long run. These young and impressionable minds were forced to accept lies about their gender.\n\nIn answering the question as to the path created by these false ideas, consider the glorification of violence as an integral part of America’s masculine culture. As a consequence, young boys and teenagers are prone to using aggression and excessive force as tools in dealing with conflicts. Men are also subconsciously trained to perceive women as mere objects that they can use. Thus, the evening news and news articles are filled with stories of sexual assault and sexual harassment cases. This is the slippery path that this particular society will fall into if a counter-movement is not initiated soon. Nonetheless, there is hope for change.\n\nIs it too late for change?\n\nIt is too early to raise the white flag and surrender the struggle, allowing the status quo to permeate the still unblemished parts of American society. Nevertheless, it is not difficult to understand why many people are thinking of giving up. In a film entitled Miss Representation , another project that was written and directed by Jennifer Newsom, the producers peeled back the covers to reveal how America’s mainstream media developed a persuasive message saying that a woman’s value and power is limited to her external appearance, youthful looks, and how attractive she is to the opposite sex (2011a). Those who are going to make a stand and make a commitment to transform this current mode of thinking are up against formidable foes, such as, the titans of the movie industry and the captains of advertising agencies, because these leaders are going to sell their products at the expense of women. These are formidable opponents. However, it is not wise to give in and give up.\n\nIt is not too late to change because of the contributions of Jennifer Newsom and people who shared the same personal values. The said filmmaker graduated with honors from the prestigious Stanford University and the equally famous Stanford Graduate School of Business. Her academic background assures her of corporate riches, and yet she decided to use her skills to make a difference in the lives of women and children. In her films, one can observe the participation of influential women known all over the world as leaders in the field of politics, mass media, and business. They inspire ordinary people to take up the challenge and do something to change the status quo.\n\nWhat are we going to do?\n\nIt is high time to confront the destructive practice of shaping worldviews through male and female stereotypes. However, improve the probability of success by arming the attack with intelligent strategies. One of the pragmatic ways to change the minds of people is to educate them and reveal to them how films, advertising campaigns, and mainstream media are shaping their core values when it comes to the way they perceive men and women. A good example was the project sponsored by a social media entity popularly known as BuzzFeed. In the said endeavor, four women were given a chance to undergo a professional makeover, and this process required the application of skills from makeup artists and photoshop experts (Gilkey, 2014). Through this project, young women received a powerful education with regard to how the mass media use tools and tricks to create fantasies. In other words, people are now aware of the truth behind the glossy magazine covers.\n\nIt is also a sign of an effective strategy to widen the base of support and encourage the participation of men and women from all walks of life. One of the best ways to achieve this goal is to use humor in the presentation of an inherently serious message. In a video shared through an alternative media site, serious topics like women’s ideal weight and body-hugging clothes were reduced to humorous lines, such as, “all that I am don’t fit prettily in polyester and spandex” and wanting to be a vampire in order not to see the flaws on the mirror’s reflection (Warren, 2013). Humor draws people in and ensures a wider reception of the intended message.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerica is headed into an era filled with the stories of the broken lives of young boys and young girls as a result of violent confrontations, brutal murders, teen suicide, drug addiction, and fragile self-esteem if no one dares to confront the careless use of gender stereotypes. There is still time to turn things around, as evidenced by projects, films, and alternative media presentations exposing the truth behind the subconscious shaping of minds and identities through mass media and peer pressure. However, it is best to confront the current mode of thinking and unmask the evil consequences of male and female stereotypes through intelligent methods. It is prudent to use well-crafted strategies that are also enhanced by humor in order to ensure a wider reception of the intended message.\n\nReferences\n\nGilkey, M. (2014).

      "Organizational Behavior: Family/Work Conflict Research Paper\n\nHow can we prevent ourselves from facing work/ family problems?\n\nWork-life conflicts give rise to significant negative effects and it is therefore important to try reducing this conflicts. One way through which we can reduce work-family conflict is by setting boundaries. Such a strategy will involve a person taking steps to reduce the forces that interfere with their plans at home and at work.\n\nFor example, one could set boundaries as to how much time should be spent at work. Any thing which interferes with this boundary should be identified and appropriate measures taken to stop it.\n\nHowever, this strategy will require the support of the organization where a person works since without the support of the organization, the boundaries set by the employee will not be respected and the whole strategy will fail.\n\nAnother approach for reducing work-family conflict is by talking about family issues with fellow employees. While it would seem that isolating home issues from work is the best approach, the fact is that people spend significant amount of their time at work and they form good relationships with their work mates.\n\nDiscussing family situations with co-workers will therefore be beneficial for a person since these colleagues will be able to empathize and assist a person to achieve work goals especially when the family responsibilities are great.\n\nSince most work-family conflicts are caused by rigid working hours, adopting flexible working hours can lower the conflicts. This is because flexible working hours give a person a sense of control and they are able to schedule their lives such that balance is achieved between family and work.\n\nIn addition to this, flexible working hours increase the level of job satisfaction and reduce the amount of stress experienced by the worker therefore reducing work-family conflict.\n\nTo reduce burnout, the worker should avoid putting in too many hours at work especially when it is not mandatory. Most people work overtime so that they can make more money or in order to gain promotions. Others put in more time since there is a common misconception that the person who spends a lot of time in the workplace is more committed to the organization.\n\nHowever, this is not true and the amount of time spend at work is not an indication of commitment or employee productivity. By ensuring that you do not overwork yourself, you will avoid burnout and reduce work-family conflict.\n\nThe organization can assist in reducing burnout by providing enough resources to the staff. Assigning work fairly and equitably to the employees so that there is no work overload will fulfill this goal and therefore prevent work-family problems.\n\nConsequences of work/ family conflict\n\nConflicts between work and family responsibilities have a number of adverse consequences for the individual and the place he works. To begin with, these conflicts result in an increase in stress and burnout by the employee. As organizations seek to get the most from their workers, they are constantly expecting employees to put in more work hours.\n\nThis is normally at the expense of time which would be used for non-work related issues. This causes a work-life imbalance that leads to high stress levels as the individual attempts to complete the increasing work load in time all the while foregoing his out of work obligations.\n\nHaving to work overtime causes the employee to burnout since they do may not have enough time to rest. Stress and burnout are conditions that decrease the productivity of the employee since they result in cognitive difficulties such as decreased concentration, reduced alertness, and trouble staying awake.\n\nWork/family conflicts cause lower job satisfaction since the quality of work environment is not seen as conducive by the employee. When job satisfaction is low, the worker is more likely to have reduced commitment to the organization.\n\nLack of commitment will lead to the employee not making enough effort to achieve the goals and objectives of the organization. Employees who have low commitment have high rates of absenteeism and reduced performance.\n\nIn addition to this, the low job satisfaction which is caused by work-family conflict will increase the employee turnover rate. High turnover rates are costly to the organization since they will have to incur the costs of recruiting and training new personnel to fill in the vacated positions.\n\nWork life conflicts also damage personal relationships that the person has with his family and friends. By dedicating too much time to work as a result of personal ambition or an increasing workload, the amount of time given to relationships is reduced.\n\nThis hampers the growth of these relationships and one can end up feeling left out or out of touch with the people they love. For married couples with children, the effect of work-family imbalance is even worse.\n\nThe children will not enjoy a balanced upbringing since one or both of their parents will be held up at work and when they are not, they will be exhibiting stress. The lack of time may also lead to divorce since the married couple will grow out of touch.\n",
      "Summary of Interview with John (Fire Station Chief) Essay\n\nInterview with Senior Manager\n\nSummary of Interview with John (Fire Station Chief)\n\nThe first interviewee was the Chief of a fire department. Concerning his day-to-day work, the Chief reported that most of his work revolves around financial management and allocation of the resources of the fire department and ensuring that the firefighters in the department receive proper training.\n\nThe Chief reported that the most critical problem facing the department is safety. The firefighters’ job is very risky. The third question asked about the skills needed to succeed in the line of work. The manager’s response related to the skills needed to be a firefighter, and not a manager.\n\nThe fourth question dealt with the reasons why some people have failed in the line of work. The Chief said that those who fail in the line of work do not have the patience to learn and grown in the trade. In the fifth question, the Chief pointed out that the most important skill needed to be the manager of the fire department is the ability to solve problems. In the final question, the Chief said the qualities he would look for in someone meant to replace him are openness, availability, and a hands-on approach to work.\n\nManagement Functions\n\nThe four management functions of planning, controlling, organizing, strategizing in the Chief’s line of work are clear. The Chief is in charge of planning for the operations of the department. He ensures that there are resources for use in the operations of the fire department.\n\nIn the area of controlling, it is up to him to ensure that the financial resources given to the department are sufficient to run the department for a given period. The Chief said that the money given to the department mainly goes to the payroll, which accounts for ninety percent of the department’s expenses.\n\nOrganizing the department is also part of the Chief’s work. He is responsible for planning to ensure that all the activities of the fire department take place in an organized manner. Finally, the Chief is in charge of strategizing regarding the operations of the department. He determines the number of staff needed and he finds the best way to meet the shortfall based on his experience as a firefighter.\n\nSimilarities and Differences to Other Managers\n\nThe fire station Chief is responsible for higher level thinking for the entire department. The issues the Chief raises cut across the operations of the entire department. In this sense, his work is different from the work of the other managers. The main similarity between the Chief’s work and that of other managers is that they all work with people.\n\nThis means that it is the job of all managers interviewed to supervise, to motivate, and to organize resources and staff to achieve departmental goals. The unique role that a senior manager plays shows in the high scores the Chief gave to the functional aspects of management that he handles. His scores are the highest in all categories compared to the other two managers.\n\nInterview with Middle Level Manager\n\nSummary of Interview\n\nThe second interview was with Sarah, who is the Assistant Dean of Academic Services in the School of Business. Sarah reports to the Dean, but the school’s staff report to her. In this sense, she is a middle level manager. When asked about how her typical day looks like, Sarah pointed out that her work varies a lot to the extent that it is difficult to have a clear picture of what a typical day looks like.\n\nShe said what she does depend on the time of the year. During the registration period, spends a lot of time discussing majors, internships, and solving problems related to the registration of students. At other times, she does exam assessments and grading of papers. The most critical problem Sarah faces is dealing with issues requiring the intervention of a parent or a guardian.\n\nIn many cases, the person responsible for taking care of the student is never aware of what the student is going through. Sarah finds herself bridging this gap very often. Sara pointed out three skills needed to succeed in her line of work. First, one must be a good listener because different people come with different sorts of problems. Secondly, one must know how to delegate.\n\nOther people can solve some problems more effectively, and it is impossible to handle all the needs that come your way. Thirdly, one must know how to take charge in situations. Sarah pointed out that those who fail in her position are poor listeners. She added that they are also rude and that they are oblivious of what is going on around them.\n\nThe job needs someone engaged with the issues. When asked about the skills needed to succeed in her job, Sarah said that the job requires a team player because of the need to refer people to other places. She also added that it is very important to be a good listener. The two skills Sarah would pass on to someone that should replace her are the ability to organize oneself, and the requirement to be kind to all people.\n\nManagement Functions\n\nSarah’s involvement in the four management functions of planning, controlling, organizing, and strategizing are as follows. Her need to plan revolves around her work. The workload on her desk requires someone who can effectively plan her time. She has fewer powers to control what happens in the school because the dean sets the standards for control.\n\nHowever, she plays an important role in implementing the controls and ensuring that everything goes according to the overall plan. Sarah does a lot of work that involves organizing issues. Arranging for internships and meeting student to discuss majors requires a person to have a high ability to organize operations. On the issue of strategizing, Sarah participates in meetings that develop strategy for the operations of the School of Business. Therefore, she is part of the team that develops strategies for the School of Business\n\nSimilarities and Differences to Other Managers\n\nSarah as a middle level manager reports to the Dean. She has people working under her, while she works under someone. She has a higher degree of independence in the execution of her work compared to Jesse, the low-level manager. However, she does not have much say about financial management priorities of the organization. Sarah scored moderately high on the specific aspects of management that her work demands. Her scores were lower than the Chief’s buy higher than Jesse’s scores.\n\nInterview with Low-Level Manager\n\nManagement Functions\n\nThe person interviewed as a low-level manager is Jesse, who is the Director of Global Education. In the first question, Jesse said that most of the work she does revolve around talking to current and prospective international students who need clarifications of various kinds. She also attends many meetings related to her work. Jesse’s response to the second question, about her most critical challenge at work, was managing the budget.\n\nShe said that she must do a lot of work, but that the work must be within budget. The third question in the interview was about the critical skills needed to succeed in her line of work. The skills listed by Jesse were communication skills, motivational skills and mentorship skills. The need for good communication skills come from the nature of work in the office. She has to communicate with current and prospective international students on a regular basis.\n\nShe also has to communicate with her superiors and colleagues in meetings. As a low-level manager, Jesse has a high need to motivate her team and to mentor the team. She depends on her team to handle the workload effectively hence the need to keep the morale high. She also needs to ensure that they are becoming better at what they are doing in order to achieve the best results. Managers in Jesse’s position fail because of stress and burnout, the workload is very distributed.\n\nTherefore, a manager can easily feel overwhelmed by the number of issues to handle. Jesse also pointed out that those who fail have poor delegation skills, or are not willing to delegate some of the work. When asked about the outstanding skill other managers in her position have, Jesse said that the ability to trust team members, ability to mentor them, and good project management skills count. The main things Jesse would stress to someone who she is training to replace her is to follow laid down departmental rules and procedures.\n\nManagement Functions\n\nAn evaluation of the Jesse’s involvement in the four management functions of planning, controlling, organizing, and strategizing reveal the following. First, she has a very important role to play in the planning of the operations of the department. She is in charge of the delivery of the mandate of the Global Education Department hence the need to plan well. Secondly, she exercises a lot of control in relation to the work of the subordinates in the department.\n\nHowever, she does not have much say in budgetary allocations. Her role in organizing the operations of the department is also very important. As the department head, she must make sure that all members of staff are doing the right things to cover their work quota. Finally, she has an important responsibility in the development of strategy. Her role in the development of strategy is to figure out how to execute the mandate of the department based on the goals provided by senior administrators in the institution.\n\nSimilarities and Differences to Other Managers\n\nJesse work is similar to the other managers in the area of people management. However, she has a more task oriented job description as shown by the clarity of her day-to-day work. In addition, she says that the best way to handle the work she does is by following the rules and sticking to the departmental policy.\n\nShe works more as an executor of strategy rather than a developer of the strategy. Compared to the Fire Station Chief, she has few options related to sourcing for financing and determining the staffing rules. Jesse had the lowest scores in management functions.\n",

      "[There's a version of this post with calculations on nbviewer!]\n\nI asked some people on Twitter what they wanted to understand about statistics, and someone asked:\n\n\"How do I decide how big of a sample size I need for an experiment?\"\n\nFlipping a coin\n\nI'll do my best to answer, but first let's do an experiment! Let's flip a coin ten times.\n\n> flip_coin(10) heads 7 tails 3\n\nOh man! 70% were heads! That's a big difference.\n\nNOPE. This was a random result! 10 as a sample size is way too small to decide that. What about 20?\n\n> flip_coin(20) heads 13 tails 7\n\n65% were heads! That is still a pretty big difference! NOPE. What about 10000?\n\n> flip_coin(10000) heads 5018 tails 4982\n\nThat's very close to 50%.\n\nSo what we've learned already, without even doing any statistics, is that if you're doing an experiment with two possible outcomes, and you're doing 10 trials, that's terrible. If you do 10,000 trials, that's pretty good, and if you see a big difference, like 80% / 20%, you can almost certainly rely on it.\n\nBut if you're trying to detect a small difference like 50.3% / 49.7%, that's not a big enough difference to detect with only 10,000 trials.\n\nSo far this has all been totally handwavy. There are a couple of ways to formalize our claims about sample size. One really common way is by doing hypothesis testing. So let's do that!\n\nLet's imagine that our experiment is that we're asking people whether they like mustard or not. We need to make a decision now about our experiment.\n\nStep 1: make a null hypothesis\n\nLet's say that we've talked to 10 people, and 7⁄ 10 of them like mustard. We are not fooled by small sample sizes and we ALREADY KNOW that we can't trust this information. But your brother is arguing \"7⁄ 10 seems like a lot! I like mustard! I totally believe this!\". You need to argue with him with MATH.\n\nSo we're going to make what's called a \"null hypothesis\", and try to disprove it. In this case, let's make the null hypothesis \"there's a 50⁄ 50 chance that a given person likes mustard\".\n\nSo! What's the probability of seeing an outcome like 7⁄ 10 if the null hypothesis is true? We could calculate this, but we have a computer and I think it's more fun to use the computer.\n\nSo let's pretend we ran this experiment 10,000 times, and the null hypothesis was true. We'd expect to sometimes get 10⁄ 10 mustard likers, sometimes 0/10, but mostly something in between. Since we can program, let's run the asking-10-people experiment 10,000 times!\n\nI programmed it, and here are the results:\n\n0 7 1 102 2 444 3 1158 4 2002 5 2425 6 2094 7 1176 8 454 9 127 10 11\n\nOr, on a pretty graph:\n\nOkay, amazing. The next step is:\n\nStep 2: Find out the probability of seeing an outcome this unlikely or more if the null hypothesis is true\n\nThe \"this unlikely or more\" part is key: we don't want to know the probability of seeing exactly 7⁄ 10 mustard-likers, we want to know the probability of seeing 7⁄ 10 or 8⁄ 10 or 9⁄ 10 or 10⁄ 10 .\n\nSo if we add up all the times when 7⁄ 10 or more people liked mustard by looking at our table, that's about 1700 times, or 17% of the time.\n\nWe could also calculate the exact probabilities, but this is pretty close so we won't. The way this kind of hypothesis testing works is that you only reject the null hypothesis if the probability of seeing this data if it's true is really low. So here the probability of seeing this data if the null hypothesis is true is 17%. 17% is pretty high, (1⁄ 6 !), so we won't reject it. This value (0.17) is called a p-value by statisticians. We won't say that word again here though. Usually you want this to be more like 1% or 5%.\n\nWe've really quickly arrived at\n\nStep 3: Decide whether or not to reject the null hypothesis\n\nIf we see that 7⁄ 10 people like mustard, we can't reject it! If we'd instead seen that 10⁄ 10 of our survey respondants liked mustard, that would be a totally different story! The",
      "RELATED APPLICATIONS\n\nThe present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application Ser. No. 60/955,577, filed Aug. 13, 2007, which is expressly incorporated herein in its entirety by reference.\n\nBACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION\n\n1. The Field of the Invention\n\nThe present invention relates to a method and system for assessing brain functionality. More specifically, the present invention relates to a method for utilizing magnetic resonance imaging to monitor brain activity in order to assess brain functionality and damage to the brain.\n\n2. State of the Art\n\nMagnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is used to detect tissue damage. MRI technology is important to the medical field because, while X-ray or CT imaging are more sensitive to detection of bone or hard tissues, MRI is sensitive to the soft tissues of the body and can differentiate between different adjacent tissues. Thus, MRI has been used to detect tissue damage by detecting the differences between damaged and healthy tissue, such as the increase in fluids often present in a damaged tissue\n\nClinical neuropsychology is a specialty of psychology which specializes in the assessment and treatment of patients with brain injury or neurocognitive deficits. Neuropsychologists have used brain-behavior relationships to determine whether impairment is present. The neuropsychologist will test skills such as reasoning, learning/recall, attention/concentration, perception, sensation, language processes, and controlled/directed movement to determine the person's ability to perform these skills, and thus determine impairment.\n\nIn order to accurately and consistently determine impairment, a number of neuropsychological tests and assessments have been developed which are designed to evaluate the cognitive abilities of a person, and thus determine the presence and degree of impairment. These tests may include memory assessment scales, verbal learning tests, continuous performance task, decision making tests, sorting tests, etc. The tests are standardized and statistical information for the test performance of a large number of persons is typically available. As such, the tests are designed to allow the treating neuropsychologist to observe the performance of the patient in taking the test and compare the patient's performance with that of the general population to determine if the person has impaired brain functioning for the tested skills.\n\nWhile useful in detecting and assessing brain injury or mental impairment, the existing tests and methods have drawbacks. MRI scans, for example, are useful in detecting unusual tissues such as tumors or scars or tissues which show edema or other structural damage to the tissue. Conventional MRI scans, however, are not useful in detecting impaired brain functionality where the brain tissues do not manifest physical damage.\n\nThe standard paper and pencil neuropsychological tests used to determine a person's cognitive abilities, and thus to determine if any impairment is present, are also limited in their abilities to properly diagnose brain impairment. The tests used for evaluation do not measure brain functionality, but measure the ability to perform predetermined tasks and brain functionality is inferred therefrom. As such, the tests are not able to determine if a low level of performance or cognitive ability is the result of an injury, or is simply the result of a lack or education or experience or even the result of a person's deliberate attempt to achieve a low score in order to receive a benefit such as a disability benefit or medical leave. Additionally, these tests rely on human perception of performance and determination of any impairment, and are thus subject to human errors.\n\nIt would be desirable in many cases to directly measure brain functionality instead of observing a person's abilities to therefrom infer brain functionality. Such may be the case where a worker is claiming an injury affecting the brain and requesting benefits or compensation, where a soldier is claiming a battle injury or shell shock, etc. has caused impairment. In these cases, persons may be motivated to achieve low testing scores as they desire to receive a benefit. In such a situation the ability to measure and observe the brain functionality instead of simply observing the performance of tasks may allow the treating neuropsychologist to better determine if brain injury and impairment is actually present.\n\nIt would also be desirable to directly measure brain functionality where a person is being treated for an injury or impairment. Typically, the purpose of diagnosing and assessing a brain injury or impairment is to provide a treatment suited to correcting the condition. The treatment may involve surgery, drugs, physical or mental exercises, etc. Where a person is being treated, it is typically desirable to determine whether the treatment is effective or not. It would thus be desirable to be able to directly monitor brain functioning before and during or after the treatment to determine the effectiveness of the treatment. Similarly, it would be desirable in a variety of situations to periodically monitor a person's brain functionality in order to track improvement or deterioration of brain functionality.\n\nIt is thus desirable to have a system and testing methods which allows direct observation of a patient's brain functions instead of only allowing observation of the patients ability to perform a task.\n\nSUMMARY OF THE INVENTION\n\nIt is an object of the present invention to provide an improved method",
      "Prototypes of the high-flying Bouyant Air Turbine. Images: Altaeros\n\nIn far-flung rural Alaska, where electricity can cost as much as $1 per kilowatt hour—more than 10 times the national average, according to the New York Times—a wind turbine encased in a giant helium balloon is about to break a world record. The Bouyant Air Turbine (BAT) is about to be floated 1,000 feet into the air in the name of cleaner, cheaper, and mobile energy. That single airborne object—sort of a hybrid of a blimp, a kite, and a turbine—will power over a dozen homes.\n\nThe BAT is the brainchild of Altaeros, a company founded by MIT alumni, and, if everything goes according to plan, it's going to be the highest-flying power generator in history.\n\nFloating turbines high up in the air, where wind speeds are greater, isn't a new concept. \"It's known that wind speed increases with altitude above ground level, and power density increases with a cubic factor of wind speed,\" Altaeros co-founder Adam Rein told me in an email. \"Roughly speaking, a doubling of wind speed equates to an eight-fold increase in wind power density. Conventional turbine manufacturers are also trying to reach higher heights because of this fact—though not as high as our turbine.\"\n\nMakani Power, which was acquired by Google last year, may have done most of the legwork in popularizing the high-altitude turbine. But Altaeros is looking to push the boundaries of where and how high-flying turbines can be deployed right now.\n\n\"The immediate benefit to our customers is generating low-cost, clean electricity in place of expensive, dirty fossil fuel,\" Rein said. The company is aiming to deploy its turbines in remote areas, hard-to-reach areas that currently rely on expensive diesel generators or costly patchwork grids—in those markets, the BAT can be the cheapest, easiest source of power.\n\nAltaeros floats its BATs using a helium-filled inflatable shell that resembles a soaring open-mouthed grouper. Since winds blow stronger and more consistently the higher above the ground you go, and the hovering BAT harnesses that gale and sends electricity down to earth through the high-strength tethers that also hold the machine steady.\n\n\"The BAT has an automatic controller, which adjusts the attitude and altitude of the BAT, through winches on the ground station, in order to maximize power capture, flight stability, and limit loads on the structure,\" Rein claimed. \"The BAT is fully capable of operating autonomously, without the need of a ground crew to launch or land the system.\" The device can deliver two to three times more power than a conventional turbine, Rein said. And it costs a lot less to install.\n\nThe company expects to be able to offer electricity for 18 cents per kilowatt hour; that's a lot more than the national average of 11.6 cents. But it's definitely cheaper than available options in places like Hawaii (where the average is a whopping 37 cents per kwh) and the aforementioned Alaska, and it gets pretty close to densely populated California, where a residents' average power bill comes out to 16 cents per kwh.\n\nRein noted that the BAT \"will also remove the logistical headaches caused by complex fuel supply chains, or transporting and installing large wind towers over rough terrain.\" He also imagines it will be useful for industrial operations, like mining or resource extraction, and for acting as giant hotspots, too. \"The BAT's shell also offers the opportunity to lift additional payload equipment—internet, phone, and imaging devices—that can offer customers an additional stream of revenue.\"\n\nObstacles remain, to be sure. \"The largest barrier to implementation right now is the need for a product that is reliable in all weather conditions for long periods of time,\" Rein said. He noted that the \"FAA will play an important role in the approval of our product.\" It's already approved a draft policy allowing the BAT to take flight, but the prospect of a multitude of floating wind turbines sprouting up in remote areas around the nation certainly calls for a cohesive regulatory framework.\n\nAnd do expect to see more skyward turbines in coming years. Some scientists have argued that we could meet the entire world's energy demand if we were able to harness the hugely powerful jet stream. That number's since been revised, but they believe there's a massive reservoir of usable energy just waiting to be tapped high up in the sky. Altaeros may be the first to bring some of it back down to earth.",

      "Introduction\n\nPerl is a general-purpose programming language. It became really popular for web programming in the 1990s, but it can be just as useful for many other general programming tasks. Perl borrows heavily from a number of other programming languages, and it has also been heavily influenced by Unix/Linux utilities like awk and sed. In this tutorial, we will cover enough Perl that you will be able to write simple but useful programs.\n\nIf you want to impress people in the Perl community, then you should never refer to the language as \"PERL\". Perl is not an acronym (although possible expansions like \"Practical Extraction and Reporting Language\" and \"Pathologically Eclectic Rubbish Lister\" are often retrofitted to the name).\n\nGetting Started\n\nTo write and run Perl programs, you need two things: a Perl compiler and an editor. If you're using a Mac or a machine running Linux, then Perl will already be installed on your system.\n\nHowever, if you're using Windows then you'll need to install Perl. There are a few versions of Perl available for Windows. The one that most people seem to recommend is Strawberry Perl, which you can get from http://strawberryperl.com/. It is distributed as a standard Windows software installation file (an .msi file) so you will be able to install it easily.\n\nOnce you have Perl installed, it is simple to check that it is working correctly. Just bring up a terminal window (in Windows that's CMD.EXE ) and run perl -v to see which version of Perl is installed. Hopefully, it will be something pretty recent (say, 5.14 or newer) but don't worry if it's older than that – all of the code we'll be writing this tutorial will run on versions as old as 5.10.\n\nYou will also need an editor to write your Perl programs. Any basic text editor will do, but as you get more proficient at programming you'll find a proper programmers' editor will be very useful. Many Perl programmers use something like vi or Emacs. These editors both have quite steep learning curves, so you might feel more comfortable starting with something like Padre, which you can download from http://padre.perlide.org/.\n\nYour First Perl Program\n\nIt's traditional that your first program in any language should print the words \"Hello world\". So that's what we will do. Open your editor and type in the following:\n\nprint \"Hello world\n\n\"; 1 print \"Hello world\n\n\" ;\n\nSave the file as hello.pl and run it by typing perl hello.pl on your command line. You should see the text \"Hello world\". If it doesn't work, then the most likely problem is that you aren't running the command from the directory where you saved the program. Find the directory where the hello.pl file is and try running the command from there.\n\nThere's not much to explain here. We have a single line of code, and it calls a built-in Perl function called print . You can probably guess what print does: it takes a string and displays that string on the screen. In this case, we pass it the string \"Hello world\n\n\" and that is what we see on our screen. If you have used pretty much any other modern programming language, you will recognise the final two characters in that string (the\n\n) as a character sequence that is almost universally recognised as meaning a new line character. Try removing it from your string and see what difference it makes when you run the program.\n\nIn many other languages, you would need to put parentheses around the string that you pass to Perl – print(\"Hello world\n\n\") – this also works, but Perl programmers tend to omit non-essential punctuation.\n\nThere is another way to write the same program. In fact, there are many other ways (one of Perl's mottos is \"There's more than one way to do it\") but we will only cover one more here. Try putting the the following in a file called hello2.pl and running it:\n\nuse feature 'say'; say 'Hello world'; 1 2 use feature 'say' ; say 'Hello world' ;\n\nIf your version of Perl is 5.10 or greater, then this code will do the same as the previous version (if you have an earlier version, you will get a syntax error and you should really think about updating your version of Perl).\n\nThe new function say was added in Perl 5.10. It is a shortcut version of print which always adds the new line to the string that it prints. It is a feature that needs to be turned on explicitly, which is why we have the use feature line before it. You will often see use statements in a Perl program (the same keyword is used to load external libraries) and it is traditional to put them all near",

      "3\n\n\nSummary by Alexander Jung 11 months ago ### What is BN: * Batch Normalization (BN) is a normalization method/layer for neural networks. * Usually inputs to neural networks are normalized to either the range of [0, 1] or [-1, 1] or to mean=0 and variance=1. The latter is called *Whitening*. * BN essentially performs Whitening to the intermediate layers of the networks. ### How its calculated: * The basic formula is $x^* = (x - E[x]) / \\sqrt{\\text{var}(x)}$, where $x^*$ is the new value of a single component, $E[x]$ is its mean within a batch and `var(x)` is its variance within a batch. * BN extends that formula further to $x^{**} = gamma * x^* +$ beta, where $x^{**}$ is the final normalized value. `gamma` and `beta` are learned per layer. They make sure that BN can learn the identity function, which is needed in a few cases. * For convolutions, every layer/filter/kernel is normalized on its own (linear layer: each neuron/node/component). That means that every generated value (\"pixel\") is treated as an example. If we have a batch size of N and the image generated by the convolution has width=P and height=Q, we would calculate the mean (E) over `N*P*Q` examples (same for the variance). ### Theoretical effects: * BN reduces *Covariate Shift*. That is the change in distribution of activation of a component. By using BN, each neuron's activation becomes (more or less) a gaussian distribution, i.e. its usually not active, sometimes a bit active, rare very active. * Covariate Shift is undesirable, because the later layers have to keep adapting to the change of the type of distribution (instead of just to new distribution parameters, e.g. new mean and variance values for gaussian distributions). * BN reduces effects of exploding and vanishing gradients, because every becomes roughly normal distributed. Without BN, low activations of one layer can lead to lower activations in the next layer, and then even lower ones in the next layer and so on. ### Practical effects: * BN reduces training times. (Because of less Covariate Shift, less exploding/vanishing gradients.) * BN reduces demand for regularization, e.g. dropout or L2 norm. (Because the means and variances are calculated over batches and therefore every normalized value depends on the current batch. I.e. the network can no longer just memorize values and their correct answers.) * BN allows higher learning rates. (Because of less danger of exploding/vanishing gradients.) * BN enables training with saturating nonlinearities in deep networks, e.g. sigmoid. (Because the normalization prevents them from getting stuck in saturating ranges, e.g. very high/low values for sigmoid.) ![MNIST and neuron activations](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/aleju/papers/master/neural-nets/images/Batch_Normalization__performance_and_activations.png?raw=true \"MNIST and neuron activations\") *BN applied to MNIST (a), and activations of a randomly selected neuron over time (b, c), where the middle line is the median activation, the top line is the 15th percentile and the bottom line is the 85th percentile.* ------------------------- ### Rough chapter-wise notes * (2) Towards Reducing Covariate Shift * Batch Normalization (*BN*) is a special normalization method for neural networks. * In neural networks, the inputs to each layer depend on the outputs of all previous layers. * The distributions of these outputs can change during the training. Such a change is called a *covariate shift*. * If the distributions stayed the same, it would simplify the training. Then only the parameters would have to be readjusted continuously (e.g. mean and variance for normal distributions). * If using sigmoid activations, it can happen that one unit saturates (very high/low values). That is undesired as it leads to vanishing gradients for all units below in the network. * BN fixes the means and variances of layer inputs to specific values (zero mean, unit variance). * That accomplishes: * No more covariate shift. * Fixes problems with vanishing gradients due to saturation. * Effects: * Networks learn faster. (As they don't have to adjust to covariate shift any more.) * Optimizes gradient flow in the network. (As the gradient becomes less dependent on the scale of the parameters and their initial values.) *",

      "Extraction is a small JavaScript library for extracting object trees from arbitrary object graphs. Object graphs usually have cycles and contain many information. Hence, the clue is that the extracted object trees use links to break object reference cycles and can be just partial by leaving out non-requested information. The tree extraction is controlled with a custom JSON-style query language. The object tree is structurally derived from the object graph, but contains no references to the original objects and hence can be further mutated by the caller. The Extraction library is intended for two main use cases: primarily, to support the generation of responses in REST APIs based on object graphs (where the cycle problem and the partial information problem has to be resolved) and, secondarily, to support the persisting and restoring of arbitrary in-memory object graph structures (where the cycle problem has to be resolved, too). See the Github source code for more documentation and download options via NPM and Bower.",

      "Host Bindings Proposal for WebAssembly\n\nMotivation\n\nWebAssembly currently in practice relies on a substantial amount of support from JavaScript + Web APIs to be useful on the Web. Interoperability with JavaScript and Web APIs will help make WebAssembly in practice more \"of the Web\" while improving performance and ergonomics. Bindings for non-Web hosts embeddings are also relevant.\n\nGoals / Non-Goals\n\nGoals:\n\nErgonomics - Allow WebAssembly modules to create, pass around, call, and manipulate JavaScript + DOM objects.\n\nSpeed - Allow JS/DOM or other host calls to be well optimized.\n\nPlatform Consistency - Allow WebIDL to be used to annotate Wasm imports / exports (via a tool).\n\nIncrementalism - Provide a strategy that is polyfillable.\n\nNon-Goals:\n\nProvide a general purpose managed object solution.\n\nCover functionality better carved off Managed Objects in the Anyref proposal.\n\nNo support for anything not expressible in JS/Host objects, such as concurrent access.\n\nBasic Approach\n\nAssume the separate Anyref proposal will allow direct handling of host objects. This will include: Allows host objects in: locals, globals, stack slots, and arguments. Allow multiple Tables to be imported. This will allow indirect indexed access to host objects. Extend WebAssembly.Table { element : elemType} to allow elemType to be `anyref'.\n\nAdd a \"Host Bindings\" section to WebAssembly modules. Describes conversion steps for imports + exports that: Allows unsigned conversion. Allows invocation of constructors. Allows invocation of bound methods.\n\n\nDetails\n\nA subsection will list a series of IMPORT bindings:\n\nStructure of an Import Binding\n\nField Description Import index Function with extra conversions Function Mode Style of function call: function / new / method invocation. n x Argument Bindings List of description of how each argument is handled. Return Type Description of how the return type is handled.\n\nImport Function Modes\n\nMode Description CALL_FUNCTION Treated as a normal function call. CALL_NEW Calls function as if called as: new func(...). Return type must be OBJECT_HANDLE. CALL_THIS Treats the first argument as a 'this' reference to bind the call to.\n\nImport Argument Binding Types\n\nA series of binding conversion operations for each import argument (calling from Wasm-to-Host), taken from:\n\nType Description Arguments PASS_THRU Leaves the argument in the current type. U32 Treats the next argument as an u32 (must have i32 type)\n\nJavaScript hosts might additionally provide:\n\nType Description Arguments STRING Converts the next two arguments from a pair of i32s to a utf8 string. It treats the first as an address in linear memory of the string bytes, and the second as a length. ARRAY_BUFFER Converts the next two arguments from a pair of i32s to an ArrayBufferView. It treats the first as an address in linear memory of the array view bytes, and the second as a length. JSON Converts the next two arguments from a pair of i32s to JSON. It treats the first as an address in linear memory of the json bytes, and the second as a length. Parses this region as if it has been passed to JSON.parse(). STRING_IMMEDIATE Encodes a string in this section, passed as an argument, but does not consume an actual function argument.\n\nImport Return Value Binding Types\n\nA binding conversion for the return type (Host-to-Wasm), taken from:\n\nType Description Arguments PASS_THRU Leaves the return value in the current type\n\nJavaScript hosts might additionally provide:\n\nType Description Arguments STRING Calls a passed ALLOC_MEM function to reserve destination space, copies in the bytes, and provides the address of the i32 allocation as the return value. index of an allocation function ARRAY_BUFFER Calls a passed ALLOC_MEM function to reserve destination space, copies in the bytes, and provides the address of the i32 allocation as the return value.

      "Setting And Using Emacs In Three Columns\n\nI run Emacs fullscreen and have enough room for three buffers next to each other, the first two being 80-character wide and the last one being 74-character wide.\n\nSetting this up correctly took me a few years. I did it incrementally. First I used C-x 3 manually. Then I automated the process of splitting. After a while I noticed how painful some tasks where. For instance, the *compilation* window would use any column in a seemingly random fashion, or maybe even split an existing one in half, screwing the whole layout. I also noticed that it was very convenient to be able to swap or clone columns.\n\nI finally have something I am confortable with. You can download it here. I will explain its features and how I use it. I will also go into the code in details, to serve as a tutorial.\n\nQuick Start\n\nFile s3c.el provides s3c :\n\n(provide 's3c)\n\nSo all you have to do is put s3c.el next to other .el files and add the following to your .emacs :\n\n(require 's3c \"s3c\" 'noerror)\n\nThe 'noerror option ensures that if s3c.el is not installed, Emacs will not complain. This makes it easier to copy your .emacs to another computer.\n\nIf you are not interested in reading about how it works, here are the default important key bindings:\n\nF1 : select left or center column;\n\n: select left or center column; S-F1 : select right column;\n\n: select right column; F11 : clone current buffer;\n\n: clone current buffer; F12 : swap left and center columns.\n\nInitial Setup\n\nThe first function is s3c-initial-setup , which actually splits Emacs.\n\n(defun s3c-initial-setup () (interactive \"\") (delete-other-windows) (setq s3c-window-1 (selected-window)) (split-window-horizontally 82) (switch-to-buffer \"*scratch*\") (other-window 1) (setq s3c-window-2 (selected-window)) (split-window-horizontally 82) (other-window 1) (switch-to-buffer \"*Messages*\") (setq s3c-window-3 (selected-window)) (other-window 2) (message \"Setup 3 Columns - Done\") )\n\nNote that there is only one Emacs window in the window manager sense. This Emacs window is split into three columns, and the Emacs term for each column is \"window\".\n\nLet's see how it works:\n\nfirst, it resets Emacs to having only one window; then it remembers the current window as s3c-window-1 ; then it splits the window in two, with the left-hand side taking 82 characters (there are 2 empty columns, so the actual text area is 80-character wide); then it switches the left window to buffer *scratch* ; then it moves the cursor to the next window, i.e. the right-hand side; then it remembers the current window as s3c-window-2 ; then it performs the same actions again to create the third column, named s3c-window-3 which is set to contain the *Messages* buffer; it eventually puts the cursor in the center window, which still contains the original buffer.\n\nSo in the end there are three columns. The left one contains *scratch* , the center one contains the original buffer, and the right one contains *Messages* .\n\nAutomatic Setup\n\nYou don't actually have to call s3c-initial-setup . It is automatically called by another function named s3c-check-setup if needed. Function s3c-check-setup is itself called by most other functions. It checks whether s3c-window-1 , s3c-window-2 and s3c-window-3 exist and if they don't, it calls s3c-initial-setup .\n\n(defun s3c-check-setup () (interactive \"\") (if (not (and (boundp 's3c-window-1) (window-live-p s3c-window-1) (boundp 's3c-window-2) (window-live-p s3c-window-2) (boundp 's3c-window-3) (window-live-p s3c-window-3) ) ) (progn (message \"Setup 3 Columns - Automatic Initialization\") (s3c-initial-setup) ) ) )",
      "Battle Master\n\nThose who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weapon smithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.\n\nCombat Superiority\n\nWhen you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you gain a number of features that display your superiority in combat.\n\nManeuvers. You learn three maneuvers of your choice, which are detailed under \"Maneuvers\" below. Many maneuvers enhance an attack in some way. You can use only one maneuver per attack.\n\nYou learn three additional maneuvers of your choice at 7th level. Each time you learn new maneuvers, you can also replace one maneuver you know with a different one.\n\nSuperiority Dice. You have six superiority dice, which are d6s. A superiority die is expended when you use it. You regain all of your expended superiority dice when you finish a short or long rest.\n\nYou gain two superiority dice at 7th level and two more at 18th level.\n\nSaving Throws. Some of your maneuvers require your target to make a saving throw to resist the maneuver's effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:\n\nManeuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Strength or Dexterity modifier (your choice)\n\nStudent of War\n\nAt 3rd level, you gain proficiency with one type of artisan's tools of your choice.\n\nKnow Your Enemy\n\nStarting at 7th level, if you spend at least 1 minute observing or interacting with another creature outside combat, you can learn certain information about its capabilities compared to your own. The DM tells you if the creature is your equal, superior, or inferior in regard to two of the following characteristics of your choice:\n\nStregnth score\n\nDexterity score\n\nConstitution score\n\nArmor Class\n\nCurrent hit points\n\nTotal class levels (if any)\n\nFighter class levels (if any)\n\nImproved Combat Superiority\n\nStarting at 10th level, you learn three advanced maneuvers listed under \"Advanced Maneuvers\" below.\n\nYou learn three additional advanced maneuvers of your choice at 15th level. Each time you learn new advanced maneuvers, you can also replace one advanced maneuver you know with a different one.\n\nRelentless\n\nStarting at 15th level, when you roll initiative and have no superiority dice remaining, you regain 3 superiority dice.\n\nManeuvers\n\nThe maneuvers are presented in alphabetical order.\n\nCommander's Strike. When you take the Attack action on your turn, you can forgo one of your attacks and use a bonus action to direct one of your companions to strike. When you do so, choose a friendly creature who can see or hear you and expend one superiority die. That creature can immediately use its reaction to make one weapon attack, adding the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nDisarming Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to disarm the target, forcing it to drop one item of your choice that it's holding. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, it drops the object you choose. The object lands at its feet.\n\nDistracting Strike. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to distract the creature, giving your allies an opening. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll. The next attack roll against the target by an attacker other than you has advantage if the attack is made before the start of your next turn.\n\nEvasive Footwork. When you move, you can expend one superiority die, rolling the die and adding the number rolled to your AC until you stop moving.\n\nFeinting Attack. You can expend one superiority die and use a bonus action on your turn to feint, choosing one creature within 5 feet of you as your target. You have advantage on your next attack roll against that creature. If that attack hits, add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll.\n\nGoading Attack. When you hit a creature with a weapon attack, you can expend one superiority die to attempt to goad the target into attacking you. You add the superiority die to the attack's damage roll, and the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on all attack rolls against targets other than you until the end of your next turn.\n\nLunging Attack. When you make a melee weapon attack on your turn, you can expend one superiority die to increase your reach",

      "A 34-year-old Turkish man suspected of killing three Kurdish activists, including one of the cofounders of the banned PKK, in Paris in January 2013 died Saturday morning in a Parisian hospital days before the start of his trial.\n\nOmer Güney, the only suspect in the 2013 killings of three female Kurdish activists in Paris in January 2013, died Saturday morning at the Pitié-Salpétrière hospital following a battle with a serious brain injury, a judicial source told the AFP.\n\nGüney was charged with the murders of Sakine Cansiz, Fidan Dogan and Leyla Soylemez in a Kurdish cultural centre in the 10th arrondissement of the French capital.\n\nCansiz was a prominent Kurdish activist and a co-founder of the PKK (Kurdistan Workers' Party), a leftist group considered a terrorist organisation in Turkey, the EU and the US.\n\nThe three women were shot at close range in broad daylight in a busy Parisian neighbourhood not far from the Gare du Nord, sparking shocked reactions and condemnations across France.\n\nGüney was charged with \"assassinations in connection with a terrorist enterprise\" shortly after the killings.\n\nHis death, in effect, puts an end to his trial, which was scheduled to start on January 23, 2017.\n\nFamilies of victims express anger over deprivation of justice\n\n\nResponding to the news of his death, lawyers for the families of the victims issued a statement expressing the \"anger of the families of the victims, deprived of a public trial for which they had waited for nearly four years; families, who had placed their hopes in the French justice system\".\n\nThe families of the victims expressed their \"consternation to see that, once again, France is still not able to judge a political crime committed on French territory by foreign secret services,\" according to the statement signed by lawyers Sylvie Boitel, Antoine Comte, Virginia Dusen, Jan Fermon and Jean-Louis Malterre.\n\nA judicial source told the AFP that French investigators had concluded that members of the Turkish secret service, MIT, were involved in the triple murder.\n\nBut the investigations did not establish whether these agents acted \"with the backing of their superiors\" or \"without the knowledge of the secret service in order to discredit or harm the peace process\".\n\nAt the time of the murders, the Turkish government was engaged in a peace process with the PKK in a bid to end a longstanding conflict between the Turkish state and the left-wing organisation, which peaked in the 1990s and killed more than 40,000.\n\nThe peace process collapsed in 2015, shortly after the June 7 election saw the pro-Kurdish HDP party cross the required 10 percent vote threshold to enter parliament for the first time. Fighting between the PKK and the Turkish state has since flared up again as Kurds across the southern Turkish border with Syria have been asserting their influence on the Syrian battlefields.\n\nGermany arrests Turk for spying on Kurds\n\n\nDuring the investigation, Güney denied the charges despite incriminating evidence, including video surveillance filmed of him entering the Kurdistan Information Centre building shortly before the crimes. DNA of one of the victims was found on Güney's parka and his bag contained traces of gunpowder.\n\nThe accused, a former maintenance officer at the Charles de Gaulle airport, had approached Kurdish associations in the Paris region at the end of 2011. Described by his relatives as an ultra-nationalist Turk, he had infiltrated the movement \"for the purpose of surveillance and espionage\" with the aim of \"eliminating PKK cadres,\" according to the source close to the investigation.\n\nThe Turkish intelligence services in January 2014 officially denied any role in the killings.\n\nGüney's death came a day after the German federal prosecutor's office revealed that a Turkish national suspected of spying on Ankara's behalf on the large Kurdish community in Germany had been arrested in the city of Hamburg.\n\nThe 31-year-old is suspected of having gathered, \"on behalf of the Turkish secret service, information on the places of residence, personal data and political activity of Kurds living in Germany, as well as on Kurdish organisations,\" said the statement released by the prosecutor's office.\n\nTurkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has criticised Europe for not doing enough to crack down on the PKK and has accused Germany of harbouring \"terrorists\".\n\n(FRANCE 24 with AFP)\n\nDate created : 2016-12-17",

      "From Smite Wiki\n\nAttack and Defense is a core concept in SMITE.\n\nThere are three types of damage: Physical, Magical, and True damage. Gods are classified as being either magical or physical, with their attacks and abilities applying that type of damage. Physical damage can be mitigated by physical protection, and magical damage can be mitigated by magical protection. True damage deals its full amount regardless of how much physical or magical protection the target has. True damage is relatively rare; an example is Bakasura's Butcher Blades ability.\n\nDamage reduction is a mechanic that reduces the damage output of the afflicted god or unit. It can either affect a single type of damage or it can affect all types of damage, including True damage.\n\nThere are rare circumstances where gods can apply damage of a different power type than their own. For example, Mystical Mail has an aura effect that deals magical damage around the user and can be acquired by physical gods.\n\nGods have a \"Power\" statistic which attacks and abilities scale from. Most gods start with 0 power (an example of an exception is Kukulkan whose passive ability grants him magical power equal to a percentage of his maximum mana) and can gain power from items and some god ability effects. Certain jungle buffs can also increase a god's power.\n\nBasic Attacks [ edit | edit source ]\n\nBasic attacks scale based on the god's level and their Power stat. The \"Basic Attack\" number indicates the amount of unmitigated damage a basic attack does. Each god has a formula that defines what their Basic Attack value is. The formula for how basic damage is calculated is:\n\nBase Damage + (Base Damage per lvl × God's lvl) + (100% of Physical Power OR 20% of Magical Power)\n\nAll magical gods scale at 20% of their Magical Power, and all physical gods scale at 100% of their Physical Power. For example, Agni's basic attack damage is 34 + 1.5 × level + 20% of Magical Power. Izanami is the only exception to this rule; she is a hunter who has boomerang like basic attacks which can go through multiple targets and that scale at 75% Physical Power when fired and 25% when they are returning to her.\n\nBuffs and effects that grant a percentage basic attack damage increase will apply the bonus before the physical/magical power contribution.\n\nAttack Speed defines how many attacks a god can fire per second. The higher the value is, the faster a god will use their basic attacks.\n\nSome gods have a hit progression which changes the speed and amount of damage a basic attack does, and in some cases it allows them to hit all targets in an area.\n\nPhysical gods have access to Critical Chance, which gives them a chance to land critical strikes with their basic attacks. Critical strikes deal 200% (twice) as much damage as a regular basic attack. The item Deathbringer increases how much damage critical strikes do by an extra 30% (230% total).\n\nLaunching a Basic Attack while moving will reduce movement speed by 50% (The movement speed counter will not change while doing so). The \"Haste\" passive effect of items such as Hastened Katana and Hastened Ring removes this movement penalty on activation.\n\nMost damaging abilities have a base amount of damage (which may increase each time a point is put into the ability), plus an additional amount based on the god's Power stat. For example, Ra's Celestial Beam at max rank will do (335 + 90% of Magical Power) unmitigated damage. Some abilies may also scale with Basic Attack Power, which is equal to the damage the god currently deals with their basic attacks.\n\nThere are a few abilities in the game, like Mercury's Made You Look and Ne Zha's Armillary Sash, that can be affected by Critical Chance, which is normally something that only affects basic attacks.\n\nProtections and Mitigation [ edit | edit source ]\n\nA god's magical and physical protection values will reduce the amount of damage the corresponding types of damage apply. A god's inherent protections scale with level. For example, Ymir's total physical protection is 23 + 3.3 × level + Physical Protection From Items. Ignoring penetration for now, the formula for how a protection value reduces damage is:\n\nDamage = (100 × Unmitigated Damage)/(Protections + 100)\n\nThe result of this equation means that a protection value of 50 will reduce damage by 33%, 100 will reduce it by 50%, and 150 will reduce it by 60%.\n\nFor example (still ignoring penetration), if Ra's Celestial Beam is listed as doing 335 damage, and he hits someone with 70 magical protection, then the actual damage will be 197 = ((100 × 335)/(70 + 100)).\n\nDamage can also be mitigated by percentage damage reduction like Athena's Defender of Olympus. Percentage damage reduction can't be penetrated by",

      "By Ian Simpson\n\nBALTIMORE (Reuters) - A Baltimore policeman on trial for the death of a black man from a spinal injury while in custody failed to secure him in the back of a van and ignored his request for medical aid, a prosecutor said in opening statements on Wednesday.\n\nBut a defense lawyer for Officer William Porter rejected the allegations, saying that the officer had no responsibility to strap in Freddie Gray and that Gray showed no signs of being ill or injured.\n\nGray's death in April triggered rioting, arson and protests in the largely black city and fueled a national debate over police tactics and relations with minorities.\n\nPorter, 26, faces charges in Baltimore City Circuit Court that include manslaughter, second-degree assault and misconduct. Gray, 25, died a week after he was taken into custody on April 12 for fleeing an officer and possessing a knife.\n\nPorter is the first of six officers to go on trial and one of three black officers charged in the case. The charges against the other five officers range from misconduct to second-degree murder.\n\nThe Baltimore trials mark a rare case of the prosecution of police for misconduct. Legal experts have said the outcome could influence U.S. prosecutors in bringing charges in cases of alleged police brutality.\n\nChief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow said Porter was present at five of the six stops the van made the day Gray was arrested, shackled and handcuffed. He described Gray's neck injury as similar to that suffered by a diver landing headfirst in a shallow pool.\n\nAlthough Gray told Porter he could not breathe, the officer ignored his requests for medical aid as well as a department order mandating that detainees be secured with a seat belt, Schatzow said.\n\n\"When he was taken out of the van, he couldn't breathe, he was unconscious, no heartbeat,\" Schatzow told the jury of eight women and four men.\n\nPorter also had been trained at the police academy to give medical assistance to people who request it and to secure detainees in vehicles with seat belts.\n\nThe officer's lawyer, Gary Proctor, said other officers such as the van driver and arresting officers likely were responsible for ensuring that Gray was secured.\n\nGray, who had a history of brushes with the law, had a reputation of causing a scene when being arrested. Porter \"knew he (Gray) didn't go quietly,\" the lawyer said.\n\nGray showed no symptoms of medical trouble when Porter spoke with him. Taking Gray to a hospital would have stripped the short-handed police district of another officer, Proctor said.\n\nIn the courtroom, Gray's mother and two other women wept quietly while Schatzow spoke. Gray's stepfather was also present.\n\nThe first witness was Alice Carson Johnson, an instructor at the Baltimore Police Academy, who was questioned by prosecutor Janet Bledsoe about Porter's medical and other training.\n\nUnder cross-examination by defense lawyer Joseph Murtha, Johnson said she had no record of Porter taking refresher courses after leaving the academy.\n\n\n(Additional reporting by Donna Owens; Editing by Frank McGurty and Jonathan Oatis)",
      "Rate Of Coastal Wetlands Loss Has Sped Up, U.S. Study Says\n\nEnlarge this image toggle caption U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service\n\nThe U.S. lost an average of 80,000 acres of coastal wetlands from 2004 to 2009, according to the latest data published by federal agencies. More than 70 percent of the estimated loss came in the Gulf of Mexico; nationwide, most of the loss was blamed on development that incurred on freshwater wetlands.\n\n\"The losses of these vital wetlands were 25 percent greater than during the previous six years,\" NPR's Elizabeth Shogren reports for our Newscast unit. She also notes that the loss equals \"about seven football fields every hour.\"\n\nThe figures come from a recent report titled Status and Trends of Wetlands in the Coastal Watersheds of the Conterminous United States. For their study, researchers examined 2,614 plots that were chosen at random, with each plot representing 4 square miles.\n\nU.S. coastal wetlands are concentrated in four areas — the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic coast, the Great Lakes, and the Pacific coast. Here's how the study estimates they fared from 2004-2009:\n\nGulf of Mexico: Net loss of 257,150 acres\n\nAtlantic Coast: Net loss of 111,960 acres\n\nPacific Coast: Net loss of 5,220 acres\n\nGreat Lakes: Net gain of 13,610 acres\n\nThe report also notes that some coastal wetland gains were seen in the coastal watersheds of South Carolina, Georgia and parts of central Florida.\n\nThe causes for the wetlands losses range from tree farming to rural and urban development to powerful storms like those that have obliterated wetlands in the Gulf of Mexico, turning them into open water.\n\nIn the U.S., most of the coastal wetlands are freshwater — about 34.6 million acres, according to the report, compared to 6.4 million acres of saltwater wetlands.\n\nWetlands are a vital part of coastal ecology, supporting fish and other wildlife. They improve water quality by filtering runoff; wetlands are also crucial to protecting coastal regions from erosion and flooding, particularly during strong storms. Wetlands are also an economic engine for the seafood and tourism industries.\n\nIf you're a little rusty on what constitutes a wetland in the U.S., here's how the Environmental Protection Agency defines them:",

      "Scientists know that humans, chimpanzees, and other primates can convey surprising amounts of information by means of a glance and tilt of the head. But what about animals with eyes on the sides of their heads, like deer and horses? What kind of social cues do they use to communicate? Now, mammal communication experts report that, at least for horses, a great deal of information is conveyed through the position of the animal's ears as well as its eyes. To find out which facial cues equines use, the scientists placed two buckets of feed in front of a wall with a life-size photograph of a horse's head. The head faced either left or right. They then released 24 horses, one at a time, and let them choose which bucket to dine from. If the eyes or ears of the pictured horse were covered, the freed horse randomly selected either bucket for its dinner. But if the eyes and ears in the photo were visible, the horse (such as the one in the photo above, pictured with study author Jennifer Wathan) used these cues to guide its choice, and most often picked the bucket that the pictured horse was facing, as in this video. The study, reported today in Current Biology, serves as a reminder that creatures with faces shaped differently from those of humans and other primates can nevertheless exchange social signals, the scientists say. None of this is likely to surprise people who work with horses or dogs, they note, but then it sometimes takes a while for science to catch up.",

One important move that Hitler made when he came to power was to have the military stop pledging to serve Germany and start pledging to him personally . His hope was that their loyalty to him would lead them to follow his orders even if they were harmful to the nation or its citizens . This fear goes back at least as far as ancient Rome , when ( for example ) Julius Caesar was able to become ~~emperor~~ dictator because he had a large army of soldiers who were loyal to him personally , rather than to the Roman Republic . * Edit :* Thank you for the gold ! And thanks to those who are correcting and refining my history . This was all off the top of my head so there were bound to be mistakes .",

      "I 'm not an expert but I tried to sum up some information ... The German Pirate Party was founded in September 2006 . First their aims and goals were mainly focused on digital copyright and internet , as you mentioned . I guess this is why they became popular for young people in the first place . Their first real success was last year in Berlin ( apart from the big Germany - wide elections , every federal state has own small elections ) and they managed to get 8,9 % of the votes ( in Berlin ) and therefore made it into the federal state government . It turns out that not only young people but also a big amount of nonvoters were attracted by this party . The success was rather surprising for everyone , including the Pirates themselves . Ever since , they are trying to get a proper party manifesto . They do n’t have opinions on everything yet but they i.e. want free education for everyone ( get rid of university fees ) , free public transportation , they want to make democracy more accessible and transparent for the citizens , they oppose nuclear energy – just to name a few . This year they made it into two more federal state governments and they try hard to get organized . They are still newcomers and not experienced in politics . But it seems as if their success makes them even more attractive for voters that are sick of the long - established parties . EDIT : Spelling .",
      "Sir Charles Antony Richard Hoare (Tony Hoare or C. A. R. Hoare) FRS FREng (born 11 January 1934) is a British computer scientist who has made foundational contributions to programming languages, algorithms, operating systems, formal verification, and concurrent computing. His work earned him the Turing Award, usually regarded as the highest distinction in computer science, in 1980.\nHoare developed the sorting algorithm quicksort in 1959–1960. He developed Hoare logic, an axiomatic basis for verifying program correctness. In the semantics of concurrency, he introduced the formal language communicating sequential processes (CSP) to specify the interactions of concurrent processes, and along with Edsger Dijkstra, formulated the dining philosophers problem.[10][11][12] He is also credited with development (and later criticism) of the null pointer, having introduced it in the ALGOL family of languages. Since 1977, he has held positions at the University of Oxford and Microsoft Research in Cambridge.",
      "If you don't know how to fix your own car or have time to take car parts off of a car at a junk yard, the average amount of money per month you spend on repairing an old car will be greater than the amount of money you spend per month on a new car payment. This is because car repair shops are charging $85 per hour for labor for car repairs. Many parts that wear out on a car are difficult to replace because of their location on the engine. The classic example is piston rings.",

      "What we have here is a scene of action and violence, and while our characters may not be bold and decisive, our writing must be. Other posters here have noted the need for some basic reduction and some grammar issues, and I agree with them. \n \n \n A story like this can be interesting because it allows the reader to examine what a protagonist is. Are we seeing the story through this character's eyes because he is particularly special or has some special part in the story, or does the story simply require an on-the-ground POV? I think it's almost always the first option, especially if you have a first person or third person limited point of view, but in this story it's really the second.

On more then one occasion did the man find himself in total darkness, the only source of light being the headlights before him. The radio crackled in and out of existence, the signal blocked by the rock. Then silence. Even the engine seemed to go strangely quiet ; he could only hear his own breathing, as it steadily became more and more frantic. The lights flickered, and he began to panic.

He could only wait. \n \n Then, he came out of the tunnel, and onto a great expanse of land.

      "Spotify and Airbnb Firms’ Network Effects Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nModern society is characterized by a high degree of complexity and is based on interaction and communication between groups or individuals. Companies actively use this aspect to generate product value for users. In particular, they use network effects to increase the number of participants in their network, which not only attracts more users but also generates product value for network members. Several main types of network effects affect a product’s value, increasing it and providing a competitive advantage to companies. Spotify and Airbnb are examples of the most successful use of various network effects to continuously generate the value of the network members’ products and increase their defense in the market.\n\nNetwork Effects Definition and Overview\n\nThe principles of network effects in modern society and business are fundamental to the development of a competitive company. James Currier underlines that “every new user has the value in your product to other users who are using the product or will use the product” (NFX, 2020, [0:00-0:11]). Thus, the more people use the product, the more valuable it becomes to other existing and potential users. This factor also ensures the company’s growth and development, which provides a competitive advantage in the market.\n\nFactors Affecting Product Value\n\nNetwork Effects Types\n\nNetwork effects are particularly significant in contemporary, highly digitalized society. In particular, there are four key defensibilities today, including network effects, embedding, scale, and brand (NFX, 2018). These factors allow companies to create value that cannot be copied or replicated, which increases the company’s competitive advantage in the market (Pidun et al., 2020). As part of technology startups, network effects account for more than 70% of the total value generated by the company (NFX, 2018, [0:20]). There are various types of network effects, which fall into major categories, including direct, two-sided, data, and social. A detailed network effects map is presented in\n\nFig. 1. Network effects map (Currier, n.d).\n\nFig. 1 and describes 13 types of effects as their impact on the value of a company’s product decreases.\n\nDirect Network Effects\n\nDirect network effects are the simplest and most powerful factors influencing business success. As shown in the map in Fig. 1, this broad group includes five effects: physical, protocol, personal utility, personal, and market network. The physical network effect is based on physical nodes and links, as a network of telephones and wires between them. This effect is the most defensible since it has a direct network effect, as well as “lends itself to the addition of other defensibilities; namely, scale effects and embedding” (Currier, n.d, para. 31). Businesses based on this type such as railway networks or electric networks, require large initial investments. Thus, most of the products and services offered by such companies are utilities that cannot be accessed through other effects.\n\nThe network effect protocol occurs when communication standards are set by the creator of the node and are available to anyone who can connect to the network using this protocol. For example, the latest blockchain technologies, such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, are created according to this principle. The personal utility network effect is built on the principle of personal communication between network members. The main disadvantage of this effect is that when the network is disrupted, people using it experience direct harm from the inability to maintain personal communication. Examples of these networks are instant messaging tools or applications such as WhatsApp or SMS.\n\nFig. 2. Direct network (Currier, n.d).\n\nA personal direct network effect occurs when a product provides individual value to network participants. In particular, this is due to the fact that the reputation and personality of network participants are associated with and influenced by the product. In contrast to personal utility networks, this type of effect is not used for vital communication and is less personal in nature. Thus, when leaving the network or destroying it, users do not receive much damage. An example of such networks is Facebook or Twitter, where people can build long-term personal interactions. Finally, market networks are direct communication between marketplace participants. Thus, this effect is very similar to personal but focuses on interactions within a particular market. Examples of this effect are companies like HoneyBook or DotLoop that provide services to other businesses. Fig. 2 shows a typical structure of the direct network effect, which is built on nodes and links between them.\n\nTwo-Sided Network Effects\n\nThis group is also often called indirect effects, as it describes the interaction of demand and supply, which generate indirect value for each other. However, network participants on the same side also generate direct value when interacting, which explains the two-way nature of these effects. Most importantly, direct influences often negatively affect the value of a product, while indirect influences outweigh these factors to generate positive value. As shown in Fig. 1, there are three main network effects data types: marketplace, platform, and asymptomatic marketplace.\n\nThe marketplace network effect implies the presence of sellers and buyers. More opposing parties generate more value for the product. In this case, direct interaction on one side generates a negative value, which is offset by indirect influence. Examples of companies using this effect are marketplaces such as Amazon and eBay, matchmaking apps (Tinder or Craiglist, and payment instruments (Visa or American Express). The platform network effect is similar to the marketplace, but on the one hand, there are the creators of a product that is only available on a certain platform, and on the other, users. This effect is used by the creators of operating software, including Microsoft OS, and iOS, as well as the creators of game consoles and other similar systems.\n\nThe asymptomatic marketplace network effect differs from the two types described in that they offer a rapid increase in value at the start of product implementation and a decrease in efficiency as the company develops. Typical and deferred value marketplaces, in turn, offer businesses the opportunity for stable growth in the generated value (the factor is illustrated in Fig. 3). This model is the most vulnerable and represents the least competitive advantage for companies but allows a quick start. Examples of companies successfully using this network effect are Uber and Lyft.\n\nFig. 3. Marketplace network effect types (Currier, n.d).\n\nData Network Effects\n\nThe data network effect describes how an increase in the amount of data leads to an increase in the value of a product. In turn, the growth in the value of the product is associated with the generation of a large amount of data. The interaction between the quantity and quality of generated data, as well as the mode of its usage, can affect the value of a product in different ways. However, the increased use of data and the improvement of the quality of information products leads to an increase in the value of the product for users. Companies that actively use this effect include Google, Amazon, IMDB, and others.\n\nTech Performance Network Effects\n\nThis aspect describes a situation where the performance of technology grows with an increase in the number of users. A large number of users or devices on the network will make the technology more convenient, cheaper, and more accessible. A feature of this effect is that each new node increases the performance of the technology for all other nodes of the network. Basically, this system is actively used by peer-2-peer technologies and companies based on them, including BitTorrent, VPN services, Hola, and others.\n\nSocial Network Effects\n\nThis type of effect generates product value solely through the interaction between people. This group is the most difficult in the long run but can offer a great competitive advantage. Social network effects, including language, bandwagon, and belief, are a form of brand defensibility because they are based on the influence of people’s psychology. However, these aspects still represent a network effect since their effectiveness also depends on the number of nodes and connections within the system.\n\nLanguage is the most common factor that increases the value of a product. In particular, the more people use the brand name in the speech, the more recognizable and defensible it becomes. Language is also a predicate of international development since, for example, a company with a name in English will be much easier to promote globally than using local languages. For example, the company name Google already has a generic designation for Internet search, which greatly increases the value of the product. Belief works in a similar way: the more people believe in the value of a product, the more value it generates. The simplest example of this effect is religions or ideologies that exist solely due to belief and has no physical embodiment. The bandwagon network effect also engages people’s psychology by putting pressure on them to join a movement or group. A good example is Slack, which created a prejudice among tech companies that using their product is what makes a successful business. Therefore, the utility and the product do not match the opinion created around it.\n\nThe Exploitation of Network Effects Examples\n\nSpotify\n\nSpotify has become one of the pioneers in using the principles of network effects. This streaming application allows any user to create a profile on the platform as well as share their own or others’ playlists. Additionally, users can add each other as friends, see what music other users are listening to, and create joint playlists. It is also important that the application is integrated into other media platforms and allows users to share their music on Facebook pages and other resources. Recently, the company added the ability to share remote listening for users. Thus, Spotify actively uses several network effects, which together constantly increase the value of the product.\n\nFirst of all, Spotify uses direct effects, including personal utility and personal effects. The personal utility effect is to provide users with the opportunity to communicate with each other and express themselves, as well as search for communities. The personal network effect consists of giving users access to music and various playlists, which creates value in itself. More musicians and listeners in the network generate more and more value for all its participants. The company also uses the two-sided network platform effect, as Spotify delivers value exclusively within its platform, gaining additional value and defensibility. Moreover, the company uses the sided network marketplace effect to provide value-generating interaction between musicians and listeners. Finally, Spotify is actively integrating social networks such as language and bandwagon to promote the brand as well as set trends that influence public opinion. Together, these factors allow the company to constantly increase the value of its product, making it more and more indispensable in the market and increasing its competitive advantage.\n\nAirbnb\n\nAirbnb is another example of the successful use of network effects, but the company utilizes fewer factors than Spotify. In particular, the company model is based on the interaction of hosts and guests, which is a typical example of the marketplace network effect. Thus, the platform provides network participants with the opportunity to interact. In turn, more users generate increased value and attract new members. In turn, the constant growth of the network increases the value of the company’s product and provides a competitive advantage in the market.\n\nConclusion\n\nNetwork effects are built on the interaction of system nodes and links to generate product value. As one can see from the examples of Spotify and Airbnb examples, companies can use various factors to attract more users and increase the company’s competitive advantage. The most important thing about network effects is that the process does not require any special investments or strategies from the company. The product itself generates value if it is useful to users, which is the main driver of value growth.\n\nReference List\n\nCurrier, J.

      "The Nursing Staff Shortage and Patient Care Quality Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. The Problem\n 2. The Setting\n 3. A Description\n 4. Effect of the Problem\n 5. Significance of the Topic\n 6. A Proposed Solution\n 7. References\n\nThe Problem\n\nThe specific evidence-based topic chosen for this capstone project change proposal is the effects of nursing staff shortage and quality of care for patients. The issue is increasingly becoming a major problem in the healthcare facility I currently work for. According to Haddad et al. (2019), nursing shortage is caused by several factors among them, a large patient population, and a high number of those retiring every year. In the recent past, this issue has proven difficult to address due to the high cost of hiring and training new nurses.\n\nThe Setting\n\nThe nursing staff shortage is being witnessed in the long term care facility, specifically the special care unit. The unit exists to serve the elderly population (Aloisio et al., 2021). The total number of patients currently admitted at the facility is three hundred. Most of these patients are in need of services such as speech, occupational and physical therapy (Jung et al., 2018). These services are provided to prevent deterioration while, at the same time, improve individual’s social adjustment to stages of decline.\n\nA Description\n\nNursing staff shortage in the long-term care facility is no longer a problem but a crisis. The facility receives a high number of patients every year with majority of them in need of specialized care. Most of these patients, especially the elderly have stayed in the facility for up to two years. This means that nurses must spend extra time caring for the needs of this population—they need both medical and personal support services since most of them cannot live independently. Therefore, high patient population, especially those aged 65 years, remains to a major cause of nursing shortage at the facility. According to Markides, and Rote (2019), the United States has the highest number of individuals over 65 years and above. As the population continue to age, the need for health services increases.\n\nEffect of the Problem\n\nThere are many effects of nursing shortage with the first being low quality of patient care. Different studies, among them Ulrich et al. (2019), show a direct link between short-staffed facilities and low quality care. This is the case because nursing shortage means long shift hours and high patient-to-nurse ratios. These ratios increases waiting time, thus delaying the delivery of services. Another effect of nursing shortage relates to nursing burnout which is common in my facility (Marć et al. 2019). Some nurses at the facility often complained of being overworked and many of them experienced burnout. The problem is that as the aged nurses continue to leave, the remaining few were being forced to take up their roles. Finally, nursing shortage has a major impact on work environment: this is evidenced through the many cases of hospital acquired infections.\n\nSignificance of the Topic\n\nNursing shortage is associated with medical errors, high morbidity and mortality rates. In facilities with high patient-to-nurse rations, nurses experienced dissatisfaction and burnout (Austin et al. 2020). The patients also experienced high mortality compared to facilities with low patient-to-nurse rations. In other words, nursing shortage has a major impact on the nursing profession. Nurses working under stressful conditions are more prone to making mistakes. In fact, most of them are seen as delivering poor quality service which is an indication of incompetency.\n\nA Proposed Solution\n\nThe proposed solution to address the nursing shortage at the facility is the implementation of a nurse residency program. This program will help graduate nursing students transition to dealing with the duties of being nurses (Ackerson et al. 2018). The aim is to offer mentorship to new graduates: they should be allowed to shadow the experienced nurses. This will ensure they spend a lot of time caring for patients before they are released to practice on their own.\n\nReferences\n\nAckerson, K., & Stiles, K. A. (2018).

      "Biden’s Push to Increase Tax on the Rich From New York Times Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Get Woke\n 2. Be Woke\n 3. Stay Woke\n 4. Works Cited\n\nThe major reason for this news is Biden’s will to increase taxes for the rich to fund his plan of reshaping the economy. Biden seeks to increase taxes for the rich in a move he terms as ‘ensuring the rich their fair share of taxes’ to pump about four trillion US dollars into the economy (Tankersley). In his plan to reshape the economy, he is seeking to alleviate poverty, cut down prekindergarten costs, and make vocational college free to everyone.\n\nIn the new tax policy, households earning more than four hundred and fifty thousand US dollars will get an increase in their taxation in different categories. The income tax will also raise to 39.6 percent from 37 percent set in 2017 (Tankersley). This push by Biden to rebalance the disproportionate economy is expected to meet fierce resistance from the Democrats. This is because it does not address the most important issue of the boosting of healthcare using taxes gained from the new policy (Luhby and Lobosco). However, Democrats are likely to shift and side with the policy by proposing new but with the condition of lowering percentages of tax increase in different categories in the new policy (Luhby and Lobosco). This is an extremely sensitive matter that the government and citizens are waiting for the decision of the Senate.\n\nGet Woke\n\nIncreasing taxes for the rich has been one of the most engaging topics in the past two governments. It is critical issue because it will be a clash between Republicans and Democrats and will test the depth Democrats are willing to go minimize to effects of capitalism. The new policy that will pump money into the economy to fund the child tax credit, free vocational college, and national paid leave program will also affect everyone. Thus, this news is a major concern to everyone in the country as it will impact both the rich and poor. Fairness is hard to achieve in the country, but it is necessary, even though it will have negative effects. Finally, if the policy goes through, there would be a major dynamic effect in the way Americans will view both Republicans and Democrats, and that is why I choose this subject matter.\n\nBe Woke\n\nThe tax policy has been a subject that the Trump administration always wanted to implement, but its time ended without being implemented thus making it a major concern for both the government and citizens. The tax policy will also contribute a lot to child poverty alleviation through child tax credit amongst other important advantages that will come with it. I choose this topic because it would give me a prospect of how the rich are viewed by the government. This policy will, however, cause a ripple effect and it might end up scaring off investors and may also take up to a year for it to be fully implemented questioning its time feasibility. It surprised me that for Biden’s plan to reshape the economy, taxing more the rich would be his source of funds to implement it. There always would be divergent views about this sensitive subject.\n\nStay Woke\n\n 1. Is the new policy to increase tax for the rich, seeking to punish the rich, and if so, is it constitutionally correct as the constitution treats everyone equally?\n 2. If the policy passes, how will it affect the Republicans’ and Democrats’ political demography?\n 3. Will the positive effects of the new policy outweigh the negative effects it is expected to cause?\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLuhby, Tami and Lobosco, Katie. “‘Tax the Rich’ Plans at Risk as ‘Democrats’ Talks Drag on.” Edition CNN, 2021.

      "Independent but Dependent Media in Japan Essay\n\nThe mass media are essential and influential aspects of the modern social life of Japanese citizens. There has been a steady increase in the number of publications, Newspapers, television channels, radio stations, and internet-based sources of news in the last decade. This increment could mean more accurate and reliable information, but they are all under censorship. Though most media companies are privately owned, government and top politicians play a crucial role in developing news in Japan. Information is a vital product in everyday life, implying that the independence of media and the state involvement in publication and broadcasting materials directly impact a country’s social vision. This paper agrees with the truth presented by Alex Kerr in his article that media in Japan act like cartels and investigative reporting is actively punished.\n\nHigh hopes were set when the internet was established as a mainstream channel for interaction. This is because it provided a new public sphere where people could freely interact and share news without relying on third-party agents. Like any other country, Japan spent considerable funds ensuring a smooth social avenue for developing communication online across the country (Yoshioka & Maeda, 2020). The anticipated freedom was never felt as state organizations have primarily shaped the Japanese media avenues and substantial political influence with no individual broadcasting impact on the news. The presence of middle media that decides what news is to be published has undermined the power and quality that mass media present to the people. This translates to false news and information being released to the world, protecting the interest of a few cartels.\n\nJapanese news is far from being accurate because of the pressure faced by reporters and presenters. In 2015 Shigeaki Koga was axed as a news pundit after reporting that the government was applying pressure to media to tone down any critic against the government (Petrovic, 2020). Hodo Station sacked Koga without any reason where the producers claimed that he had interfered with government reporting. This worrying trend was witnessed when state and LDP officials openly participated in editorial decisions (Petrovic, 2020). The media are soft and avoid being confronted by the state questioning the firmness and the self-reliance of editorial and broadcasters’ rights. In addition, the termination of Koga by TV Asahi expressed the willingness of significant country’s mainstream media to bore down to the level of behind-the-scenes reporting by the administration.\n\nAccording to the magazine Sekai, one of the highly regarded liberal opinions in the country states that there is growing conformity that one cannot resist (Petrovic, 2020). This is written by Hiroko Kuniya, a TV anchor who documented force being used to accommodate the majority in their reporting from even the media owners (Petrovic, 2020). The country’s free press has been silenced for a long, and news is based on what the government believes is good for its reputation. This was reflected during the deadly earthquake in the southern city of Kumamoto and concerns about the nuclear plant. The government restricted journalists from covering the event, stating that all reporting must be based on official state announcements and not any independent newscasting. This led to unprofessional reporting filled with inaccurate information and data that the press could not establish credibility.\n\nFreedom of expression is evident as Japan is a liberal and capitalist nation. For decades now, there has been a minor change in the lineup of how newspapers and TV stations execute their duties. They produce programs and news within the same old narrow framework to keep their friendly corporate images. The news program is prominent segments promoting the fawning lifestyles and business of the rich and famous individuals. Journalist too often writes down what the government and other respected corporations have provided, and there is little by the press members as they are afraid of angering the powerful rich. This supports Kerr’s findings in the 21st century as it explains why the front page of newspapers is all the same.\n\nJournalism has always been the guardian to the public interest and abuse of power as practiced in other contemporary democracies. In addition, the press should facilitate factual news that supports pluralist debate and the free flow of accurate information. This is a conflicting view in Japan as the media is primarily used as an instrument of state power. Publishing is ruled by monopolies, commercial and political influence that restrict the amount of accurate information written in the country. The dominance of the press club system in newsgathering profounds the reporter’s freedom and independence, undermining the quality of news and information released. The media credibility is not observed in the country, and most of the word and information reported lack transparency, as depicted in the March 11 disaster (Yoshioka & Maeda, 2020). There is vital information, and communication gaps pointed out in how journalists conducted themselves during the catastrophic event. There was a lack of trust between the news reported and the actual information, strongly supporting that news in Japan is inaccurate.\n\nFor the people of Japan to get accurate news every day, the canon of journalism must be adopted and fully adhered to by every party involved in news making. The state must respect the freedom and independence of press firms as it pertains to investigative reporting. The citizens should form a watchdog media to keep both the state’s influence and media freedom in check. The people of the democratic republic of Japan need to set up independent movements to fight for media independence to be respected by the people in power. More press stations that are free from manipulation need to be established and not afraid of state threats. This will reduce the influence of politicians and state officers on reporting giving opportunity for news anchors to present accurate and authentic data.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the media avoidance of controversies, Japan does not exhibit the polarization of political ideas widely as in other developed nations. With the highest circulation of newspapers worldwide, media distrust arises from mainstream media’s ideological bent and bias. The reporting style is restrained and aimed at impartiality, and they heavily rely on court controversy. Critical topics and issues require media presence in Japan, such as the buraku issue, the use of nuclear power, continued use of the death penalty, and the current discrimination against ethnic Koreans that the press organs shy away from and only enter fray debate. This leads to inaccurate reporting on these topics as the media show little initiative in reporting key affairs affecting the democratic society. This supports the passage “Dogs and Demons” by Alex Kerr on the Japanese press that the news is manipulated and there is little or no truth in them. In addition, any investigative reporting in the country is never rewarded as press clubs collude with powerful institutions that decide what to report.\n\nReferences\n\nPetrovic, S. (2020).

      "A Case Study of “Bus 174 Film” by Felipe Lacerda Dissertation\n\nAbstract\n\nMedium specificity is a concept that is very common in film theory in the world of arts today. It basically means a piece of art or artistic medium that represents the characteristics and qualities of the raw material from which it is made. This study looked at medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in films from the perspective of Bus 174. The study adopted a phenomenological case study design. The researcher looked at the various film theories and how they conceptualize image on one hand and life and death on the other. This was by using Bus 174 as the reference point.\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground Information\n\nMedium specificity is a concept that is popular in the film industry today. The concept can be looked at by defining the two terms that make it up and then relating them to art as media. The two terms can be defined separately so as to get a deep insight into the concept. They can be defined from the perspectives of different scholars. As Bernstein (2012) states, the word ‘specificity’ is used to describe a scenario in the arts or to depict the specific nature of events as they occur in the environment. Medium on the other hand is the original material used in making art and which is brought about through creativity on the part of the artist. The two words are also used within the context of life, death and temporality of images as far as film as a form of art is concerned.\n\nSo far the researcher has looked at the two concepts differently. At this juncture, the author will look at the two words together and analyse the meaning they convey when combined. The term ‘medium specificity’ implies that the ‘character’ expressed by the work of art reflects the original ‘character’ or state of the components used in compiling it. In other words, a piece of art that is ‘medium specific’ takes the forms of the raw materials from which it was made. The two terms therefore are linked and are very significant in art today. Under different circumstances, the term ‘medium specificity’ exhibits the actual phenomenon that exists in the artistic environment. This process of imitating the actual or original raw material is referred to as the effect .\n\nIt is noted that that medium specificity takes into consideration several effects. For instance, when paint is used to cover a given surface, it takes the shape of the surface being painted. The paint assumes the structure and appearance of the canvas that was used. This is how Shankel (2011) describes the relationship between materiality and the effect of characterisation. This is not to say that the paint will change the colour of the surface being painted or the canvas. The actual effect of the canvas remains the same. The final product in this case takes the form of paint and brings out the actual materiality in its art to maintain a “………close connotation of characters” (Shankel 2011).\n\nProblem Statement\n\nAs already stated earlier in this paper, medium specificity is an expression that is common in contemporary film theories today. According to Bernstein (2012), the expression can be looked at by defining the two words “medium” and “specificity”. According to this author, specificity within the context of arts can be conceptualized as the “…….quality or fact (of) being specific in operation (and) effect” (Bernstein 2012, p. 1). It can also be conceptualized as the ability of a given phenomenon, object or subject to possess a specific character. On its part, medium within the context of arts can be viewed as the “……….raw material (and) mode of expression (that is used) in an artistic or creative (undertaking)” (Bernstein 2012, p. 1).\n\nHaving looked at specificity and medium as distinct terms and expression in the artistic world, Bernstein turns his attention to the combination of the two words to form the term ‘medium specificity’. The latter is defined as the “…..quality of being specific (in both operation and effect) to the character of the raw material being used as a mode of artistic expression” (Bernstein 2012, p. 2). From this author’s arguments, one can conclude that medium specificity connotes an artwork that manifests the characteristics, traits and qualities of the raw material which it is made from. A case in point is a painting as an artistic media. The paint can be said to be medium specific under given circumstances. It has to be made of the paint and the surface on which the paint is spread (a phenomenon Shankel [2011] refers to as operation). The paint should also “represent and imitate” the two materials from which it is made, a phenomenon that is referred to as effect by the author (Shankel 2011).\n\nAccording to Bernstein (2012), medium specificity is dependent on the “distinct materiality” (p. 3) of the artistic media such as a painting or a photograph. However, it should be noted that the qualities that characterize or categorize a medium are neither irreducible nor inherent. Rather, an artistic medium such as film is more or less a tool and practices that has being structured historically.\n\nTo this end, the author is going to analyse the concept and how it has been used in the film Bus 174. In addition, the author is going to analyse death, life, and temporality of images in the film.\n\nTemporality of images is a concept that is used in the film to represent tense. Tense is important as it is used to put images within a certain time frame and in a given context. What happens behind the scenes is always represented by gestures used in the film. However, this fails to account for presentness, past tense and even the future. To contextualise this point, the author will use an example in literature. For instance, book writers can go back in time and present information in the past tense whereas the film does not have the capability to shift to the past to fish out information pertaining to a particular incidence. Temporality of images becomes an important aspect of this research which will be used to depict how the film was presented.\n\nHaving this idea in mind, the researcher will incorporate the thinking of various film theorists and how their arguments relate to this particular film. This is especially so on what the various thinkers have to say about temporality of images and such other issues. As already indicated, the researcher will analyse life and death in images to bring out the essence of the film. The use of images becomes a vital tool in explaining how and why the film was acted in a particular manner.\n\nSome of the most influential aspects in the presentation of the film include Bazin’s classical film theories. Film theory is a collection of frameworks and principles that interpret and explain how films are made and received both by the audience and the critics. The frameworks are not static or frozen in time and space; rather, they are dynamic phenomena that vary from one period to the other. The theories borrow from other fields such as philosophy and social sciences.\n\nBazin is one of the most popular film critics of all time. This scholar made a case for films based on objective reality. These are for example documentaries. He also advocated for invisible directors. He argued for the use of deep focus, wide shots and such other traits of film. According to him, a film should be a manifestation of the director’s personal vision.\n\nThe study then proceeds to contemporary cultural critics such as Barthes who argue for temporality of images and their unique relationship to life and in extension death. The researcher noted that modern day writers such as Mulvey and Doane had taken up this line of inquiry, arguing for a specifically cinematic form of time.\n\nThe researcher analyses the ideas presented above from the perspective of Bus 174. This is a Brazilian documentary revolving around a life and death event. The documentary raises questions on both televisual and cinematic representation.\n\nResearch Objectives\n\nThe objectives of a given study can be taken as the aims that the researcher has in mind and which they expect to attain through the findings of the study. This research had one major objective and three specific objectives. By addressing the specific objectives, the researcher would have effectively addressed the major objective of the study. The major and specific objectives are listed below:\n\nMajor Objective\n\nThe major aim of the research is to analyse the film Bus 174 and find out how it depicts medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images.\n\nSpecific Objectives\n\n 1. Analyse medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in arts with special focus on films\n 2. Analyse medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in the context of the film Bus 174\n 3. The research also seeks to analyse the arguments of contemporary cultural critics regarding the relationship between images, life and death and how this relationship affects contemporary films.\n\nResearch Questions\n\nIt is noted that that research questions are related to research objectives. This is given the fact that by answering the research questions, the researcher would have effectively achieved the objectives of the study. Therefore, like in the case of the research objectives, the current study had one major research question and three specific questions. Again by answering the specific research questions, the researcher would have effectively addressed the major research question. The major and specific research questions are listed below:\n\nMajor Research Question\n\nHow does the film Bus 174 reflect medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film?\n\nSpecific Questions\n\n 1. How is medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images reflected in arts especially films?\n 2. How are medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images reflected in the film Bus 174?\n 3. What are some of the arguments made by both classical and contemporary film theorists with regard to medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film?\n 4. How are the arguments of classical and contemporary film theorists on medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images reflected in the film Bus 174?\n\nScope and Limitations of the Study\n\nIn the process of formulating the research design and collecting data for the study, the researcher identified several limitations that were inherent in the study. The limitations were both from within and from without the research design. It is not possible to address every aspect of a given topic in a single study. On realising this, the researcher found it important to focus the study in a particular area of interest. This formed the scope and limitations of the study. It was the boundary within which the study was conducted. Here are the scope and limitations of the study:\n\n 1. The research was limited to the study of medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images. This is despite the fact that images have many other characters which were left out of this study\n 2. The study was also limited to film as an artistic medium\n 3. The study was limited to the film Bus 174. This is despite the fact that there are other films that express medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images\n\nSignificance of the Study\n\nIn any given field, there are a number of studies that are going on at any one given time. As a result of this, any new study conducted in the field has to be justified. One way to justify the study is to identify its importance or the value that it is going to add into the field. This in other words is the significance of the study. The current study was not an exception. Following are potential practical applications of the findings of the study:\n\n 1. The findings of this study will contribute to the wealth of knowledge in this field. This is by coming up with new information\n 2. The findings will help film theorists and other stakeholders in relating the concepts of film theories to real life\n 3. The researcher will identify gaps that exists in this field and in addition make recommendations for future studies in the field\n\nIn this section, the author introduced the reader to the study by addressing some of the major highlights of the research. The areas addressed include background information, problem statement, research objectives, research questions, as well as the significance of the study. This was to give the reader an idea on what the whole study was all about.\n\nIn the next chapter the author is going to introduce the reader to the film Bus 174 . This is the film which the study will revolve around. In other words, it is the case for this study. Several aspects of the film will be put into perspective. These include the synopsis as well as the main themes of the film.\n\nBus 174: The Film\n\nIntroduction\n\nBus 174 is a film depicting a life and death scenario and which was produced way back in the year 2002. It is a debut film which was directed by Jose Padilha in form of a documentary reflecting life in Brazil. In this documentary, a young man by the name Sandro Rosa do Nascimento boarded a bus plying route 174 with the intention of stealing from the passengers. The heist did not go as planned and it turned into a tragedy for the young man. The events taking place in the bus were telecasted live on national television in Brazil (Villarejo 2006, p.117).\n\nBus 174: Synopsis\n\nThe film revolves around a failed robbery in which the hijacker takes the passengers of the bus hostage to avoid being arrested by the police. This Brazilian documentary tries to analyse the scenes captured live and transmitted to the national televisions as the poor young man named Sandro do Nascimento commandeers Bus 174 . Live cameras captured almost five hours of the tense scene as the police tried their best to save the people trapped in the bus (Young 2003, p.29).\n\nAs the police and television crew converge on the scene, several civilians as well as the police are interviewed on what took place prior to the hijacking. It was found that Nascimento was avenging the death of his Aunt who was killed few years ago. On top of that, he had escaped death from police who were targeting a group of young men who planned and carried out a massacre in a church in the year 1993. All this information was gathered from a person who was identified as Nascimento’s relative (Young 2003, p. 30).\n\nNascimento took the passengers hostage as the police continued to surround the scene of crime. He assured everyone that he had no intention of killing anyone. He reported that he had no intention of harming members of the press, police, passengers as well as the civilians who were standing by. The driver escaped through the window while the police surrounded the bus. Nascimento was demanding that another driver be deployed to the scene immediately. He even asked for more weapons from the police, threatening that failure to comply with his wishes will leave him no option but to take action. At around six o’clock local time, he vowed to kill one of the passengers since none of his demands had been met (Villarejo 2006, p. 117).\n\nOne hour later, Nascimento decided to attract the attention of the police and the onlookers by faking death. All along he used the passengers as human shields, a fact that prevented the police from acting. Using a 38 calibre revolver, he fired and ordered some of the passengers to act as though they have been shot dead. He called the attention of the police to this supposed execution but nothing happened. He tried to pull several pranks on the police and members of the public and the media to show his seriousness but none of his wishes were granted.\n\nGiven that no driver was sent to the scene, he decided to use one of the hostages by the name of Geisa Firmo (a school teacher) as human shield to walk out of the bus. As he exited the bus, his attention was focused on one side of the crowd. He was exposed from behind but he did not know this. An armed police officer crept on him from behind. As the police was approaching the two, Nascimento turned and jerked his hostage from the grip of the police. Unfortunately he lost his balance and fell down but he still held onto the man he was using as a shield (Villarejo 2006, p. 119).\n\nOn falling down, the armed police officer shot at him several times. Other police officers joined in and converged on the place where Nascimento and the teacher were lying. The shots did not meet the target given that he was still using the human shield and the police were wary. But at long last the police were able to immobilise him. The onlookers rushed to the scene to take a look at the person who had gripped their attention all this time. They shouted in unison “kill him! Kill him!” (Villarejo 2006, p.120).\n\nNascimento was escorted to a police car under heavy guard and after sometime, it was announced that he has died. The announcement read that he died of asphyxiation meaning that he was suffocated and deprived of oxygen. Different reports indicated that he was shot dead and in fact several police officers who were in charge of the situation were charged with murder.\n\nOne victim used by Nascimento was shot dead by the advancing police officers behind the culprit. There were conflicting reports as some of the media houses reported that the lady who was a school teacher was shot four times on the face. But the police on the other hand deny this claiming that she was shot just once. The media concluded that Nascimento may have been shot by the approaching police officer when they were struggling with the man on the ground. The charges that were preferred against the police were ruled out on the basis of the fact that the shooting was not intended.\n\nBus 174: Major Themes\n\nPostmodern Documentary\n\nThe term documentary can be used to describe the way truth is organised and presented to the audience. Theoretically, documentaries are moving away from the perception of reality to what photography implies. At the heart of the problem, truth must prevail. The film Bus 174 can be described as a postmodern documentary given that it is a recreation of real life event that actually took place. The movie uses imagery to represent people moving away from certain truths to an indexical relationship with the subject (Bazin 1999, p. 44).\n\nIn this segment, the author is going to dwell much on the truth behind the postmodern documentary which is film Bus 174. It is obvious that the film contains some aspects that are associated with documentaries in contemporary society. This includes the use of sophisticated cameras and other photography equipments as well as depiction of some of the traits of a postmodern society. This is for example the trait of the clash between different classes in the society; the clash between the government and the governed. The creator of the movie uses images to depict how the young man (represents the common man) clashes with the police (representing those in authority) (Bazin 1999, p. 47).\n\nThere are other events that clearly come out in this film. These include the illustration of Latin America as having a different cultural background from other societies in the world. Secondly the documentary incorporates some aspects of modernity which include film as well as cinematic arts. Finally the aesthetics used by the director to drive the point home are fascinating and has attracted the attention of stakeholders in the film industry as a whole (Blakeney 2009, p. 4).\n\nThis film is the first in Brazilian history as far as documentation in film is concerned. The film has been made popular by the fact that the director used a sophisticated strategy to create this art. The director made use of both aesthetic and narrative components that characterise fiction to come up with this film. The art is rich with tension from the spectators at the scene of the crime as well as the audience watching the film. Some contradictions are however evident in the film. For example the focus of the film keeps shifting from the spectators around the scene and those watching the events on the live telecast (Bazin 2009, p. 59).\n\nDocumentary has many features that can be found in fiction. This makes it one of the most popular forms of art in cinemas. The characteristics of the film are in line with the expectations in film making. Cultural aspects in Brazil also play a huge role in determining the kind of film that is suitable for such a generation. In this case, it is noted criminality is a common feature of this society. One of the ways to express the gap between criminal and the justice system is through the use of reality productions or documentaries like in this case (Young 2003, p.38).\n\nThe Theme of Time\n\nThe use of time in the film helps in presenting the state of the country in an attempt to denounce crime and injustice taking place. Use of live telecast is a presentation of the reality in the present form. Elsewhere in this paper, the author has mentioned the use of temporality in images to identify the relationship between the film and time. The reader will agree that there are different time spans that have been used in the film, for example the chronological and the psychological time spans. All this will be looked into as the author addresses the use of temporality of images in the film (Young 2003, p.41).\n\nRealism\n\nAnother important theme that clearly comes out in the film Bus 174 is realism. Different films have used different methods to represent the reality in the world. Documentation has been widely used to represent real-life scenarios in a real world situation in the film Bus 174. Unlike the other methods which are predominantly used by other film producers, this film is able to capture the concept of reality. The film is said to always possess the present but according to Bazin,\n\nNo matter how long a film is, every frame at the instant of its projection portrays the present – a flashback may be supposed to be occurring in the “then” of the story but it is on the “now” of the screen, just as it was in the “now” of the present mind – and any written word rests on the page, or is read, in its present tense (Bazin 2009, p. 52).\n\nThe film uses time to represent events that took place long time ago. For instance, the director tells us about the past of the hijacker and which made him carry out the awful act. Theorists would say that film represents only the presentness. This does not imply that the film does not have the capacity to use time scale. Use of time scale enables the journalists from the Brazilian television crew to follow the events and analyse why they took place. Bazin who is an experienced theorist on matters that concern film confirms this, arguing,\n\nWe shall begin, necessarily, with the photographic image, the primitive element of the ultimate synthesis, and go on from there to outline, if not a theory of film language based on the hypothesis of its inherent realism, at least an analysis which in no way contradicts it (Bazin, 1958 p.59).\n\nThis statement is inconsistent with the fact that for the medium to be effectively presented, the images needs to be manipulated to fit in the mind of the viewer and to make sense while extracting truth. This inherent reality influences the work of the director in the film Bus 174 where he has the ability to manipulate the images to reflect what is happening beyond the filmic world for the viewers.\n\nThe author of this paper introduced the reader to the film which is the main focus of this study. A brief introduction to the film Bus 174 was provided including a synopsis which was put into perspective to make sure that when the author embarks on the analysis of the film in relation to medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film, the reader will understand fully where the author is coming from. The author has also shed light on some of the themes in the film.\n\nIn the next chapter, the author is going to engage the reader in a discourse touching on the concepts of medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film with special focus on the film Bus 174 . The relationship between film and other artistic media such as photography, video and television among others will also be analysed.\n\nMedium Specificity, Life, Death and Temporality of Images in Film\n\nIntroduction\n\nHaving discussed the film Bus 174 in the previous section, the researcher will now turn to the issue of medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in media and especially in film. Special focus will be given to Bus 174 given that it is the case for this study.\n\nFilm as an art is a process through which static or motionless objects are put into motion (Uroskie 2003, p. 2). The images are then recorded in a photographic film with the help of a camera. The pictures may also be put into motion through the use of animation techniques which is also a way of making films.\n\nMedium Specificity: An Overview\n\nMedium specificity is the nature of any photographic techniques that are use to put images into motion. Medium specificity exists in two different components which are internal and comparative components. Comparative medium specificity compares what a given medium is capable of doing compared to other media. This is for example what a canvas used in drawing is capable of doing as compared to a screen used in film. The film Bus 174 is an analysis of a live news telecast which is streamed through more than one channel in Brazilian televisions. This is different from a canvas that is used by an artist in capturing an image.\n\nInternal medium on the other hand allows the medium to perform different actions in areas of its specificity. Doing better in this context is the live documentation of images in the film. Compared to other predominantly used film categories, documentation has been used perfectly to address the desire of pointing out the social menace in the country.\n\nThe art of film making is to be found in different cultures in the world. This diversity gives rise to specific artistic characteristics that vary from one culture to the other. This means that the film industry as an artistic media is appreciated by people from different cultural backgrounds. Film has been used to portray the kind of culture adopted by a particular society. For example in the film Bus 174 there are various cultural traits that are expressed by the film. On the other hand, the film affects culture by altering the behavioural patterns of people in the society (Uroskie 2003, p. 3).\n\nTo this end, film as an artistic media is used in different ways. It is both a source of entertainment and an educational tool too. In most cases, it has been used to instil cultural values in members of the society in a given country.\n\nThe author of this paper notes that film is a collection of images referred to as frames. It is noted that most of the times, these images stick to the mind of the individual viewer even after it has been removed.\n\nMedium Specificity in Film\n\nIn chapter one, the author defined medium specificity as a process whereby art is constituted to reflect all the characteristics of the raw material. This concept is linked to modernism even though it appeared in the art scene much earlier with the contribution of veteran artists such as Clement Greenberg. He encouraged the use of the term by film and art critics to analyse both aesthetics and art itself (Cubitt et al. 2012, p. 4). Manipulation of characters in a given work of art with the view of reflecting the medium is the basis of medium specificity. Bus 174 is an example of film that has several attributes which indicate or represent medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film.\n\nAn objective view of reality is presented in the film by using a direct mode of cinema to reflect the actual and live activities in the film. The footage allows Sandro’s actions to be viewed live but his actions cannot be explained. The director uses the direct interview medium by digging into the past to explain the current actions of the hijacker. The media presence in the location influences Sandro’s actions, motivating him and giving him confidence in what he is doing.\n\nMedia presence has been used by the director to report on the firsthand information without even editing the actions. This tells how medium specificity has been manipulated to give the viewer a personal interpretation of the reality in Brazil. Elements of medium specificity are used in the film to depict the unknown events behind the hijacking incidence. The insight is achieved by interviews as well as testimonies to show medium specificity.\n\nDocumentaries have made it possible to employ medium specificity in films and other forms of art. It makes it possible to develop and employ features that are used in fiction and narrative forms of art. Features have been used to replace lies and with the emergence of technology, observers and members of the audience are not given the opportunity to interpret the contents of the film (Bernstein 2012, p. 17). Several theorists have contested the fact that directors working in the production of a given film need to be guided by their own vision in the process. This gives the observers a chance to employ an array of analytical techniques as they evaluate and criticise the work of the writer and the director of the film.\n\nRelationship between Media Images, Life, Death and Temporality in the Context of Bus 174\n\nDeath in film is a realistic phenomenon that needs to be captured with professionalism. Medium specificity as it has been analysed elsewhere in this paper requires the image to represent the view as it would have appeared in a real life situation. For example a reality show illustrates all the scenes as they occur in a real life situation. Images are not manipulated to suit the viewer’s interpretations but to allow the director to express his vision in the film (Campany 2009, p. 25).\n\nThe film Bus 174 was recorded two years after the hijacking incident took place. The directors found it important to refine the images to suit the cinematic view required for the film. This required appropriate sound effects with background information leading from one incident to the other. This way, the director was able to give the images life, depicting the close relationship between images and life. The quality of images is complemented by the quality of the background sound in the film. In other words, the sounds give life to the images.\n\nDeath is also a theme in the film as it is illustrated by the hijacker. He uses fellow human beings to shield himself from the police. As the police from the park approach Nascimento from behind, he fires at them but misses his target. Instead, the lady Nascimento was using as a shield was shot in the face. Death in the film takes a temporal part as the incidence shows that the hijacker is determined to kill. But his actions demonstrate something different from what the audience is expecting from him. Instead of killing the lady, Nascimento uses his hands to embrace the lady on her neck. All these scenarios depict life and death and they are used to illustrate the behaviour of the images used in the film (Campany 2009, p. 19). In such scenes, it is noted that the director is using images to express life and death. From an abstract perspective, it is noted that the director is able to create a link between life, death and images. This is given the fact that images are used to illustrate life and death.\n\nTemporality is another aspect of this film. It has been used in the documentary to illustrate the truth by building on the evidence gathered from the scene as opposed to contradictions from various individuals in the area whom are interviewed by the media. Even though they give all that information, the viewers are taken back to the hijack scene which where the director shows them the kind of person the hijacker is.\n\nRelationship between Film and other Forms of Media such as Video, Photography and Television\n\nFilm is related to other forms of media in many ways. The author of this paper is going to focus on just a few aspects which will help in analysing how the film Bus 174 is related to the other forms of media. Camera Lucida which is associated with Bathes illustrates the tautological aspect of photograph as a form of art. To put it in another way, photographs display “…….along with them their own reference ” (Bernstein 2012, p 12). The observer does not need explicit details to reference the image on the photograph.\n\nTelevision on the other hand is another way through which motion pictures as well as still objects are displayed. In many cases, television is a stream of live objects and events as they occur in the environment. Television is different from film since the images and other aspects like background sound and background information have been refined. To this end, it can be argued that the life, death and temporality of images in film vary from that of images in television. This is given the fact that the directors give the images life using different strategies. The background sound and information which are used to give the images life vary between film and television. As noted earlier, the background sound and information in television is more refined than it is in films.\n\nRegardless of these subtle differences, both film and television present the viewer with information. But television images lack the multiple interpretations that are present in film images. To this end, it can be argued that images in television are more temporal as compared to images in films such as Bus 174. On this point, theorists contend that film directors should have a personal vision of the film.\n\nVideo is closely related to film as a form of art. It is noted that the relationship between video and film is closer than that between film and other forms of artistic media such as television. After episodes of the ‘bus174’ incident were streamed live in the televisions, most of the audience did appreciate the concerns of the young man who had hijacked the bus. Two years later the episode was crafted into a cinematic form of art so as to capture other aspects such as sound, light and even background activities (Gaut 2010, p. 7).\n\nIn this chapter, the researcher analysed some of the attributes of film as an artistic medium. To this end, the researcher looked at aspects such as medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film. Bus 174 was used as the point of reference for this chapter and of course the whole paper.\n\nIn the next chapter, the researcher will analyse film theory from the perspective of different scholars. The agreements and disagreements between these authors will be analysed and where possible, efforts made to resolve them.\n\nFilm Theory and Bus 174\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe basic concept in a film is the ability to give human mind another opportunity to record what was viewed even after the actual viewing has taken place. This is what is referred to as the indexical relationship between the images in reference to life and death in the film. However, documentaries in general lack the ability to present the incident and imagery concept of the events. Hence there is need to manipulate the images to achieve the aspect of medium specificity in the film Bus 174.\n\nThe film starts with raw news telecast live but more events are incorporated as the film goes on. The director of the film imposed the use of archived news’ casts to balance between current narration and past incidents. Film theory comes into play with reference to Barthes Roland in the use of myth as a language in the film. In this case, use of narration is blocking or dehistoricising the documentation process. In the current media process, archival footage is the living evidence of all aspects of viewing. Young D. defines archival footage as…..…recovered actuality footage incorporated into a secondary text… that was not recorded for the specific purpose of being included in the film……. (p.4)\n\nThe postmodern documentary has given film directors a myriad of options since they can fabricate images and truths to achieve reduced distinction between fiction and documentary. Analysing Roland’s myth theory today and its implications in the film Bus 174, the author finds that there is the significant use of initial raw material. As far as myths are concerned, there is need to present them in a collection of signs that are important to the entire process. For example, the director of the film Bus 174 talks about the prison guards but according to theory of myths, it is all about the corrupt political regime. On the second collection of signs implicating myth, the director of the film talks about the former news footage archives by stating that the prison guards are always corrupt (Bernstein 2012).\n\nTheoretical frameworks have been used in film studies to analyse several aspects of film as a form of art (Bazin 1978, p. 4). Ricciotto Canudo is one of the earliest scholars to have come up with theoretical frameworks in film studies. His first theory was applied on the birth of the sixth art. Other theorists have argued that film is different from reality but they agree on the fact that film is a valid form of art (Bazin 1978, p. 8). Just like paintings, music, sculptures or videos, a film is used to represent the reality in the society and as such, it can be said to be a true form of artistic media.\n\nFrom these arguments emerged Bazin’s theory which differed from other theories as he contended that film was able to manipulate reality “……..and not different from reality as the other theorists argued” (Bazin 1999, p. 54). He argued on the basis of reality hence the emergence of the realist theory. Though there are other recent theoretical frameworks which are significantly different, in this section the researcher is going to dwell on Bazin’s classical film theory in attempts to analyse the film Bus 174 .\n\nAndre Bazin’s Film Style Theory\n\nAlthough Bazin died in 1958, his contribution becomes an important aspect in this film through his expertise in film concepts. His works has elicited criticism from all sides and it becomes important in analysing this film. As a theorist, he is a person to reckon with when it comes to matters to do with film concepts. Film theory entails looking for correspondence between images and realities when the camera is rolling.\n\nThis kind of concept is being used in films today. According to Bazin, it restricts stylistic manipulation in attempts to fabricate the images. Bazin’s argument in this theory is based on ethical consideration. For example, the ethical issues in Brazil play an important role in the context of Bazin’s theory of film.\n\nThe film also makes use of cinematography where it utilises the concept to bring into focus the views of all people and exhaust the information. Other models as far as realism is concerned include documentary, Italian, neo-realism and finally the perceptual realism.\n\nRealism in general expresses the existence of reality in human life. The existence of reality varies from one individual to the other and from one place to the other. This is to say that what is considered reality in one society or community may not be regarded as such in another society. For example in the film Bus 174, crime and police brutality are depicted as realities in the Brazilian society. This may not be the case in other societies in the world (Bazin 1999, p.31).\n\nThe philosophy of realism has been narrowed down to include reality in theatrical arts. Bazin being one of the philosophers as well as a film critic in early society has made major contributions to film theory. His contributions have influenced other people in the field.\n\nBazin has come up with many arguments and contends that film is supposed to exhibit multiple interpretations to capture the mind of the observer. He did not agree with other theorists such as Pudovkin who claimed that film making encompasses the use of hypothetical points of view. This is limited to observers in the film. On the contrary, Bazin approached the point by stating that film makers need to focus more on the film’s starting point. Even though this approach was ideal in the film making industry, Bazin opposed Pudovkin’s arguments (Bazin 2009, p. 22).\n\nBazin argues for sound manipulation to bring to bear the aspect of temporality of images in film and other artistic media. This is the basis of realism as there will is no intention of creating expressions to drive the point home. In addition, there is also the importance of applying space and depth to create reality as opposed to director’s point of view. In the case of the Bus 174 , the directors used various strategies to address the view of the observers. For example have the media interview members of the public are a move to show that interpretation of events is left to the observer and not the director. In this case, it is the director’s vision which will be used if the viewer interprets the scenario.\n\nSeveral social aspects are evident in the film and the director has used visions display them to the public. The public is then left to interpret the issues and problems in the society as the reality is presented in almost all telecast media in the Brazil. Bazin’s views can be used to interpret the events taking place in the film. He further argues that the film makers should rather use reality as opposed to image. He draws a sharp distinction between those directors who use image and the others who use reality in their film (Bazin 2009, p. 23). Reality is very much evident in the film used as case study in this research. The film has captured the real life scenarios as they took place on the ground. Of further significance is the fact that the images were moulded live on the national televisions. The viewers were able to give their opinions regarding what was happening in the scene, both in the real life situation and in the film scenario. To this end, it can be argued that the film directors were able to give the images life by eliciting the interest of the members of the public.\n\nBazin continues to argue that reality gives a film the credit that it deserves. On the other hand he accepts the fact that films are moulded on montage foundation even though the still images are not sufficient to create film scenes without the help of juxtaposition (Bazin 2009, p. 24). Editing of the film images denies them the ability to depict reality and hence the realism theory.\n\nBazin’s theory contains elements that support reality. One of it is the use of sound and sound effects. In the film Bus 174 sound is altered to capture the explosion of bullets and how they were fired. Sound is also evident where the crowd yells at the police to kill Nascimento.\n\nThe dramatic acts in the film are not exaggerated at all unlike the justice system in Brazil which is exaggerated to capture the attention of the viewers. This is what Phadilha (the director of the film) is trying to show. The viewers are expected to pick on the contradicting reports that the police are giving concerning the case of the hijacker. The environment of the film is natural as there are no artificial items or aspects introduced in the setting. The medium takes the viewer through a series of scenes including the life in Brazilian slums and some of the reasons that drove Nascimento to commit the crime.\n\nThe onlookers on the scene cannot see this but those following the events on national televisions can interpret what is happening from one act to the other. Bazin’s theory in such a case argues to the contrary indicating that in an artificial film the images have been manipulated to influence the viewers’ interpretations. The film in this case is appropriate as it allows the viewers to make open ended interpretations.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses of Bazin’s Theory in the Context of Bus 174\n\nBazin’s theory has some strengths and weaknesses which are clearly seen throughout his arguments. The major strength is the ability of the theory to identify ethical issues in the society, like those depicted in the film Bus 174. Here, the emphasis is on the film maker and the viewer who is able to support refute the events going on in the society, giving them a chance to correct them. This is the main strength of the theory as far as this film is concerned.\n\nAnother important and vital ingredient of the theory and which is employed in the film is the ability to use the three dimensional concept. This is from a perceptual point of view another form of realistic theory. In addition, acoustic information is relayed in a very clear manner as opposed to other film concepts in different film theories. The theory’s focus on cinematography gives the director the chance to convey the information relating to every day’s life.\n\nIn spite of this, the theory contains some weaknesses that may negatively affect the arguments made and its contributions to this film. First, the concept typifies only a small number of films which makes it difficult for different directors to use the same concepts in address issues across the continuum.\n\nTransformative elements deny the film the ability to depict some important events and this represents another weakness of Bazin’s theory of realist. For example, the onlookers can only see what is happening but they are not filled in on what led to the action. They angrily support the police encouraging them to kill the hijacker. But with the media around the scene, the hijacker is confident enough as he is aware that the world is watching. Those who are watching through the media are provided with information unlike the onlookers (Bernstein 2012, p. 22).\n\nIn his film theory, Bazin contradicts his interpretations of film as an artistic media. To begin with he brings the montage aspect into scrutiny and denounces the aspect of editing. He argues that editing of the images deny the viewer the chance to interpret the correct and real scenarios in the field. The life of the film images is affected by the editing or so Bazin argues. This being the case, he agrees that the use of montage has given the directors an opportunity to help the viewers make adequate and accurate conclusions about the themes of the film.\n\nThe whole of Bazin’s classical theory as far as film is concerned places more emphasis the reality of imagery art. This is where the strength of the theory lies. He contended that the director needs to address his vision in the film and on the other hand the observers or members of the audience need to employ multiple interpretation techniques to make sense of what is happening to the real objects. In the case of the film used in this study reality is expressed where the director of the film tries to theorise on the life of the rich people as well as the poor people in a Brazilian society. The conflict between crime and justice the justice system is a normal occurrence for the low earning citizens of the Brazilian society. The rich do not use bus to commute between work and home. This being the case, it can be argued that Nascimento hijacked poor people to whom he is related. The justice system in the country is seen to be strict and hard on the poor people too. The lady is shot when the police officers on the scene are trying to kill Nascimento. Bazin’s theory at this juncture gives the viewers the opportunity to ponder on what befalls a particular group of people in the society.\n\nHaving looked at Bazin’s classical film theory, the author will now shift their attention to other contemporary film theorists and relate their arguments to the film bus 174 .\n\nContemporary Film Theorists\n\nRoland Barthes\n\nRoland Barthes is another important figure as far as literary theory is concerned. His theories have been applied in different fields in spite of the fact that he was a writer. One of his major influences in artistic media comes from his theory explaining the various attributes of photography. This theory plays an important role in this case study. He showed that photography could be used to reveal naturalistic truths in a particular society.\n\nTo this end, he engaged himself in writing about photography and the issues surrounding this form of artistic medium. Some of his works include the camera Lucida which postulates the use of image and interpretation of the same. Two words emerge in Barthes’ interpretation of a photograph as a medium. These are stadium and punctum where the latter implies the symbol used to represent truth while the former implies interpretation of the photograph on the part of the viewer.\n\nThe contributions made by this theorist were instigated by his mother’s death after which he resolved to use photography to investigate and learn more about nature. To this end he used photography to show how the image can affect the spectator. The interaction between the viewer and the image gives the latter an aura of life, death and temporality.\n\nAs the researcher has already stated in this paper, the stadium was a representation of the cultural aspect of the photograph. This idea can be used to analyse the film used as the case for this study. The use of photography in the film Bus 174 has elicited mixed reactions and tension from the observers. As the media delves into the live interviews, photographic images were used to illustrate the different forms of life within and without the Brazilian society.\n\nThe other term punctum depicts the close relationship between the hijacker and the environment within which the crime was committed. Therefore, Roland attempts to bring out the relationship between the object in the photograph and the surrounding environment. This is how he gives his images life.\n\nThe camera Lucida compilation was like a eulogy for his mother. Reality was used here as the theorist used photographic images to reflect death. It is also important to note that Roland died shortly after publishing his work. Here, a link between photographic image and death is evident as it appears that the scholar wrote his own eulogy using the images in the photographs.\n\nBus 174 brings to life all the scenes that were captured as live images on camera. Viewers are given the chance to see the events live as they occurred on the ground. Temporality of images in the film appears to hog the limelight as far as Roland’s Camera Lucida is concerned. Documentary is at its best when the temporality of images depicts the realist nature of the film. It is noted that reality in this case is captured and appears in the form of medium specificity.\n\nLaura Mulvey and Ann Doane: A Critique of Cinematic Concepts\n\nThe feminist models are part of theories that are suggested in making a film. In making a film, gender is used to depict incidences that postulate preferences which can connect various issues in the film. For example, the film Bus 174 has used women to link social practices and mentalities. The images of women used in the film are put there by men. The good thing with this theory is that it insists on gender preferences used to drive the interaction of images from one point to another in the film. Hence, Laura Mulvey and Ann Doane are important theorists in this film.\n\nThese two scholars are feminist theorists contesting the cinematic apparatus used in the film to make women appear as the major objects of attraction. Mulvey argues that women are specifically identified as objects to be desired. No wonder the hijacker used a female school teacher to distract the attention of the police and to avoid being shot. On their part, the police fired and unfortunately the woman was killed. The documentary vividly depicts this aspect when the director attempts to provide a reflection on the position of women in the society. Reality speaks for itself as the woman falls down on being shot.\n\nMulvey’s works on visual pleasure and narrative cinema argue that men are seen as the ones driving the film, making it move forward. Mulvey and her colleagues thought that cinematic concepts are supposed to portray a symbolic medium in which the audience are portrayed as bourgeois objects . To further support their arguments, a psychoanalysis approach centering on gender as a visual apparatus is adopted. Ann Doane on the other hand likens this to a visual gaze as men are identified as the spectators in this case.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nHaving looked at the case study carefully, it is now time to draw conclusions as far as medium specificity, life, death and temporality of images in film is concerned. In relation to the film Bus 174 , the researcher notes that there are several conclusions that can be drawn from the whole documentary.\n\nBus 174 clearly illustrates how facts and images are represented in both televisual as well as cinematic artistic media. As far as televisual presentation of images is concerned, it is noted that facts have been captured and telecasted live to almost all televisions networks in Brazil. This gave the viewers a chance to have a personal encounter or experience with the actual event that was taking place. The media personnel were strategically placed together with their instruments to be able to capture all the events that were taking place (Gaut 2010, p. 18).\n\nTelevisual aspect is illustrated with the use of actual images as the camera captures them and creates photographs from the events taking place in the field. It is not fiction per se as it is obvious that most of the scenes have not been interfered with. Questions arose from the film as the episodes continued to be aired. Journalists continued to interview people and this seemed to lead them into the truth of the matter. Police were interviewed as well together with the street children who provided the observer with an opportunity to interpret social decomposition in the society. There was no editing carried out to manipulate the images for the sake of the audience. This exposed the truth behind the event through a discourse on sobriety.\n\nPost modern cinema has been used mainly to reflect the culture of post modern society. On its part, Bus 174 appears to illustrate modernism in the society as opposed to post modernism. This society is characterised by many people with different needs leading to mass consumption. The consumption changes with technology and the use of reality documentaries illustrates the true nature of all the scenes without creating illusions. This is what modernism requires and the documentary seems to achieve it fully.\n\nViolence in contemporary society is also reflected along with other social problems. If fiction was used to create this artistic medium, the information provided may not have exposed what really exists in the society today. Temporality of images comes to the rescue and enhances the ability of medium specificity to present the truth to the audience. For cinematic purposes, the visual element is represented through the use of temporality to address aspects such as background sound, lighting and such others. This is where the difference between televisual casting and cinematic presentation comes in. Both are films drawn from a real life event but adjustments are made to include sounds and lighting to create surreal scenery that closely resembles the real environment (Gaut 2010, p. 21).\n\nThere is no need to manipulate the Images in both cases. However, cinematic presentation alters the blurred images to reflect actual ones as they would appear in the initial place or the material they were harvested from. The cultural ambiguities and controversies that exist are illustrated well in the cinematic presentation of images. For example the rise of a hero is substituted with anti heroism to misrepresent the social problems. It could have been appropriate if the hijacker was able to present the views of the downtrodden members of the society like himself rather than attacking his ilk.\n\nFinally, self reflective components give the film an aesthetic touch as the images that are deemed to be against the law are made open to the viewers. Bus 174 was perfect for this because it captured the attention of the viewers as well as the aesthetics of the situation. In addition dramatic elements and suspense contributed significantly to the success of the film.\n\nReferences\n\nBazin, A 1978, Orson Welles: a critical view, Harper and Row, New York.\n\nBazin, A 1999, The evolution of the language of cinema, Free Press, New York.\n\nBazin, A 2009, What is cinema?

      "Talent Shortage in the United States Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Skill Shortage Will Remain\n 3. The Paradigm Issue of Training Programs\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nSkill shortage is a pressing issue for the United States (US) manufacturing sector. ManpowerGroup (2020) notes that “talent shortages in the U.S. have more than tripled in a decade” (para. 1). At the same time, industries that require fewer skills continue to be outsourced to other countries such as China and Mexico (AP Archive, 2017). The need for a skilled workforce in business actors and a large number of unemployed workers lacking the necessary modern manufacturing skills have prompted many companies to develop training programs to fill the skill shortage. The question that arises is whether the measures taken are effective.\n\nSkill Shortage Will Remain\n\nThe truth is that training does not reduce talent shortage; even companies themselves are aware of this. According to Gaskell (2021), “firms seem unable or unwilling to invest more than they currently are in training their workforce” (para. 20). It is primarily due to significant financial costs associated with the development, implementation, and maintenance of the training program. Moreover, it was found that businesses prefer to recruit new employees because they already have the necessary skills (Gaskell, 2021). Simply put, they exchange work experience for specialized skills. However, the patterns mentioned above are characteristic of the European industrial sector.\n\nThe Paradigm Issue of Training Programs\n\nThe state of affairs in the USA is not much better. New high-tech and automated production facilities have significantly increased the number of jobs, but not the number of employable laborers (AP Archive, 2017). It is probably due to the current international paradigm of the training program, which is workplace safety training (Gaskell, 2021). If companies focus on training specialized skills, the trend may change.\n\nReferences\n\nAP Archive. (2017). US plants struggle to fill skilled positions [Video]. YouTube.\n\nGaskell, A. (2021).

      "Symmetric Encryption: Data Encryption Standard Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Strengths\n 3. Weaknesses\n 4. Opportunities\n 5. Threats\n 6. Summary: SWOT Analysis\n 7. Conclusion\n 8. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nDigital technology has revolutionized the way human beings and corporations pursue their economic goals. Since the 1940s, the world has relied on emerging systems to produce information that could be coded and decoded depending on the goals of the user. As the level of data application and access increased, the demand for encryption has grown in an attempt to make information on different platforms and databases more secure. This trend led to the creation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in the 1970s. Such an idea was founded on the original algorithm that Horst Feistel had created five years earlier (Sivakumar et al., 2017). IBM managed to develop more advanced encryption for the National Bureau of Standards. Consequently, DES became a superior version developed using differential cryptanalysis (Sivakumar et al., 2017). This creation makes it a symmetric-key algorithm that supports the encryption and subsequent protection of digital information or data (Daimary & Saikia, 2015). It has a short key characterized by 56 bits.\n\nBefore the development of DES, a hardware security module (HMS) was the common method for protecting devices both offline and online. This innovation relied on the power of a personal identification number (PIN) to grant access. Since this technology was owned by a single person named Mohamed Atalla, it became necessary for different institutions and stakeholders to consider the need for a standardized model that led to the development of the DES standard (Daimary & Saikia, 2015). This encryption method works by relying on a similar key to decrypt or encrypt the intended message. The approach means that the sender and the reader or receiver need to be in possession or aware of the private key (Sivakumar et al., 2017). It fits in with the prior technology since it only added additional features to maximize security through a better and advanced encryption strategy.\n\nStrengths\n\nThe DES model presents several strengths or advantages that make it an effective encryption technology. First, it is founded on a 56-bit key, something that makes it a relatively secure model (Daimary & Saikia, 2015). The argument behind this idea is that it would take hackers or criminals a long time before they guess or enter the right key to access the safeguarded data (Sivakumar et al., 2017). Second, the notion of having the same function that only needs reversal during decryption makes it convenient for hardware and software match or configuration (Sivakumar et al., 2017). Computer technologists would, therefore, find the innovative idea easy to apply in a wide range of scenarios or settings. Third, triple-DES improves the security level of the original algorithm, thereby increasing the security level.\n\nWeaknesses\n\nAlthough DES has been in use for many years, it presents specific challenges and weaknesses that make it inappropriate in the modern-day technological world. For instance, it has short keys of 56 bits while advanced ones have more security attributes and long blocks (Princy, 2015). This issue means that it would apply to different ciphers using the same 56-bit key (Princy, 2015). Due to the nature of this drawback, the security risk of DES has continued to increase significantly. Although this technology lacks design or functional flaws, it remains inadequate in providing the relevant defense against hacking, replication, or unauthorized access. This challenge exists because it relies on short keys (Princy, 2015). The division of the plaintext block becomes another aspect that makes the DES system insecure.\n\nIn terms of performance, the encryption model is fast but incapable of maximizing protection. Users have been focusing on this gap to consider or introduce a superior system of encryption that is capable of delivering positive results (Hameed et al., 2018). Using the total cost of ownership (TCO), it is quite clear that the buyer or user of DES will be unable to get value for money after installing it for data privacy. The reasoning behind this argument is that the chances of unauthorized access increases significantly (Princy, 2015). The cost of deployment (COD) guides companies to understand the connection between a specific system and the overall ability to provide long-term financial gains (Princy, 2015). The DES encryption technology might have a low COD in comparison with modern systems, such as the Advanced Encryption System (AES). Finally, those who want to implement the DES model in their systems will be disadvantaged because more companies and institutions are pursuing superior methods to support data decryption and encryption.\n\nOpportunities\n\nThe nature of DES technology means that it presents various opportunities to those who rely on it for security purposes. The first outstanding one is that workers or employees would require additional training to be able to utilize it successfully and pursue their outlined organizational goals. The second opportunity is that more companies and institutions can capitalize on it to safeguard data without incurring unnecessary expenses (Patil et al., 2016). The third possible consideration is that many agencies or firms that rely on this technology will have to establish the right infrastructure. This achievement can prepare them for additional changes or replacements in the future. Such organizations will not spend more financial resources trying to acquire new systems to support the superior data encryption, innovation model. The fourth outstanding opportunity is that DES would still be relevant for emerging businesses and small firms shortly (Hameed et al., 2018). The ease of implementation, the reduced cost, and the ability to provide the intended security measures explain why such a prospect exists. Additionally, business organizations planning to sell their systems would encounter minimum challenges. Such an outcome is possible since DES remains applicable and recognizable in a wide range of industries or sectors across the globe.\n\nThreats\n\nModern technologies and innovations have been changing very fast due to the power of research and development (R&D). DES has continued to suffer a similar fate as more companies and users continue to consider emerging systems that can provide the best security. The weaknesses associated with it have led to the innovation and implementation of the AES. The use of 56 bits keys makes it vulnerable and ineffective for confidential data. Hackers, phishers, and programmers can break or access it much faster. The leading security issues include: easy to compromise, weak block, and brute-force attacks (Patil et al., 2016). The major legal concern is that firms that implement DES stand a chance to be sued if hackers access private data and use it for malicious purposes.\n\nAdditionally, the established data privacy standards in many regions no longer recognize DES as an effective system (Alemami et al., 2019). Such a gap explains why many countries have gone further to consider the effectiveness of the AES system (Sivakumar et al., 2017). This trend is possible since AES has better features and is incapable of being breached (see Figure 1). This encryption method encounters numerous deployment concerns since a smaller number of businesses and organizations rely on it (Patil et al., 2016). This gap makes it impossible for users to link their systems and achieve their goals. Due to the nature of this threat, many individuals and leaders have been keen to identify and implement advanced encryption systems that can be deployed at the international level.\n\nSummary: SWOT Analysis\n\n                                                                                   STRENGTHS                                                                                                                                                     WEAKNESSES                                                                                                                                              \n                                                                                    1.

The outlined summary can guide different professionals and engineers to focus on the strengths of DES and capitalize on the existing opportunities to develop a superior encryption system that can compete successfully in the market with AES. Such a move will encourage more people to implement the advanced version and eventually achieve the anticipated business goals.\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Alemami, Y., Mohamed, M. A., & Atiewi, S. (2019).

      "Digital Marketing Strategy for India Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe digital space has become one of the most lucrative marketplaces for most organizations in the 21st century. As a modern company, Lee’s Artificial Flowers greatly benefits from online marketing and sales. Currently, most of the company’s inventory sales come from its website, which implies that it is gaining a lot from online activities. To effectively enter and dominate more international markets, it will be instrumental for the firm to develop and apply critical digital marketing strategies.\n\nPart One: India’s Demographics\n\nOne of the most lucrative international markets that Lee’s Artificial Flowers can consider investing in is the Indian market. India is one of the most populated countries globally, with approximately 1.39 billion people as of January of 2021 ( List of industries in India , 2021). The population of internet users in the country in January 2021 was 624 million, which was about 8.2% more than the population registered in the same period in the previous year (“ National Account Statistics Releases 2020, 2021 ”). The country’s economy has been relatively stable; in the 2020 financial year, the economy recorded a gross domestic product (GDP) of 2.708.77 billion U.S. dollars which was a slight deviation from the 2,870.5 billion U.S. dollars GDP recorded in the year 2019 (“ National Account Statistics Releases 2020, 2021” ). The population of the country, its enormous internet users, and the high GDP make it an appropriate international market for Lee’s Artificial Flowers.\n\nThere are other notable trends that India, similar to other countries of the world, has adopted, making it a viable international market for the company. For instance, business-to-consumer (B2C) e-commerce is widely embraced in India. Factors such as the increased use of smartphones, high penetration of the internet in urban and rural areas, and hectic lifestyles, among others, have contributed to the popularity of (B2C) e-commerce in India (Kalia et al., 2021). The average online spending in India has been on a sharp rise since 2014. The average online spending in India in 2020 was significant at approximately 64 billion U. S dollars. India’s annual commercial retail sales have also been impressive in the past years ( List of industries in India , 2021). In 2020, the Indian Brand Equality Foundation (IBEF) estimated the country’s Annual commercial retail sales to be 883 billion U.S. dollars ( List of industries in India , 2021). From all the factors analyzed above, it is evident India has numerous market opportunities for the company.\n\nThe concept of network readiness is highly instrumental in the determination of appropriate international markets to venture into. Network readiness reflects a country’s ability to use Information, Communication Technologies (ICT) to improve its wellbeing and competitiveness in the global market. It is also a fundamental indicator showing the performance of a country in the digital world. In 2019, India ranked at position 79 in the Network Readiness Index (Dutta & Lanvin, 2019). Challenges affecting the extension of ICT skills and access to the general population explain the position, although the country still can make significant improvements.\n\nOnline Market Places in India\n\nThere are numerous online marketplaces in India, although the most dominant ones include Amazon and Flipkart, which deal in general products and Myntra, which focuses on fashion products. Snapdeal, Shopclues, Meesho, Paytm mail, Limeroad, and Pepperfry are among other online marketplaces on the rise dealing with general, homeware, and fashion products in the country. Despite the availability of various marketplaces, there are still several challenges that the company may experience should it decide to operate in the Indian market. Inadequate digital literacy is a significant challenge limiting the e-commerce performance in the country (Kumar et al., 2018). Again, infrastructural development in the country is still poor, leading to connectivity problems in some parts of the country, affecting e-commerce (Kalia et al., 2021). The consumer perception may be another potential problem for the business since a significant Indian population still believe that e-commerce transactions may be exposing them to various threats (Kumar et al., 2018). Having a clear understanding of the potential challenges is important because it prepares the company for the possible challenges which may impede performance.\n\nLee’s Artificial Flowers Digital Marketing Strategy\n\nSearch engine marketing (SEM)\n\nSEM is one of the marketing strategies that will help the company’s website be more visible to potential customers in the Indian market. It will be prudent to consider adopting SEM with Google since it is the most vibrant search engine in the country.\n\nSearch Engine Optimization (SEO)\n\nThe search is an instrumental part of the online presence. Therefore, SEO will be a perfect part of the digital strategy because it will enable the company to effectively rank its target phrases and keywords so that the clients can easily reach it (Suleiman et al., 2020). Some of the best SEO companies in India which Lee’s Artificial Flowers should consider working with include Growth Hacker Digital, RankZ, and Seotonic Web Solution PVT Ltd.\n\nAffiliate Marketing\n\nLee’s Artificial Flowers should develop a digital affiliate program to ensure effective marketing of its products in the digital space. The existing affiliate programs in India, such as the Flipkart affiliate, Amazon Associates, vComission, and BigRock Affiliate, are working excellently for the online companies. With a commission of between 5% to 30%, Lee’s Artificial Flower should succeed in establishing the program.\n\nSocial media\n\nOnline sales have proved to be better for the company in the past. Thus, the company needs to maintain a 24-hour social media presence. The company should have a team to continuously maintain social media posts to ensure the customers and potential clients are exposed to relevant and up-to-date content. The platforms on which the company must capitalize its resources include Facebook, Instagram, Youtube, Twitter, and Pinterest. Social media will improve the company sales within the Indian market and increase traffic on the firm’s website.\n\nMobile marketing\n\nThe company should embrace mobile marketing by sending weekly emails and Short Message Services (SMS) to clients. The company should also develop its application for clients to download and improve their interaction with the firm.\n\nEmail marketing\n\nLee’s Artificial Flowers should consider maintaining regular customer communication to thoroughly understand their clients and build a strong relationship with them. The company should send at least one email per week to the customers to keep them engaged, close deals much faster, and identify new opportunities in the market through the feedback received from the clients (Suleiman et al., 2020). One mail per week is reasonably good since a higher frequency of mails may be considered spam by the customers.\n\nEvaluation of digital marketing strategy results\n\nTo effectively evaluate the results of the digital marketing strategy, the company should focus on monitoring the changes in sales and the progress towards the strategic business goal. The traffic of the company’s website will also greatly inform the performance of the digital strategic strategy. Increase in sales and traffic on the website will reveal a positive impact of the digital marketing strategy while a decrease in the two factors may call for need to readjust the plan.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, it is highly instrumental for the company to adopt a digital marketing strategy as it focuses on getting into the Indian market because of the reasonably significant online presence of customers in the country. However, there is a need to exploit other none digital options of sales and marketing in the country because of the negative mentality of online business among a certain fraction of the citizens. It will also be necessary for the company to reinvent its digital marketing strategies to optimize its performance once it begins operation in the Indian market.\n\nReferences\n\nDutta, S., & Lanvin, B.

      "Non-Political Revolutions: France, China and Iran Presentation\n\nSocial Revolution\n\n  * Social movements and collective action in France.\n  * Occurring in the 1980-1990s.\n  * New forms of social mobilization for a variety of social issue.\n  * Meant to achieve social and economic goals without relying on existing political structures at the time.\n  * Focused not only addressing labor needs but key social constructs such as racism and income inequality. 1\n  * Collective action with a political stake combined with ideology.\n  * Generating social change and commitment to politics in order to secure.\n  * Redefying and reforming political and social structures.\n  * Tourainian perspective saw this action as society expressing rejection of existing systems. 2\n  * These collective action movements saw a change in the nature of society and culture in France as it became politically active.\n\nThe latter part of the 20th century saw a significant rise of “new” social movements in France, which not only defied conceptions of relative indifference to politics among the modern French society but shifted methodological and ideological perspectives on social change. These forms of mobilization highlighted the contemporary issues that French society struggles with and gave rise to a dynamic form of citizenship which is evident to modern day.\n\nThe social movements of the late 20th century in France have all the markings of a peaceful social revolution. It was a general social expression of contempt and rejection of the status quo, particularly of the political and social systems of governance meant to oversee areas that the population was dissatisfied with. It led to a transformation of certain political and social structures and the manner which society perceives its role in the political institutions guiding social policy.\n\nCultural Revolution\n\n  * China’s post-socialist transformation in the 1980-1990s.\n  * Reforms instituted by Deng led to ideological shift.\n  * Cultural transformation from Mao’s revolutionary past.\n  * Led to the capitalist and global economy known today.\n  * Reform paradigm shifted perspective of socialism.\n  * Both public perceptions and methods of governance changed. 3\n  * Radical transformation of China’s society, economy, and politics.\n  * Sociopolitical movement which addressed the social roots of discontent.\n  * Changed the cultural landscape for China’s population.\n  * Introduction of new ideologies and relaxation of restrictions. 4\n  * Reforms presented opportunity for growth and discussion for China’s future and its identity.\n\nDeng Xiaoping became the leader of the People’s Republic of China after the death of the infamous revolutionary Mao Zedong which established Communism in China just a few decades earlier. Deng began a series of socio-economic reforms which were initially meant to revitalize socialism but led to extensive cultural and social changes. The conditions of state repression and ideological appropriation changed to a socialism dogma that is more liberal and focuses on modernization of the country, both economically and socially.\n\nAlthough the term “cultural revolution” commonly applies to the movement by Mao to bring Communism to China, the events stirred by Deng reforms in the latter 20th century are often referred to as the second revolution in China. It was a rapid shift in ideology which sought to maintain socialism as a form of governance but greatly diverted from the oppression, economic isolation, and cultural protectionism that had been established by Mao. The socioeconomic changes created by Deng allowed the Chinese numerous freedoms ranging from advocating for better pay to access to Western cultural elements. It was a wholesome cultural revolution in the way of life and social perceptions.\n\nReligious Revolution\n\n  * The Islamic Fundamentalism movement.\n  * Confronts the modern and liberal Islam.\n  * Prime example: Iranian Revolution (1979), primarily religious than political.\n  * Established a first modern Islamic republic.\n  * Religion and state became integrated under clerical leadership. 5\n  * Unique as it lacked the common social conditions for a revolution.\n  * Definition of an Islamic fundamentalist revolution.\n  * It is a culturally determined political response to an external threat.\n  * Its outcome was the transformation of domestic politics.\n  * Achieved through religious means and extreme forms of fundamentalism.\n  * Transformed the religious, social, and political status quo in the country and region.\n\nIslamic Fundamentalism is based on the premise that society should function under highly conservative Sharia Law. Leading up to 1979, Iran was ruled by an authoritarian monarch Reza Shah who was increasingly pro-Western and supported secular Islam. Although political reasons were involved as well, the fundamentalist Islam groups cooperated to overthrow the government and religious leadership to establish an Islamic republic state ruled by a religious figure Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini. It was a swift, nonviolent, and non-traditional revolution, but created significant changes in Iran, not only religiously but reflected upon civil law.\n\nThe Iranian Revolution came about due to the public perception that the Shah government was an instrument of foreign intervention from the United States, both politically and socially. From an Islamic standpoint this was seen as moral corruption, incompatible with the religious beliefs of Islam. Combined with nationalistic movements, the revolution occurred based on Islamic fundamentalist structure which is an effective cultural response at a political level to eliminate this external influence. As a result, this led to the rise of a religiously centered and highly conservative leadership and social order.\n\nConclusion\n\n  * All three revolutions generally saw significant socio-political change.\n  * Revolutionary “action” was generated or influenced by the populations.\n  * Some political factor or leadership was involved.\n  * Systemic change occurred but differed on a top-down or bottom-up approach depending on the conditions.\n  * Outcomes of revolutions were successful.\n  * The revolutions described were largely non-violent.\n  * Outcomes resulted in a peaceful transition.\n  * Changing the status quo and nature of societal function.\n  * A reflection of population dynamics and political activism.\n  * Instigated by dissatisfaction of the population that resulted in transitional changes.\n\nAlthough the three revolutions discussed in this presentation are inherently differing in their nature and structure, they share many similarities including their intention to create meaningful socio-political change in the context of their unique conditions. The revolutions differ in their origins as one was a social movement, the other was driven by religious groups, and the other was actually instigated by the government itself. However, outcomes of generating systemic change was commonplace among all of them as the actions sought to resolve the unique issues facing each society.\n\nAmong these three types of revolutions, all of them were relative non-violent in their process and outcomes, which is vastly juxtaposed with the bloody political revolutions of the early 20th century. It was a peaceful transitional change of the status quo either in society, culture, or governing religion. This can be attributed to the fact that the revolutions were a reflection of population dynamics and increase political activism among populations that ensured a bottom-up approach to generating and accepting the outcomes of these swift and radical changes to the various political and social systemic factors.\n\nFootnotes\n\n 1.

      "An Anglo-American Republic: Racial Citizenship in 1760-1860 Essay\n\nThe anti-slavery organization in the Revolutionary period was attributed to the developing ideas of liberty that became modestly contagious. In the 1770s, led by Quakers such as John Woolman and Benezet, White Americans began a move toward the abolition of slavery. Many slave owners, in Virginia especially, were persuaded to free their human property during the Revolution and after. In addition, Black activists also inserted themselves into the anti-slavery movement by reminding that they participated in notable American battles, such as the battle of Yorktown. This showed that slaves were fighting not only for their personal freedom but also for their country’s freedom.\n\nThe concept of legal freedom is used in order to mark the difference of free individuals in their legal status compared to those who were enslaved and did not have and rights and privileges. Legally free African Americans, according to Ira Berlin, are slaves without masters. Even though Black individuals were legally not slaves, nonetheless, they had few of the rights available to European Americans (Spickard, 2007). Most of them could not vote, serve on juries, keep firearms, or testify against White citizens in court.\n\nThe Ohio Black Codes passed by the Ohio Constitution represented the laws that stipulated that only freed individuals with a valid certificate of freedom, which were obtained from the court, had the permission to reside in Ohio. The reconciliation of the Black Code with the founding principles of the Territory was linked to the idea that African Americans would still not have the same rights to own land and work as Whites. This was the mindset of the 19th century – while some Black Americans were granted freedom, their role in society did not reach the position held by White Americans. Richard Allen was an activist and abolitionist who founded the African Methodist Episcopal Church.\n\nThe Naturalization Act of 1790 was a law passed by the US Congress that set the initial uniform rules for granting citizenship in the country by naturalization. Later, the 1795 Act expanded the residence requirement to five years, adding that prospective applicants needed to give a three-year application notice. The central theme of American naturalization was that the law included only free white individuals, thus excluding any other minority representatives. This prompted the institutionalized oppression of the rights and needs of racial minorities. The naturalization ceremonies were considered important because a candidate had not only to be eligible but also appear in court, swear an oath of allegiance, and declare devotion to the Constitution.\n\nNative Americans were considered nature’s noble people, with their beliefs and traditions rooted in the nature around them. The appropriation of Native American culture by White Americans stemmed from the idea that the Natives do not have rights, opinions, and power. Therefore, the process of appropriating their culture was acceptable (Spickard, 2007). Chief Wahoo, the symbol of Cleveland Indians, fits into the cultural appropriation category because an Indian head is a symbol of genocide, and using its caricature is a mocking of mass murder. In reality of the 19th century, White Americans did not treat Native peoples very well, even despite the provisions of the Northwest Ordinance. White people in America wanted to capture as much Indian land as possible, and they wanted the tribes to be off the lands.\n\nReference\n\nSpickard, P. (2007).

      "Apple and Its Product Range in the UK Smartphone Market Coursework\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe history of Apple Inc. is closely tied to that of the technology industry, with the company being one of the best-recognized developers and sellers of smartphones, computers, and software. This multinational organization was founded in the United States in 1976, and at the present moment, it is considered a major contender in multiple technology markets (Giachetti 2017). In the smartphone segment, Apple Inc. has introduced many revolutionary ideas, leading trends in innovation and changing the way people perceive handheld devices. Nevertheless, the company’s success does not make it the leader in this segment of the market—Apple’s competitors also display varied strengths as well as opportunities for future growth. This report analyzes Apple’s place in the smartphone market in the UK, using SWOT, PEST, and strategic group mapping analyses to provide a foundation for making recommendations.\n\nOrganization and Product Line Description\n\nApple Inc. is a company that develops manufactures and sells electronics and software. The organization has also branched out into online services, offering subscriptions to its customers. A distinguishing feature of Apple’s products is that the company develops both hardware and software. For example, in the smartphone industry, Apple presents iPhones that are equipped with iOS, a unique operating system available for Apple devices only. The firm also sells a range of accessories for smartphones, designed to complement the features of the devices.\n\nNotably, the range of Apple products is much smaller than that of other companies. Currently, it offers such models as the iPhone Xr, iPhone Xs, and Xs Max, as well as iPhone 8 and iPhone 7. While older models can be found through some retailers, the company’s official website features the line of products listed ( iPhone 2019). Clearly, the selection of available Apple smartphones is limited, characteristic of all the product ranges of this company (Payne 2017). Furthermore, the models do not show evidence of any significant differences. In contrast to other firms’ phones, which often feature a wide variety of designs, colors, screen sizes, and—most importantly—price categories, Apple has introduced a line that is consistent in design while varying in some features. For instance, the only differences between iPhone Xs and iPhone Xs Max are the screen (and device) size and battery capacity. Similarly, other Apple phones have differences in screen size, resolution, battery capacity, and camera capabilities.\n\nMarket Condition and Current Competition in the UK Market\n\nComparing Apple and other companies in the smartphone industry along with other consumer electronics reveals many differences between the company and its competitors. Apple products are based on iOS, in contrast to smartphones from other companies that feature the Android operating system. In the UK, iPhones dominate the industry: statistics show that more than 40% of the national market share belongs to Apple iPhone ( Market share held by Apple iPhone 2019; Moskvitch 2018). The position of Apple products is leading to a steady increase in its influence in the UK electronics business arena (Figure 1). Overall, the latest figures show a decline in smartphone sales for all companies in the face of rising prices for devices (Field 2018). It is possible that Apple’s discontinuing its open sharing of sales numbers can be connected to market difficulties (Rotstein 2018; Titcomb 2018). While Android is a major iOS competitor, Android-based models come from different companies, allowing Apple to assume a position of power in the market.\n\nFigure 1: Market share held by Apple iPhone in Great Britain from 1st quarter 2011 to 4th quarter 2017\n\nOne of Apple’s major competitors, both locally and internationally, is Samsung, a South Korean company offering a wide variety of consumer electronics. Samsung develops smartphones that use Android OS; the firm’s wide range of models includes products from multiple price segments (Lovejoy 2017). For example, Samsung’s Galaxy product line offers smartphones that are very similar to iPhones in the features they provide. On the other hand, some of the phones the South Korean company produces are significantly cheaper, smaller, less powerful, or less equipped than iPhones. This allows Samsung to attract a wider variety of buyers, reaching audiences that Apple does not target (Gardere, Sharir & Maman 2018). Moreover, another recent competitor is continuing to gain international recognition. Huawei is a Chinese developer of consumer electronics that also offers products in low-, middle-, and high-price categories (Gibbs 2018). According to Sharma (2017), UK shares of Samsung and Apple were almost equal, each company accounting for around 34% of all smartphone sales in 2017. Huawei came in third with 13% of the smartphones bought by UK customers (Sharma 2017). While not as popular as the two other brands, Huawei’s standing in the global market continues to strengthen.\n\nAnalyses\n\nPEST\n\n  * Political: The ongoing political discussion regarding Brexit continues to affect all companies that are actively participating in UK markets. The fluctuation of the British pound is a politically influenced aspect that lowers Apple’s stability in the UK. The current uncertainty regarding the Brexit deal means that Apple and other smartphone companies are facing instability in product pricing.\n  * Economic: The abovementioned political change is affecting the national economy, challenging many local and international companies. Apple may need to review its pricing, affecting future buyers. Moreover, the laws and regulations that may potentially be accepted following changes to the relationship between other European countries and the UK may also affect Apple’s expenses and revenues.\n  * Social: Throughout the years, Apple has created a strong network of supporters and has increased brand loyalty, benefiting sales. However, reliance on customer choice may produce adverse effects in the future if customers should turn their attention to another brand or alter their values. Increasing societal interest in environmental conservation may also influence Apple’s advertising and manufacturing.\n  * Technological: Apple’s products are considered unique, innovative, and simple to use, all characteristics that have contributed to raising the company’s status. Nevertheless, reviewers have criticized Apple’s latest products for their lack of new substantial changes (Berendt, Uhrich & Thompson 2018; Bradshaw 2018). At the same time, the number of competitors whose products offer a similar set of characteristics and features continues to expand.\n\nThe results of the PEST analysis demonstrate how the current political and economic landscape of the UK has the potential to endanger Apple’s revenue growth. It is vital to note that a change in consumer preferences regarding retaining phones for longer periods of time along with their concern for the environment may also decrease sales numbers. Finally, the current staggering rate of innovation is another threat to the company’s profitability as Apple’s range of products remains highly limited.\n\nSWOT\n\nStrengths                                                                                                                                                    Weaknesses                                                                                                                                                                                                                             \n  * Customer loyalty                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n  * Devices’ interoperability                                                                                                                                  * High prices—Some latest models cost more than £1000 (Williams 2018)                                                                                                                                                                \n  * Brand recognition                                                                                                                                          * Overreliance on the concept—Steve Jobs’ passing affected Apple’s followers and weakened the connections formed during his tenure at the company.                                                                                   \n  * Exclusive positioning                                                                                                                                      * High exclusivity and incompatibility with some major services—while Microsoft and Android focus on accessibility across platforms, iPhone users may encounter problems when working with other devices (Lazareska & Jakimoski 2017)\n  * High profits (Ghosh 2017)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n  * Combination of unique hardware, software, and services (Fawzy & Olson 2018)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     \nOpportunities                                                                                                                                                Threats                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n  * Apple can use its stable markets such as the UK and the US and expand into new territories such as India (Khan, Alam & Alam 2015)                          * The emergence and growth of competitors that target other segments                                                                                                                                                                 \n  * Face ID, wireless charging and accessories, and other innovations may help iPhones to move into another phase of product development                       * Market saturation complemented with a rising similarity of smartphone features                                                                                                                                                     \n  * Apple Store—the assortment of Apple-provided services may expand to offer video and audio streaming to compete with other firms (White & Williams 2019)    * Stagnating innovation in the field (Sunnebo 2018)                                                                                                                                                                                  \n                                                                                                                                                               * Changes in the market; overall decline in smartphone sales                                                                                                                                                                         \n\n\nThe SWOT analysis reveals an unstable position for Apple in the face of increasing recognition for other brands. While the current reliance on brand loyalty and iPhone’s compatibility with other Apple products tend to support sales, the changing environment may quickly shift the focus of Apple’s platform to image and quality (Appiah, Ozuem & Howell 2017). Although competitors have begun to equip their smartphones with similar features at a lower price, Apple has continued to base its high prices on customer experience (Liu, Zhai & Chen 2018). The threat of high competitors’ saturation may increase as younger generations enter the market.\n\nStrategic Group Mapping\n\nFigure 2: Strategic group mapping for major smartphone selling companies\n\nCore Strategy Statement and Optimal Strategic Option\n\nThe provided analyses show that Apple is positioning its products differently from other companies’ approach, focusing on exclusivity, quality, a unique customer experience, and a network of products. The challenge facing Apple lies in the downturn in the smartphone market characterized by saturation and high competitiveness (Ahmed, Gull & Rafiq 2015; Field 2018). The company’s strategy should be aimed at achieving further growth and support of brand recognition and loyalty in the next five years (Lamberson & Page 2018). Apple should use their current place in the market while recognizing the new needs and concerns of customers by addressing the rising opportunities for ethical consumption and environmental protection. Here, the goal is growth; neither retrenchment (scaling down the scope of the company’s reach) nor consolidation (use of current resources) is necessary for Apple to survive (Bassell & Lambert 2018).\n\nIn contrast, by reaching additional markets and modifying its message to accommodate younger current consumers, Apple will be able to grow through partnerships and acquisition of new software. iPhones appeal to the younger generation; thus, it is vital for the company to engage in further analysis of emerging trends. Apple is relying on a competitive stance of differentiation, increasing competition between Samsung and Huawei without taking a direct role (Gibbs 2018). As a result, while its current strategic group should remain the basis, the company can add new customers and engage them in the process of transitioning from Android to iOS products.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple is a company that has created a brand image reflecting high quality, uniqueness, excellence, and spirit. People across generations use iPhones, and the products’ high cost does not dissuade returning customers who have shown a willingness to readily exchange older models for new ones. Apple’s pricing strategy is not based on competition from Samsung, Huawei, or other brands because the company embodies higher quality and a better user experience. This approach may, however, be detrimental to Apple’s future if the next generation of consumers fails to share Apple’s values in the same way as its current loyal customers. Moreover, the UK’s unstable position in the European economy may also lead to additional problems for the company in its attempts to maintain popularity in the market.\n\nReference List\n\nAhmed, Z, Gull, M & Rafiq, U 2015, ‘Factors affecting consumer switching behavior: mobile phone market in Manchester-United Kingdom’, International Journal of Scientific and Research Publications , vol. 5, no. 7, pp. 1-7.\n\nAppiah, D, Ozuem, W & Howell, KE 2017, ‘Brand switching in the smartphone industry: a preliminary study’, in Global Business and Technology Association nineteenth annual international conference , Global Business and Technology Association, Vienna, pp. 8-15.\n\nBassell, M & Lambert, S 2018, ‘Marketing leadership in a knowledge economy’, Atlantic Marketing Journal , vol. 7, no. 1, pp. 33-46.\n\nBerendt, J, Uhrich, S & Thompson, SA 2018, ‘Marketing, get ready to rumble—how rivalry promotes distinctiveness for brands and consumers’, Journal of Business Research , vol. 88, pp. 161-172.\n\nBradshaw, T 2018, ‘Apple hopes its daring bet on iPhone pricing will still pay off’, Financial Times , Web.\n\nFawzy, MF& Olson, EW 2018, ‘Total quality management & Apple success’, in Proceedings of the American Society for Engineering Management 2018 international annual conference , American Society for Engineering Management, Philadelphia, PA, pp. 1-7.\n\nField, M 2018, ‘Smartphone industry falls into ‘recession’ as sales slump 8pc’, The Telegraph , Web.\n\nGardere, J, Sharir, D & Maman, Y 2018, ‘Consulting and executive coaching on future trends: the need for a long term vision with Apple and Samsung’, International Journal of Business and Social Science , vol. 9, no. 3, pp. 1-7.\n\nGhosh, S 2017, ‘This chart shows iPhone X adoption has overtaken the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus’, Business Insider , Web.\n\nGiachetti, C 2017, ‘Explaining Apple’s iPhone success in the mobile phone industry: the creation of a new market space.

Reliability and validity of Mammography\n 4. Sensitivity and Specificity of Mammography\n 5. Controversies\n 6. Ethical Issues\n 7. References\n\nUnderstanding Mammography/Mammogram\n\nThe National Cancer Institute defines a mammogram as an x-ray picture of the breast after mammography. Mammographies are useful screening and diagnostic tools. They help to check for breast cancer in case of no signs/symptoms: screening. They are also used to confirm the presence of breast cancer in the case of a prevailing lump or other sign/symptom of the disease (National Cancer Institute, 2014).\n\nConducting Mammography\n\nWhen conducting a mammography, the breast is sandwiched between two plates, which compress the breast and are connected to a mammogram machine. The mammogram machine consists an adjustable at the top, and a fixed one at the bottom. An x-ray film is attached to the fixed bottom plate to enable it record the mammogram image. In order to avoid prolonged exposure to x-ray, while simultaneously obtaining a clearer picture, the breast is compressed to a thinner layer of tissue as indicated in the figure below.\n\nA computer-generated black and white image is produced during this procedure. A radiologist is the only capable person who can interpret this image. These computer-generated mammograms, otherwise known as digital mammograms are preferred in detecting cancer in women below the age of 50, and among women who have dense breast tissue (American Cancer Society, 2014). The mammograms are used to provide information necessary in the early detection of breast cancer.\n\nReliability and validity of Mammography\n\nIn this context, validity is the ability of the mammography to distinguish clearly between those who have breast cancer, and those who don’t. The issue of validity and reliability of mammograms is an area that has not been widely researched. However, there are numerous indications of the unreliability and poor validity of results as indicated by the occurrence of false positive and false negative results (Andolina and Lille, 2010). Available studies have mainly focused on the validity of health belief model variables in relation to mammography screening interventions. The reliability of mammography is not 100% due to the presence of false-negatives and false-positives, which apparently are inevitable.\n\nSensitivity and Specificity of Mammography\n\nMammography has a high sensitivity because it is able to detect prevailing cancers. Andolina and Lille (2010) report that the mammogram is not without some false negatives of between 5 and 15%. These false alarms could be attributed to cancers not diagnosable through a mammogram, young age, dense breast tissue, mucinous or lobular breast tissue, or rapidly enlarging cancer (National Cancer Institute, 2014). According to Andolina and Lille (2010), specificity of mammography is higher when used to screen the larger population in comparison to diagnosis of the cancer. Despite the fact that the mammography can indicate the presence of a malignancy or benign disease, it does not distinguish between these two. The predictive value of mammography is highly dependent on the sensitivity and specificity of the test.\n\nControversies\n\nDespite the fact that the mammogram saves lives through early diagnosis of cancer; hence, prompting immediate treatment, there is contention over the high rates of overdiagnosis and distress resulting from false alarms. Apparently, mammography results in negative psychological wellbeing due to issues with specificity and sensitivity (Bond et al., 2013).\n\nEthical Issues\n\nThe diagnosis of cancers that may not be harmful exposes a woman to risks associated with therapy, lymphedema and post-radiation effects such as occurrence of new cancers and scarring (National Cancer Institute, 2014). The false-negatives develop a false complacency and may ignore subsequent warning symptoms; hence, delaying diagnosis as the progression of the disease continues. The false-positives are subjected to unnecessary therapy that is costly, uncomfortable and harmful due to associated psychological distress.\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Cancer Society. (2014).

      "Some Aspects of the Nursing Essay\n\nThe code of ethical behavior in nursing practice is critical. According to Chuang, Dill, Morgan, and Konrad (2012), professional etiquette in nursing is a critical component that guides the interactions between nurses and patients. It also provides guidelines on how nurses should handle patients. In order to accord optimal care to patients, healthcare practitioners and the support staff should work as a team (Chuang et al., 2012). The absenteeism and the arguments among the nurses in the hospital jeopardize the care for patients. Therefore, in order to improve efficiency and enhance the satisfactory patient experience, I will advocate for the implementation of workplace policies that will regulate the conduct of the employees. The HRM should enact the policy. The human resource department in the healthcare organization has the role of improving performance. According to Vermeeren, Steijn, Tummers, Lankhaar and Van-Beek (2014), good performance practices lead to proper patients’ care.\n\nThere have been extensive studies in the healthcare field. For instance, a study carried out by Vermeeren et al. (2014) found that the human resource practices in the health care setting are directly or indirectly linked to clients’ satisfaction. The practices reduce the absence of employees. In addition, good HR practices influence job satisfaction among the employees. Vermeeren et al. (2014) noted that healthcare organizations that have motivated and satisfied employees have reduced absenteeism (Vermeeren et al., 2014). Good HR practices include frequent training of the employees, good remuneration, and rewards based on frequent job reviews. The absence of one employee affects the productivity of the available health care workers. Therefore, advocacy for proper work policy and employee motivation will enhance the productive continuation of work processes in an organization.\n\nThe numbers and capabilities of advanced practice nursing (APN) have expanded in many states. The APNs have become very valued and are considered an integral part of the healthcare system in the United States of America (Poghosyan, Lucero, Rauch & Berkowitz, 2012). Due to the critical role played by APNs, licensure, accreditation, certification and education (LACE) is very important (Stanley, Wermer & Apple, 2010). LACE is integral in ensuring that the health of patients is not compromised. The four prongs are used as the regulatory model for nurses (Stanley et al., 2010). However, they may differ depending on the state. As a result, each state has its requirement for the LACE.\n\nIn the state of California, an APN should have additional skills in psychosocial assessment, physical diagnosis and management of health illness. The nurse is required to have a master’s degree in nursing. A master’s degree in a field that is related to nursing may be used as a qualification. In addition, the nurse should have satisfactorily completed a nurse practitioner program that is approved by the board of registered nurses in the state. In the state of Washington, the APN is supposed to hold a registered nurse license in the state. The APN should have graduated from an advanced nursing education program within the past year and should be certified by an approved certification program. On the other hand, LACE requirements in the state of Illinois mandate the APN to hold a license for a registered nurse in the state. Furthermore, the APN is supposed to have current national certifications for nurse practitioners. The other requirement is that the nurse should have completed a post-basic advanced practice informal education program in the area of specialty.\n\nReferences\n\nChuang, E., Dill, J., Morgan, J., & Konrad, T.

      "Critique of Martha Rodger Theory Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nMartha Rodger’s theory clearly agrees with the ideals that I hold as a nursing professional that nursing should endeavor to promote health, prevention of diseases, rehabilitate ill people through incorporation of humane scientific ways. Nursing as a profession exists to serve people, being a profession that has a direct as well as overriding societal responsibility. Nursing as a profession seeks to integrate physiology as well as science fields in order to facilitate a patients healing process.\n\nFor safe practice of nursing the individual should have a good background information and knowledge about nursing, and the patients need a well-informed nurse aware of the responsibilities and function that she is supposed to perform (Meleis, 1997). The theory states that, a human being is an irreducible four-dimensional thing that in indivisible (Meleis, 1997). The human being is identified by a particular pattern and manifests with particular characteristics that is summed to a whole being and hence cannot be predicted using parts. Human beings are made up of their own characteristics that cannot be seen by looking at, or describing or summarizing the parts.\n\nNursing as a profession is as old as people existed. The element of nursing means taking care, it can be the sick or not. As per the assumption that nursing exists to serve people, it is true in that the sick need to be taken care of through administration of drugs, ensuring that the patient has observed good hygienic standards and check the progress of the patient. Without the nurse many patients might die from small complication that can be easily avoided by employing good care skills.\n\nFor example, a diabetic patient with a wound and in a coma is not in a position to take a shower or even take care of the wound. He therefore needs somebody to take care of the wounds failure to which he might develop infection that will eventually lead to sepsis with an eventuality of death. Therefore, a nurse will play an essential role in the management of patients. At the same time nursing as a profession does not mean slavery-, serving people means serving the needy where the needy are people like the old, young and the sick. Nursing does not also mean forcing an individual to perform a given function but it is out of will and commitment to serve.\n\nThe society is made of individuals who come together for a common purpose. Nursing therefore entails performing functions that cut across the society. The responsibility of a nurse is to ensure enhanced health to the society. For example, a nurse can be taking care of the sick e.g. dressing wounds, visiting the sick and offering services to them, but at the same time, the nurse might be the one responsible in educating the community in prevention of diseases. Therefore, the nurse has overriding responsibilities and direct responsibilities to the society.\n\nFor the nurse to perform well her functions in the community, she must be well qualified and well equipped with the knowledge and experience in health care or concerning to the aid she is offering to the community. For example, some nurses have a specialty in wound care, some are specialized in the management of diabetic patients, some the old therefore it is necessary for the nurse to have the relevant knowledge for the better management of the patients.\n\nThis ensures the safety of the patient and to the nurse, for example if the nurse is dressing a wound and she is not aware that she can contract a disease from the wound she might not use any protective ware. In addition, if the nurse is not aware of the drugs to use he might cause more harm to the patient. The people need knowledgeable nursing that is the nurse should know what is to be done to a particular condition and at the same time the patient must be informed on the procedure that is to be performed and the nurse must seek consent before performing a procedure to the patient (Tomey & Alligood, 1998). This ensures informed decision from both the nurse and the one seeking care.\n\nThe diagram is logical in that for a disease process to take place one of the components of the diagram must be destabilized. For example for a disease, process to take place environment must be destabilized. In addition, the human being as per the theory has energy fields and the environment too. The disturbances of the fields either leads to a disease process or will ensure care delivery (Tomey & Alligood, 1998). The combination of the environmental fields and human being have shared communication with one another is the basis of making a diagnosis and in offering a nursing interventions.\n\nThe assumptions go hand in hand with the theory. The theory states that a human being must be viewed as a unitary entity but not as parts. When you look at the assumptions, they all point to looking at an individual as one entity. If a person has a wound, the whole body is affected. When you consider the assumptions they explain the theory well and vice versa e.g. nursing is supposed to serve the community, the community is made of individuals who are surrounded by the environment (Rogers, 1989). Effects on the environment cause a direct impact on the individual hence the connection.\n\nThe principles, concepts and propositions are all well described and they do match with the theory’s aim. The principles describe the theory well; the concepts of the theory like energy fields tend to build the principle of energy field that work together for Unitarian human being. Openness is exhibited through description of how the environment and the human field keep exchanging energy freely without anything to limit the exchange (Tomey & Alligood, 1998). Such factors as pan dimensionality, environment, health and nursing are intended to create a unitary outlook towards the human being.\n\nThe meaning of concepts as well as principles is evident. For instance, there exists an aspect of human being’s aspect in human beings that is completely different from the rest of the body parts. When you look at the concept that discusses the human being as a unitary thing, they are very clear. The interaction between the environment, the pattern and the exchange of energy between the different levels it all points to a unitary form of life. The theory has been used in the developing of health management systems in Philadelphia and also it has been used in improving the assessing patients in that you look at a patient as one or as a whole individual not as part if one part of the body is affected the whole body is affected.\n\nThe theory has helped in the development of other modern theories of nursing, and it is used in training of nurses, the theory promotes the use of science for the betterment of humans’ health and promotes the use of creativity as knowledge in nursing (Tomey & Alligood, 1998). Additionally, creation of rules for research has been advanced through this model.\n\nThe theory has certain limitations. For instance, the language used in the description states the pandimensonality of human being field and influence for change in humans (Imogene, 1981). In addition, vague definitions that also lead to debate among the Rodgerian scholars is also a limitation. Being a closed system, the studies and publications are done within the Rodgerian scholars. Existing scientific methodology fails to capture the immeasurable components of the theory.\n\nOn the other side, the theory has enabled the revolution of nursing as well as helping in revealing the fact an individual is one entity. Accelerating evolution theory states that evolution is moving very fast and diversity of life process is widening hence the higher energy frequency is the source human development. If you compare the two theories, it seems the acceleration theory is a derivative of the unitary theory and both of them use energy fields to describe the relationship between man and the environment.\n\nMartha Rodger has made massive contribution to nursing. For instance, she was the first person to describe man as a unitary as the central phenomenon in the nursing profession (Taylor, 2001). The conceptual system she developed is the base of knowledge in nursing that has relevance in all the workers. The theory is used as a guide to nursing knowledge theory development and expansion of research in nursing. Moreover, the matrix of nursing is relevant in the life process of man. Generally, without the contribution of the Rodger theory the nursing practice would still be miles behind.\n\nReferences\n\nImogene, K. (1981). A Theory for nursing: systems, concepts, process.

      "The Branch of Well Engineering Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Roles and responsibilities of a well engineer\n 2. Physical and mechanical properties of Diamond\n 3. Applications of diamond bit in well engineering\n 4. References\n\nThe branch of engineering that has close resemblance to well engineering is the petroleum engineering. Free Dictionary (2009) defines petroleum engineering as “The application of almost all types of engineering to the drilling for the production of oil, gas, and liquefiable hydrocarbons and is subdivided into the branches of petro physical, geological, reservoir drilling, production, well and construction engineering”. The complexity and technicality of petroleum engineering has increased over the years and today involves the extraction of oil in very complex situations most of which are near there depletion levels. While this class of engineer faces a lot of challenges, the advancement in computer technology, improved job related materials, the analysis of probability and the inventions of important technologies of enhanced oil recovery and horizontal drilling have made their job easier. This class forms one of the best paid engineering disciplines. Lawndirt (2009) illustrates that “In a June 4th, article, reported “that Petroleum Engineering was the 24th best paying job in the United States”\n\nRoles and responsibilities of a well engineer\n\nWell engineering is on the other hand is the profession in petroleum engineering that deals with the design, construction, drilling and the general maintenance of oil and gas wells drilled during the a gas or an oil extraction. “Working closely with Petroleum and Production Engineers, Geoscientists and contractors, they ensure the best technical, commercial and environmental ways are found to connect the subsurface hydrocarbons with the surface and export facilities” (Shell, 2009 ). Well engineering is a complex field that requires adequate training to ensure that all the technical aspects of this field are properly understood.\n\nA well engineer is responsible in handling a large number of responsibilities during the extraction of oil or gas. This includes the overall development and facilitation of strategies that involve the contracting plans, formulation, evaluation and negotiation of contracts that relate directly to the provision, handling and maintenance of well services. A thorough knowledge in understanding and accurately evaluating the aspects of well economics and must have an active role in the proposing and recommending technically capable suppliers and contractors in the provision of well services. In addition to the above, a well engineer must be able to understand and undertake the process of subsurface data gathering before the drilling process, undertake the process of safety and environmental management procedures that conform to the guidelines of environmental regulations. A deep knowledge in the optimization of well construction, well maintenance and the operations that involve the process of abandonment of used wells are also essential to a well engineer.\n\nThe work of designing and drilling of wells must strictly conform to the accepted industry technical criteria and the regulations that govern this engineering field so that the set goals are realized in a cost reduced manner. In the execution of well design process and activities, a number of technical areas are essential. These include directional design, casing design, planning of well control, and cement design. The procedures underlining these well design processes and activities must be technically valid and correctly used in the specific well conditions. Since this job involves a hands-on kind of role, the engineer must have the capacity to evaluate and monitor the conditions of the well in close relation with his or her seniors. Towards this end, the well engineer must support his seniors in the correct formulation and supervision of HSSE system. Finally, this role involves working under conditions that are at times dangerous in nature and as such the individual must be equipped with the ability to effectively support his seniors and other officers during response to emergency situations.\n\nPhysical and mechanical properties of Diamond\n\nDiamond has for centuries been described as the ultimate gemstone that has with it most strengths and a very limited number of weaknesses. It is a common knowledge that diamond is the hardest material in existence. Even though it is the hardest material in nature, diamond on the other hand is not impervious in that it has four directions of cleavages. This refers to one fact that a very strong strike along one of these cleavages will definitely lead to a cleave or a split. In hardness, diamond is ranked at number ten which defines its perfection in hardness and thus appears at the top of list.\n\nThe second material in nature after diamond in hardness and ranked at number nine is corundum (sapphire and ruby) and if four times weaker than diamond. This translates to the fact that diamond is still far much harder than most substances in existence with a very large range. Clarity is another important physical property of diamond in that it is very transparent over a very wide range of wavelengths that range from ultra violet and moves further to the far infrared. This means that diamond is the clearest material on earth and none, be it solid or liquid substance comes close to it. In terms of thermal conductivity, diamond is again considered as the best. It conducts heat far better than anything in existence and more surprising is the fact that the second material in nature in terms of thermal conductivity, Silver, is five times poorer than diamond.\n\nIn terms of tensile strength, it is considered to have the highest tensile strength than any other material in existence with a tensile degree of 2.8 gigapascals. However, Amethyst Galleries, (2006), illustrates that “ that does not quite translate into the strongest rope or cable, as diamond has cleavage planes which support crack propagation and thus the strongest ropes can likely be made from another material, carbon nanotubes, as they should not suffer from the effects of cracks and breaks but still, if a long, thin, perfect crystal of diamond could be manufactured, it would offer the highest possible pulling strength (in a straight line – don’t try to tie it in a knot!)” (Amethyst Galleries, 2006). In compressive strength, diamond was once considered as the material most resistant to compressive forces i.e. the material that is least compressible in nature. However, research has revealed that a rare metal referred to as Osmium has overtaken it to become the least compressible. It still must be appreciated that diamond still remains the hardest substance.\n\nAmethyst Galleries (2006 ) “demonstrates this by expounding that diamond has a bulk modulus (reciprocal of compressibility) of 443 GigaPascals (GPa) and the bulk modulus of the metal osmium has recently been found to be 476 GPa, about 7% greater than diamond”. Lattice density of diamond is again the highest in that the atoms that make up its structure are very closely arranged and packed tightly together in comparison to any other substance in nature. Finally, the melting point of this unique substance is as high as 3820 in degree Kelvin. It is therefore true to add that apart from the characteristics above, diamond still has the highest melting point.\n\nApplications of diamond bit in well engineering\n\nThe definition of well engineering illustrates that it involves the drilling of oil or gas from underground wells. This demands a material that is not only strong but also capable of withstanding very high temperatures (Amethyst Galleries, 2006). The high melting property of diamond means that it capable of withstanding very high temperatures especially in the end points of the well. Oil and gas are known to exist under very high and extreme temperatures underground. In addition to the above, the processes of drilling demands a very strong a material that can withstand both tensile and compressive forces and pressures since oil or gas wells in most instances exist in very many miles underground. The material must therefore be able to dig very deep without showing any signs of buckling. The lattice density translates to its hardness and thus gives it the ability to stay strong. The property of thermal conductivity aids in the transfer of internal heat in the well to the outer space and thus reduces the excessive accumulation of heat in the wells. This reduces the damage caused by heat on other materials thereby translating to a reduction in time and overall costs.\n\nReferences\n\nAmethyst Galleries., (2006). The mineral diamond.

      "The Dior Building: Representation and Metaphor Essay\n\nOutline\n\nAs early as the 1930’s Dior building was the best fashion house in the world and still is today with very many of its brands in various parts. It was established by fashion guru Christian Dior after the Second World War 11 as a worldwide brand with several products. Many of the products at the beginning were mainly clothes that were important particularly after the war since Dior realized that it was vital for a new look after the Second World War. After which he ventured into other beauty products. Dior house’s first products were Belle Époque worn with long skirts because they were some of the dresses that Christian’s mother wore in the early 1990s. Unfortunately, the owner of Dior, Christian passed away but it did not mean the end of his hard work but the management was taken up by Madame Zehnmacker (Cicero, L. 1994; 7).\n\nDior building is one of the most splendid and designer houses in the world belonging to the fashion guru Christian Dior. It is tall, regal and modest magnificence that goes beyond the price, quality, and value and with varying architectural decors. Dior building itself is wrapped in translucent glass that allows a clear view of the floors beneath achieved by using glass on the outside and the inside is the acrylic aluminum. For over forty years Dior building has brought many people to New York from various places around the world. It creates timeless pieces that have both a youthful appeal and old that leave them with a lasting gaze. It’s enthralling scents, handbags, women wear, accessories and men’s wear all years in and out and they can be found in departmental stores all over the world.\n\nThis paper will discuss the representation and the metaphor of the Dior building.\n\nSignificance of Dior building\n\nWith the increasing number of fashion houses in the growing economic sector, the Dior was not left out. This building is found in New York but has a variety of stores in different countries like one is in Japan. The one in New York represents a splendid fashion house with a wide range of wears for all ages and genders. Designed by two architects Kazuyo Sejima and Ryue Nishizawa commonly called (SANAA). It is spotless white covering the whole trapezoidal area with shape edges. The creation of this building was stirred by crucial splendor in the fashion industry the Couture dress. Standing at the height of 30 meters tall. The white color signifies the magnificence that is determined by the light during daytime and light saturation at night. The white horizontal aluminum brands represent the continuous division of the building into various uneven segments. Whereas the slender white box illustrates the sophistication of femininity that allows it to stand out distinctively. It is also an air of ambiguity that welcomes people from all parts of the world to a step in the magnificence world of fashion. Various floors are linked by the stare core that has a glass tower standing out from the basement to the top of the building. The interior décor is designed with wooden panels, romance, ceilings that are molded, and a traditional Dior that contrasts with modern glazed walls. The interior of the building is a different world that awaits disclosure. Instead of the eight floors of boutique space perceived from outside, there is only one basement floor and five floors above the ground. The basement and the first three floors are devoted to the various retail lines under the Dior umbrella; there is one multi-purpose occasion’s space on the fourth floor and a rooftop garden above (Eisenman, et al, 1998: 78). Each retail line with the Dior building has got its own name and unique ambiance. Ladieswear and accessories are mainly located on the second floor. The third floor is mainly for general beauty with the theme of backstage that is customers and those admiring the products experience the runway of the Dior fashion show and an opportunity to test new products in the beauty industry such as nails and skincare products (Fishman, R.1977: 14). Inside is an underground floor that is the Dior Homme store used for particular designs like the white lacquer, black lacquer plisse, polished metal, black stone floor, strip lighting and fitting room. These are traditional designs of Dior but they have been integrated into a more modern design and shopping house. The polished metal is used in series to indicate the reflective facade within the building (Hearn, M.1981; 7).\n\nThe Dior plisse is used to represent the architectural feature of black lacquer bands. The graphic element is depicted by the light within the corridors, floors and ceilings. The fitting room is an interaction room and image analysis area. It represents the notion of time management and self-awareness. The fitting mirrors commonly called dressing rooms depicts projection area with cameras and videos where pictures of the person within the building appear on graphic screens (Conrad, U. 1990; 4-7).\n\nMetaphorical representation of Dior building\n\nThe metaphoric with this building is being an umbrella, feminine and the misinterpretation of floors and the reason behind is an enlargement of space from the necessary 1.5 meters to a larger height that suits all the fascia composition. SANNA articulated and competently integrated all the features to create a slender building to a required maximum height that is supported by a changeable degree of transparency and the mechanical spaces are not clear. By an umbrella, the building houses several stores with major in fashion but different products and designs (Hays, K1998; 9).\n\nThe building is feminine in the sense that its interior is assorted with thermoformed acrylic hangings that are able to manifest a consistent image and able to provoke customers’ imagination while shopping. From inside looking at the cityscape one is able to see a fairyland overwhelmed by white fluffy clouds (Cicero, L. 1994; 7). This is a building where one can experience a lifetime shopping spree.\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Cicero, L.TransHarry Caplan. Cambridge, MA, 1994;\n 2. Conrad, U.

      "Transportation in Logistics and Supply Chain Management Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Background\n 3. Impact on Business\n 4. Transportation Strategy\n 5. Transportation Risks\n 6. Transportation Costs\n 7. Case Study\n 8. Conclusion\n 9. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nTransportation is one of the most critical economic activities in a business supply chain. It is based on the fundamental principles of moving goods and resources from the location where they are produced to the location where they are demand, essentially linking suppliers to consumers without which the business and economy as whole would not be existent. The back-end concepts of a business such as supply chain management and logistics are ultimately dependent on transportation functioning effectively and efficiently since goods and products consistently have to be moved in between locations. Transportation is a vital part of the supply chain management and a key element to its function, serving as a necessity and enabler to virtually any business activity or strategy.\n\nBackground\n\nA major driving force for supply chain in the 21st century are globalization and technology. Globalization has resulted in supply chains being stretched across the world, particularly with production shifting to cheaper labor markets while major consumers remain in affluent Western regions. To facilitate the depth and scope of these extensive supply chains, transportation became critical to supply chain management, figuratively described as the “glue” and “life blood” of global supply chains, vital to growth and development of businesses and economies as a whole. Transportation is the most critical industry in an industrialized society, as a tool without which no element of the economy would be able to function, ranging from a grocery store to a factory. The more complex the economy, business, or company – the more indispensable an efficient and effective transportation system becomes (Novack et al., 2016).\n\nLogistics is an element of supply chain management that “plans, implements, and controls the efficient, effective forward and reverse flow and storage of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption in order to meet customers’ requirements” (Goldsby et al., 2014, par. 7). In this definition, the term flow is synonymous with transportation, which has the function of providing the flow of inventory from points of origin to points of use and production to final places of sale or consumption. Businesses commonly manage inbound logistics which involves receiving raw materials, and outbound logistics which focuses on distribution of goods to markets, the complexity of both can be seen in the figure below. Logistics involves activities such as forecasting demand, inventory planning, and the storage and delivery of goods. Optimized logistics systems ensure that the activities are done efficiently and in unison so that customers are satisfied with the logistics (time and speed) while incurred costs for the company are minimal. Transportation is the one activity critically responsible for “providing time and place utilities through inbound and outbound” (Goldsby et al., 2014 par. 9).\n\nFigure 1: Physical distribution in a typical logistics network highlighting various points where transportation is necessary (Novack et al., 2016).\n\nImpact on Business\n\nTransportation as part of logistics and supply chain management is a key component in business activities of a company. Transportation directly influences inventory flow, with effective transportation able to keep the supply chain moving and keeping inventory lean. Inventory consistently has to be moved in and out of production and storage, and transportation is able to impact warehouse efficiently, reduce lead time, and reduce expenses in areas such as storage management. Any supply chain disruptions, particularly those caused by transportation are costly and impact the bottom line for operations. Transportation is also one point where a company has direct contact with the consumer via shipping of products. The point of delivery commonly reflects the competency of a business. Transportation plays a key role in the ‘last mile’ delivery, which is often the most complex and costly while being prone to disruptions. Therefore, the logistics of transportation during the point of delivery can impact customer satisfaction based on the speed and quality of the transported product (PLS Logistics, n.d.).\n\nTransportation directly affects the economic side of things in various business activities. For example, transportation helps to manage price hikes and allow for profit maximization. Transportation allows to coordinate between less and more supplied regions, moving goods conveniently, thus being able to fulfill demand at any different locations where customers seek to purchase goods at stable prices. Profit maximization occurs when transportation is used to deliver cheap raw materials from various locations to areas of production where labor is cheapest, and then distributed to high profit markets. Transportation aids in large scale production by supplying each part of the supply chain without interruption and at scale, which helps businesses to manufacture and sell product at a cheaper cost, but also serving a large number of customers and increasing revenue (Novack et al., 2016).\n\nTransportation Strategy\n\nGiven the key logistics function of transportation in supply chains, it is common for large companies to develop their own transportation strategies. A transportation strategy contributes to effective supply chain management by fitting the movement of goods into the general corporate supply chain. Instead of ensuing carrier competition or ineffective planning, the transportation strategy seeks to be a dynamic response to the needs of the business and its operations (LTD Management, n.d.). Transportation strategy needs to examine the supply chain holistically, not just the technicalities of transportation (such as using technology for most efficient routes) and enable strategic collaboration between the various entities and players in the supply chain to reach the objectives that the organization has set.\n\nState of the art supply chains use competent management to reduce inventory and warehousing costs while speeding up delivery – therefore, the effectiveness is inherently linked to the appropriate implementation of transportation strategy. For example, Wal-Mart utilizes a responsive transportation system which calls for cross-docking at distribution centers. Thus, product is exchanged between trucks so that each truck heading to the retail location maintains a variety of products from differing suppliers. This has helped the retail giant to lower costs since total transportation costs include elements such as transportation decisions, responsiveness levels, and inventory expenses (SupplyChainDive, 2017). In the end, companies must match transportation strategy to its competitive strategy for the best performance.\n\nTransportation Risks\n\nAlongside being one of the most critical factors in a supply chain, transportation is also the most vulnerable and prone to risk. The majority of adverse events occurring in the supply chain are due to transportation-related causes which then cause ripple effects up the supply chain. Carriers inherently undertake a significant risk because of this since shipments allow for companies to continue operating. Any accidents, disruptions, or losses of cargo will disrupt the supply chain and result in decreased financial profit. Transportation companies can face risks such as integrity and safety of the transportation method, personnel safety and retention, compliance issues, and environmental impacts (Wensing, 2018).\n\nTransportation and logistics services are virtually outsourced operations making them high value, but also high impact elements of the supply chain. The risk increases since each part of the supply chain deals in its own regulatory framework, contractual agreements, and business practices. Since transportation is usually outsourced, unless it is an extremely large company (even then, some stages are still reliant on third parties, after all Wal-Mart does not have its own ships and does not deliver the product to the front door itself), there are inherent risks dealing with carriers, transportation management providers, customs, export agents, and warehousing companies. Competent supply chains integrate transportation risk as a leading concept in its supply chain risk mitigation strategies, with resilience to leverage the outlined problems during procurement of transportation services and subsequent operations management (Todd, 2017).\n\nTransportation Costs\n\nThe business of moving inventory through the supply chain to the end market is a major expense for companies. An analysis of logistics activities costs conducted by CSCMP suggests that transportation costs in the supply chains in the United States exceed $836 billion annually, or 62.8% of total logistics expenses (seen in the table below). Commercial transportation is so large, that it accounts for 5.4% of the U.S. GDP (Goldsby et al., 2014). Costs can vary significant in transportation due to a wide variety of factors ranging from distance to transportation type to specifics of storage conditions. The more difficult it is to move a product over distance, the greater the friction of distance, the higher the cost. A modern supply chain is highly spread out, so both suppliers and companies are competing, and the ease of transporting goods will affect competitiveness.\n\nCost Category                                                $ Billions  % of Total\nInventory-Carrying Cost                                      305         22.9      \nTransportation                                               836         62.8      \nWarehousing                                                  130         9.8       \nShipper-Related Costs                                        10          0.8       \nLogistics Administration                                     51          3.8       \nTotal Logistics Cost                                         1,331       100       \nTable 1: U.S. Logistics Cost in 2012 (Goldsby et al., 2014)\n\n\nIn the 1990s and early 2000s, low cost of transportation and high availability of freight services led to businesses to focus on fast delivery to end markets and consumers, moving inventory to reduce expenses. However, the status quo has changed with the development of e-commerce and exponentially rising costs in transportation due to rising oil prices and generally low supply in comparison to demand – all while consumer expectations have only shifted towards expectations of rapid availability and delivery. As a result, certain industry shifts have occurred in supply chain management in regard to transportation. In some companies and products, there has been a notable shift from offshoring to nearshoring in order to reduce distance of shipments travel. Product design as well as packaging has evolved also towards more efficient production but also incorporating shipping considerations such as size efficiency, protection of goods efficiency, and processes of offloading and repackaging. Finally, the inventory management in the supply chain has changed from lean inventory to hybrid lean and transportation strategies which has long-reaching impacts in the supply chain management designed to overcome transportation challenges and costs (Russell et al., 2014).\n\nCase Study\n\nFigure 2: A model of Starbucks supply chain distribution to the United States (Sargent, n.d.).\n\nA company which critically relies on transportation in its expansive supply chain is Starbucks. Starbucks operates a highly centralized and vertically integrated supply chain network which is one of a kind, but also offers it complete control or involvement in every step of the process. The primary goods sold by Starbucks are coffee and coffee associated products. Therefore, Starbucks relies on coffee beans as its raw material. Working directly with plantation farmers, Starbucks imports various sorts of coffee beans from small to medium sized plantations in South and Central America, Africa and Middle East, and Asia/Oceania. Upon collection and packaging of coffee beans, they are delivered by truck to the nearest port. Coffee beans must be transported without moisture in ventilated containers, which presents some challenges considering most are shipped via sea transport. The beans are shipped to one of six storage sites in U.S. and Europe, the number being low to ensure close management of site operation and ensuring that all products are prepared and packaged the same way. The beans are roasted, specially packaged, and shipped to one of eight centralized or of the 50 regional distribution centers. From there, the beans are sent directly to Starbucks stores and restaurants or a few select retailers selling their products (Sargent, n.d.).\n\nIt is evident from the numerous contact points in the Starbucks supply chain, that transportation is critical to their functioning. Transportation is necessary from plantations to port (via ground), port to storage center (via sea and ground), then to distribution centers (via ground or air), and from distribution center to stores (via ground). Previously, Starbucks spent approximately 70% of its supply chain costs on outsourcing transportation and logistics. Upon a radical transformation of its system in 2008, virtually all transportation is under Starbucks’ supervision as part of the “deliver” function of its supply chain structure. Starbucks now attempts to utilize a regionalized approach to coffee manufacturing by refining coffee beans nearest to the region where they are to be sold. This allowed to reduce transportation costs and lead times, even switching coffee plant operations to 5 days rather than 7. Starbucks operates six plants of its own and relies on 24 co-manufacturers around the world (Cooke, 2010).\n\nInevitably, the Starbucks delivery and transportation process is demanding and complex. Unlike most other companies with suppliers and production in a specific region, Starbucks imports and then reships coffee beans all over the world. Starbucks processes about 70,000 deliveries to its stores in 69 countries per week. During its supply chain reorganization, Starbucks had to consider efficiency in its logistics. Each transport carrier was assessed for performance, and only the best were left as partners to this global company. Furthermore, Starbucks implemented a variety of technological solutions within the supply chain to continuously improve efficiencies. In the first two years that Starbucks reformed its supply chain system, they have curtailed costs by approximately $500 million without compromising service delivery (Cooke, 2010).\n\nConclusion\n\nTransportation is a critical element of logistics responsible for the movement of product from one location to another along the supply chain, ranging from beginning to when the product reaches consumers. It is a costly and complex endeavor that has far-reaching impact on business operations and profit margins. Most high-profile companies recognize the key role of transportation and have developed appropriate transportation strategy to integrate into the supply chain management ranging from vendors being used and cost-savings to technology tracking and positioning of distribution centers. Globalization has contributed to the growing complexity of supply chains, creating more distance and chains in between the raw materials delivery to the final product shipment. Meanwhile, transportation is both limited in availability and both financially and ecologically unprofitable. Going forward businesses are seeking to optimize and make supply chains more efficient, with a primary focus on transportation modes and planning.\n\nReferences\n\nCooke, J. A. (2010).

      "United States History to 1877: The Climax of the Developments That Transformed the Country Forever Essay\n\nThe most dynamic and momentous period in American history was the 19 th century. This period turned out to be the climax of the developments that would later transform the country forever. This era of change saw many Americans participate in the transformations that were taking place around them, including the civil war, reconstruction, and creation of the constitution. This paper discusses the major themes that emerge in US history to 1877, lessons learned and issues up for debate.\n\nMajor Themes\n\nImmigration\n\nThe European migration to America encountered resistance from Native Americans. Different policies and laws on slavery led to the American Revolution (1775-1783), after which a new republic and the Constitution were established, and reconstruction began. The 1800-1877 period was marked by immigration into the US, which raised concerns among the natives. During this era, the American population increased by almost 27 million people (Hierbert et al., 2018). Immigrants came in hordes from China and Western Europe and settled in every part of the country in large numbers except in the Deep South, which was hostile. Free or contract migrant labor helped grow the economy and triggered democratic movements to agitate for political and civic rights.\n\nIndustrial Growth\n\nBy the 1900s, America became a global leader in manufacturing. The country’s economy was built on the railroads constructed to facilitate transportation. By the late 1890s, 20 percent of the total rail network was complete (Hierbert et al., 2018). Heavy investment in railroads was necessary to power the industrial economy and open up the country. America had overtaken Great Britain as the world leader in iron and steel production. The country’s economy was linked to the larger global economy. Higher immigration rates, family-owned businesses, and urbanization contributed to industrial growth. The social and cultural aspects also affected the economy, as they determined the value attached to the manufacturing sector, who led businesses, and workplace culture. Despite the steady progress in the economy, most Americans were worried that strong corporations, urbanization, immigration, and wage labor could undermine their values.\n\nPolitics\n\nAmericans came together and founded many reform movements and trade unions. This group (anti-monopolists) comprised farmers, entrepreneurs, and laborers fighting for better terms or treatment. The unifying factor was the concerns about the emergence of powerful corporations and monopolistic entities. According to Watson (2018), many Americans were worried about the independence of their wages, rising unemployment, and declining individual freedoms and rights. Although the anti-monopolists agreed on the problems they were facing, they always disagreed on the solutions. Finally, they agreed that the main aim of the republican economy was to sustain citizens and ensure independence and prosperity for all. The anti-monopolists thrived to the point that they comprised larger members, including democrats and republicans. Most reforms this group advocated for were enacted during this period.\n\nReform\n\nAnother common theme in American history was structural and policy reform. Many legislative changes were initiated to address social and structural problems in society. In American history, major reform areas revolved around women and civil rights. During this progressive era, many social and political reforms were experienced in the country led by activists and religious figures. Among them, women earned the right to vote in elections. This reform was a major milestone achieved through the 19 th amendment (Watson, 2018). For women to get equality, they had to acquire voting rights first. Women worked for low wages during the great depression because they were relegated to menial jobs with meager pay. The reform saw female labor assume roles in industries and factories like men. Therefore, women’s empowerment was instrumental in America’s economic and social development.\n\nAgriculture\n\nCheap lands and reasonable high wages were available in the US. Between 1870 and 1900, America brought more land under cultivation than ever before (Watson, 2018). As a result, most states moved from small-scale farming to plantation agriculture in new, large, and fertile tracts of land in the American west and mid-west. They invested heavily in technology – advanced their plows, reapers, and threshers (Watson, 2018). The wages earned from farm produce fueled home consumptions that triggered the country’s industrial development.\n\nLessons Learned\n\nFrom the above themes, several lessons can be learned that have implications for the present society. From a political perspective, immigration to America mainly contributed to the development of the country. Were it not for immigrants that composed a great percentage of the labor force, America could not have experienced phenomenal growth during this period. For example, by the year 1900, 72 percent of the American population was immigrants (Watson, 2018). An issue for debate is what should be the nation’s immigration policy now.\n\nFrom the social reforms in America during this period, we learn that women are important in society, and their stake in the economy should not be overlooked. For example, the 19 th amendment granted women voting rights that they did not have before. It also allowed them to work in industries like men, but their wages were low. A contemporary issue related to this historical milestone is equal pay. Contract terms and compensation should be the same for all people, irrespective of gender, race, or religion.\n\nCulturally, women were allowed to do unpaid domestic work and childbearing roles. For instance, during the great depression (1882-1897), women were given jobs but were paid less than men. A point of debate here is whether cultural values are superior to individual freedoms. Racial discrimination is also a contemporary issue in American society that has its roots in slavery. Minority groups, for example, African Americans, complain of police brutality and injustice. Religious minorities, such as Muslims, also face prejudice and accusations of extremism. These issues illustrate the need for tolerance and protection of minority (migrant) rights in the country.\n\nAnother lesson learned from American history is that agriculture is the backbone of the country’s economy. For example, immigration due to economic opportunities in the US was focused on agriculture and manufacturing. The issue here is how to adapt the economy to technology for labor that heavily relies on traditional sectors to fight poverty. Effective economic policies should include social support for the vulnerable. Increasing minimum wage levels can improve the living standards of the working class and address socioeconomic inequalities and health disparities.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmerican history revolves around the themes that triggered its industrial growth during the 19 th and 20 th centuries. The climax of American development emerged during this period, transforming the country into a major economic powerhouse to date. The foundation upon which the country was based is the reason for America’s stable economy and leadership globally. Inclusive and fair policies should be considered to promote unity and economic participation of all citizens.\n\nReferences\n\nHierbert, F. T., Altoff, P., & Fischer, F. (2018).

      "“The Flowers of Evil” by Charles Baudelaire Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Role of a Flâneur\n 3. Limit Experiences\n 4. “The Swan”\n 5. “To a Passer-By”\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Work Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nCharles Baudelaire was a remarkable French poet who discussed the changes in Paris of the 19th century. His collection of poems, The Flowers of Evil , contains a variety of stories about people, their emotions, and abstract things that determine the quality of life. A distinctive feature of his works is the presence of a flâneur, a person who wanders the world and shares his observations. After reading his poems like “The Swan” and “To a Passer-By”, it is easy to understand that Baudelaire is that flâneur, who is both fascinated and upset with the process of urbanization and its contradictory beauty.\n\nHe uses the whole city as his canvas and integrates various literary techniques to relate the images of luminal experiences. He focuses on contradictions related to personal and social changes. Despite using classical verse forms, he, being fascinated by sensation contrast, he underlines the mismatch between form and content through the concept of limit and liminal experiences. In “The Swan” and “To a Passer-By”, Baudelaire, the flâneur, shares his memories of the past and the realities of the mundane present to underline the beauty of the transience of life.\n\nThe Role of a Flâneur\n\nThe introduction of the flâneur and the thrills of the feeling of overstimulation make Baudelaire one of the most recognizable sensory poets during the 19th century. On the one hand, this character is detached from the crowd and observes recent social and industrial changes “in the windows shine the jumbled bric-a-brac” from the sidewalk (Baudelaire 89). On the other hand, flâneur cannot ignore his interest in urban life opportunities and a variety of people with “new palaces, scaffolding, blocks of stone, old quarters” (Baudelaire 90). Using the experience of an ethnographer, the author tries to catalog the beauty of everyday life with its dissonant parts.\n\nFor example, there are eternal and invariable elements like Louvre and relative, circumstantial details like “piles of shafts, of rough hewn cornices” (Baudelaire 89). His fascination with the language used in “Swan” is seen through the lines as each word is properly chosen to depict the unity of hesitation, uncertainty, frustration, and inspiration. The future of the flâneur remains unclear because everything depends on some chance, ephemeral encounters, and minute observations. Attention to such liminal experiences makes Baudelaire’s poems out of mundane everyday life.\n\nLimit Experiences\n\nThe concept of limit experience was a common technique developed by French philosophers in the 20th century. This type of human activity could push people to the edge of their beliefs and possibilities and make a choice that is not always easy to understand. Limit experiences include life events that can either motivate or challenge, depending on humans and their visions. For example, if a person faces problems and concerns constantly, there is a possibility that limit experience reveals the darkest side of his or her soul. However, negative emotions should not be the only expected outcomes of limit experiences.\n\nThere is also a challenge to be turned into a great opportunity to change something. Therefore, despite being properly defined and explained, limit experiences are hard to predict and discuss in one frame. However, Baudelaire goes beyond the common 19th century French norms where love and other feelings prevailed. He uses a city, “Old Paris”, as an object of his poetry (Baudelaire 89). He becomes the first urban but still melancholic poet who misses the past, cherishes his memories, and cannot resist a life that is passing by.\n\nIn Baudelaire’s poems, there are no clearly identified good or bad sides of a human soul, and people are introduced as strangers and passers-by. It is hard to comprehend what has already happened to a person and why such decisions are made. At the same time, it is clear that, even being detached from society, the flâneur is frustrated with the idea of urbanization and ready to reproach God just to avoid changes (Baudelaire 90).\n\nAs a result, the representation of limited experiences in “The Swan” and “To a Passer-By” pushes the reader to some new ways of understanding, relying on specific poetic forms and images. These two poems are examples of lyric modernity, where the convention of normal forms and ideas is twisted because of the lack of knowledge, experience, and evidence.\n\n“The Swan”\n\nThe peculiarity of limit expression in Baudelaire’s poem “The Swan” is the combination of attitudes toward Paris past and present that are shared by a transient flâneur. In the 19th century, the city underwent a number of considerable changes in different spheres, including architecture, politics, economic, and social relationships. Being a direct observer of human reactions, Baudelaire found it necessary to share his knowledge and attitude toward the transition of old Paris into a new one. To escape the limits of language and demonstrate his love for sonnets, he used a traditional format, Alexandrine or iambic hexameter.\n\nHowever, compared to the original text of the poem (written in French), its English versions may be confusing. Therefore, attention should be paid to the use of figurative language and ideas. The author begins the poem by mentioning Andromache as “that mirror, poor and sad, which glittered long ago/ With the vast majesty of your widow’s grieving” (Baudelaire 89). This image and the metaphor of “mirror” are used to introduce pain the stranger experiences about Paris ruins and transformations, comparing them with the emotions of the Greek woman who lost her family and land.\n\nAn increased number of metaphors proves the liminal position of the stranger and the desire of the author to conjoin apocalyptic vision with mundane things. He has nothing to do but accept social transformations and keep the past in his memories that “are heavier than rocks” or that “sounds loud the hunting horn” (Baudelaire 91). To underline a driving rhythm and intensify emotions, Baudelaire also used anaphora several times, “towards the sky at times…/ towards the ironic, cruelly blue sky” (90).\n\nThere is also a repetitive occurrence of the preposition “of” at the beginning of many lines, which conveys an impressive number of similar outcomes and experiences. Finally, “the swan” itself becomes an allegory of the author who “restlessly bathed his wings in the dust” and “stretch his avid head upon his quivering neck” (Baudelaire 90). All these poetic techniques show the importance of liminal experiences of the author (the stranger) with a desire to never forget the past but accept the present as it is.\n\n“To a Passer-By”\n\nCompared to “The Swan” where the stranger does not have a particular thing or a person to hold on in the process of change, Baudelaire’s “To a Passer-By” introduces a specific image of a woman. “The Swan” is a reaction to the changes the citizens of Paris cannot avoid, and “To a Passer-By” is a solution that is available to everyone. Instead of focusing of abstract notions and ideas, this poem focuses on the woman “tall, slender, in heavy mourning, majestic grief” (Baudelaire 95). Still, liminal experiences cannot be ignored in this poem because the author wanted to explain how people are pushed to the edge of their emotions.\n\nThe ecology of urban life turns out to be an interesting subject for consideration for Baudelaire. Instead of discussing the qualities of humans, their experiences, and abilities, he focuses on the city as the main source of inspiration and differentiation. His unwillingness to be definite about “whoever has lost that which is never found” challenges and provokes the reader (Baudelaire 91). And yet, such uncertain but limit experience proves the author’s fascination about what happens and the desire to observe more.\n\n“To a Passer-By” is a poem about changes people experience every day and the explanations of why some change is accepted, and another is not. In the beginning, a flâneur faces “the street” that “roared with a deafening sound” (Baudelaire 95). The presence of such metaphors demonstrates the irritation of the author about his inability to escape the world where he lives. Then, he saw an “agile and graceful” woman and again used several metaphors to express the transition of emotions and experiences. In the end, the reality is revealed by means of the chosen anaphors of “know not” and “o you” (Baudelaire 95). They demonstrate the author’s unawareness of the future and uncertainties of the present, and the reader is free to create a specific development of events in regard to personal experiences and ideas.\n\nConclusion\n\nBoth poems by Baudelaire are unique in their representation of limited experiences. The author did not want to provide the reader with definite emotions and attitudes toward the events around but enhanced creativity by means of metaphors and allegories. Liminal experiences of people are hard to avoid or predict because there are many internal and external factors that influence the development of events. “The Swan” and “To a Passer-By” represent the intensity of feelings and the impossibility of maintaining human relationships in the same way because of a constantly developing world, unstable standards, and unpredictable reactions.\n\nThe presence of the flâneur is not a random step taken by the author. This character explains the position of people toward the situation in the country. On the one hand, they become direct participants of the changes that happen around them. On the other hand, they can hardly do something individually to influence urbanization and the established standards. Baudelaire breaks the rules inherent to the poetry of the 19th century, and his tradition to consider the city as an object for analysis is proved to be successful and interesting to readers and critics.\n\nWork Cited\n\nBaudelaire, Charles.

      "Childhood Obesity Intervention and Its Effectiveness Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Literature Review\n 2. Description of the Case from a Theoretical Perspective\n 3. Detailed Explanation of the Findings\n 4. Summary of the Case\n 5. Entire Scenario\n 6. Evaluating the Proposed Intervention\n 7. Concluding Thoughts\n 8. References\n\nEven though health problems are usually associated with older populations, children are also subject to various issues. Childhood obesity is among them because numerous children now have a weight that exceeds an average value for their age and height. Multiple social, environmental, and behavioral patterns contribute to this phenomenon, while its consequences are represented by severe diseases, including elevated blood pressure, diabetes, and others. That is why pediatric obesity is a significant issue within a DNP area of practice. This state of affairs means that it is necessary to develop a specific intervention plan to address the issue and improve the target population’s health. Thus, the given case report will explain the problem and describe it from a theoretical perspective, present literature review, as well as offer a scenario to define the problem, implement an intervention, and analyze its effectiveness.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nPediatric obesity is a central topic of many pieces of research since scientists understand that this phenomenon is of importance. It is so because the problem significantly influences a large part of the world’s population. Powell (2019) stipulates that the number of children of 6-10 years old who has the body-mass index (BMI) of 30 and higher has doubled in the US over the past years. It denotes that BMI is an essential metric to determine whether an individual is overweight. In addition to that, Haynes and Browne (2016) mention that “the number of children under 5 years old affected by obesity has risen from 31 million in 1990 to 41 million in 2014” (p. 32). Furthermore, Bleich et al. (2018) explain that individuals from both developed and developing nations are subject to the given problem because of the existing socioeconomic inequalities.\n\nThe increasing number of obese children throughout the world means that many factors contribute to the spread of the given disease. Powell (2019) admits that it is a multifactorial issue since it “is affected by genetics, metabolic factors, socioeconomic factors, and lifestyle choices” (p. 1). However, this definition does not mean that all overweight individuals are victims of external conditions. It is sad to say, but the most typical cause of pediatric obesity refers to consuming more energy than the body spends and utilizes (Powell, 2019; Kumar & Kelly, 2017). It means that children have unhealthy eating habits that are accompanied by the lack of sufficient physical activity.\n\nThe given section of the literature review is devoted to the possible consequences of the issue under consideration. The main problem refers to the fact that individuals of young ages are exposed to this specific health condition that, in turn, will result in severe outcomes in the future. Bleich et al. (2018) admit that pediatric obesity is a practical prerequisite of the fact that individuals will suffer from chronic diseases when they grow up. In addition to that, typical consequences include low self-esteem, asthma, elevated blood pressure, and others. Powell (2019) supports this claim and tells that the possible effects include hypertension, asthma, diabetes, and others. At the same time, overweight children are subject to many conditions that have been considered “adult” ones a few years ago. Kumar and Kelly (2017) explain that it refers to type 2 diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.\n\nThe information above shows that society requires specific interventions to protect the young population from the problem under analysis. Kumar and Kelly (2017) admit that family-based lifestyle interventions are useful because they imply a healthy diet and increased physical exercise to burn excess energy. However, Bleich et al. (2018) stipulate that these ways to address the problem are not always useful because children spend much time at school, and family-based interventions lose their effect in this environment. That is why the researchers insist on the fact that school-based interventions are the most effective (Bleich et al., 2018). School-based interventions that include a healthy diet and sufficient physical exercise are said to be a practical way to address and prevent childhood obesity.\n\nDescription of the Case from a Theoretical Perspective\n\nIn addition to that, it is reasonable to address a theoretical perspective of the problem under consideration, and humanistic theory is a suitable option here. According to Mukhalalati and Taylor (2019), “humanism is a paradigm that emerged in the 1960s and focuses on human freedom and dignity to achieve full potential” (p. 3). Even though this theory is usually applied to adults, it is still a useful way to understand why the issue of childhood obesity exists. It is so because the given learning theory considers children fully-fledged members of society with their own thoughts, beliefs, and requirements. That is why children are provided with relative freedom to choose how to behave, what to eat, what to do, and others.\n\nSince young individuals do not have sufficient knowledge and experience, it is a typical case that they make mistakes and suffer from appropriate consequences. Consequently, the humanist theory explains that children are immature individuals to make reasonable decisions concerning their health. That is why the problem of pediatric obesity exists, and a suitable intervention is necessary to improve the health of the younger population. The literature under review has demonstrated that it is possible to use various interventions, but one should also explain what specific steps are required.\n\nDetailed Explanation of the Findings\n\nFindings of the literature review demonstrate that childhood obesity is a severe health issue in the modern world. It is so because millions of people in the United States and around the globe suffer from being overweight. The information above demonstrates that no one is protected against this issue irrespective of whether they live in developed or developing countries. Various factors can be considered causes of pediatric obesity, including health prerequisites, unhealthy eating, lack of physical exercise, and others. It is impossible to mention that some of them are the most significant. Still, abundant evidence proves that all overweight individuals follow unhealthy diets and do not engage in sufficient physical activity. In any case, the problem under consideration results in multiple adverse outcomes that can deteriorate people’s lives’ quality and duration. That is why various health care organizations and researchers address the problem and try to find ways to minimize its effects.\n\nAccording to the information above, it is possible to use two various interventions to reduce pediatric obesity prevalence. Even though the two imply the improvement of diet and the increase of physical activity, they differ in their manner. It refers to the fact that these options are family-based and school-based interventions (Bleich et al., 2018; Kumar & Kelly, 2017). These two terms mean that the scenarios are different based on who is responsible for implementing the necessary change. At this point, it is possible to suppose that the best results are possible if the two variants are combined.\n\nSummary of the Case\n\nMillions of children from various countries suffer from obesity and adverse consequences that this health condition brings. Social, behavioral, and other factors contribute to an increasing prevalence of the issue, which means that a comprehensive approach is needed to improve the situation. That is why the following section will present the entire scenario of how to identify obese children, what intervention to use, how to implement it, and how to evaluate it with an appropriate research instrument.\n\nEntire Scenario\n\nThe first step in the proposed scenario is to describe how to understand whether a child is obese. It is not a genuinely scientific approach, but a visual estimation can be suitable to find the individuals who are exposed to the problem under consideration. At the same time, BMI is an appropriate tool here because it brings accuracy. It is so because this metric shows whether a person’s weight is suitable for their height. Kumar and Kelly (2017) explain that BMI “is calculated by dividing the body weight in kilograms by the height in meters squared” (p. 251). This metric can generate slightly wrong results when it comes to children with relatively high muscle masses or who are short. Nevertheless, it is still the principal instrument that is used to determine individuals with obesity.\n\nSince everything is clear with defining obese children, it is rational to comment on what intervention can be the most effective. It has already been described that school and family-based programs are suitable. However, one should explain what specific steps or actions should compose the necessary intervention. On the one hand, physical activity can lead to positive outcomes if it is obligatory and regular. This claim is supported by Bleich et al. (2018), who demonstrate that enhanced or lengthened physical activity time is a suitable choice. Since the proposed intervention refers to children, running games are an effective option that provides individuals with required motivation. Children spend a significant part of their time at schools in educators’ care, meaning that the latter can be considered responsible for engaging children in such games.\n\nOn the other hand, one can suppose that regular physical activity will be more efficient when it is accompanied by a healthy diet. That is why the researchers insist on the necessity to make children improve their food habits. It refers to increasing fruit and vegetable intake, minimizing the consumption of sugar, fat, and salt, as well as preventing children from skipping their meals (Kumar & Kelly, 2017). Since parents are more responsible for providing their children with healthy food, this strategy is an element of a home-based intervention.\n\nEven though the information above has shown the difference between the home and school responsibilities, it does not mean that this division is strict. Parents should do their best to motivate their children to engage in regular and enhanced physical activity. Simultaneously, schools should also provide their pupils with healthy food to prevent them from consuming harmful products. It means that a comprehensive approach can be useful to address childhood obesity and improve the target population’s health. This information provides insight into how to implement the proposed intervention. Thus, schools should have specific educational programs that promote physical activity among their pupils. At the same time, it is reasonable to develop appropriate diet plans for parents to allow them to provide their children with healthy food.\n\nSpecific empirical evidence shows that the proposed intervention is rational and adequately selected. Firstly, Bleich et al. (2018) have analyzed 41 studies and state that most of them prove the effectiveness of school-based interventions. Secondly, Kumar and Kelly (2017) report that moderate and low-intensity physical activity leads to modest weight loss and results in improvements that range “from 1 to 3 km/m 2 of BMI” (p. 259). This evidence stands for the tenets of why these two interventions have been selected to address pediatric obesity.\n\nThe information above stipulates that the proposed interventions are based on the behaviorist learning theory. This idea emphasizes that a stimulus in the environment is required to make people change their behavioral patterns, which is necessary to fight pediatric obesity. Mukhalalati and Taylor (2019) explain that children will be more likely to participate in the interventions if they understand that this new behavior will positively affect them. Thus, parents and educators’ responsibility is to create a specific environment that will motivate children to modify their behavior. The behaviorist learning theory stipulates that the condition above allows the parents and educators to achieve a response from the children, which will help the people unite their efforts to reach the shared goal.\n\nEvaluating the Proposed Intervention\n\nIt is impossible to determine whether an intervention is successful if there is no explanation of how to evaluate it. Since the proposed change strategy is aimed at addressing childhood obesity, it is not a surprise that weight loss is its principal purpose. However, it is also reasonable to comment on what specific research instruments can be used to assess the effectiveness of the proposed intervention.\n\nAccording to Abildgaard et al. (2016), the most typical variant is to use qualitative or quantitative research instruments to evaluate interventions’ results. On the one hand, quantitative research instruments usually include questionnaires that are organized to identify whether an intervention has influenced the target population. This research instrument is useful to define a percentage of individuals who have experienced positive outcomes. It is possible with the help of building the scale that would reflect the total number of participants and the number of individuals who have benefited from the intervention. This instrument is relatively easy to use because it makes individuals fill in written forms, mainly with simple answers that do not require any detailed explanations.\n\nOn the other hand, qualitative research instruments are also practical, but they draw attention to more profound phenomena. Abildgaard et al. (2016) stipulate that “semi-structured interviews seem to be the conventional method” of these research instruments (p. 3). It relates to the fact that interviews are conducted to identify the extent to which the intervention has become effective. In addition to determining the number of improvements, the given research instrument focuses on their quality and volume. The implementation of this research instrument requires more effort compared to the example above. It is so because interviews imply direct contact between researchers and participants of the intervention. As a result, the given instrument allows scientists to determine what individuals think of the intervention, what can be improved, and others.\n\nAs for the proposed intervention to reduce the childhood obesity rates, one can suppose that quantitative research instruments, including questionnaires, are sufficient. The rationale behind this claim is that the intervention goal only is to reduce the number of children with obesity. One should explain that questionnaires will not present exhaustive information on what exactly children felt during the intervention, how they find the change strategy, or what they would like to improve. That is why this instrument is useful to assess the change strategy’s effectiveness because this tool requires little time and effort to identify how many individuals have experienced positive outcomes.\n\nIn addition to that, it is rational to comment on some steps to evaluate the instrument’s use under consideration. It is necessary because some individuals can present false information in their questionnaires. It can happen either intentionally or accidentally, but in any case, this fact will distort the real effect of the intervention. That is why the research instrument’s evaluation is suitable to ensure that the questionnaire results are factually correct. Since this instrument focuses on individual weight, it can quickly be evaluated by calculating the participants’ BMIs. The obtained information will show whether the intervention has led to the fact that the participants have lost weight and improved their BMIs. This measure will support the questionnaire results with empirical evidence.\n\nConcluding Thoughts\n\nPediatric obesity is a severe problem in the modern world because millions of children suffer from this health condition both in developed and developing countries. Many factors cause the given health issue, but an unhealthy diet and the lack of physical activity are the most influential. Furthermore, humanist learning theory is another factor that explains a high prevalence of overweight among children. Childhood obesity is a dangerous phenomenon since it implies many adverse consequences, including hypertension, diabetes, asthma, and others. That is why many scientists choose this topic for their research, and they offer useful ways to address the problem.\n\nIt has been demonstrated that childhood obesity rates can be reduced with a comprehensive approach to the case. That is why the use of school and home-based interventions should be justified and efficient. On the one hand, schools and educators are responsible for involving children in regular and sufficient physical activity, and conducting running games is a suitable option. It is so because this kind of physical activity provides children with the adequate motivation to participate in the intervention. On the other hand, parents should do their best to make their children eat healthy food. This strategy implies developing specific diet programs that do not include fats, sugar, and salt. Since the two steps require behavioral changes to achieve positive outcomes, it is reasonable to use them together to reckon on the best results.\n\nIn conclusion, one should also explain how it is possible to evaluate the proposed intervention. Since the proposed intervention aims at reducing the number of overweight children, it is possible to use qualitative research instruments. That is why questionnaires are suitable as they reflect how many individuals have experienced weight loss because of the intervention. If it is necessary to determine whether the questionnaire results are adequate and have an empirical basis, one can calculate the participants’ BMIs and compare them to pre-intervention values.\n\nReferences\n\nAbildgaard, J.

      "Your Destiny Is in Your Hands Essay\n\n“It may be unfair, but what happens in a few days, sometimes even a single day, can change the course of a whole lifetime…” (Hosseini p. 142).\n\nBoth films and books are created to produce a certain impression and bring some particular message to the reader or viewer. We will overview the film ‘Far and Away’ and the book ‘The Kite Runner’ to analyze the symbolic features in both.\n\nThe film ‘Far and Away’ produced and directed by Ron Howard tells the story of a young Irish man named Joseph who has great dreams and a strong intention to bring them to life. His house burnt down, and on the deathbed his father asks Joseph to fulfill his dream and become the owner of some land. He says: ‘Without land, a man is nothing. Land is a very man’s soul.’ (Far and Away). Joseph wants to take the revenge over Daniel Christie, the landlord who have burnt his house. When Joseph comes to Christie’s house he falls in love with Shannon, the landlord’s daughter who persuades him to flee to America with her. On their way to America, they meet a stranger who tells them that anyone can win a land at the Land Race in Oklahoma. In America, they encounter great difficulties. Joseph makes money participating in barehanded boxing matches, Shannon works at a plant and later she becomes a dancer in a local club. Once Joseph loses a big match, they are thrown away from the club without any money. Joseph and Shannon are desperate and helpless. When Shannon is wounded Joseph brings her to her family who had also lost their house in Ireland and moved to the USA searching for their daughter. Joseph starts working at the railroad building but once in his dream he sees his father who reminds Joseph about his main purpose in this country that is winning a land. Some time passed and Joseph meets Shannon again at the Land Run of 1893 in Oklahoma where she participates with her family. During the race, Stephen starts a fight with Joseph, who falls on the ground and hurts his head. Shannon is desperate thinking that Joseph was dead and tells Joseph that she loves him. These words revive him and they together plant the flag into the ground.\n\n‘The Kite Runner’ was the first novel by Afghan writer published in English. The novel brought the worldwide fame to Khaled Hosseini. It seems to be a quite different story in which the author narrates about the life of an Afghan boy Amir who once does not help his best friend Hassan. Due to his cowardice, he runs away leaving Hassan in a fight with an older boy and this occasion changes his life. ‘Amir’s story is simultaneously devastating and inspiring’ (Hill par. 6). He dreams to become a writer but his father does not support his idea. Rahim Khan, his father’s friend is the only person who understands his ambitions. Sometimes the protagonist feels that Khan loves him more than his own father does. The events of the winter 1975 force Amir to move to America where he starts a new life and finally becomes a famous novelist. One day his father’s friend Rahim Khan calls him and asks to come back to his motherland. Amir walks in the park where he sees children playing with kites and recalls his childhood when he played with his dear friend Hassan whom he called the kite runner back in Kabul many years ago. He remembers his father’s house, the pictures of his mother, and the sad story about Hassan’s mother who left him when he was one week old. Amir tries to think of a reason for Rahim Khan to summon him to Kabul (Hosseini pp. 1-12).\n\nWe can draw some parallels between the two stories. Both of them have two protagonists who are of different social status. Amir and Shannon were born in wealthy families and Hassan and Joseph originated from poor ones. Hassan is Amir’s servant and Joseph pretends to be Shannon’s servant when they travel. Both Amir and Shannon are misunderstood in their families. Amir wants to become a writer but his father does not appreciate his ambitions. Shannon, in her turn, longs for the modern lifestyle but her conservative parents suppress her intentions. The circumstances force the young people in both stories to leave their homes and search for a better life in America. The protagonists in both stories have to overcome great difficulties on their way to happiness (Gleiberman par. 3). They parted to reunite later: Shannon and Joseph meet again at the Land Run, and though Amir has never seen his friend since he left Afghanistan, he ‘meets’ Hassan and redeems his betrayal when he finds the way to become a friend and father to Sohrab.\n\nBoth stories have their specific symbols carrying some particular message. In the book ‘The Kite Runner’, kite has the same meaning and importance as land in ‘Far and Away’. Both land and kite in these stories symbolize freedom and happiness. Amir remembers his dear friend when he sees a child playing with a kite in San Francisco. Shannon and Joseph who have lost their homes have the purpose to win a land as the best way to happiness. For Joseph the land means not only wealth and money. It is associated with his own soul: a man without a land is a man having no soul.\n\nHouse is a strong symbol in the analyzed book and film as well. The house here stands for the social status of the protagonists. Amir and Shannon originate from wealthy families and they have grown up in big beautiful luxurious houses. While Joseph lives on a small farm and then loses it in the fire together with his family and Hassan lives in a ‘mud shack’ as he and his father are servants in Amir’s house.\n\nFamily is also symbolic and is supposed to mean safety and happiness but in both stories, main characters cannot find any support of their dreams there. They try to gain love and understanding of their parents but all their attempts break on the wall of conservatism. Shannon and Amir associate their families with a cage, which suppresses their identity so they both flee from their homes to get rid of the prejudice haunting them.\n\nThe two stories have much in common and each tells about a young man, who had a dream and fulfilled it. This film and novel prove that one day may totally change someone’s life. They also show that everyone has power to change his life to the better if he just dares to step on the winding road to the happiness.\n\nReferences\n\nFar and Away . Ex. Prod. Ron Howard.

      "Arts and Crafts Movement and Modernism Essay (Literature Review)\n\nIn “The Arts and Crafts Movement in Britain,” Crawford reviews the design and ideas behind the movement, trying to “explain why collaborative attempts at the Unity of Art did not come to much” (15).\nThe movement, with its Romantic sense of the past, strove to separate itself from the world by counter-distinguishing the Unity of Art and professionalism, Joy in Labor and factories, Design Reform and commercial taste; it became the last period of Romanticism, or anti-modernism (Crawford 24). While he cites the link between the movement and socialism, he states that it is not a political affiliation per se, but a sense of creating without being motivated by profit—of social responsibility.\nCrawford gives a very thorough account of the Arts and Crafts movement in Britain, and clearly states its strengths and weaknesses, but he cannot claim to be unbiased. It is clear that the author somewhat idealizes the campaign, freely explaining away some of its questionable attributes.\n\nWinter starts “The Arts and Crafts as a Social Movement” by calling attention to the failure of the Arts and Crafts movement just before World War I. Numerous Arts and Crafts societies had completely wound down by 1920 (Winter 36). All of the movement’s areas of work suffered a decline in quality, most notably architecture, due to increased wealth of the middle-class, and the spiritual nature of the campaign. Winter draws parallels between the Arts and Crafts movement and Progressivism as a whole, saying that Morris attempted to “revive the Protestant work ethic without Protestantism” (Winter 36).\nLike Progressivism, it also didn’t have any plan for social regeneration, other than vague Protestant and socialistic overtures. Though various artists shed light on the drawbacks of the movements, it was susceptible to Utopian aspirations.\nWinter states in the beginning that he is not unbiased toward the Arts and Crafts movement, and yet his article gives a lot of thought to the weaknesses and failures of the movement. Winter concentrates on the individual input of the movement’s notable artists, giving it a more personal and diverse outlook.\n\nIn “Designing for Democracy: Modernism and Its Utopias,” Barter describes modernism as “an extended revolution” (7) that emphasizes everything new, a collection of related styles drawing from the Arts and Crafts movement.\nThe author describes the philosophy and background of the movement, how a new generation reached toward new materials and the idea of simpler, more affordable design. Modernist futurism was equally as Utopian as the Arts and Crafts movement, striving to bring higher standards of living for all.\nThe author discusses American modernism, its history, and social uses, with skyscrapers as a “compelling symbol of a modern American culture that was driven and shaped by the forces of industry” (Barter 11). In the end, modernism became an impersonal symbol of corporate power in the United States, and a symbol of prosperity in a consumer society.\nBarter gives a clear and extensive analysis of modernism in both Europe and the United States. While the author clearly favors the modernism in the United States in his article, showing himself somewhat enamored with the concept behind it, he portrays its failures without bias.\n\nTschichold’s The New Typography is a publication about the New Typography movement that rejected traditional text placement. The book is made up of two major parts. In the first part, the author examines the historical roots of the movement and promotes its use. While all parts of the text are connected by value and context, it should be a typographer’s goal “ to express this relationship clearly and visi bly through type sizes and weight, arrangement of lines, use of color, photography” (Tschichold 3). In the second part of the publication, Tschichold discusses the practical aspects of the idea.\nIn the “Introduction to the English-Language Edition” that accompanies the text, Robin Kinross hails it “as the best single document of and about the New Typography” (Tschichold XV). He briefly describes Tschichold’s life before and after publication, and the realities that typographers of the German world were facing. Kinross discusses the main principles of the movement and mentions main objections.\nKinross’ introduction to The New Typography is a perfect introduction to an outdated publication. By giving the book’s and the author’s historical and cultural background, Kinross highlights why The New Typography was a revolutionary break-through in typography of its time. Starting the introduction with Tschichold’s biography is a well-calculated move, aimed at making the reader take a more personal look at the material.\nThe only aspect that doesn’t seem to be fully revealed is the opposition to the New Typography movement, which makes the introduction look rather one-sided.\n\nThe book Cultural Criticism: A Primer of Key Concepts by Berger is a valuable introductory text that presents a wide variety of theories and concepts, such as literary theory, Marxism, semiotics, and psychoanalytical and sociological theories, in the context of cultural criticism.\nIn the fourth chapter, Berger discusses the basic concepts of semiotics, “the science of signs” (73), sign functioning according to Peirce’s and Saussure’s systems, and the differences between index, sign, and symbol definitions in those systems. Berger gives definitions of connotation, denotation, metaphor, metonymy, and their subcategories, along with the opinions of various authors on their purpose in the language.\nCultural Criticism: A Primer of Key Concepts by Berger is the most academic, in comparison to the works above. It approaches semiotics as a concept that can be, and is, widely used in all types of art in everyday life. Consequently, Berger gives the reader a fascinating outlook on the choice of symbols in both the Arts and Crafts movement and modernism.\n\nReferences\n\nBarter, Judith A. “Designing for Democracy: Modernism and Its Utopias.” Art Institute of Chicago Museum Studies 27.2 (2001): 7-105.

      "The Case for Reparations: Slavery and Segregation Consequences in the US Essay (Article Review)\n\nIntroduction\n\nSlavery, racial segregation, and discrimination are critical topics in American society as the effects of these events are noticeable in the modern world. Black Americans, despite legislative equality, more often than white citizens experience poverty and limited opportunities, which is an effect of artificially created unequal conditions in the past. Ta-Nehisi Coates, in his essay The Case for Reparations , examines the consequences of slavery and segregation in the United States and argues the importance of reparations for black Americans, both in a financial and moral perspective.\n\nThe Policies and Practices That the Author Uses in His Essay\n\nCoates examines the problem of racial injustice of the past to prove the unfairness of the government’s attitude towards its citizens and to link this trend with the current situation in American society. His arguments are based on real stories and discriminatory policies that had been existing for centuries. The author demonstrates the story of a regular black American, Ross, to explain the arguments for reparations. Coates talks about Ross’s life in Mississippi, where his parents were forced to give up their farm and continue to work for the state government, fearing for their life and health (par.6). Then he studies scams with the sale of houses in Chicago when white owners profiteered on black Americans several dozen times. Black Americans were cut off from the possibility of obtaining a mortgage at the bank because the FHA identified available for them areas as a category that does not fall under the conditions of leases (Coates par.22). Therefore, the government formed black ghettos by creating conditions for speculation, since black people had to overpay to white owners for an opportunity to get a house.\n\nThe Main Kinds of Reparations\n\nThe author argues the need for financial reparations in his essay but also focuses on justice by saying that all cases should be documented and recognized by society. This step not only helps to create precedents and reduce the gap between racial groups but will teach people of history. Such a move is also logical and right for the morale of society as the segregation is a clear demonstration of the violation of all seven principles of Catholic social teaching. The very concept of slavery violated the idea of human dignity, and the slave trade undermined the institution of the family, since the masters often separated relatives by selling only one of them. For centuries, unfair laws violated the principle of protecting the rights and dignity of work, since black people were just a tool for making money even after the abolition of slavery. Ignoring the problems of black citizens and refusing to pay reparations now violate the principles of caring for God’s creation, helping the vulnerable, and solidarity. Thus, reparations are the right decision for Americans who want to live in a democratic and fair society.\n\nThe Main Arguments for Reparation\n\nThe author considers as the main reasons for the reparations, both elimination of the consequences of inequality and the fact of admitting guilt for the damage caused to people. Coates concludes that the situation has not changed much since the 1970s by analyzing the income gap of citizens and other social indicators (par.39). This problem exists due to the created unequal conditions and opportunities in which many black people have not been able to improve their lives. For this reason, reparations have to help needy citizens as they can use the money for treatment, education, or moving from the ghetto. The fact of a guilty plea is also an important reason, since it helps to reduce existing discrimination and to develop real democracy in the country. Black Americans will be able to receive moral satisfaction for the fact that today they are equal with other citizens, and the years of their suffering will at least partially justify themselves. Besides, such a demonstration of respect and understanding of the horrors of discrimination contributes to the fact that such a situation will not be repeated with any other resident of the United States.\n\nWhat the Government and Society Should Do\n\nThe author also considers the bill already proposed by the congressman and believes that new law is the right step towards solving the problem. Although there is still no law regulating the procedure for considering and paying reparations, there are already some precedents when lawsuits were settled in favor of black Americans. Thereby, the government needs to develop a bill in which the reasons, procedures for considering the case, and the sources of paying reparations will be identified precisely. Besides, it is necessary to convey to the public the need for such a law and explain the reasons for its creation to teach Americans history. These steps contribute to reducing financial and social inequalities among the population.\n\nConclusion\n\nTherefore, The Case for Reparations by Ta-Nehisi Coates is a work that reveals the consequences of racial injustice in American society from a legal and moral point of view. The author explains the reasons and demonstrates that reparations are a way to fix these consequences and improve the lives of US citizens. Besides, a society that learns from the mistakes of the past and exists according to the principles of morality has a much higher chance of a brighter future.\n\nReferences\n\nCoates, Ta-Nehisi. “ The Case for Reparations.” The Atlantic, 2014.

      "Translation as a Psycholinguistic Phenomenon Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Summary of the Article\n 3. Critical Reflections\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nHatzidaki (2007) argues that many studies in translatology involves the analysis of the language processing that takes place when a text is being translated from one language to the other. This being the case, the researcher goes further to argue that a connection exists between translatology and psycholinguistics. This is given the fact that psycholinguistics involves cognitive processes that are largely similar to those found in translatology. Translatology especially addresses the activities of bilingual and multilingual individuals involved in the process of translating a text (Hatzidaki, 2007). On the other hand, psycholinguistics (as mentioned above) addresses the cognitive elements of language usage, an aspect that is related to translatology.\n\nIn his article, Zasyekin (2010) seems to concur with Hatzidaki (2007) as far as the relationship between translation and psycholinguistics is concerned. Zasyekin (2010) argues that applying psycholinguistic principles in translation studies (read translatology) enables the researcher to determine “structural and semantic characteristics of the original and target texts, (and how) they influence the reader” (p. 232).\n\nThis paper is going to critically review the article written by Zasyekin (2010) which reports the findings of his study viewing translation as a psycholinguistic phenomenon. In this paper, I am going to provide a summary of the article which will be followed by a critical reflection of the same. I will also comment on selected aspects of the article as well as relate the study to the SLA context in Saudi Arabia. The application of this research to different social settings will also be provided.\n\nSummary of the Article\n\nIn the study reported in this article, Zasyekin (2010) proposes a theoretical framework that can be used to analyze translation of literary texts. This theoretical framework conceptualizes translation as a “psycho-semiotic phenomenon” that involves cognitive processes on the part of the translator.\n\nZasyekin (2010) makes use of four sources of data in his research. This includes The Catcher in the Rye and Franny, both texts written by Salinger. This is together with the Ukrainian and Russian versions of these two texts. The Temple of Poseidon by Pokalchuk is also used in this study. Other texts used include The Calling Cards and The Tender Breathing both by Bunin (Zasyekin, 2010). The English translations of the two texts are taken by Zasyekin as the primary corpus of this study. Ozymandias sonnet by Shelley is used by Zasyekin to supplement the primary corpus identified above.\n\nZasyekin (2010) reveals formal and content characteristics of the corpus by the use of a discourse analysis technique. The researcher also makes use of psycholinguistic techniques developed by Osgood et al. in 1957 to identify how semantic spaces are created by the native and target language readers of the selected texts (p. 226). Other techniques that are used by this researcher in the study include psycho-graphological analysis of prosaic texts.\n\nZasyekin (2010) concludes that the two codes that appear during translations can be regarded as two different forces. The codes are verbal-logical and concrete-imagined which are taken by many scholars (including Zasyekin himself) as the opposing forces in fictional texts. Distortions of textual structure result into a “spacious and simultaneous perception (of the) mythological (and) cyclic time model” (Zasyekin, 2010: pp. 232-233). Zasyekin concludes that this affects the consciousness of the reader.\n\nThe target reader is expected to interpret the information that is contained in the translated text. According to Zasyekin (2010), this involves application of cognitive efforts which might overload the reader’s consciousness (p. 233). This negatively affects the relevance of the information on the part of the reader.\n\nCritical Reflections\n\nThe major aim of Zasyekin as expressed in this article is to prove that translation is a psycholinguistic phenomenon. One reason why I find this article credible is the fact that the researcher integrates theories and perspectives of other scholars in the field in his study. For example, he refers to Vygotsky’s theory of the aesthetic response to show how the left and right cerebral hemispheres of the human brain affect the translation process (Zasyekin, 2010: p. 232). Other theories that the researcher integrates in his study includes Nida’s theory of dynamic equivalence among others. This makes this article a credible reference and source of information especially for linguistic students like me. This point is supported by other scholars such as Warszawa (2004).\n\nAfter reading this article, I found that Zasyekin’s study can be used to understand SLA students in Saudi Arabia. It is noted that English is a second language to almost all Saudi Arabia students who are taught using the language in college. These students will find themselves translating texts from English to Arabic and from Arabic to English. The students will also read articles and texts that have been translated from one language to the other either in class or at home. This being the case, translation can be seen as a critical aspect of SLA student in Saudi Arabia.\n\nHowever, one weakness of this article when it comes to understanding SLA students in Saudi Arabia is the fact that none of the texts used by Zasyekin is written or translated into Arabic. The texts used are written or translated either in English, Russian or Ukrainian.\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Hatzidaki, A. (2007).

      "Augustine and Kant’s Views on the Origin and Source of Wrongdoing Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Augustine’s views on the origin of wrongdoing\n 2. Kant’s view on wrongdoing\n 3. Why I support Kant’s views\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nAugustine and Kant provided revolutionary ideas on the problem of evil. They provided a means with which humanity could understand why they are so imperfect and thus paved the way for correcting those imperfections. The paper shall argue that the Augustinian view of sin excuses man from accountability and that the best way for solving such a problem is through adoption of Kant’s categorical imperative.\n\nAugustine’s views on the origin of wrongdoing\n\nThe three assumptions upon which Augustine bases his ‘ origin of sin’ concept is that man was created pure and he/she has a tendency to do good. The second is that evil results from the absence of good thus making evil an undesirable thing. Lastly, man cannot change the inclination to commit a wrongdoing doing by altering his social environment or anything else around him. In essence, Augustine was arguing that human beings are naturally good, however, they were distorted by the original sin and this causes them to be evil. (Outler, p. 40) In this school of thought, he affirms that there was a monumental fall from grace during humanity’s inception. Consequently, man lost the freedom that had been granted to him and this is a penalty that all other descendants have to deal with. Augustine’s arguments present a number of paradoxes that are resolved by the ‘downfall’ perspective. Augustine asserts that human beings in essence are good and he further affirms that evil is not desirable yet all human beings have an inclination to commit evil. This paradox is therefore resolved by the fall where Augustine explains that man acquired the inclination towards evil when Adam himself sinned. Therefore, through the actions of the first man, everyone else became evil. (Outler, p. 60)\n\nKant’s view on wrongdoing\n\nKant did not support the ‘downfall’ concept and dismisses it as a falsehood. He however concurs with Augustine that man is naturally moral although man has that inclination towards committing evil. To Kant, one must give precedence to moral principles rather than one’s inclination and this is an inner decision not based on any superficialities. (Kant, p. 271) His explanation on the collective nature of sin is founded on the premise that evil is not equal or superior to the will. This brings in a paradox which is based on the notion of evil and how to define. If one affirms that to be evil to be human then man is free from moral law. Conversely, if one affirms that to be evil is not natural, then it is assumed that some external force actually caused it and he cannot be held responsible for adhering to moral law. The paradox is solved by the noumenal ‘self concept’. Here, he states that man has two sides which include the apparent and the real. The real human is one who has pure intellect and is not bound by space or time. Conversely, the apparent one is one who eventually unravels himself after certain periods of time. Therefore, man can change morally by subscribing to rational faith. (Kant, p. 47) He can therefore atone himself through suffering.\n\nWhy I support Kant’s views\n\nThe Augustinian view of evil has a number of loopholes. First, the explanation allows one to understand what happened to the rest of humanity but it does not cover Adam’s sin. His type of sin did not emanate from an inherent nature; Adam had not fallen so he was innocent when committing that sin. Furthermore, the type of evil committed by Adam was original so by virtue of its originality, it cannot be repeated. It is therefore difficult to understand exactly how such sin can be carried forward to other human creations that followed Adam. Critics often wonder why God could not intervene and stop that transmission. Additionally, if man is currently not guilty of his wrongdoing, then he escapes the responsibility for sinning (Kant, p. 248).\n\nKant’s categorical imperative therefore places the responsibility for rectifying one’s sins on the shoulders of man. When man chooses to act beyond moral law, then he is conscious of these acts and must be made accountable for them. This is a critical insight to the problem of wrongdoing because it provides a tangible solution towards correcting man’s imperfections (Kant, p. 60). Furthermore, because of Kant’s focus on the driving force or the maxim behind an evil act in the categorical imperative doctrine, then humans can demystify this phenomenon of evil. Kant believes that one is moral when they opt to act in a manner that can become a universal law by any other person who may have been placed in such a position. This means that it is man’s imperative to decide whether or not he needs to behave in specific way or not. To this end, Kant offers a means with which man can improve himself. By learning more about life, wants and the like, one can be able to act in a moral way. This implies that one is not born as an evil person; however one has the choice to become evil as one learns more about life. In other words, faith’s place in man’s life can have a richer meaning upon understanding the categorical imperative since faith can then be understood as a means for making man less evil (Kant, p. 238).\n\nConclusion\n\nKant’s assertions acknowledge that the problem of sin is a concept that will always be a mystery to man. However, through the categorical imperative, he is able to explain why evil occurs and therefore prescribes ways in which man can take responsibility for his actions.\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Public Administration: Unemployment Economic Impact Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nUnemployment is a major social and economic problem. As per the International Labor Office’s (ILO) definition, a person is considered to be in a state of unemployment when he/she “ does not have a job, is available for work, and is actively looking for work ” (Disqus, 2010).\n\nThe U.S Department of Labor takes into account the above definition of unemployment while calculating the nation’s jobless rate. The “official” unemployment rate is released by the U.S government every month. This “official” unemployment index is indicative of the nation’s employment situation (Helpman, 2010).\n\nHowever, many believe that the “official” unemployment rate released by the U.S government is not a correct reflection of the actual state of unemployment in the nation. The situation is much grimmer. This is because the unemployment index released by the U.S government considers only those persons to be unemployed who have reportedly been looking for job for the past four weeks. This approach of the U.S Department of Labor has been widely criticized as it “ dramatically understates the true number of unemployed (and underemployed) people ” (DM, 2010).\n\nThis paradoxical situation can be explained with the help of the fact that the U.S government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics releases six different numbers relating to the nation’s unemployment rate every month namely “ U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, U-5 and U-6 ” (DM 2010). Of these, U-3 is the “ official unemployment rate ” (DM, 2010). But, the U-6 number is more accurate in the sense that it takes into account those sections that are generally not considered by the U.S government while calculating the unemployment index. These sections include the “ under-employed, part-time, temporary, discouraged workers, underground economy ” (Ehmke, 2010) etc.\n\nProblems with the unemployment rate\n\nAs per the unemployment numbers released by the U.S government in the month of July, 2010, the “official” unemployment rate stands at 9.6%. However, many are of the opinion that the unemployment numbers provided by the Bureau of Labor Statistics are frictional numbers. The real unemployment rate is much higher and is a reflection of the rising tide of unemployment in the nation. The U-6 number which is considered to be an authentic reflection of the actual scenario stands at a whopping 16.5% (U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2010). This is because this figure includes discouraged workers, marginally attached workers as well as part-time workers. Apart from these, there are other sections of the workforce that are not even covered by the U-6 numbers. These include temporary workers, under-paid workers, underground workers and persons involved in criminal activities (Benítez-Silva, 2010).\n\nDiscouraged and marginally attached workers\n\nThe discouraged workers constitute a major section of the labor force. In the U.S, discouraged workers are those who have stopped looking for work after realizing the futility of their efforts. “ They believe there are no jobs available for them . Discouraged workers are those people who are want to work and have looked for suitable jobs during the last 12 months but have not been able to find one” (Helpman, 2010). If the numbers of discouraged workers are incorporated into the “official” unemployment rate, it shots up considerably.\n\nIn addition to the discouraged workers, there is another broader category of workforce referred to as the “ marginally attached workers ” (Sahin, 2010). Helpman (2010) even indicated that “ These include those workers who are currently not looking for a job but have been on the lookout for a job in the recent past and would take up a job if offered. Discouraged workers constitute a sub-set of the marginally attached workers” (Helpman, 2010). The reason for omitting the marginally attached workers is that they have not looked for jobs during the last four weeks.\n\nPart-time workers\n\nThe U-3 number also excludes those persons who want to work full-time but are forced to work part-time due to “ economic reasons ” (Sahin, 2010). According to Helpman, (2010) “ These are the persons who are forced to work part-time either because their working hours have been shortened or they are unable to find suitable full-time jobs ” (Helpman, 2010). These part-time workers as well as the seasonal workers constitute the under-employed labor force of the U.S.\n\nTemporary workers\n\nAnother interesting aspect of the “official” unemployment rate released by the U.S government relates to the role of the temporary workers. According to the unemployment index released for the month of May, 2010, the overall payrolls increased primarily due to the increased hiring of the temporary workers. The data reveals that about 411,000 temporary census workers have been hired by the federal government which has contributed to maximum job creation in the month of May (Ehmke, 2010). However, the same is not the case with the private companies who are hesitant in enhancing their workforce. This sector has created only 41,000 jobs in the month of May compared to 218,000 in April (Benítez-Silva, 2010).\n\nUnder-paid workers\n\nThe record increase in the long-term unemployment rate post recession has given rise to a new working population comprising of persons who are over-qualified but under-paid. These are the persons who have to compromise with their education and experience and take up jobs for their survival.\n\nThe U-6 number, which is believed to be the real unemployment number, also fails to take into account the rising number of over-qualified but under-paid workers. The Bureau of Labor Statistics doesn’t have any accurate idea of the number of such persons in the US at present. If the number of these persons is taken into consideration, the unemployment rate is bound to be even higher (Sahin, 2010).\n\nUnderground economy\n\nParallel to the national economy, there exists another prosperous economy in the shadowy world where ‘ jobs, services and business transactions are conducted by word of mouth and paid for in cash to avoid scrutiny by government officials ” (Sennholz, 2003). This is known as the “ underground economy ” Sennholz, 2003).\n\nHowever, the underground economy needs to be distinguished from the criminal activities of the underworld in the sense that they do not inflict any harm on the society. The underground economy consists of persons who indulge in such activities in order to avenge the wrongs done to them by the government.\n\nThe kinds of jobs carried out by the underground workers include activities that yield income that are not reported to the tax authorities, economic activities that defy one or several government mandates, productive activities by aliens who do not enjoy the resident status and productive activities carried out by individuals who draw Social Security benefits or other forms of public assistance.\n\nThis economy misleads the workings of the government in a number of ways. One of these is in the calculation of the “official” unemployment rate by the government which fails to identify the underground workers. They are either bracketed into the employed or unemployed category depending on the findings of the interview survey that the U.S Department of Labor conducts every month (Sahin, 2010).\n\nCriminal activities\n\nAnother major problem with the high unemployment rate in the U.S is the increase in the number of criminal activities. With the weakening of the economy, the less educated and skilled youths face the maximum problem in accessing a decent job. Early denial instigates these youths to indulge in various criminal activities thereby inflicting harm on themselves as well as the society. The BLS, while calculating the unemployment rate of the nation, doesn’t take into consideration the increase in the number of individuals involved in various crimes. Thus, the above discussion reinstates the fact that the ‘official” unemployment rate is subject to modification as there are certain aspects of the unemployment problem that needs consideration (Helpman, 2010).\n\nImpact of the unemployment rate on the economy of United States\n\nThe unemployment rate is an indicator of the growth rate of a nation. The high unemployment rate that has struck US after the recession has a number of economic implications.\n\nFirstly, high unemployment means that the economy is unable to boost its situation by making use of the productivity of the unemployed individuals. High unemployment has a direct cost to the government since it is forced to pay unemployment benefits to individuals without any job and thus looses out on tax earnings.\n\nThe double costs incurred by the government in the form of additional costs and lost incomes can further aggravate the already declining economic condition. This is because the government will be forced to fund its unemployment benefit plans by increasing taxes and borrowing (Ehmke, 2010).\n\nThe increased taxes will again impact the consumption rate of the individuals. This will lead to further unemployment as people will spend less, there will be fewer revenues for the companies and companies will be forced to lay off more people. It must be taken into consideration that consumer spending forms an important part of the U.S economy. It is commonly held that consumer spending “ accounts for 70% of the U.S Gross Domestic Product ” (Global Research, 2009).\n\nIncreased borrowing by the government implies that the government will be forced to take more money out of the financial markets. This will again have an impact on the interest rates which will lead to higher company costs, less profit and more layoffs.\n\nIn the case of a sharp rise in the unemployment rates, the banks would be worst hit as they will have billions of dollars of bad loans on the balance sheets. This would, in turn, impact the dollar value. The rate at which banks will suffer loan loss will increase considerably which will make them more tight-fisted while lending loans.\n\nAnother impact the rising unemployment rate will have on the U.S economy is regarding the increase in the number of persons who have remained jobless for a longer period of time. After the recent recession that hit the U.S market, the number of such persons has reached a record 5 million. The problem with the increasing population of individuals remaining unemployed for a longer period of time is that it would be difficult for them to be reemployed after such a long gap. This would leave them unemployable for the rest of their lives which would have a strong impact on the economy. The economy would not be able to utilize its labor resources to the maximum (Benítez-Silva, 2010).\n\nThe primary goal for any economy is not to attain zero unemployment. This is because a developing economy must have a minimum level of unemployment failing which the employers would not be able to find suitable workers. Lack of suitable workforce would impact the product output.\n\nHowever, the inherent aim of most economies is attainment of full employment. Full employment is not the same as zero employment. The concept of full employment becomes clear with the help of a basic understanding of the three types of unemployment.\n\nTypes of unemployment\n\nThe three types of unemployment to be discussed here are ‘ frictional unemployment ’, ‘ structural unemployment’ and ‘ cyclical unemployment’ (Sahin, 2010).\n\nFrictional unemployment\n\nFrictional unemployment is defined as the unemployment that occurs when individuals switch different jobs or when they enter the labor market. The period of unemployment results from the fact that finding a suitable job takes some time. However, frictional unemployment is a temporary phase as this is the time taken by the job-seekers to find the suitable jobs. In this context, reference may be drawn to the fresh college graduates who may take a couple of months to find the desired job. It is believed that some level of frictional unemployment always exists in the society (Helpman, 2010).\n\nStructural unemployment\n\nThe structural unemployment is considered a more serious form of unemployment. “ This is because this kind of unemployment is the direct result of a complete mismatch between the skills required for specific jobs and the skills possessed by the job seekers” (Ehmke, 2010). It can also emanate from a mismatch between the job location offered and that desired by the job seekers.\n\nStructural unemployment is considered to be long-term unemployment as individuals with specific skills require time to find jobs that match their abilities. Moreover, relocation to other places also requires considerable amount of time. Reference may be made to the many garment workers who lost their jobs when the garment factories moved overseas. This gave rise to structural unemployment as these workers did not have the necessary skills to fit into computer related jobs (Sahin, 2010).\n\nCyclical unemployment\n\n“ Cyclical unemployment occurs when there are fewer jobs available in the market due to slower economic growth. Due to less demand of goods and services, the number of available workforce is greater than the number of workforce required ” (Ehmke, 2010). Cyclical unemployment occurs during recessions. As has been already mentioned, an understanding of the above unemployment types helps us in our understanding of the concept of full employment. “ Full employment occurs when cyclical unemployment is zero and frictional and structural unemployment are at the lowest ” (Ehmke, 2010).\n\nWhen the unemployment rate is higher, the economy cannot utilize the human resources effectively. On the other hand, when the unemployment rate is lower, the number of available workers become less thereby giving rise to inflation. Full employment, thus, refers to the optimum unemployment rate and is defined as “ the lowest unemployment rate consistent with stable prices ” (Bureau of Labor Statistics 2009).\n\nRole of education in reducing unemployment\n\nEducation and proper training plays a pivotal role in reducing unemployment which is a global problem. During economic slowdown arising out of recession, the worst affected are those who have less education and insufficient skills to fit into any job. They lack the necessary job requirements that leave them unemployed for a longer period of time. Out of frustration and anger, they select the easiest route to earn their living by indulging in a number of criminal activities.\n\nStructural unemployment is a common feature not only of an economy hit by recession but also of a stable economy. This is a recurrent feature in today’s world. Rapid technological advancement and global integration leads to the development of new sectors and decline of the older ones. This calls for a highly skilled workforce who possesses the flexibility to adapt to the changing demands for job (Benítez-Silva, 2010).\n\nThis becomes difficult for persons who have the necessary skills to work in specific capacities. Naturally, when they are laid off or when their sector suffers a decline, it becomes difficult for them to find new employments. This problem is referred to as occupational immobility of labor (Sahin, 2010).\n\nHowever, this problem can be addressed by formulating policies aimed at providing the unemployed with the necessary skills to meet the growing job needs. By providing necessary education and quality training, these individuals would be qualified enough to satisfy the job needs. By improving the quality and availability of education and workforce training, more and more unemployed persons will gain the necessary expertise which would facilitate their re-employment in other sectors. Thus, education and effective workforce training will help in reducing the unemployment rate considerably. For this, both the employer and the employee need to understand the benefits of education in addressing the problem of unemployment (Helpman, 2010).\n\nThe problems of cyclical unemployment which result from economic slowdown can also be addressed with the help of education and training. This can be well illustrated with the help of the data regarding the unemployment rate as calculated in the year 2009. The data reveals that the unemployment rate has been recorded least among the professional degree holders (2.3%) followed by the doctors (2.5%) (Sahin, 2010). The Master’s degree holders recorded an unemployment rate of 3.9% while the bachelor’s degree holders had an unemployment rate of 5.2% (Benítez-Silva, 2010). Unemployment rate was higher among the high school graduates (9.7%) and maximum among those who had less than a high school diploma (14.6%) (Ehmke, 2010).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above discussion, thus, draws our attention to the fact that there is a greater discrepancy between the “official” unemployment rates as released by U.S government and the real unemployment numbers. This disparity between the two numbers has also given rise to a lot of confusion regarding the definition of unemployment as followed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Moreover, it has also triggered a debate as to which sections of the labor force are to be taken into consideration in order to calculate the unemployment rate. The upward rise in the unemployment rate in the U.S has impacted the economy in a number of ways. Steps should be taken to reduce the unemployment rate as it has got serious implications. Apart from the various economic setbacks, high unemployment rate also increases criminal activities among those who couldn’t find suitable jobs. The goals of unemployment need to be understood before addressing the problem. There are a number of ways in which unemployment can be reduced. One of these is education. Providing quality education and proper workforce training can help in developing the human capital and preparing them for all sorts of jobs.\n\nReferences\n\nBenítez-Silva, H. (2010).

      "Herbert Spencer and Harold Garfinkel: Comparison Term Paper\n\nHerbert Spencer was well known as a gifted amateur. During his early days, he attended a local school for four years but he started his studies when he was 7 years old. When he attained the age of 13 years, he decided to go and live with his uncle, who was pursuing a successful career at Cambridge University (Kendall, 203). When he was 16 years old his uncle offered him an offer at the University of Cambridge, but he declined the offer and got obliged to look for a job. In his life, he learned much from experience, where he used to roam the countryside to collect specimens and acquired knowledge of how animals and insects live, and finally got used to sketching from nature.\n\nHarold Garfinkel was born in 1917 in New Jersey. He had initial interests in becoming a surgeon but this was later affected by great depression conditions. He decided to study business so that he can be in a position to help his father’s furniture business. He studied at the University of Newark where he specialized in accounting. During that period, his friends from Columbia University influenced him to study sociology (Stephens, 426).\n\nIt was in 1939 when he attended the University of North Carolina where he advanced in the description of race relations and homicide. His interests in the works of other theorists who were best on social actions developed a great deal.\n\nGarfinkel was putting extra effort to make sociology a more scientific field whereby he was generating statistics and quantitative analysis to describe society and the issues in it. In 1948 he composed a dissertation proposal which was known as “prospectus for an exploratory study of communicative effort and the modes of understanding in selected types of dyadic relationships”. Although this proposal was incomplete it was distributed among graduate students of Harvard University. First-time readers of Garfinkel’s writings find it hard to understand because his approach to sociology is unconventional and most readers are used to the traditional approaches.\n\nWriters describe his writing as complex (Slattery 124). Some of his colleagues like John Heritage and Michael lynch have expressed the ideas of Garfinkel in a simple way in their books. Before he expanded his sociology ideas, the field of sociology had undergone some revolutions. Other publications which Garfinkel made were studies in ethnomethodology, ethnomethodologys program, and seeing sociologically, the routine grounds of social actions.\n\nHerbert Spencer lived between 1820 and 1903. Between 1790 and 1866 George Spencer who was Herbert’s father was an apolitical radical who worked hard to see re-order of the society. Herbert was considered more radical than his father, though they both acted with each other on good terms and corresponded with each other till the time his father died (Stolley, 98). Herbert’s radical status was greatly influenced by his uncle because he was in charge of his education. His uncle Thomas prioritized political actions and mostly favored the church reforms. At the age of 16 years, his uncle had already stated influencing Herbert’s decision of starting writing some short articles.\n\nBetween 1837 and 1841 Herbert worked as a railway engineer, but he was still determined to pursue his writing career. In his railway work, he got first-hand experience which he expressed in his article which was known as “Railway Morals and Railway policy in the Edinburgh Review of October 1854”. His work on the railways advanced his scientific knowledge. He published his first book in 1850 when he was at the age of 30 which was called “social static”. Other books which Herbert wrote included “Education intellectual, moral, and physical’, “Data of ethics”, “The principles of sociology volume 1”, and “Study of sociology among others”. This book was mainly focusing on the equal freedom doctrine (Kendall, 531).\n\nHerbert’s interests in becoming a potential philosopher or a scientist were all along with limited by the lack of some components of formal education. Philosophers could not recognize him as a true philosopher and on the other hand, scientists would not recognize him as a professional scientist. Among the major accomplishments of Herbert Spencer is the development of the concept of evolution, and was referred to by the Victorians as the foremost philosopher during that period (Stephens, 470).\n\nThe major accomplishment of Harold Garfinkel is being associated with the foundation of ethnomethodology. He has defined ethnomethodology as the way in which ordinary people use to make sense out of the many aspects contained in the social world. Herbert Spencer has been referred to as the second founder of sociology, with many contributions to shaping sociology into what it is today (Stolley, 103). Harold’s ethnomethodology studies have contributed a lot to the development of sociology to the point it has reached today.\n\nIn conclusion, these two theorists are great contributors to what sociology is today especially in the efforts of making it a discipline. Through their publications, they brought many individuals to the understanding of what sociology should mean to them and assisted them to interpret many aspects of life. In several cases, they have also challenged many readers and writers in their day-to-day lives.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nKendall, D.E. Sociology in our times , (3 rd ed), ISBN053457078X, 978053457078.

      "Comparson of Two Versions of the Story of Lucretia Essay\n\nWomen are traditionally considered to the fair sex. However, human history has known some women who have managed to make their memory worshipped in centuries due to their remarkable lives. Two pages are too short to mention all of them since the list that will start with the Virgin Mary, Jane of Arc, and other outstanding women can cover numerous volumes. Still, there is no necessity to enumerate them, the fact that their memory lives in our mind, literature, and art is a good tribute to their heroic lives. If we have mentioned art and literature as the source of memories of heroic women, it is necessary to mention a legendary Roman woman, Lucretia, whose heroic sacrifice has been a turning point of Roman history and a major theme of world literature and art.\n\nLiterature can serve different purposes and the same historical event can be interpreted by different authors in different ways that let them present their argument. Such is the case with Lucretia and the story of her rape and suicide. The present paper is devoted to the comparative analysis of the story of Lucretia as presented by Roman historian, Livy in his History of Rome and the character of Lucretia as depicted by Christine de Pizan, a medieval authoress, in her “City of Ladies”. Both authors present a different interpretation of the legend and the personality of Lucretia by the purposes of their writings: the primary aim of the historian, Livy, is to give the account of a historic event, while the main aim of de Pizan is to show the problem of women in society dominated by men.\n\nLivy’s interpretation of the event is presented in the primary source, his History of Rome is a historical document and this specific character accounts for his manner of presentation of the event. Besides, the authorship of a man leaves its mark on the episode and its bare presentation of facts. The story of Lucretia is presented by its main purpose. The historian treated it as the chief cause of the coup d’état in Rome that put an end to the monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of Rome. He depicted the event from the point of view of its importance for Roman citizens who understood that it was impossible to submit to the monarchy of tyrannical rulers anymore. Lucretia inspired the beginning of revolution though she had no intention to do this. The key idea of the story is the final statement by Brutus, “I swear … never to tolerate Kings in Rome evermore, whether of that family of any other” (Livy par.3). Thus, the rape of Lucretia is recounted from the point of view of its historical significance.\n\nAs for the story of Lucretia as offered by de Pizan, it produces different effects due to the main aim of the authoress: she analyzes the personality of Lucretia, the place of a woman in society dominated by male authority, and she tries to defend her sanctity and fidelity. If emotions are omitted by Livy as unimportant, they prevail in de Pizan’s narration. Her style of narration is more emotional and she does not stick to historical details. She makes use of such words as “weeping”, “sobbing”, “shameless and dishonorable”, “rushed like madmen” (De Pizan par. 19). The final statement in the episode has nothing in common with the Revolution and the Republic. Besides, the Republic is mentioned in this version as an event of secondary importance. Thus, de Pizan states: “because of this outrage … a law was enacted whereby a man would be condemned to death for raping a woman” (par. 16). Rape as a moral trauma is at the center of the story.\n\nConcluding, it is possible to state that the two versions of the same legend show that any historical event can be interpreted by different authors in their ways. A certain historical episode can be an account of historical development and a moral parable as well.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDe Pizan, Christine. The Book of the City of Ladies . 2010. Web.\n\nLivy.

      "Southwest Airlines: The Key Issues Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Company Background\n 2. Analysis\n 3. Issues and Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nThe paper will elaborate on Southwest Airlines, its strategy, the reasons behind its success and a critical review of the kind of plan it should chalk out for the future.\n\nCompany Background\n\nSouthWest Airlines has been running for the past twelve years and is reputed to be one of the best there is in North America. Southwest was initially named as Air Southwest Co. by Rollin King and Herb Kelleher who were the co-founders of the airlines. It was in 1968, did they file for their approval with the FAA for their plan to fly between three cities. From there on, especially the 1980s and the 1990s, the airline started expanding its bases quickly in the Southwest, Midwest and Northwest. Soon Florida was also added. In most of these places, South West Airlines, enjoyed success on a larger than predicted scale. Local airlines were inevitably abandoned by the natives there and SWA chosen over for its incredibly cheap airfares. It gave a good run for money to the likes of American airways and US Airways. Most of them had to track routes, which SWA was not taking, but found little progress even there. Today, it is the fourth-last domestic carrier, speaking in terms of the number of customers that board on it. The airline has come a long way, transforming itself from a regional operator in Dallas to a national carrier. At the end of 2002, SWA was serving 58 cities in 30 states and was operating a whooping 2800 flights a day. It enjoys revenue of 45.4 billion RPMs and even more astonishing is its thirtieth year in a row of profitable operations. It was apparently the only profitable US airline in 2002. It enjoys good standing amongst its customers for its on time performance, on-time performance, best baggage handling, and fewest customer complaints.\n\nThe organization has been running under the auspices of Mr. Kelleher for the past three years while Mr. Parker is the company’s top negotiator. He has been the main pillar behind the continued constant growth of South West Airlines. Their vision is the same today as it was ten years ago. They believe in providing good service, at cheap costs, no frills airline in it.\n\nAnalysis\n\nThere are a myriad of factors that have contributed to the success of Southwest. Its operating income was a huge 5 billion dollars in 2002 while operating expenses continued to decline proportionally. SW’s operations are proactive and are quick to size strategic opportunities that they come across. Rapid expansion was always resisted and it was only when sufficient resources would be available did they venture into other areas. Competition has intensified for SWA since September 11 th , 2001 and has shifted to low fare airlines. This was a result of the losses incurred by some major airlines in 2002. Before September 11, United was SWA’s biggest competitor but owing to financial losses, it had to be closed down eventually. Other formidable low fare competitors include Delta and America West but thanks to careful planning by SWA, it continues to enjoy high market shares. (SouthWest Airlines)\n\nSouthwest tries to be as unique as possible in its marketing approach from the rest of the industry. It tends to live up to its fun-loving, funky bubbly reputation in the process. It followed this strategy especially when other big airlines were trying to run southwest out of business. It placed an ad that said, “Nobody’s going to shoot Southwest Airlines out of the sky for a lousy 513.” This was followed by an offer by Southwest to purchase a ticket from Southwest which stood at half the price of normal fares. It also offered a full fare ticket at a measly $26 along with a premium whisky with it. The response was overwhelming. Southwest’s Planes were jam packed in no time and became one of the top Liquor distributors in the state of Texas. The ads placed by Southwest have a very convincing flavor attached to them. They emphasize more on the real value that the airline is set to offer them. In other words, it aims at making flying fun and colorful. Ergo, it has earned a lot of respect and credibility amongst its customers by living up to its promises.\n\nIt continues to be one of the lowest-cost airlines in its markets. Bigger airlines could not help but incur losses when they tried to live up to its standards. SWA still operates at the lowest cost per available seat mile and this is around twenty five percent lower than its rivals. One big reason behind the lost costs is its enviable record when it comes to maintaining and using planes of the same time. They are and always have been Boeing 737s which has always helped them curb their operating expenses in the process. This was also substantiated by this realization on South West’s part that the planes can only earn money when they are in air, hence they focused on faster turnaround on the ground. Their on ground services became faster and rapid/ it has a turnaround time of twenty minutes or less while that of other companies is 1 hour. (Southwest Airlines)\n\nThey have also been unhindered and completely successful in rapidly turning around planes but post September 11; this could not be done without incurring expenses. As the government added new security procedures and measures, longer check-in times, operating expenses rose up. Yet another plus point of Southwest is the team spirit with which it works. This is more so, because the company holds this belief that employees come before customers. It is reputed in the market for providing ample amount of information to its employees about southwest, its mission, its purpose, its history and it’ long term goal. It believes that information is power and tries its utmost to capitalize on this bountiful resource. (Connections on The South West Network)\n\nIssues and Conclusion\n\nAt the moment, SWA is providing service in at least fifty eight cities around the globe. Thus there exist innumerable opportunities for expansion all over. However there is a hitch. Competitors have now learned from Southwest and its unique management strategies. They are trying to implement the same tactics to woo and win over customers. SW has always believed in conservative growth tactics but this may bounce back provided that its rival competitors opt for faster growth strategies. Thus it is incumbent that Southwest carefully chalks out a strategy which will help it meet any eventuality in near future.

      "Wal-Mart: Problem Formulation and Identification Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Wal-Mart\n 3. Other Organizations\n 4. Process Description\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe definition and analysis of a problem, if properly performed, is half of the solution, as the actions are sufficiently effective if they are aimed at a particular target. The style, which is generally used in any company, depends on the business traditions of a company, and on the experience of its managers in solving various problems and defining the reasons for the problems.\n\nThis paper aims to analyze the problem identification of Wal-Mart organization and compare it with the style of the other organizations. Originally, there is a necessity to outline the pros and cons of these methods.\n\nWal-Mart\n\nOriginally, this is the largest retail industry in the world, and if problems occur, they often appear to be global. The way of identifying the problem is the following: the strategy of the organization presupposes the existence of particular aims and goals, directed for the further development and maintenance of the existing structure. If the goals are not achieved, and the requirements of the strategy are not met, it is regarded as a problem. The fact is that this technique is used by any organization, as it is universal and simple. However, it is impossible to resort to it, if the strategy and plan are absent. (Langdon, 2001)\n\nLocal problems are solved locally, and each regional department resorts to the way of solving problems that is closer by its origin to the problem, or manager’s experience. As for the organization in general, it should be stated that it chiefly practices the collective-participative problem-solution style. The essence of this style is collecting and discussing all the possible variants. The leader of a discussion is selected every time the discussion is arranged, and he is responsible for the order and taking of the final decision.\n\nOriginally, this style is close to brainstorming techniques, consequently, all the decisions are taken quickly. On the one hand, the rapidity of the process seriously violates the objectivity of the decision and the accuracy of the analysis. On the other hand, the organization of such scales has to take all the decisions immediately, to avoid serious consequences.\n\nSometimes the problems are forecasted, prevention is required instead of the solution. Surely, it is the best way of solving problems, nevertheless, forecasting requires a more accurate approach and analysis of the reasons and consequences.\n\nOther Organizations\n\nOther business and non-profit organizations also resort to the collective-participative method, however, lots also use the method which entails three components: Consultation, Objective Analysis, and Monitoring. Thus, consultation presupposes the comparison of the existing problem with the similar obstacles, which were faced by the company, or some other organization. Archives and reviews should be studied and outlined if some tendency is observed. Then, when the necessary and sufficient data is collected, the next phase starts. Objective analysis requires the adjustment of the scale and the set of indicators. Basing on the evaluation system the current position of the company should be identified, and the reasons, why the company is unable to move forward should be defined basing on the results of a consultation phase. Consequently, when the obstacles are defined, they can be easily eliminated, and progress may be estimated. (Langdon, Paul, 2006)\n\nThe final phase is monitoring. It requires thorough observation of the decision implementation process as well as the monitoring of the business environment and organizational performance to identify whether the solution was correct, and the problem was properly identified.\n\nThe advantages of this method are that it is more objective than brainstorming and more accurate in the context of analyzing the circumstances. Taking into consideration the fact that the preparation phase for solving the problem is essentially extended, there is a strong necessity to emphasize that the decision-making process is based on a wider database, consequently, the search of the reasons and the problems is essentially simplified.\n\nThe drawback of this method is covered in the notion that it requires too much time for performing the data collection and processing of the data for further objective analysis.\n\nProcess Description\n\nTo describe the problem in a manner, which is sensitive for the stakeholders, it should be explained to them, that their interests would be seriously affected. If the immediate actions are not undertaken, the consequences may be fatal. Surely, there is a strong necessity not to frighten them, but explain everything for they realized the danger of a delay or negligence. The perspectives of the stakeholders, if affected, may play an essential role in investment.\n\nConclusion\n\nFinally, it should be emphasized that the problem identification and solution processes may be defined by several techniques, nevertheless, the essence of all the methods are outlined in two described styles. The fact is that Collective-participation and Consultation – Analysis – Monitoring are the two antipodes of problem-solving. The former is quick, and the latter is objective and accurate. Which one to use is up to the company’s management.\n\nReference\n\nElder, L., Paul, R. (2006) “Critical Thinking.

      "Addiction: Is It a Disease or Moral Failing? Essay\n\nAccording to the journal article of clinical and research news (2004), a disease can be defined as a complicated relationship existing between the environment of an individual and the general genetic makeup that combines together resulting in an abnormal state of physiology that is reflected in signs and symptoms (Pg 15). The article further defines addiction as a complex societal and health problem which has the potential of destroying peoples’ lives and communities (Pg 19). Studies on brain have shown that addiction can have a great influence on the brain areas and especially when it comes to decision making, memory, learning and behavior control. In order to overcome this situation the addiction problem should be addressed since the issue of whether addiction is disease or not has raised many concerns with many people arguing that addiction is not a disease rather a moral failing or negative behavior (Pg 30). My point of view in this essay is that addiction is disease not moral failing.\n\nAccording to the journal article of Psychiatric News (2004), addiction is a disease (Pg 32).The journal describes addiction as a illness by using the disease representation model which describes addiction as a difficult disease like other diseases (Pg 33). It further states that addiction is associated with physiological, genetic, nutritional and environmental factors which are key factors that need to be addressed for the situation to be corrected (Pg 40).Like other diseases addiction causes a person to act in unhealthy way and adapt a compulsive behavior that they carry out uncontrollably around with chronic use of a certain substance or stimulus such as alcohol, drugs, sex, gambling or cigarettes (Pg 50). On the other hand studies in this journal shows that some other people argue that addiction is not a disease rather a moral failing or character problem caused by degeneracy or lack of will power (Pg 51).\n\nIn the journal article of Psychiatric News (2004), drug addiction is also seen as major disease of addiction that affects the brain (Pg 60).The article defines drug addiction as a persistent brain damage which causes a person to heavily use drugs and despite destructive penalties associated with it (Pg 65).Drug addiction has been known to have undesirable results which may include escalating communal stigma and individual shame which contributes to an individual not seeking treatment in time. It is a brain disease that results in the change of the overall structure of the mind and how it functions (Pg 68). These changes do not easily end and can make people to behave in a manner that is not desirable especially by people who consume the drugs. The addiction disease has a long lasting effect on the brain and can have harmful effect on a person’s brain and conduct which has been proved by research done by scientists who prove that natural and ecological factors add to the growth and evolution of the disease (Pg 78). On the other hand studies in this journal shows that other people argue that addiction is not a disease rather a negative bad behavior which people often experience as a compelling motivation (Pg 79).\n\nAccording to the journal of Psychiatric News people view it as just a bad behavior like other behaviors that include nail biting, overeating, wife beating etc. They argue that it is a self-defeating and anti-social behavior which people engage in because they feel degraded and disapproved of which motivates them to continue the negative behavior since they feel that the balance of their internal desires and rewards is not to act that way (Pg 80). Furthermore they argue that since it is just a negative behavior it can be corrected whenever the person is given an opportunity and support to makes positive choices (Pg 81).\n\nAccording the generic model explained in the journal article of Volkow May Have Uncovered Answer to Addiction Riddle (2004), addiction is seen a disease which is caused by susceptibility genes that someone has in his/her body which indicates a propensity for certain behaviors (Pg 20). Evidence from the development studies of twins illustrate that addiction is a disease that is categorized like other heritable diseases since genes play a role since they influence a person to develop a drug addiction character (Pg 26) Genes can play a great role to protect an individual from using drugs or becoming an addict as the genes relate with ecological risk and defensive factors genetically to determine the way and effect of the disease (Pg 28).The model gives an example of AI allele of the dopamine receptors DRD2 gene that is shared with people who are likely to have problems with addiction to alcohol, cocaine or gambling compulsive(Pg 33).The theory argues that this causes opioid cravings for an individual hence influencing the individual to start using drugs and making it difficult to withdrawal from drugs which in the end becomes a disease that can treated (Pg 35).\n\nStudies in the journal article of Jim Rosack shows that not all people believe the genetic model, other people argue that the genes are not solely responsible for drug abuse and addiction since there are no mechanisms that can make a person to become completely unable to control substance abuse nor go on tremendous binges or live without connection to the environments in order to consume a substance (Pg 35). They wrap up a conclusion that hereditary theories do not clarify the knowledge on the loss of control since they reveal fundamentally anti scientific attitudes that lack understanding of the power of human motivation to react to response, experience, environmental science and external stimuli (Pg 38).\n\nAccording to the journal article of Psychiatric News (2004),dependency on alcohol and other drugs was termed by people as a moral problem since the person addicted to it was seen as weak-willed and an individual who do not care about his/her life and other individuals (Pg 82).Studies in book shows that the situation has been corrected by medical doctors, clergy and other medical professionals after the realization that chemical consumption is a disease which responds to treatment (Pg 83).Studies further in this journal point out that addiction as a disease has many features that are related to other kinds of diseases which are also influenced by ecological conditions and activities that have the ability to respond to correct treatment which may include long-term lifestyle and adjustment.(Pg 85).\n\nOn the other hand, studies in this journal article of Psychiatric (2004), shows that not all people agree with this idea others argue that no one chooses to be a drug addict or to develop heart disease (Pg 87).This implies that the people may choose behaviors that have undesirable effects unknowingly due to lack of personal responsibility and good character. They therefore argue that addiction is not like other composite diseases which requires a lot if attention from medical practitioners (Pg 90).\n\nIn the journal article of Volkow May Have Uncovered Answer to Addiction Riddle (2004), studies shows that people oppose the disease model and prefer life process model of addiction as they argue that labeling people as addicts make them not to develop self control but rather stigmatizes them (Pg 28).They further argue that the disease approach has not discovered any natural mechanisms that can be identified with the addiction behavior nor justify addiction as disease which is a great implication that addiction cannot be termed as a disease rather a habitual response that can be corrected by building social relationships(Pg 50). However the medical practitioners in this journal article argue that such definition is wrong since not all diseases require a mechanism to be identified which implies that addiction is a disease (Pg 52). In conclusion, addiction is a complex chronic disease like other diseases which can be treated hence should be seen as neither a moral failing nor a negative behavior.\n\nWorks cited\n\nPsychiatric News: American Psychiatric Association; Volume 39, Number 11; Pg 32-90, (2004).\n\nClinical and Research News; Pg 15-30, (2004).

      "Enslaved Women’s Means of Resistance Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. According to gender\n 3. According to kind of work performed\n 4. According to geographical location\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Works Cited\n\nThis paper addresses the various forms in which women resisted slavery. It also looks at the ways in which these forms of resistance were influenced by factors such as gender inclinations, the geographical location and the kind of work performed by these women. It includes an introduction, the discussion on various forms of resistance applied which are classified under the 3 broad categories of gender, geographic location and work done and finally, a conclusion.\n\nIntroduction\n\nSlavery is one worst injustices where an individual is forcefully made to labor for another against their will. The well documented form of slavery was the people of African origin, both male and female were working for the white masters. It is this denial of freedom to a social life, being overworked, mistreatment and other forms of cruelties that probed the slaves to start a wave resistance. The contribution of the women in the rebellion against slavery is often overlooked, a stand which needs to be reconsidered particularly having in mind the way they distinctively used their gender, geographical location and the form of work they performed.\n\nAccording to gender\n\nWomen took several ways of resistance which were either passive or active. Resistance methods applied by females often differed from those applied by their male counterparts. Their form of action sought to particularly maximize their gender to fight the forms of abuse related to them: against sexual abuse where they denied their masters the favors or in an active form they fought physically like in the case of Celia who had bore 2 children to her master (Robert Newsom) before deciding enough was enough and attacking him with a piece of sick and killing him. Women also took charge of educating their daughters on their traditions as a form of retaining the cultural identity. Women are known to posses the art of marketing which in slavery; they were able to use to resist abuse (Stearns, Adas, and Schwartz 56).\n\nStereotypes were also broken in the slavery resistance where women took active roles and full control of their lives to beat the odds like in the narration of Mary Prince who tells her life and portrays herself as an industrious resourceful and productive woman. The children of the slaves were usually sold out into slavery too thereby being broken from family ties and thus leading a slave life. Women would usually induce abortions to prevent their future generations from being subjected to the same life they were leading. Unlike males, women are known to possess the power to withstand intensive mental and physical hardships coupled with their gift to bring new life into the world. Women in slavery often used this power to tolerate their sexually abusive masters who could not resist the obsession on the women (Ferguson 61).\n\nAccording to kind of work performed\n\nMost of the slave women’s work was concentrated in the ‘big house’ of their masters. They were therefore able to manipulate their positions in the house to resist. The most common form was poisoning their masters or family members. Another form was destruction of property or livestock. Stealing was another vital tactic like Clara, a woman who stole bullets from the main house to give to her son who used them to kill the master (Stearns, Adas, and Schwartz 116).\n\nOther forms are burning the best dress of the lady of the house during ironing, adding too much salt in the food and humming to traditional songs as they worked to teach their children of their traditions. Nanny Ashanti Maroon was a free woman who used her position as a priestess in her community to lead a battalion in Jamaica against resistance. She used her magical religious tactics to advice on the most appropriate moment to stage an attack. Individuals who held influential positions in the community also fought from their positions. According to Lauderdale Graham, Caetana and Inacia struggle to change the face of Brazilian slavery by challenging men who were decision makers on slavery matters, Caetana condones the flexible harsh structure developed by the male authority in southern Brazil; she believes that ‘Brazilian slavery’ will never look the same (Shepherd 93).\n\nAccording to geographical location\n\nSlavery in different locations took different shapes from one another. For instance, slavery in the British America differed from that of the Caribbean hence prompting the women to device varying ways of resistance. With the introduction of new plantation farming methods in America, which was backed by high demand of tropical and semitropical crops in demand in Europe, labor specialization became apparent among the Afro Americans as opposed to the slaves in the Caribbean and Brazil who would indulge in any type of labor. This divergence in the source of instruction and the varying geographical location and with the increase in inter-racial mixing led to the slaves’ lives being shaped differently by oppression and resistance. In particular, slaves in North America continued to populate by birth and by mid 18 th century, the ties with African culture had been greatly eroded as compared to Brazil and the Caribbean (Eltis 108).\n\nConclusion\n\nWhile the role of women in the resistance of slavery maybe downplayed and often considered as not active in the abolishment of slave trade, it is evident that women were able to use their distinctive qualities to offer significant resistance that mostly dealt with oppression related to their kind. This is evidenced by the contribution of women like Stephanie Li Camp, Nanny Maroon, narrators such as Mary Prince and numerous stories of Heroic deeds from women in slavery who stayed true to their word and saw the formation of movements that led to abolishment of slavery.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nEltis, David.

      "Leadership and Performance Management Essay\n\nOrganisations are frequently looking for new ways of enhancing performance and profitability. Organisational citizenship behaviour as well as task performance have the potential to achieve these goals and the paper shall look at how the latter can be achieved.\n\nLeadership behaviour shown by supervisors that may enhance subordinates task performance and leadership behaviour that enhances organisational citizenship behaviour\n\nIn order to ensure that task performance is enhanced within an organisation. Leaders need to possess the ability to match employee competence levels alongside the complexity of tasks allocated to them. This can best be achieved through institution of certain structures within the workplace. More often than not, when a supervisor lacks such qualities then employee expectations will be diminished and this may impede their ability to carry out certain tasks.(Xin & Pelled, 2002)\n\nLeaders need to know how to engage in effective conflict management because this affects task performance. Also, they should not in any way cause those conflicts by treating their subordinates in an inferior manner. (Xin &Pelled, 2002).\n\nThey also possess an ability to improve task performance by practicing participative leadership. An analysis of several Fortune five companies indicated that frontline employees as well as managerial employees were substantially motivated to perform their respective tasks. Also, a high interaction with one’s subordinates causes staff members to remain committed to their organisation and hence be more motivated. (Organ, 2000)\n\nTask performance is an essential part of any organisation’s operations; however, companies need to recognise that there are still other aspects of employee performance that are not just defined by organisational tasks. Organisational citizenship behaviour refers to those components of employees’ behaviour that are not acknowledged and recognised by the traditional reward. However, this behaviour has the potential to increase efficiency of the workplace. (Watson & Michaelsen, 2001)\n\nSince organisational citizenship behaviour has two separate dimensions associated with it then it is also essential for leaders to think of separate strategies for enhancing these aspects. The first portion of citizenship behaviour is altruism and the second is compliance. Compliance means those aspects of good citizenry that are done naturally or out of a need to comply with rules. This can be improved by meeting one’s end of the bargain and thus causing employees to have an inherent tendency to comply with expectations. Also, when one creates an organisational culture that supports this compliance, then one’s employees are also likely to follow suit. (Kavanagh, 2001)\n\nThe most important aspect of citizenship behaviour that needs to be encouraged is altruism because this causes them to stick to a certain challenge. There are no other ways of adopting these underlying issues. Here, leaders must be there for their employees in case their staffs encounter problems. They must forge a support system to the concerned party so that individuals may be motivated to want to help others in his line of duty. This can be understood through the social exchange theory.\n\nThe social exchange theory states that employment should be considered as a trade off between reward systems and social or monitory rewards. Adherents to this theory believe that human beings behave in such a manner that reciprocates that they receive from the people around them. There are three groups that are affected by this social exchange theory and they include:\n\n  * Co-workers\n  * Supervisors\n  * The organisation\n\nIn other words, the latter listed aspects are avenues for creating social exchanges. Consequently, the extent to which persons receive a reward is the same way with which they will engage with the concerned party. Alternatively, leaders also need to create an organisational culture that enhances loyalty from the concerned groups. (Decktop, 1999)\n\nTraining programmes that should enhance leadership behaviours that are conducive to organisational citizenship behaviour.\n\nThis leadership training program will teach leaders how to act as examples rather than as supervisors. On top of that, there would also be a need to volunteer for overtime so that their subordinates can learn from the best. (Anderson & Williams, 1991)\n\nThe participating leaders will be taught about empowering their employees in decision making processes. Statistics indicate that those staff members who are involved in decision making tend to feel a sense of obligation. The training process will involve identification of some aspects of the workplace that can be delegated to their staff members. (Organ, 2000)\n\nJob satisfaction is another crucial area of the enterprise that will also have to be improved. In other words, the leaders involved in training need to look for ways in which they can cause their employees to be psyched about their tasks. They also need to be in a situation where they feel that they are valued in that institution. One cannot ignore the issue of organisational commitment. (Erez et al & Lepine, 2002) This is because this will make them more involved in the process. Leaders also need to work on increasing these aspects.\n\nThe evaluation technique of the latter process will entail five major parameters. Managers will analyse the ability of members to help one another, secondly, they will look at the number of times that they engage in overtime work, thirdly, their ability to cope with high stress situations, their ability to suggest some changes in the workplace and their consideration of the effects of their actions. All these aspects will be analysed on a monthly basis and if after one year it has been found that there is no change then the concerned leaders will have to change their approach to everything\n\nTask performance is crucial in bringing out organisational success. However, organisational citizenship behaviour is just as important. Leaders need to realise that it is a two way exchange and that organisational citizenship behaviour as well as task performance can be realised if they meet their end of the bargain. Training therefore needs to deal with aspects that improve these social exchanges such that co-workers and supervisors have a sense of loyalty towards the company that they are working for at any one time.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, S. & Williams, L.

      "The Right to Food: Government Policy Essay\n\nThis paper deals with the report of the Special Rapporteur in detailing the steps taken for the crisis emanating out of the world wide shortages of food. The primary emphasis of the report has been on the right to food for the various countries in the regions of Africa and Asia. The report lays special emphasis on the fact that the primary responsibility in providing food to the populace lies with the respective national governments and hence the governments concerned have to take steps to alleviate the sufferings of the local population.\n\nThe report also points to the fact that “externalities” like territorial obligations and the duties of each country in not exacerbating the situations in other countries needs to be considered. As the report points out, “All countries should therefore ensure that their policies do not contribute to human rights violations in other countries”. Thus, apart from having a duty towards its own citizens, each government has to ensure that it has a special duty towards the other countries in resolving the issue.\n\nThe central argument of the report is that the citizens of these countries have certain rights that include the right to food and cognizance of this right is a fundamental acceptance of human rights by the countries. Thus, the fact that citizens need to have access to sources of food and that adequate stocks made available to the citizens’ forms an obligation of the countries concerned. As the report points out, “The Special Rapporteur believes that States must respect, protect and support the fulfillment of the right to food of people living in other territories, to fully comply with their obligations under the right to food”.\n\nThe report also calls upon governments not only to desist from activities inimical to the neighboring countries but also to act in concert with them in resolving any potential issues that arise from shortages of food and other resources. Since the report has been made by a special representative of the United Nations, there are some specific programs aimed at ending the shortages of food.\n\nIn conclusion, it is apparent that unless coordinated and calibrated efforts are taken to alleviate the shortages of food and other commodities, the world may well be heading towards a food crisis and famine like situations that warrant emergency procedures. Thus, the findings in the report by the need to be deliberated and acted upon with urgency.\n",
      "Different Expressive Means and Stylistic Devices Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nEvery poem contains a lot of information in itself even though the sizes of some poems are very small. Poets use symbols to provide the reader with a wider understanding of the poem in most cases. The small size of poems does not allow the poets to describe all they want in simple words, so they use some language decoration to make their poems sound better. The use of different expressive means and stylistic devices makes the poem sound better, leads the vividness and expression in the poem.\n\nMain body\n\n“Song of Myself” is a poem by Walter Whitman, which seems to be his best work. The author presents the combination of the sermon, biography, and poetic meditation in his “Song of Myself”. The repetitions throughout the whole poem have very important meanings. Repetition, as a technique of argument, substitutes for logical development a growing weight of example, of amplification and exhortation, of inductive repetition rather than deductive thought.\n\nWhitman often uses a stanzaic form in his poems. The first line presents a thought or image and the following lines amplify, explain, or parallel that thought or image. The example may be given the 403-430 lines in his “Song of Myself”.\n\nAlmost at the very beginning, the author uses some different types of repetition: “Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same”.\n\nThe attentive reader will understand the purpose of such repetition: the author wanted to create a sense of the endlessness of the line and the thought. The next line confirms our guesses: Hoping to cease not till death. (Whitman)\n\nThe end of the fifth section of the poem is full of repetitions. The whole stanza starts with the conjunction “and” to show the reader the connection with the previous line, with the previous idea:\n\nAnd that a kelson of the creation is love,\n\nAnd limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,\n\nAnd brown ants in the little wells beneath them, And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein, and poke-weed. (Whitman)\n\nIn this section the repetition of the phrase “I know that…” and the repetition of the structure of the line make the reader believe in the poet’s words without checking them. Such powerful conviction is presented by the repetition. These repetitions give the reader a more detailed understanding of the author’s thoughts. The reader understands how important it is to the poet to make us understand his idea.\n\nThe repetitions have also some structural aim. The whole poem is based on the rhythm which is organized with the help of repetitions. The constant repetition of the same words through the text creates some effect of rhythm. The repeated words are “assume”, “myself”, “perfume”, and the ending “ing” also has the same aim.\n\nI celebrate myself, and sing myself,\n\nAnd what I assume you shall assume,\n\nHouses and rooms are full of perfumes…. the shelves are crowded with perfumes,\n\nI breathe the fragrance myself, (Whitman)\n\nThe given examples are shown to confirm the idea about rhythm creation in the poem.\n\nSo, we may conclude that the repetitions in the poem “Song of Myself” by Walter Whitman pursue several aims. One of them is to create a rhythm in the poem, and the other is to provide a deeper understanding of the poem by the reader.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nWhitman, Walter. “Song of Myself” 2009. Web.\n",
      "Development of Effective States Essay\n\nMarx Weber, a famous German sociologist in his observation of the United States of America, gave a succinct definition of a state as a human community claiming the monopoly of legitimacy in the use of physical force in a given territory. As defined by Fukuyama (2004, p.21), state-building, therefore, entails the processes through which countries undergo, to bring into existence new institutions of their governments, of fortification of the states, if they existed before. Various countries worldwide have made efforts to create states, a trend which has seen some emerge successful, while others were failing in the process. The failure or success in state-building is attributable to various underlying factors within or outside a country, discussed hereafter.\n\nDemocracy stands out as the core pillar in state-building in any given country. The presence of strong democracy in a country brings about an active civil society which is usually strong in all aspects of state-building (Putnam, 1995). For instance, the prevailing state of democracy in the USA accounts for its success in state-building. Democracy is linked directly with strong civil societies, which triggers social modernization, a key ingredient for a successful and effective state-building process. Social modernization accounts for associations both intellectual and moral, which are both contributing factors to state-building, as observed by Tocqueville in his visit to America (Putnam, 1995).\n\nCivil engagements are also directly linked with quality life in a country’s population, enhanced social and industrial performance, resulting in enhanced economic development, which is a compliment to the effective state-building process.\n\nThe capacity of a state to effectively administer and govern its state activities contributes to the success of state-building, as observed by Fukuyama (2004, p.21), as in the case of the American state. Such countries possess the capacity to enact statutes, frame policies, and executing them effectively, hence enhancing transparency and accountability of a government, a key ingredient in the building of an effective state (Fukuyama 2004, p.22).\n\nA failed state is one characterized by conflicts, warring factions, and ineffective governments (Rortberg, 2002, p.85). Various obstacles have been pointed out as the stumbling blocks obscuring various failed states in the processes of building and reclamation of effective states’ status. Issues of poverty, drug trafficking, terrorism, AIDS, and weak, incompetent governments have been at the forefront in undermining the process of building effective states, particularly in developing countries (Fukayama, 2004. p.19).\n\nThe AIDS status in Africa, for instance, has claimed a substantial number of lives while weakening the remaining population. A lot of resources have been channeled to programs associated with the management of the pandemic. Such resources could be used in economic development, which is a key pillar in the process of state-building. This problem is intensified by the lack of governments’ capacity to fully manage the epidemic through their health systems.\n\nDwindling social and civil engagements and frameworks can be a factor behind a failing state. The decline in union membership in America accounts for the slowed state building for decades, particularly between 1975-1985 (Putnam, 1995).\n\nLack of state capacity affects the process of building an effective state in poor states as well as in other supporting states. For instance, the cold war left the Balkan states too weak, as the capacity of their state had considerably weakened. The condition in Somalia, Afghanistan, and other troubled states contributed to the weakening of the state’s capacity, which in turn led to the rise of terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda. The culmination of terrorism practices as exper4ienced in the September 11 attack on America brought in to limelight the challenges posed to well-off states by their weak compatriots.\n\nThe lack of effective governance and modernity by weak states enhances criminal activities and violence, which jeopardizes the progress of state-building globally, as its effects are felt either directly or indirectly by other states globally. The failed state of Zimbabwe in Africa as a result of poor governance is a goods example (Rortberg, 2002, p.87).\n\nMoreover, the war in various regions stands out as a major cause of struggle or failure in state-building among countries. Africa and many other third-world countries cite a good example. War threatens both internal and external security within a region. The absence of security hinders all the economic, social, and political processes in a country, which are the main pillars that hold the process of state-building firmly. War weakens the state’s political consolidation, administrative structures, the execution of economic policies as well as the social connectedness and relationships among people. This is evident in Somalia and the Democratic Republic of Congo in Africa (Herbst, 1990, p. 118 and Rortberg, 2002, p.93).\n\nWar hinders the development of Nationalism in countries. This is the relationship between a nation with its population. When the sense of Nationalism lacks among people, then mistrust between the two erodes, leading to interference in the process of state-building (Herbst, 1990, p. 122 and Rortberg, 2002, p.86). War coupled with poverty, the decline in economic productivity, and shortages of skilled manpower jeopardize the process of state-building in war-torn countries, a situation which is severer in Africa (Herbst, 1990, p. 122). Rortberg (2002, p.85) seconded Herbst in regard to the effect of war and violence in the process of nation-building.\n\nRortberg, 2002, p.94, and Friedman 2005 maintained that it was better to prevent a state from failing than reviving or reclaiming it after the failure. They pointed out that the establishment of a framework to address the issue of security was paramount, the establishment of legitimate judicial systems and restarting of the collapsed social institution especially in war shattered countries such as Afghanistan, as well as overseeing such countries with abundant human resource assistance.\n\nEnhancing democracy to prevail in such states is the beginning of fostering an effective process of building and strengthening weak states. Through democracy, social organizations will be enhanced and strengthened, which in turn will facilitate effective communication, coordination as well as cooperation, which are preconditions for the establishment of a strong state economically, politically, and socially (Putnam, 1995). This will also enhance the prevalence of civil society as well as social engagements.\n\nThe growth of tertiary organizations such as Non-Governmental Organizations should be encouraged as a move to increase social connectedness among people, which is fundamental in state-building.\n\nResponsible leadership and good governance should also be encouraged. External support, economically and financially, should be availed to help in the reconstruction and building of failed states (Rortberg, 2002, p.95-96).\n\nWorks Cited\n\n 1. Rotberg, I.

      "Video Games and Their Benefits for Learning Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Learning in Games\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe paper is claimed to dispute that PC and video games have a great deal to teach how to simplify learning, even in areas outside games. Good PC and video games are compound, exigent, and long; they may take 50 or more hours to be accomplished. If a game cannot be studied properly, then it will not succeed to be sold well, and the corporation that produces it may be subjected to the breakdown. Shortening games down is not a variant, as most enthusiastic gamers do not want short or simple games. Therefore good games have to include good learning standards in the asset of which they get themselves well examined. Game exclusives create on each other’s achievements and, in a kind of Darwinian procedure, good games come to reproduce yet better and better studying standards.\n\nThe claim that video games are suitable for learning does not signify that people should retort to video games for learning in and out of schools. It is also necessary to note that people should use the learning principles grounded into good games in and out of schools even if the games are not used. These learning attitudes can be implemented into lots of various curricula.\n\nLearning in Games\n\nFirst of all, it should be stated, that game design entails modeling human contacts within compound virtual worlds, entailing the learning process as an integral part of these contacts. This is not unlike design examination in edifying psychology where investigators create new forms of contacts linked to learning in classrooms, investigate such contacts to better realize how and why they lead to profound studying, and, then finally broadcast them across a great many classrooms.\n\nIn high-quality open-ended games, games like The Elder Scrolls, Morrowind, Arcanum, Deus Ex 2, Mercenaries, Grand Theft Auto, and many more, gamers also set up their own aims, grounded on their own wishes, approaches, and backdrops. The gamer must then apply these individual aims to the virtual personage and must take into account the affordances in the virtual world (psych out the ruling scheme) so as to get these individual aims realized along with the virtual character’s more clearly “in-game” aims.\n\nSome researchers argue, that the virtual world of games helps people start thinking broader, and feel the life one would never live. It helps to view the world with different eyes.\n\nFor Instance, in The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind, a player may choose to avoid heavy armor and lots of hostility in favor of influential skills, craftiness, and magic, or the player can appoint in lots of face-to-face battles in heavy armor. The player may carry out a linear succession of missions set by the designers or can create his or her own quests. In Grand Theft Auto, the gamer can be evil or not (as the gamer may jump in ambulances and do good actions), can accomplish missions in various arranges, and can play or miss huge pieces of the game, for instance, one is able to trigger gang conflicts or evade them altogether. Even in less open-ended games, gamers set their own principles of finishing, replaying some particular elements of the game so that the hero pulls things off in the brave style the player regards as proper.\n\nAnother example may be regarded in the world of Grand Theft Auto as ways between cover (for instance, corner to corner, house to house), as this organizes them for the exploits they need to take, specifically attacking without being hit. Gamers view the world of Thief in terms of light and dark, enlightenment and shadows, as this helps to get ready for the various actions they are required to take in this world, specifically hiding, shooting, niggling, and in various other methods moving unmentioned to their aim.\n\nAmong some stated researchers outside of Madison, however, Mr. Gee’s notions are taken with cynicism, even contempt. David W. Breneman, the dean of the Curry School of Education at the University of Virginia, praises Mr. Gee for thinking about technology in new methods and regarding what attracts students outside of the classroom. One could regard a case study as a kind of game, he notes. (Gee, 2003).\n\nBut Mr. Breneman, who is not a video-game player, can not take the suggestion that a game like Grand Theft Auto could be an instrument of teaching. “Rough and tumble with these games might instruct in trouble settling, but one does not learn anything about the world,” he notes. Mr. Gee “has doubtless pushed the restrictions to get people talking – one has to be radical to get attention these days.”\n\nIt is obvious to regard how deeply motivating video games are for gamers. Players concentrate closely on gameplay for hours, settling complex troubles and matters all through the way. In an ‘attentional financial system’, where various artifacts and messages, not to talk about school subjects, compete for people’s restricted concentration, video games can attract our deep attention. It is significant that research is ruled to realize the source or sources of this inspiration if it is to offer a statement for learning. (Baron, 2004).\n\nConclusion\n\nVideo games are suitable for learning as, among other grounds, they have the following characteristics:\n\n 1. They can make a personified understanding of a compound system\n 2. They are activity-and-goal-ruled preparations for, and imitations of embodied skills”\n 3. They entail dispensed cleverness via the creation of smart instruments\n 4. They generate possibilities for cross-functional association\n 5. They permit meaning to be located\n 6. They can be open-ended, permitting for aims and projects that set the personal and the communal.\n\nNothing is to note that PC games do these good obsessions all by themselves. It all depends on how they are applied and what types of wider learning schemes (activities and relations) they are made a part of. None of these motives explain why video games are suitable for learning stalks chiefly from a game’s great 3-D graphics or the only fact that it is a game in the general meaning of “game”. The cutting border of games and studying is not in video game technique – although great graphics are magnificent and technical developments are significant. The cutting edge is the understanding of the potential of pastimes for learning by building good games into good learning schemes in and out of classrooms and by creating the good learning standards in good games into studying in and out of school whether or not a PC game is suggested.\n\nReferences\n\nBaron, R.A., Kalsher, L.J.

      "Giving Behavior in Students of Various Fields of Study Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nGiven that nonprofit organizations generally don’t have a lot of time, money, and resources, they are best served by the most efficient fundraising techniques possible. Through efficient fundraising, nonprofits can better survive no matter the economy or other unforeseen circumstances. In order for nonprofits to survive, they need to have diverse funders with the most important source of ongoing support being individual donors. Individual donors are the biggest source of donations nationally (Hatfield, 2008). In 2006, individuals gave 75.6% of charitable donations (Sargeant, Ford, Hudson 2007). Last year, over $300 billion was donated of which individuals again represented roughly 75% (Stone, 2008). Given their importance, it’s crucial to understand donors’ characteristics so charitable organizations can target those most likely to give thereby saving time and money in the process as well.\n\nForty-seven percent of individual donors in 1995 were college graduates (Fulkerson, 1995). Prior research indicates that higher education leads to an increase in charitable giving (Brown, 2001). People who choose to obtain a college degree may be more invested in their communities, to begin with, and learn about the value of charitable organizations in the school. Degrees raise one’s social hierarchy and therefore, people with degrees are more likely to be asked for charitable donations and more expected to donate (Brown, 2001). Among higher education, my hypothesis is that those who are in certain fields of study/work are more likely to give to charitable organizations. This research will offer insight into giving behaviors of the most likely future source of ongoing income for nonprofit groups.\n\nStatement of the problem\n\nIn America statistics have shown that in every five aged elderly, one is a destitute who has no home on a family to support and spends his or her nights out in the streets and survival for the basic needs is achieved through begging. An elderly dressed in lags spreading his on her hand to beg for money does not paint a good picture and the situation is wanting. The government has done its part by establishing homes for the elderly but the demand is too high. Also the funds that are set aside to cater for this problem are not enough because of the numerous needs that come with catering for the elderly.\n\nThe already established homes for elderly are overcrowded and lack enough funds which has seen this homes because run down fund are needed to build shelters which means modern buildings with all the necessities where this elderly people can live and cell a home instead of wandering in the streets and stepping in the cold and dusty open corridors in the towns.\n\nCharity organizations have come up to assist such unfortunate groups. The community support these charities are not enough. There is need to study and understand what students can do to assist them if they want to get rid of those destitute people who are always begging. Time and money should be provided in ample.\n\nThe destitute people cannot do some services therefore people are needed to contribute. The community should know that even after donating there is a need for. It is also up to the organization to provide a social link between the destitute and the outer world. This can be done through the time and money contribution as well as interact with the destitute people.\n\nAims of study\n\nThe aim of study is to investigate and understand students donating behavior in relation to their field of study. It will also assist students in various categories embrace the idea of time donating to charity organizations. The research is also aimed at equipping students particularly those related to social and health to look critically on the best ways of donating their time and money.\n\nObjectives of the study\n\nThe overall objective of this research work is to find out donating behavior of students of various fields of study. Other objectives will include;\n\n 1. To find out which field of study students are likely to donate their time and money to charity organization.\n 2. To asses the impact of donating time and money by students to charity organization.\n 3. To come up with recommendations on what can be done to encourage students to donate their time to charity.\n 4. To assess the donating behavior by students.\n 5. To analyze and critically evaluate the extent to which students donations impacts on the image of the university.\n\nHypothesis\n\nStudents in the nursing, MPA, social work and psychology programs are more likely to donate time and/or money to charitable organizations.\n\nResearch questions\n\n 1. Are people in certain fields of study more likely to donate time and/or money to charitable organizations?\n 2. What is American population donation behavior?\n 3. What do students donate more to charity organization?\n\nBenefits of conducting the research\n\nThis research will be applicable to all those students who wish to donate their time and money to charity organizations. It will provide focus and insight to them as well as portraying to the college the importance of students donating resources.\n\nLimitations of the study\n\nBecause this is an exploratory study it will mean that more time will be required to carry out the research in order to find the relevant information that will reflect the issue of resource donation among students of various fields of study. Also, another limitation is that of availability of funds because the study will require the researcher to reach a wider population through interviewing many respondents.\n\nLiterature review\n\nGeneral Giving Behavior in US\n\nIn America today culture is one of the most fundamental determinants deciding for donations of time and money. Most of the people due to their cultural influence have started donating their time and money naturally to charities. Children growing up in such a culture will follow suit. These values common in children remain in them even if they grow up.\n\nFrom the American culture donating is not something strange. It is believed that for you to live comfortably and successively one must be ready to donate her time and money to the needy. Cultural factors influence a person’s behavior. American people believe in values like efficiency, practicality, justice, equality, and many social issues.\n\nIn America, each culture consists of smaller subcultures that provide more specific identifications. To some people in America racial groups such as the black Americans have good distinct cultural styles. They are known to join in charity or social movements that require donations.\n\nAnother factor that affects donations is one’s personal characteristics like his age and life-cycle stage, lifestyle, occupation, economic circumstances and personality. A child growing up in America is exposed to some characteristics like material comfort, external comfort and achievement and success that influences how one spends his time.\n\nDonation behavior is greatly influenced by social factors like status, family and peer groups. When one wants to donate to charity he will take consideration to his peer groups. These are groups having direct influence on one donating decisions. These are the groups one associate with most of his time. Some people fall into economic groups like the upper class prefer donating extra disposable. The influence of a family is also of great value to contribution behavior. These families have some charities associated with them and they greatly encourage their family members to contribute. A co-worker also influences one’s donation decision to a specific charity.\n\nPeople are influenced by peer groups in three ways. Peer groups usually expose a person to new behavior and lifestyle. One can belong to a group whose lifestyle believes in. Peer groups also influence one’s attitudes because their desires fit in these groups. Also peer groups influence similarity and conformity that may make a person to alive at a specific decision. So doing one will eventually donate to similar amount charities to that of his friend. People who are in the same social class share similar values, interests, and behavior. In America we have upper class people who are social elite with a good family background. This is one group in America that is in a position of affording to donate.\n\nSeptember 11 th 2001 and giving behavior\n\nMost Americans were donating little to charities before the September 11 th . However after the event of that day majority of Americans changed their donating behavior. This made Americans understand the need for donations. This episode acted as a catalyst or a publicity event for charity organizations. It is said that most people in America do not donate or contribute to charity due to a number of factors such as the inability to get an accountable record for the charity.\n\nThe September 11 th increased donations made to a greater level. It acted as a new wave that lured people to contribute resources to charities. Research carried out indicated that the September 11 th event influenced people’s donation behavior. In contributions to charities, there must be a motivating factor to the citizens to be able to give up consumption or future consumption to donate to charities. This motivating factor must show the contributor that there is something he is to gain from his contribution. The realization by the Americans after the 11 th September 2001 was that each person may need a donation at one point in life. Donations in terms of time and money are gaining momentum in the market.\n\nDemographics\n\nIn contributing to charities the population plays an important role in helping managers of charity organizations to understand the likelihood of receiving funds. The population of the area in terms of density, mobility tread, age distribution, marriage, birth, death rates, race, ethnicity, and religious structure will determine the contribution trends. Religious people like donating to charity organizations while the level of education will also be a determining factor in the population whether they will be contributing. Unmarried individuals without responsibilities will find it difficult to contribute as compared to aged and married people. It means that better educated with a white-collar job who have extra disposable income will release some funds to charities as contributions as compared to uneducated people with no income. Race is another factor that determines the contribution of individuals to charities. In an area where there are people with ages of sixty and above will contribute to charities because they will find it easier since they don’t have extra responsibilities as young family people. However young family people who have invested heavily will also contribute to charities in large amounts.\n\nOld age Charity Homes\n\nThe old people cannot do the cooking those selves and some services people are needed, to prepare the meals as well as do the required washing in the home so as to maintain good hygienic standards. These aged people need proper beddings and clothes. They cannot use sleeping bags and most of them wear tattles for clothing. These charities’ missions should take up the responsibility of ensuring that these elders steep comfortably and their cleanliness is observed.\n\nMost of the old people do suffer from poor health and take medication almost throughout their old age. They should provide such medicines to them and also avail professional medics so that they can be able to do regular check-ups and offer advice to these people. Also due to their advanced ages, some of them are unable to attend to themselves and that calls for professional assistance like nursing. The home should hire nurses who can be able to attend to these people as required.\n\nA clinic within the proximity of the home can avail medical services as well as the community. The enterprising wing of the clinic can always restock the required medical needs and bring the medical services closer to the elderly people. He can slash off the expenses of having to pay the service workers like the nurses and doctors and ensure a stable medical facility to the institution.\n\nVolunteers who want to help with their daily needs like cooking and clearing in should be welcomed. The laundry room can also be commercialized if the space is enough to do so. Some of the aged people do feel strong enough to carry their hobbies which still interest and this can include gardening, backing as well as tailoring; the home should let them do it. It would be a good way of increasing their resources by reducing expenses and also a healthy way to regulate the old people’s passion for their hobbies which has a healthy element in it.\n\nThe communities’ social attachment to the home is a resource on its own; the society can either make or black the home. Their contribution to the home is both emotional as well as physical. The community is the one that understands the need for these homes and thus they are the people who can be counted on to offer steady support to this home.\n\nThe aged people at times suffer from a denial or undergo a crisis of fearing to die or even more feel useless at this age and neglected by society. To give them a positive attitude towards themselves and a better perception about life at this age the mission will enhance services like religion and counseling programs.\n\nThe aged people at times suffer from a denial or undergo a crisis of fearing to die or even more feel useless at this age and neglected by society. To give them a positive attitude towards themselves and a better perception about life at this age the mission will enhance services like religion and counseling programs.\n\nUplifting the spirit of these aged people is important so as to promote good health in them, an emotionally sick person cannot have an upright physical well-being. The life out in the cold streets can change the old people to a people with inhuman attitudes towards life due to the harsh and unbecoming environment of the street life. Such elderly help reshape their spiritual state.\n\nThe transformation is gradual and involves a lot of patience. The church can be a good source of the spiritual fulfillment as well as counseling session. In severe case where the person has a disoriented mind the services of a psychologist can be entranced. All these will play a major role in restoring the aged people’s attitude towards life. The transition period is usually difficult and the community can help either indirectly or directly by accepting and acknowledging the presence of this aged people in the society. Assisting the old has always been there for ages, although earlier on the case for aged was mostly done in the homes, today’s society has altered that because of the busy and involving life styles.\n\nResearch Methodology\n\nResearch Design\n\nThis study necessitated the researcher to identify the donation behavior of students in various fields of study. The researcher mainly concentrated on the issue concerning the money and time donation and how students do it. Given that the study is an exploratory research it is based on; desired activities and time-based plans, research questions, selection of sources and types of information required, outline of procedures for every research activity to be carried out and also it is based on the framework that specified the relationships among the samples identified for this research purpose.\n\nSampling Procedure\n\nBefore adopting the suitable sampling technique several factors for example; cost of conducting the research, time constraint, accuracy of sources to be utilized, availability of population respondents, physical impossibilities of acquiring all the necessary items in the target population and the destructive nature of certain tests are considered in detail in order to avoid minor mistakes in the course of conducting the research.\n\nProbabilistic type of sampling technique has been chosen since the sample identified gives each and every respondent a known likelihood of being included in the sample selected. For that reason, the research will be conducted using simple random method of collecting data because it is difficult to reach all the participants in the population. Under this technique, the selected sample gives the person identified the opportunity to have an equal chance of being incorporated in the research work.\n\nTarget population\n\nThe target population for this study will be fifty (50) students from various field of study. This target population could be easy to get through the UNCW where their records can be traced as well interview them. However not all will be willing to give the much needed information. May be approximately forty will be willing to participate in this study.\n\nThe recruitment strategy\n\nTo be able to get the required number for the study, the researcher must have with him / her introductory letter from the institution where he / she is a student. The letter elaborates more on the contents of the study. The researcher will then visit the departments in charge of fields of study with the introductory letter, explain to the officials of that department of his / her mission so that she can be granted permission to obtain for records of the students. These records contain vital information including as to where they have visited as students. The researcher will then visit the lecture halls and hostels of the respondents, explain his / her mission and then ask for permission from the potential respondents as to whether he can be interviewed or not. This method will ensure confidentiality because the researcher will have obtained all the permission required and the respondent will have accepted to be interviewed after having been assured that all that will be discussed will be confidential as the interview will be done in an atmosphere chosen by the respondent.\n\nStrengths\n\n  * Having obtained all the permission to get access to the potential respondents, it gives the researcher easy time to conduct the study. The letters of permission give the researcher much hope that the study will be successful and will be able to obtain that entire he/ she requires within a specific time.\n  * Through this strategy, the researcher is assured of getting the required number of potential respondents. It will be very difficult visiting hostels and lecture halls trying to find out whether there are students without records of their details.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n  * The strategy raises a lot of suspicion even among the departmental heads and the potential respondents. They may be suspicious on why they could be interviewed and some will ask for payment after the interview.\n  * The process of obtaining permission is too long. At times getting access to the management of the college may not be easy. They will not be willing to meet the researcher if they do not fully understand their mission.\n  * The researcher may at times not be able to get the required number of respondents in that he/ she will not automatically get the potential respondent at the locations as some will have moved / shifted to some other places.\n\nData collection method\n\nSince a sample of the population has identified the researcher will utilize both open and closed questionnaires to collect the required information from the respondents that are selected from the sample identified. This method is considered and found to be effective and efficient to the researcher since he only drops the questionnaires to the respondents and collected them at a later date. The reason for choosing both open and closed questionnaires to be administered is that it gives the respondents an opportunity to answer freely to set of questionnaires that is administered to them during the study. The other methods data collection will be personal interviews. These methods are elaborated as follows;\n\nPersonal interviews\n\nIn this method, the investigator follows a procedure and seeks answers to a set of pre-conceived questions through personal interviews. Personal interviews usually depend on capability of the interview since it uses structured questions. If the interviewer is not well prepared then the research outcome may be poor. This can apply to those will not be able to use the questionnaire / or cannot be able to read or write.\n\nStrengths\n\n  * The researcher is able to read the respondents mind as they are discussing. There is that atmosphere of free expression between the interviewer and the interviewee.\n  * Confidence is built between the researcher and the respondent as there is a provision for confidentiality.\n  * As the discussion takes place, new information comes into the fold, some which may be beneficial to the researcher.\n  * Information gathered is reliable. The information that is collected through this method deals with the feelings, emotions, sentiments etc. Only the person who is affected can give description of their depth.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n  * The method is time consuming, at times the respondents can talk for too long at the expense of the researcher. Sometimes it becomes very difficult to control them and so persevere till the exercise is over.\n  * Some clients may not be willing to give out some confidential information to the researcher for fear that they may tell the same to other people. They could rather prefer write it on paper but not including their names.\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nThis is the method most commonly used when respondents can be reached and are willing to cooperate. This method can reach a large number of subjects, who are able to read and write. If need be it can be translated into the language which the respondent will be able understand or the researcher can translate it for the respondent to understand.\n\nStrengths\n\n  * The method saves time. The respondent is able to answer the questions on the questionnaire within a very short time without asking any other additional questions.\n  * The researcher is able to get many respondents. The questions in the questionnaire are easy to understand and so respondents answers quickly and return to them to the researcher who then moves to the next respondent.\n  * Free from external influence. The respondent is able to all the questions without being influenced by anybody, hence provide information according to their knowledge, views and attitudes.\n\nWeaknesses\n\n  * It is expensive to many copies of the questionnaires. The researcher may not be able to have enough resources for making the copies for the target number of respondents.\n  * Sometimes, if questionnaires are left with the respondents, there is a possibility that they may not be sent back to the interviewer. This can seriously affect the end result of the study.\n  * Respondents may answer some questions irrelevantly. This will force the researcher to make a follow up on the respondent so that he can answer the question well.\n  * This method applies best to those respondents who are able to read and write.\n  * Incomplete entries and bad handwriting. Respondents are sometimes not responsive and aware of the importance of the study and so they will leave out many questions unanswered, and some have very poor handwriting which cannot be clearly visible to the researcher.\n\nData analysis\n\nThe analysis of data requires a number of closely related operations such the establishments of categories to raw data through coding, tabulation and then drawing statistical inference. It should be anticipated that that the large amounts of field data should eventually be condensed into few manageable groups and tables for further analysis.\n\nIn SPSS, I will arrive at a sample by randomly selecting 2% of courses taught at UNCW at the time of the research excluding courses in the nursing, MPA, social work and psychology programs. I will also take a random sample from the combination of nursing, MPA, social work and psychology courses to ensure a good sample. This will allow for around 1,000 students by my estimation. Through the use of this random cluster sampling, I will deliver the survey to each of the students in these classes.\n\nFirst I will classify the participants into different majors. Then I will determine a low, medium and high range based on the information found in the survey. I will classify my participants’ average volunteer time and monetary donations separately and combined. Based on these averages, I will classify the participants in a low, medium and high range of giving behavior.\n\nI will perform a cross tab correlation with majors to see which major would be most likely to give time through volunteering. Then I will repeat this procedure with the dependent variable monetary donations and again with the combined giving behavior. I will use the composite score of both volunteer time in hours and money donated in dollars. I will classify low, medium and high range of giving all together and then do another cross tabulation on the composite score and majors. I will repeat for the second most likely and so on.\n\nReflection essay\n\nCommunity service, for some people, denotes the killing of their precious time or money which they had reserved to treat themselves after school, work, or the like. To some, the words community service rhyme with the words chore, work, and go with reluctance. Others perceive community service as a bit like philanthropy.\n\nThe work I immersed myself and that changed my life was my being summer camp junior counselor for the causes of Rylee’s Hope. It was my take at community service and I have got to admit that it was full blast right away, in the sense that a big responsibility was heaped upon my shoulder. My job was to organize sponsors to financially endow our organization. Rylee’s Hope is a non-profit organization which aids the families of premature children all over the country. It seeks to raise funds to usher in further awareness concerning pregnancy and neonatal care and how to curb the frequency of babies being born prematurely. From the very beginning, my heart was pinched because the organization that I thought would only impose additional duties on me would instead be the changer of how I view life. Children personify innocence, purity and hope, and how much more is the case with premature babies? I asked myself. Premature babies not only need financial help, I thought to myself, they need to be sure that they would have a new lease on life. After realizing the vision and mission of Rylee’s Hope, I fully committed myself to the task without qualms, without any questions. Under the guidance of my Miss Lewis, I helped set up everyday fun activities which include basketball, football, and aside from that, I also organize and maintain the order among kids on our trips and teach them the importance of teamwork, respect, and camaraderie. The irrefutable joy in the children’s eyes still mesmerizes me now, a couple months after. The children thanking me and expressing their gratitude for my efforts to make them truly happy by way of playing was indeed one of a kind. The looks on their faces telling me that I had helped them in a very big way was almost unfathomable. From my perspective, it is to them I owe a lot and I should be the one to thank them that very moment. Why? Those children personified unadulterated happiness, contentment, and love. As blatantly superficial as this might seem, if only people would learn the ways of children and feel their hearts for a day, it is easy to say that the world would be a much better and safer place to live in.\n\nAlthough it sounds overly vibrant, I can blatantly say that the experience was the best I ever had in a long time and the feeling was utterly incomparable and absolutely incomparable. I am very sure that people who find fulfillment in helping other people can relate to the sentiments I am conveying here. All charity deeds are equal in goodness, but as I have aforementioned, charity for the betterment of children is what I deem as most endearing to me. But if I were to do community service again but this time for the benefit of other disadvantaged, I would not even think twice for it was charity which made me see the world from a whole new point of view. In fact, I plan to help out at the police department next summer. For me, peacekeeping and helping the police is a very noble task. They are the men who keep our streets and homes safe and make us feel secure. But then again, I will only “cross the bridge when I get there,” meaning I will only decide when summer is only a matter of days away. After all, all forms of charity and community service are equal in nobility.\n\nAssessing my performance as junior counselor, I can say that I did a marvelous job, bragging aside. Why did I say so? Because when I came to the realization of what my being junior counselor meant, I right away perceived it as a privilege and not as a responsibility. A privilege to give back to the less fortunate a share of the blessings I possess. The mere fact that I am physically and mentally fit has taken on a new meaning to me and the meanings of the word “blessing” have multiplied. What I thought was a simple task to be accomplished over one short summer has become my life’s turning point.\n\nWhen a person realizes that there is so much more to life than just living for the sake of him and that he has so much more to give, the supreme beauty of life is beheld and the essence of it felt in the most glorious manner.\n\nReferences\n\nCharles, K.

      "Presidential Election in USA: Barack Obama Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main Text\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nFor many people, the choice of who to support for leadership in positions as important as the Presidency of the United States of America falls to one issue. While issues may vary from one individual to another or one group to another, one of the largest issues currently confronting the country is the issue of energy. The United States is currently embroiled in a war that centers around oil supplies while other countries in the world, such as Russia, are beginning to become more aggressive regarding oil supplies. How the next president addresses questions regarding oil and energy production will have a tremendous impact on the future of this country. In much of the previous century, oil was largely viewed worldwide as an economic asset and ever-expanding tool for increasing mobility needs. The dependence on oil now threatens many national economies, their security and the environment as well. Not only can the world not endure fossil fuels being pumped into the atmosphere at the current rate for the next 30 years, most experts agree that by then, the world’s supply of oil will be largely depleted. Understanding the two candidates’ approach to this issue reveals a fundamental difference in their understanding of where the nation stands today and suggests there is only one candidate who has a feasible plan for the future growth of the United States.\n\nMain Text\n\nEnergy analysts worldwide cannot agree on the date that the production of oil will reach its peak. Some argue that the world is already at its peak production, others postulate this date to be no later than 10 years from now. The most optimistic of predictions give 2035 as the height of production followed by a steady decline from that point onward. To the ardently optimistic who believe that a problem that won’t occur for 20 years does not need to be addressed yet, industrialised countries are now using more oil per year than can be supplied and is somewhat unnoticeably operating by utilizing a small percentage of its reserves. If the supply has peaked and is on a steadily decline, as some evidence suggests, most all of the world’s economies will be depressed (Drum, 2005). In this event, countries such as Brazil and China will not be affected to the same extent and will likely prosper as these societies have made great strides in converting to alternative energy. Brazil began its conversion to bio-fuels 30 years ago and today imports no foreign oil. In other countries, the U.S. for example, “petroleum supplies more than 95 percent of the energy used in transportation and has done so for the past 40 years. Transportation has remained nearly totally dependent on petroleum, despite significant efforts to promote alternative fuels” (Bureau of Transportation Statistics, 2000).\n\nThere are numerous technologies now being developed in other countries that may help cut America’s dependence on oil, but only if the nation invests in development of them. Energy from hydrogen, an environmentally friendly gas is a much discussed energy source. Iceland is already well on its way to becoming the first nation to generate its power needs by means of hydrogen fuel-cells. Though hydrogen powered means of transport are not accessible to the public as yet, they are past the initial research and development phase and are presently being demonstrated for both heavy and light-duty load applications. Bio-fuels are derived from an easily replenished source and emit no pollutants into the air. The most common type, Ethanol, has the ability to be mixed with petrol and bio-diesel, a vegetable oil, can be burned in diesel engines without engine modification. This type of ‘green’ fuel can at least be a bridge to the future of energy production and consumption as it can, unlike hydrogen, be used in existing engines. Unfortunately, it takes considerably more energy (from high-grade petrol) to create ethanol than it produces. It takes about 70 percent more energy to make a liter of ethanol than is contained in a liter of ethanol. In addition, fossil fuel is used in the production of corn or any crop used for ethanol and by “increasing ethanol production will increase degradation of vital agricultural and water resources and will seriously contribute to the pollution of the environment. In U.S. corn production, soil erodes some 20-times faster than soil is formed” (Pimentel, 1998: 5).\n\nUnderstanding that alternative means of energy are not yet available and that numerous problems continue to exist even in those technologies that are currently under development, it will be our next president who will decide which direction our future energy policies will take – one focused on sustainability and global welfare or one focused on independent wealth building and shortest means without regard for global health. Looking at the two candidates’ records, it can be seen that Barak Obama generally supports the former while John McCain generally supports the latter. Obama supports legislation geared toward reducing carbon emissions by 80 percent by the year 2050 and supports investment in electric batteries and other new technology geared toward sustainability. While he indicates he is willing to consider nuclear power as a part of that package, he emphasizes the necessity to provide protections against waste and terrorism (Barak Obama, 2008). John McCain, on the other hand, is fully in support of building nuclear power plants as the primary means of breaking America’s dependence on oil while also being in favor of big oil company’s plans to open up offshore drilling. He suggests that he is in support of other alternative forms of energy, such as wind and solar energy, but his voting record demonstrates much greater support for nuclear energy (John McCain, 2008).\n\nConclusion\n\nBy comparing Obama and McCain’s approaches to energy into the future, it can be seen that both candidates recognize the dangers of global warming as well as the quickly depleting supplies of oil. However, their records indicate that while McCain supports immediate, quick-fix solutions regardless of the future environmental costs, Obama supports more sustainable methods of energy production. Although there are a number of problems associated with the forms of energy Obama supports, there are many more lethal ramifications to McCain’s plan and little opportunity for the development of less dangerous possibilities. While Obama is willing to consider the possibility of nuclear power, with full recognition and emphasis given to the tremendous dangers such a path introduces, McCain seems careless of these possibilities. From this comparison, it seems clear Obama is the more practical candidate for a country that wishes to continue growing.\n\nReferences\n\n“Barak Obama.” (2008). On The Issues. 2008.

      "Airbus and Boeing: The Airline Industry Analysis Essay\n\nAbstract\n\nThe airline industry is one of the most important sectors of every major economy especially for the advancement of global commerce. Surprisingly the industry is dominated by two manufacturing industries, especially in the commercial plane production sector. The two companies’ Airbus and Boeing have been on each other’s toes for a long time now in trying to curve a niche in the market.\n\nThis paper seeks to examine some of the ways that the two manufacturers could come up with a pricing strategy that would not only be beneficial to their customers but that will also advance their own interests. In the analysis I will look at the market as an oligopolistic market, in addition, I will look at how the industry or the two companies can adopt game theory to advance their pricing strategies.\n\nOligopolies\n\nAn oligopolistic market is a market that is characterized by a few numbers of sellers of goods or services. In their actions, the oligopolies are always aware of the actions of other oligopolies. In this case, the decisions of a single firm or organization always affect the decision of other firms in the industry. I the same way the firm’s decisions are influenced or affected by the decisions of other firms in the industry.\n\nGame Theory\n\nGame theory is inherently a branch of applied mathematics. However, it is mostly used in the context of economic analysis. The game theory concerns itself with strategic interactions between various agents within a certain sector or industry. In this perspective, various agents choose strategies that will ultimately lead to the maximization of their returns given the strategies or decisions of others. It is better analyzed using the prisoner’s dilemma. It continues to play an important role in economics, cybernetics, and artificial intelligence.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe aviation industry or air transport is one of the most sensitive industries today especially after the September 11 terrorist attacks. Almost all countries have tightened security within their airports through their local civil aviation authorities. Over the years, the industry has seen tremendous growth through good regulations, systemic facilitation guided by the use of ultra-modern information communication technologies, high safety standards as well as gigantic investments in the current trends of automation.\n\nThis facilitation is also compounded by good relations or well-structured consultative mechanisms with government agencies like the customs union employees who are situated in regional, local and international airports.\n\nOn the other side of the story, the provision of airport, aircraft, passenger, and cargo security has increasingly led to delays, passenger discomforts, intermittent earnings in the aviation industry, collapse of local tourism in many countries, as well as the loss of customer confidence in the services provided as well as goodwill.\n\nAnalysis\n\nBoth airbus and Boeing could use game theory to come up with pricing strategies. Either, unfortunately, the pricing strategies they take could be beneficial or not depending on the type of game, they play. This is because game theory studies the choices of optimal behaviors depending on the choices of other agent’s decisions to evaluate costs and benefits.\n\nThe two firms could either exercise any of the following game types.\n\nCooperative or Non-Cooperative\n\nA cooperative game is one in which the two form binding commitments. For example, the legal system may require them to observe their promises. If the two firms can keep their promises then they are likely to reap more from the industry. In this kind of game communication on pricing strategies is of paramount importance to guarantee success.\n\nUnfortunately, uncooperative games are better for the wider public since they allow for timely delivery as well as low costs.\n\nSymmetric and Asymmetric\n\nSymmetric and asymmetric games are usually played especially when the payoffs for the different players can be varied. In an economic or business sense, this is usually determined by whether the players have different market powers. In case we have a market leader and a market follower then the payoffs for the games they involve themselves in will be skewed. In this case, the market leader will almost usually be the winner in the give-take situation.\n\nZero Sums and Non-Zero Sum\n\nIn zero-sum games, the payoffs for any collaboration will always result in a fixed figure. This means that the best way forward is for all the agents not to play so that the status quo remains. If this is not done so then the benefit to one player will lead to an equivalent cost or loss to another player.\n\nSimultaneous and Sequential\n\nIn the case of airbus and Boeing, this is the best game to play. This is because for this type of game s perfect information is not required. By using this strategy of game theory, the firms will always be competitive since each firm will be trying to be ahead of its competitor. Once this is initiated, the little information that one company acquires concerning the other will be used to effectively introduce a better marketing and pricing strategy.\n\nConclusion\n\nGame theory has been effectively used since the 1940s to date. The theory has been used to analyze a wide range of economic data. This analysis has not been limited to the field of oligopolies but also, duopolies, auctions, voting patterns, bargaining among others.\n\nReferences\n\nCathleen A. Berrick & David A. Powner. 2005.

      "“The Stronger” in the August Strindberg’s Play Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The brief elements of the play\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\n“The Stronger” by play writer August Strindberg is an ironic work. It is one of the most famous of Strindberg’s one-act plays. He wrote it in 1889 for the Experiment Theater in Copenhagen. We need to mention some facts from his life that influenced his play “The Stronger”. While composing the work, August Strindberg had a love affair with Martha Hansen who was seventeen-year-old. Also, he had other relationships, as he always did, with at least two theatre actresses. His wife Siri always stayed with him as he returned to her after each love affair with other women. It is significant that he offered her the role of Madam X. She turned down this proposition at first but afterward accepted. Obviously, he considered his wife Siri the “stronger” in the real world and in real life.\n\nThe brief elements of the play\n\nIt may seem that there is nothing special about this play, that it is simple and commonplace. The two characters of the play are two women simply called Mrs. X and Miss Y. It is the turn of the 20th century, and here we can see the role and position of women in society. It is not important for them to have names; we know only a few facts about them (like they are some “objects”, not personalities). They are two actresses and they meet in a restaurant on Christmas Eve, one of them Miss Y, doesn’t even speak in the whole performance.\n\nThe play “The Stronger” is rich in irony and allegory. Although the play is very short, one can actually spend hours thinking about it and trying to understand its deep meaning. As the play progresses, we can see that Miss Y and Mrs. X are actually rivals – Miss Y is having a love affair with Mrs. X’s husband.\n\nThere are two different readings in the play. In the first, Mrs. X is an astute wife. The truth about Miss Y and her husband reveals to her. In the second reading, we can see Mrs. X as an apathetic and paranoid woman. The insecurity about her marriage has actually brought her to real slander. And here rises the question of who is “the stronger”. We have two variants: Miss Y, who maintains silence against Mrs. X’s dirty accusations (whether false or true). Mrs. X screams at her: “I hate you, hate you, hate you! But you – you just sit there, silent, calm, not caring—not caring whether it’s night or day, summer or winter, whether other people are happy or miserable—unable to hate and unable to love—motionless like a stork over a rat-hole” (Strindberg,1979). So, we have a question, if Miss Y is stronger in her independence. On the other hand, Mrs. X may be the stronger one, because she is courageous enough to accept the truth about her husband and she is able to go on. She says: “Thank you, Miss Y, for all the good lessons you’ve taught me. Thank you for teaching my husband to love! Now I am going home, to love him” (Strindberg,1979).\n\nThis shows us the first of the allegories from the play. This is the debate about gender roles in society of that time. Strindberg shows the fundamental duality of women’s role in society. Mrs. X is a devoted mother and wife, a woman who has lost all individuality because she has been entirely changed by the demands and caprices of her husband. She is a woman that enjoys the stability of family life. On the contrary side, we have Miss Y. She is an independent woman, who lives her own life in her own manner. That’s why she is able to make others fit her personality. But here is a paradox. Although she has such abilities and opportunities, in the end, she stays alone in a restaurant on Christmas Eve. I think that by such a stereotypical description Strindberg’s sets them off against each other. That is how through a quarrel between two of these women, Strindberg brings up the debate about the role of that time women in society.\n\nBut I think there is actually a deeper allegory in this play. Miss Y is a silent character. Mrs. X is able to carry on a conversation, make accusations, and draw inferences with Miss Y who does not speak to her at all. This image is similar to man’s interaction with God. In this play, Miss Y is not actually an individual. She is represented more like a human mirror, which Mrs. X uses in order to understand and, maybe, to interpret her own life. Here Mrs. X surfaces her discontent and insecurity; she is actually reconciling herself to them (as she thinks) by means of a dialogue. But this dialogue is totally one-sided. It is not necessary for Miss Y to say something. Her thoughts and feelings are not a part of the development of this story. By the end of this play, we do not actually know what has happened. But we know that Mrs. X believes that “the stronger” is a portrait of a human that can think through some contradictions in his or her own life, using another person (or the idea of another person) as a sort of a special sounding board for his or her own thought and analysis processes, and of the real fundamentally conditional and resolute nature of truth.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe ideas and thoughts of Strindberg, his experience, were revealed to us through his characters. It is impossible to make a statement of who is “the stronger”. As he said: “My souls (characters) are conglomerations of past and present stages of civilization, bits from books and newspapers, scraps of humanity, rags and tatters of fine clothing, patched together as is the human soul. And I have added a little evolutionary history by making the weaker steal and repeat the words of the stronger, and by making the characters borrow ideas or “suggestions” from one another” (Strindberg, 1955).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nStrindberg, August.

      "City of Rome: Budget and Revenue Analysis Essay\n\nThe review of the City of Rome, GA budget indicates that its total revenue in 2019 was $50.275 million (County Manager, 2019) and its total spending was $50.011 million (County Manager, 2019), which implies that it has a budget surplus at the state level. The net change in fund balance was $263,497 in 2018. There are proposed cuts announced by the Georgia State in its upcoming budgets until 2021 (Walker, 2019). However, there are both internal and external pressures on budget preparation and allocation of funds to different sectors of the City of Rome’s economy. The internal pressures, such as crime and the quality of education and healthcare.\n\nThe external constraints due to the adoption of the national policy, such as energy and environment regulations also influence the budgetary process and decisions. The budget is based on the anticipation of revenues and expenditures that the City of Rome’s government will incur in the next period.\n\nThe analysis of the City of Rome, GA budget showed that the policymakers highlighted the importance of the state budget for public safety and general government. The analysis of 2019 revised budget shows that Floyd County increased its expenditure forecast, and it is expected to have an adverse impact on its fund balance. Moreover, the local government officials have raised concerned about the budget cuts proposed by the policymakers as they feel that it will have a trickledown effect on the local government. Specifically, this will have a negative effect on the health and crime management sectors.\n\nBoth sectors were significantly affected after 2008 as the economy slowed down. There is increasing pressure from the public and lawmakers to allocate more funds to health and public safety accounts. The state has always prioritized education and providing a safe environment to students (Governments of Floyd County and City of Rome, GA, 2019). The government announced $69.4 million for the safety of school students (Walker, 2019). In the last few years, the state also facilitated businesses by giving them tax incentives supported by the Federal tax cut, which boosted economic growth in the period of recovery. The policymakers have decided to keep the tax rate low as major corporations have overpaid their taxes in previous years (Walker, 2019).\n\nAll states must maintain budget stabilization funds, which is also referred to as rainy funds, to ensure that they have sufficient funds to spend when there is an emergency or a budget deficit. City of Rome, GA government, has authorized a stabilization fund referred to as Neighborhood Stabilization Program which is operating to ensure that neighborhood safety is assured during difficult times. The stabilization program is managed through a collaborative partnership between three stakeholders, including the City of Rome, Floyd County, and neighborhood communities (Floyd County – Finance Department, 2016).\n\nThe focus of the stabilization program is to keep neighborhoods clean, which implies that the government of the City of Rome aims to provide its citizens with a clean environment. It is recommended that the City of Rome should increase its spending on education and health care. Moreover, the local government officials criticized the policymakers of the Georgia State for not taxing the tobacco industry in line with other US states. Therefore, the City of Rome should levy more taxes on this industry to increase its revenue and reduce the negative net balance.\n\nReferences\n\nCounty Manager. (2019).

      "International Construction: British Managers in Poland Report\n\nThe modern business world is characterized by a high degree of cross-cultural communication and collaboration. Multinationals operate in different countries, which is often associated with various challenges related to the economic, political, social, and cultural peculiarities of the host countries. The cultural aspect of doing business is often underestimated, which leads to negative outcomes such as financial and reputational losses (Garavan et al. 2017). The construction industry may be specifically vulnerable since it often involves considerable investment and the collaboration of diverse groups including but not confined to policymakers, local people, small companies, and international partners and institutions (Tijhuis and Fellows 2017). Effective communication is one of the prerequisites of the successful implementation of international projects. This paper includes a brief analysis of possible barriers to effective managerial communication during the construction of the complex in Poland and strategies to be employed to overcome these challenges.\n\nMajor Barriers to Be Encountered and Effective Cross-Cultural Communication\n\nPower Distance\n\nThis report is based on Hofstede’s cultural framework that is regarded as a viable instrument to measure cultural peculiarities of different countries. Although this paradigm is sometimes criticized for overgeneralization, it is widely employed in business research and has proved to be effective (Clarke 2017). It is noteworthy that the United Kingdom and Poland are rather different in terms of almost all cultural dimensions according to Hofstede’s paradigm (Hofstede Insights n.d.). These differences should be considered so that appropriate communication patterns and channels could be developed. At this point, it is necessary to note that the differences between the countries are mainly associated with their past political agendas. Poland was under the rule of the Communist Party, which made it develop a non-Western perspective and managerial behaviors (Eisenberg et al. 2015). Nevertheless, during the past three decades, Polish people have adopted western attitudes in many aspects of their life, which is also obvious in the business sphere.\n\nPower distance is the dimension that reflects people’s attitudes towards authority and power distribution. This dimension is regarded as one of the most influential in terms of communication within multinational organizations. Poland is characterized by a high score (68), which means that it is a hierarchal society where people value centralization and authority. At the same time, there is an apparent shift in the business environment as an increasing number of employees report that they would like to have a supportive leader (Eisenberg et al. 2015). However, more discipline and higher results are achieved in companies with autocratic managers, which unveils the need to have a closer look at each employee. Oswald et al. (2017) emphasize that this dimension has a substantial impact on working place safety in the construction industry as UK and Polish managers and employees have different attitudes towards responsibilities and authority. UK managers may find working in such a working atmosphere rather inappropriate because British people prefer using a democratic leadership style.\n\nTraining is one of the central strategies that are necessary for the facilitation of cross-cultural communication. Training programs should address all the dimensions so that employees could understand each other’s worldviews and motivations (Targowski 2016). The development of communication skills should be one of the major priorities, which will result in the successful implementation of the project. The use of advanced technologies is essential since it reduces training costs and makes it more accessible and effective. Social networks can be instrumental in bringing people together during training projects (Wankel 2016). Apart from gaining specific sets of data, employees should be able to develop cross-cultural social ties, which will facilitate communication and collaboration within the organization. The use of such technologies may need certain training as well, but this investment will have a positive influence on the venture.\n\nApart from staff training, it is also important to ensure the use of proper communication channels. As far as formal communication is concerned, the company’s information systems should be characterized by wide access to a knowledge base and a communication platform with well-established levels. Supervisors should be able to inform employees, and the latter need a user-friendly reporting channel. Linear communication platforms should also be available, and Polish employees may be encouraged to utilize them, especially when it comes to knowledge sharing and innovation. Wankel (2016) states that Millennials are the group that will benefit from the use of advanced technologies and social networks. The use of mobile-based platforms can also be considered as it will facilitate the communication process, which is quite important for the construction industry.\n\nIndividualism\n\nIndividualism is another cultural dimension that has a substantial impact on the development of organizations. Polish society is rather individualistic with a score of 60 (Hofstede Insights n.d.). To compare, the UK’s score is 89, which makes it one of the most individualist nations where individual achievements and inputs are highly valued. As mentioned above, the influence of the communistic past is seen as collectivist values that were inflicted on Polish people for decades (Eisenberg et al. 2015). One of the major implications for managers related to this cultural peculiarity of the Polish society is the need to develop relationships at two levels.\n\nOn the one hand, hierarchy and power distribution should be strict and well-defined. It is essential to offer formal communication channels with a top-to-bottom approach. The introduction of standards and protocols will also be favorably accepted. On the other hand, managers should try to establish personal relationships, which will make Polish employees (at different levels) properly motivated (Soja 2016). As mentioned above, the ambivalent perspective in Polish society requires a personalized approach to employees whose views may differ significantly. Apart from training, UK managers must praise individual input and make it visible through benefits and appraisal. One of the characteristic features of the relationships between the UK and Polish managers will be attention to every individual’s needs and the creation of an atmosphere where everyone is important although unequal (Hofstede Insights n.d.). Soja (2016) also claims that managers should be supportive and guide the most active employees, which will help in addressing Polish people’s ambivalent attitude towards power and individualism. These measures may require certain training as British managers may be unprepared for such tasks.\n\nMasculinity\n\nThe two countries have almost identical scores in the masculinity dimension with 64 for Poland and 66 for the United Kingdom. The analysis of this dimension shows that Polish and British managers focus on competition and equity rather than the favorable atmosphere in the working place. However, the proper working environment is still quite relevant in both cultures. Reporting and performance assessment may be beneficial strategies that would contribute to effective cross-cultural communication. This dimension can become the basis for effective collaboration and communication as the objectives and behaviors of the two nations are quite similar. The use of social media can become the communication channel utilized to share knowledge and find the points of convergence (Wankel 2016). Managers can create video blogs sharing their views on performance, organizational goals, communication issues, and other challenges or opportunities. The development of social links during training programs can become the ground for the creation of a favorable working environment.\n\nUncertainty Avoidance\n\nThe two societies are very different in terms of the dimension of uncertainty avoidance as Poland scores 93 while the UK scores only 35 (Hofstede Insights n.d.). This cultural aspect may be associated with various issues related to strategic planning and innovation. Polish employees try to avoid any uncertainty, so rigid rules and traditions are highly valued. Changes and innovation tend to be resisted as people try to adhere to the rules and behaviors with known outcomes. As mentioned above, the construction industry is characterized by complexity and rigorous standards, so this dimension is specifically influential and should be considered when developing cross-cultural communication patterns (Tijhuis and Fellows 2017). This attitude towards the unknown also explains the leadership styles prevailing in the two cultures. In societies with high uncertainty avoidance, leaders tend to make decisions without involving their subordinates, so autocratic styles are mainly employed (Clarke 2017). In Poland, managers are regarded as primary decision-makers, while UK leaders often encourage employees to take an active part in discussions and the decision-making process.\n\nTo ensure effective communication, UK managers should try to minimize the degree of uncertainty. The development of protocols and guidelines can facilitate the communication process as all stakeholders will be able to adhere to certain standards that are associated with an appropriate degree of certainty (Tijhuis and Fellows 2017). It is also important to make sure that the decision-making process involves managers who are willing to play an active role in this context. It has been acknowledged that employees who have international working experiences are more open and prepared to adopt western business strategies (Hammond et al. 2017). Therefore, UK managers need to identify Polish managers with western orientation and those who follow traditions. Each of these groups will require the development of specific communication strategies.\n\nLong-Term Orientation\n\nLong-term orientation is the cultural dimension closely related to uncertainty avoidance. This dimension is associated with the use of a normative or pragmatic approach to the future (Lai 2017). Poland’s score is rather low (38) while the UK scores more (51) (Hofstede Insights n.d.). In terms of these cultural aspects, Polish managers employ a normative approach and try to adhere to established rules and follow the existing traditions. British managers tend to adopt a more pragmatic strand as they are ready to innovate and change the existing rules if they are more appropriate for the current situation. Therefore, UK managers will have to communicate the benefits of the pragmatic approach to the Polish staff. It can be necessary to make the associated changes gradual so that Polish managers could accept them.\n\nThe facilitation of communication within this context involves training and the use of advanced technologies. The use of video blogs can be beneficial in this case as well (Wankel 2016). Employees can share success stories related to change implementation, innovation, and the establishment of new standards. Corporate instant messenger and a specific program related to innovation adoption can make employees more motivated and active (Targowski 2016). The establishment of personal relationships with Polish managers will also be fruitful as the creation of rapport will make them less resistant to changes.\n\nIndulgence\n\nThe dimension of indulgence reveals the difference between the two nations with 29 in Poland and 69 in the United Kingdom (Hofstede Insights n.d.). This cultural aspect unveils people’s attitudes towards their desires. Polish society is characterized by a significant degree of restraint, while British people are likely to indulge themselves. Restrained societies are oriented on adherence to the existing norms and pay little attention to leisure time. In this respect, UK managers should try to develop personal relationships with employees, which can be achieved during team-building activities and similar venues (McLean and Kim 2017). Informal communication will help build bridges and overcome any misunderstanding or tension (Targowski 2016). Nevertheless, it is essential to remember that these events should include activities that have implications in employees’ professional life. Polish managers can be unwilling to spend their time playing games and having a good time as they might see it as indulging themselves.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nIn conclusion, it is essential to note that the development of effective communication channels and patterns is the key to the success of any international project. The developed cross-cultural communication strategy should be evidence-based and consistent with the goals of the venture. For such different societies as Poland and the UK, culture-related barriers to the implementation of the project are quite anticipated. To address these challenges, UK managers should follow several recommendations.\n\n 1. Staff training is one of the primary steps to undertake as employees should have the necessary skills and knowledge to address the project’s objectives. This training should involve such areas as cross-cultural communication skills, cultural peculiarities of different groups, success stories, and sharing experiences. The use of technology is essential as it will facilitate the development of a favorable working environment irrespective of the time frame and geographic location. Video conferences, instant messengers, wikis, and various social networks can help to make training effective. Training should also include team-building activities that contribute to the development of informal communication in cross-cultural teams.\n 2. The development of personal relationships between Polish and UK managers is another priority linked to cross-cultural communication. Polish people value this approach and are more motivated when they feel that their effort is noticed. The ambivalent attitude towards power distribution also suggests that a considerable number of Polish employees do not think that autocratic leadership can be effective in the modern business environment. Personal and informal communication can help in developing proper relationships among managers and make democratic leadership (that is typical of UK business contexts) a norm.\n 3. The creation of linear communication channels can facilitate cross-cultural communication and entrepreneurial zeal in the organization. Although Polish employees tend to be resistant to significant changes and innovations, the identification of active change agents among Polish managers can be beneficial. Instant messengers, knowledge base, and reporting protocols can help people explore their creativity, which can improve the organization’s competitiveness. Knowledge sharing is another aspect to pay considerable attention to since people should be exposed to success stories and various approaches to solving typical issues.\n\nReference List\n\nClarke N (2017) ‘IHRD and leader development’, in Garavan A, McCarthy, A and Carbery R (eds) Handbook of international human resource development: Context, processes and people , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 357–76.\n\nEisenberg J, Pieczonka A, Eisenring M and Mironski J (2015) ‘Poland, a workforce in transition: Exploring leadership styles and effectiveness of Polish vs. Western expatriate managers’, JEEMS Journal of East European Management Studies , 20(4), 435-451.\n\nGaravan A, McCarthy, A and Carbery R (2017) ‘International IHRD: Context, process and people – introduction’, in Garavan A, McCarthy, A and Carbery R (eds) Handbook of international human resource development: Context, processes and people , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 1–28.\n\nHammond M, O’Shea D and Pearson J (2017) ‘IHRD and global careers’, in Garavan A, McCarthy, A and Carbery R (eds) Handbook of international human resource development: Context, processes and people , Cheltenham: Edward Elgar Publishing, 336–56.\n\nHofstede Insights (n.d.) ‘Country comparison’ [online].

      "Defining Corporate Entrepreneurship Essay\n\nDefine the concept of “corporate entrepreneurship” and discuss the measures that might need to be taken to remove barriers against the development of corporate entrepreneurship\n\nEvery economy needs to be dynamic. To achieve this, there must be continuous innovation when it comes to the provision of services, products, and processes and also in establishing new business organizations. The formation of new businesses and innovation can be initiated at the individual level in what is referred to as individual entrepreneurship, or it can be done by existing organizations in what is known as corporate entrepreneurship. The latter is very useful as a tool for rejuvenating firms and giving them a new direction. It is adequately used by innovative managers to develop business, grow revenues, enhance profits and pioneer the development of novel products and processes.\n\nBased on the above information, we can determine that corporate entrepreneurship is an ongoing process within an existing firm that leads to the creation of new ventures, products, and processes. Additionally, corporate entrepreneurship renews business strategies and brings a competitive edge to the firm. It is therefore a product of a company’s venturing, innovation and renewal efforts over a period of time. Corporate entrepreneurship is highly dependent on the availability of resources and the persons tasked to control them.\n\nEntrepreneurial managers are those who are able to acquire and use new technical knowledge to solve company problems or increase the firm’s output. As such, corporate entrepreneurship is highly reliant on the employment of tangible assets such as financial physical, and labor resources and also intangible resources such as social, intellectual, and human capital. However, the intangible assets can be said to be more important since entrepreneurship is highly dependent on human skill and capacity for innovation. Human capital refers to the knowledge, capabilities, skill, and experience of the organization’s employees without regard to rank or file.\n\nIntellectual capital in corporate entrepreneurship is the collective embodiment of organizational knowledge while social capital is the asset acquired by the creation of synergistic and harmonious social networks. There is a need for the three forms of capital to collaborate to achieve an entrepreneurial goal. The organization that has an advantage is that which employs all its intellectual, human, and social capital towards the development of new strategies and attainment of greater goals.\n\nJust like in any venture, there are barriers that seem to act against corporate entrepreneurship. Again, these barriers relate to the use of tangible assets and the employment of intangible assets. Barriers that result from tangible assets are; financial constraints e.g. low liquidity, insufficient assets, weak asset base, etcetera . The result of these barriers is the prevention of investments into new technology or ideas thus curtailing entrepreneurship. However, barriers related to tangible assets are not as serious as those related to intangible ones. This is because of the importance of the latter assets in enhancing entrepreneurship.\n\nThese barriers related to the intangible assets of human, social and intellectual capital include; poor communication, inefficient management, lack of creativity, inexperienced employees, and internal wrangles within the organization. These barriers prevent the effective coordination and implementation of strategic entrepreneurial plans in the company. Alternatively, they hinder the development of innovative ideas into a workable company strategy.\n\nThere are various ways to remove the above barriers. First, the organization needs to identify the particular areas that are holding back its forward movement. It is only after a comprehensive entrepreneurial health audit that the firm can establish the problematic areas and begin working them out. For problems related to tangible assets, the organization can employ the known financial resolution methods to improve liquidity or lower financial constraints. These methods may include cost reduction, corporate restructuring, debt maintenance, and strategic planning.\n\nFor those barriers that arise from the employment of the intangible assets of human, social and intellectual capital, there are several measures that can be taken to eliminate them. These measures are managerial in nature and they aim to improve employees’ motivation, level of skill, creativity, and team-building capacity. They include; introduction of proper communication methods, in-house training of workers to improve their skills, rewarding innovation, encouraging dialogue, employing creative staff, and using motivational techniques to improve human capital.\n\nConclusion\n\nCorporate entrepreneurship can uplift the organization’s profile greatly if properly employed. Since the most dynamic organizations survive in the long term, innovation is the driving force for a business firm to remain afloat despite tough competition in the industry.\n\nEntrepreneurial failure is inevitable but predictable given its common causes,” critically discuss and illustrate with examples.\n\nEntrepreneurial failure is a devastating blow for any profit-oriented enterprise. It usually means that the plans that the individual or corporate body had put in place have backfired and the business has to start a new venture or wind up. However, the causes of entrepreneurial failure are known and thus entrepreneurial failure is predictable. Nevertheless, most individual and corporate entrepreneurs learn from failure and initial failure should not inform an entrepreneur’s decision to wind up a business or quit being an entrepreneur.\n\nCauses of entrepreneurial failure\n\nThere are many reasons why organizations and individuals decide to wind up existing businesses or shift to new ventures. While most of the problems leading to the shift or closure are predictable and avoidable, some of them are unavoidable e.g. destruction of business caused by political turmoil. The first of these problems are those related to management such as inefficiency, incompetence, lack of support, and inexperience. These problems can be easily remedied through managerial training and acquiring on the job experience.\n\nAnother cause of entrepreneurial failure that is more common is the individual factor. Most of the poor entrepreneurial decisions are made by individuals who are exposing the organization to their own personal weaknesses. Arrogance, lack of cooperation, lack of faith in employees, unreasonable risk appetite, engaging in illegal practices e.t.c. are all individual weaknesses that usually bring down the entire organization. The only way to solve this problem is through behavioral therapy, training, and modification. In some cases, it would be better for the company to dismiss the employee accustomed to making reckless decisions that cost the organization or those who engage in illegal activities.\n\nFailure may also be occasioned by production problems especially where technical problems arise and the company incurs huge costs in solving them. However, production problems are easily solved by the hiring of competent engineers and employees who are able to report problems early before they bring production to a halt. Financial problems are another major cause of entrepreneurial failure. They are solved by seeking assistance from financial institutions and employing cost reduction and profit maximization measures. Other problems are industry-related e.g. where government policies are not business-friendly or where there is stiff competition in the market. The best method would be to lobby the government and to hire aggressive marketing agents but at times the only option would be for the firm to venture into a friendlier industry.\n\nExamples of entrepreneurial failure\n\nPerhaps the best example of corporate entrepreneurial failure is the much famed Fashion Cafe’. The cafe was established by a group of models and celebrities led by famous restaurateur, Tommaso Buti. The cafe sold exclusive dishes such as fried appetizers and gargantuan burgers which were overpriced. However, the failure of the cafe was attributed to Buti’s mismanagement and illegal acts which eventually led to his arrest in 2000.\n\nAnother failure was that by Ford Motor Company when it launched its futuristic model, the Edsel. Despite Edsel’s posturing as the car of the future, the market’s reaction to its release was downright cold. Eventually, Ford withdrew the model but it came at a loss of $250 million. The failure of Edsel was attributed to poor marketing strategy. The third big failure was the Betamax by Sony Corporation. While the video recorder was touted as being capable of recording over 3 hours of TV, the marketing of the product, its bulky size, price, and limited abilities eventually led to the product becoming a flop. Lastly, there is the much-publicized flop of Switzerland’s national icon, SwissAir. While the company had originally been so successful that it was referred to as the ‘flying bank’, its failure was phenomenal. The company was too ambitious in its borrowing and eventually, it collapsed. The reason for its collapse was attributed to poor management and the September 11 attacks in New York.\n\nIn all the above examples, these companies could have easily foreseen that their entrepreneurial activities would eventually lead to failure. A good example is Swissair which was so reckless that it purchased fuel from each of its stops without consideration of losses accruing from differences in currency and price. Clearly, this could have been foreseen. As for Ford and Sony, they should have known that a new product needs aggressive marketing. For the Fashion Cafe’, Buti could have predicted that his fraudulent ways could eventually catch up with him and he would sink with all his investments. These examples show that even though entrepreneurial failure has many causes. It can be predicted and remedied.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs seen above, it is possible to effectively predict the likely causes of entrepreneurial failure. The organization should therefore make a point of auditing itself to establish whether there are signs of any of the above problems and put in restorative measures before the actual failure occurs.\n\nCritically discuss how cultural experiences may influence a person’s propensity to behavior entrepreneurially.\n\nThere has been a lot of interest in the impact that culture has on the entrepreneurial capacity of a certain country or locality. The fact that different countries show different approaches to entrepreneurship has sparked debate on the causes of the disparity. Of all the reasons that could explain the difference, culture seems to be the most logical reason and the topic has received substantial scholarly interest as a result. The main areas that seem to be influenced by culture are innovation, risk taking, and the start-up of new business ventures. Data from different countries shows interesting results with regional, national and organizational cultures all having an impact on the entrepreneurial behavior of their members.\n\nStudy findings\n\nMost studies have employed unique research methods that attempt to capture different cultural variables that can be statistically tested against particular entrepreneurial habits. While there have been few studies showing actual correlations between cultural traits and entrepreneurial outcomes, a few have shown that there is indeed a remarkable connection between culture and entrepreneurship.\n\nThe conflicting element in the available studies on culture and entrepreneurship is in the definition of culture. While some scholars seem to think that it is an “unconscious process”, others seem to think of it as a pattern of certain basic assumptions that are developed or invented by a distinct group of people in their ordinary way of life and as they try to adapt or cope to their immediate environments. Eventually, the pattern is considered to be valid and is passed to new members as the right way of thought, feeling, or action.\n\nCertain cultural practices, norms, and values seem to have considerable effects on the individual entrepreneur. A good example of this is the fact that cultures that usually emphasize family unity and collective responsibility seem to do better when it comes to the aspects of entrepreneurship that require cooperation and teamwork. In contrast, individuals from cultures such as that of America that insist on personal and individual freedom seem to do much better in starting up businesses and coming up with new ideas and products.\n\nThe effect of culture on the individual seems to be mostly value-based. Individuals from cultures that emphasize high standards of morality seem to possess traits that are more related to good business practice such as honest dealing, sufficient pay for workers e.t.c. Other cultures that stress followership and obeying rules produce risk-averse individuals who are reluctant to start up new ventures and who prefer the proven methods of doing business. Again, individuals from ‘freer’ communities that look more towards individual liberty rather than community cohesiveness produce aggressive entrepreneurs who are not shy to absorb risk and try out new ideas. Other cultural traits such as conceptions of truth, wisdom, behavior, humanity, leadership, and God also seem to have different effects on several aspects of entrepreneurship. However, researchers agree that there is a need for further testing and statistical analysis since results are not as comprehensive as other ‘finer’ studies.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt seems that culture plays a significant role in influencing the individual to make certain entrepreneurial decisions. While research may not yet be conclusive on the topic due to the susceptibility of studies to cultural bias and stereotyping as is common in most cultural studies, the initial results are a pointer to the fact that the relationship between culture and entrepreneurship cannot be ignored. Research studies are also limited in the sense that they do not give information on other control variables that may affect the seemingly different entrepreneurial behaviors such as poor economic development, unavailability of credit facilities, education e.t.c.\n\nCritically evaluate the contribution made by economists in understanding the concept of” entrepreneur” in a business context.\n\nClassical economists like Parkin long recognized the role that entrepreneurship plays in the economic system of a country. These economists even added it as one of the four critical factors of production alongside labor, capital and land. While the other three are much dependent on resource availability, entrepreneurship stands out as a unique quality that warrants research. From the early 18 th Century, the term ‘entrepreneurship’ has been used on many acts that involve innovative ways of doing things. Originally, the term was used in the French military for certain generals who had unique strategies in war.\n\nThe economists’ contribution to entrepreneurship\n\nWhile early economists were satisfied that the placing of entrepreneurship as a factor of production was enough to show its strong economic influence, modern economists seem to ignore such artificial restrictions. Instead, economists such as Joseph Schumpeter felt that entrepreneurship was more of a phenomenal factor that was in its own bracket. Schumpeter reasoned that while land, labour and capital were measurable and independent of intrinsic human capacity, entrepreneurship could not simply fit in among the other three due to the huge variance. Additionally, entrepreneurship seemed to defy the ordinary rules of economics and instead forge new paths that economists could not have foreseen.\n\nThe works of Joseph Schumpeter opened the floodgates for modern economists to discard the economic ‘rule book’ and investigate the true role of entrepreneurship. The works of William Baumol are an excellent example of Schumpeter’s influence. First, he agrees with Schumpeter in stating that entrepreneurship should actually be factored in the price determination mechanisms that only include demand and supply. He reiterates that it is the innovation of new products that seems to move the market not mere supply and demand. He states that innovation actually threatens companies that are well established and which economists would term as “financially sound” with obsolescence and extinction if they fail to be innovative or entrepreneurial. Baumol averred that instead of relying on “occasional flashes of inspiration” organizations should set up research and development departments that would ensure that innovation remains continuous.\n\nBaumol adds that innovation does not necessarily mean coming up with totally new ideas. It is mainly the improvement of the already existing products in a more presentable and creative manner. He insists on the simplicity of new ideas and encourages individuals to develop an appetite for risk. However, risk seems to be the more rampant cause of entrepreneurial failure with less than 10% of new ideas bringing instant success in most research studies. Nevertheless, entrepreneurs seem to be in a class of their own with Baumol stating that they possess a “touch of madness”.\n\nBased on the works of these ‘radical’ economists, entrepreneurship has now received more attention with the 21 st century being the foreground for a purely ‘entrepreneurial’ approach to all business activities. Judging from the level of competition in modern industries as well as the amounts of money that organizations both big and small have put into research activities, no one can deny that entrepreneurship is in the ‘driver’s seat’ of modern economics.\n\nConclusion\n\nSchumpeter, Baumol and other economists have played a huge role in ensuring that entrepreneurship gets the attention it deserves. Nowadays, it is common for one to hear of entrepreneurship in education, leadership, religion, and many other spheres that traditionally had instructional models of administration and management. The contribution by economists therefore cannot be downplayed.\n\nAccess the relative strengths and weaknesses of large/small businesses and the role of innovation.\n\nWhen it comes to entrepreneurship, there is a distinct difference in the approach of small organizations as compared to larger ones. The reason for this is that the dynamics for both organization types differ. While the small business may be run by one individual probably self employed or employing close family members, large organizations have to grapple with a huge workforce, complex decision making procedures and divergent flow of authority and responsibility.\n\nStrengths of a small business\n\nGenerally, a small business enjoys the benefits of easy start-up and smoother decision making. Most small businesses are usually engaged in one particular activity that generates all the revenue. These small businesses have the upper hand over large firms when it comes to adjustment to the economic environment e.g. they can easily cease one business activity and quickly jump on board another money-minting venture. Due to the complex decision making procedures and statutory limitations, large firms do not enjoy the benefits of such rapid structural adjustments. Other strengths include the ability to cut costs easily, the ease of monitoring profits and revenue growth, easier investment decision making and lower taxes. A small firm is more convenient for an individual entrepreneur since he/she is allowed a bigger leeway to test new ideas and innovations.\n\nWeaknesses of small businesses\n\nWhile small businesses may be easily adjustable, they are more susceptible to collapse due to the latitude that the individual has to make investment mistakes. In large companies, investment decisions are made by boards under the advice of industry professionals. This means that the margin for investment error is lower than that in small firms that prefer a go-it-alone approach. Another weakness is the limitation in terms of financial and human capital. A small firm cannot enjoy the benefit of huge capital bases that come with benefits of economies of scale and larger profits. Additionally, the small firm does not enjoy sufficient human capital which is quite necessary when it comes to innovation since more people are more likely to come up with better ideas than an individual.\n\nStrengths of large firms\n\nLarge firms enjoy huge intellectual, social and human capital as well as a bigger portfolio of assets and financial capital. This means that they have a larger capacity for innovation since they can hire the best brains in the market and also maintain an employee base that is skilled and innovative. Hypothetically, larger firms are therefore more advanced than smaller firms when it comes to innovation though in actual fact, smaller firms show a higher degree of innovation. These firms also have the advantage of ‘weighted’ decision making whereby only the best decision reaches the implementation stage. This makes larger firms less susceptible to entrepreneurial failure.\n\nWeaknesses of larger firms\n\nLarge firms face a myriad of weaknesses owing to the large number of employees and the complex decision making processes. They are thus less likely to be innovative than smaller firms despite their larger innovative capacity since entrepreneurial decisions have to be ‘vetted’ by a group of people and are more likely to be watered down or rejected. This is because boards have been shown to be more risk-averse than individuals due to the fact that they have a greater responsibility to protect shareholder’s investments. Another weakness is the large number of employees who might not be at par when it comes to achieving organizational goals thus dragging the company’s performance. Finally, large firms face entry barriers due to high start-up costs and huge taxes.\n\nRole of innovation in small/large businesses\n\nAs discussed above, innovation plays a great role in determining the entrepreneurial capacity of a business enterprise. In large firms, the accessibility of quality human resources means that they can be more innovative than smaller firms. However, bureaucracy in decision making lowers this capacity and acts as a barrier to innovation. For smaller firms, they have less financial muscle and are thus disadvantaged in acquiring the best human capital but the ‘touch of madness’ that is required in entrepreneurs is present meaning that they are more likely to embrace innovation.\n\nConclusion\n\nInnovation is the ban of entrepreneurship without which there would be no economic dynamism and investment in new ideas. The emphasis on innovation is therefore reasonable since it pushes organizations to outdo themselves and come up with better products that would ensure their long term survival in competitively ‘hostile’ industries. In summary, organizations whether small or large have only two choices-innovate or perish.\n",

References\n\nCareer-planning modules\n\nThe four career planning modules included career exploration, interviewing, networking, and resume writing. It is crucial to mention that each of the four modules is well endowed with relevant information needed by a graduate student. For example, I learned that career exploration entails preparation, interaction, and evaluation. A graduate student who is keen on understanding the career being pursued ought to go through the three processes. Second, students should learn various interviewing skills used by interviewers especially when they will be seeking employment opportunities after studies (Beatty & Willis, 2007). Salary discussions, handling questions and the entire process of the interview have been discussed in the module. Networking also facilitates the interaction of individuals across the board. It assists in the sharing of vital information. Recent developments in networking have witnessed social media use among students and professionals. In regards to resume writing, I learned that the process of searching for employment opportunities requires well-developed resumes (Tillotson & Osborn, 2012).\n\nCareer shift\n\nThe career shift segment assists students in finding jobs. The job found from the search is that of a Therapeutic Day Treatment Counselor. A professional in this field offers counseling services to patients during the day. The nature of counseling is largely therapeutic in nature. The job is readily available owing to the increasing demand for counseling services.\n\nGradprofiles\n\nThis assists in understanding the graduate school process. From the exploration, the most interesting graduate program is the school of business. This school offers graduate courses in business. Some of the courses offered at include School of Business include accounting, marketing, management, accounting, human resources and computer information systems. For a student to be enrolled in the school of business, he/she must have a strong background in business modules from past studies. The school of business also requires individuals who are self-driven to discover for themselves in the course of learning (McLoughney, 2009).\n\nOne of the factors that fascinate me in the school of business is the variety and applicability of the courses offered. As a matter of fact, all of the graduate programs in this school are in high demand in the job market. For instance, there is no single sector in the economy that does not rely on information systems. The contemporary world is rapidly being shaped by networks of information systems. Hence, unless skills and competencies in information are adequately taught, it ca n be cumbersome to operate organizations in the modern world (Gibson, Hardy, Jay & Buckley, 2014).\n\nNACE Salary calculator\n\nThe salary for a Mental Health and Substance Abuse Social Worker ranges between $29570 and $66220 while the median salary stands at $38730.when I visited this site, I found out that the starting salary is relatively lower than the preceding salary ranges. It is evident that experience counts a lot when it comes to the amount of salary awarded to employees. From the salary calculator, I also realized that the amounts earned by employees depend on the level of the job group. For a social worker dealing with mental health and substance abuse, the salary margin is quite impressive especially after working for quite a while. It is also vital to mention that the calculator only gives basic salary without the input of other benefits and allowances.

      "New and Older Muslim Generations in the Workplace Essay\n\nAs a tendency, Arab Spring has motivated young people from all over the Islamic world to re-think their identities and goals in life and become more productive as professionals, managers, and leaders. This happening is new to the Muslim culture, and this is why it is important to understand and analyze its development, implications, and potential outcomes. The major shift of values and future orientation within the new generation of the society determines its course for the upcoming decades and its wellbeing in the long-term.\n\nIn comparison to the older generation of Muslim people, the youth is much more flexible which assumes the upcoming changes in the society. That way, as the new generation is currently in pursuit of jobs, the hirers and companies are to be aware of the specific features of the potential employees.\n\nThis phenomenon is similar to the integration of the Millenials in the workforce of the West, the challenging process that requires some flexibility from the organizations. Managing the younger generation of Muslims also may result in a variety of clashes between the youth and the workplaces run by Traditionalists who prefer to follow the older practices.\n\nToday, hiring young people, the managers are to ensure that the companies’ values match the values of the potential workers, respond to their cultural flexibility, and orientation to the new values. The system of incentives also should be changed, as goal-driven young professionals are more interested in self-actualization, career building, and improvement. The companies may want to look into the adoption of such practices as coaching, qualification refinement and improvement, equality practices, team building, innovation, and new technologies.\n\nAs workers, the new generation can be motivated by the incentives and benefits that allow creativity and self-realization. It is possible that the Islamic managers would have to review some of the Western practices aimed at the maximization of productivity facilitated using positive stimuli such as appreciation, autonomy, rewards, and perks, instead of following the transactional leadership concept with autocratic authorities. In other words, the businesses today are not only to hire the younger employees but also to provide them with the opportunities to take over the leading roles and enforce fresh changes.\n\nTo sum up, the reviewed article provides elaborate information concerning the differences between the new and the older generations of Muslim societies, their specific features, and values. This information allows the managers and decision-makers to adjust their practices and strategies to attract, and motivate younger professionals who represent extremely useful human resources that carry contemporary knowledge, relevant information, and are more in tune with the latest societal and business trends.\n\nThe attraction and retention of the employees from the younger generation will allow Muslim businesses to keep up with the rapid development of the business world, expand to other countries, maintain balanced and productive communication and collaboration with the Western world, and remain at the top of their markets evolving under the influence of the Arab Spring as a social tendency.\n",
      "“Build-A-Bear: Build-A-Memory” Company’s Case Case Study\n\nGive examples of needs, wants, and demands that Build-A-Bear customers demonstrate, differentiating each of these three concepts. What are the implications of each on Build-A-Bear’s actions?\n\nIdentification of customers’ needs, wants and demands is an important strategy to any marketing department. This is because a firm will be in a position to offer products that march the customers’ needs, wants, or demand leading to their satisfaction. Maxime Clark is aware of the above fact. Through interaction with the customers in her stores, she has collected ideas on their needs and demands.\n\nThis has enabled her to produce products that guarantee customer satisfaction leading to annual increases in the store’s profits. The store does not only offer children a variety of teddy bears to choose from, but also provides them with the experience to learn and create their own customized teddy bears. The store is also composed of child-friendly assembly lines made up of various stations i.e. “choose me”, “stuff me”, “stitch me”.\n\nThis provides children with a fantasy world where they interact and satisfy their social needs. In the end, they create a need for affection and belonging based on the memory and experience they have when they visit the store. Customers want to gain knowledge on how to customize their products and express their delight or concerns on the same. The store has created an interactive website (BuildABearVille.com) where customers can access information on their products and freely express themselves. Customers demand authority over the teddy bears they purchase and the store has given them the power of customization.\n\nDescribe all facets of Build-A-Bear’s product. What is being exchanged in a Build-A-Bear transaction?\n\nBuildABear has concentrated on continuous improvement of the quality of its products rather than explore other business ventures. The firm’s initial product was making teddy bears but this changed over time. In line with the store’s objective, it has created a fantasy world where kids are treated to an experience of a kind. Therefore, in addition to the product, the store also sells experience to the kids. This facet has enabled kids to develop an attachment to the initial product of the company. Apart from making teddy bears, the store also gives the customer a unique opportunity to make the teddy bears themselves basing on their desires.\n\nThis has created a sense of control among the store’s customers which has resulted in loyalty to the store’s products. Moreover, the extensive involvement of their customers in the personalization process through their website ( BuildABearVille.com ) has created a platform for interaction with the customers. In addition to getting a teddy bear, a customer can play games and do other activities on this site. Having fun on the store’s website is considered a new product of the store.\n\nWhich of the five marketing management concepts best describes Build-A-Bear Workshop?\n\nBuildABear has utilized the product marketing concept. The concept dwells on the idea that customers or consumers will purchase the products that offer quality, performance, and improved features. Maxime Clark collects ideas from kids about their needs and uses these ideas to improve the company’s product. She achieves this by putting herself in the customer’s shoes, interacting with them in her stores, and communicating with them frequently through emails and her website.\n\nThe store has now created a genuine fantasy world that is child friendly and is made up of several work stations that give kids an amazing experience. As a way of improving on their product, the store has also given a chance for customers to personalize their products. The customer can improve on the store’s product or he/she can create his/her product to match his/her requirements. Creating an interactive website for the store is also seen as a way of improving the quality and performance of the product. The website improves service delivery to customers by serving millions of customers at the same time. These improvements on the store’s initial product have contributed positively to the profits of the store.\n\nDiscuss in detail the value that Build-A-Bear creates for its customers\n\nBuildABear offers a variety of added values to its customers. Unlike their competitors, the BuildABear store designs unique products that are very marketable. They provide customers with freedom of expression by allowing them to create their products in their ways. This has been viewed as a move to empower their customers. It has enabled their customers to get a more attractive, quality, and customized product.\n\nTheir products are also priced cheaply at $ 25 as compared to their competitor’s $ 50 to $ 100. The store has also added value to its products through exploiting technology. The website (BuildABearVille.com) provides extra services to the customers who want to have fun. They can play games and do other related tasks in the store. Lastly, the store has created a healthy and vibrant relationship with its customers by listening and providing superior products to them. These values have enabled the store to stand out among its competitors.\n\nIs Build-A-Bear likely to be successful in continuing to build customer relationships? Why or why not?\n\nI think BuildABear will be successful by continuing to build its relationship with the customer. This is because Maxime Clark (CEO) is aware of the fact that understanding customers is important for the success of any firm. She thus devotes her energy to understanding their needs and improving on the products to satisfy the consumer’s needs.\n",
      "Carbon Emissions and Greenhouse Gasses Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nCarbon emissions and greenhouse gasses are the leading environmental threat today. Environmental pollution comes as air, water, and ground. We travel in public vehicles, personal vehicles, take flights, heat our rooms and watch LCD screen TVs. All these endeavors contribute to environmental degradation. Greenhouse gasses build up in the atmosphere cause increased temperature. Researchers estimate a rise in greenhouse gasses concentration to about 550 parts per million can significantly raise temperatures by between two to four degrees Celsius. Raised temperature levels have severe effects ranging from drought, rapid melting of glaciers, and making life in the coastal regions unbearable.\n\nPeople living in the temperate regions can tolerate a temperature rise of four degrees centigrade. They can build higher sea walls, adjust the agricultural practices and acclimatize to the high temperatures. However, for the country which margin population is already stressed by water shortages, coastal flooding or too high temperatures for agricultural productivity; the alternative is not accessible. Carbon emissions including the carbon oxides and nitrogen oxides contribute to the depletion of the ozone layer. Recent abolition of leaded gasoline engines contributed to the reduction of nitrogen four oxide emissions. Carbon monoxide emissions are prevalent during winter periods.\n\nThe result of ozone layer depletion increases the intensity of sun’s UV radiations and increased risk of skin cancers as well. UK is responsible for an estimated emission of greenhouse gasses amounting to about 14 tonnes. We are, however, powerless in controlling the level of environmental pollutants as some operations that contribute to the emissions are part of our lifestyle and, therefore, make our lives comfortable (Mitsutaka Matsumoto, 2012). For example, vehicles make movement easier and faster. We cannot operate without them. Realizing a sustainable environment without compromising on the public comfort remains the biggest challenge in the fight against environmental pollution.\n\nCritical evaluation of my current lifestyle\n\nThis essay is based on my lifestyle practices and the effects it has on the environment. I will assess my lifestyle as an individual and then integrate the impact to an average human being. I will also outline the possible practices to help reduce the lifestyle effects on the environment. I will evaluate the emissions at home and my place of work. The household appliances; home heating equipment, water heating, lighting and car and air travel produce direct environmental emissions. Indirect emissions consist of food and other indirect greenhouse gas sources. The main challenge to fighting environmental degradation is the high level of economic growth (Dillon, 2014).\n\nHigh economic growth rates lead to a rise in employees pay and consequently result in lifestyle practices which increase carbon emissions to the atmosphere (Khi V. Thai, 2007; Jackson, 2012). People tend to migrate from the older cathode ray tube televisions to the LCDS. At the same time the refrigerators and freezers at home and office places get bigger and bigger (Yiming Wei, 2011; Mick, 2012). The relatively cheaper fuel prices have led to advancements in technology. The new model cars are fitted with air conditioning systems, and the kitchen lightings have been replaced with halogen spotlights instead of the older pale fluorescent tubes (Jagers, 2010).\n\nThis flossy lifestyle is attributable to the insatiable human desire for an easier life and increased comfort (Röcklinsberg, 2013; Goodall, 2010). The desired comfort, when achieved, causes an imbalance in the food input and the energy output. Obesity alert and other lifestyle diseases are on the rise as a result. The modern cars are currently fitted with power steering which increases the fuel efficiency by an estimated value of 5%. The current generation is not aware of the environmental effects of their actions. In fact, research has proved that the old value environmental safety twice more then the youth does (Goodall, 2010).\n\nEvery individual in the UK is estimated to emit about ten tonnes of greenhouse gasses excluding international flights and shipping. I drive to work every day and probably contribute this amount. We buy mostly imports from other countries like China and Germany (Matthew John Franchetti, 2012). The imports contain carbon footprints. These goods added to a reasonable quantity of emission in the country of origin. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to document the level of emission.\n\nI should as well consider the things I buy. Calculating the household emissions per year, I estimate an amount of about four tonnes to the environment. The largest proportion is the food I use. In addition, clothing, paper, and consumer electronics also contribute a significant amount. It is, however, impossible to reduce this amount of emission to a figure between 80-90% without embracing substantial improvements both in energy efficiency and controlling our high power consuming western lives. Manufacturers make improvements in home insulations to reduce gas usage, reducing carbon usage in electricity production and production of more efficient cars (Lucia A. Reisch, 2015; Goodall, 2010).\n\nI use gas and electricity for home heating. Estimated amounts of about 280kWh of gas and electricity are spent in every home per square meter of living space. This amounts to a total of 170 kWh a year for space heating (Goodall, 2010). Research indicates that a typical house composed of averagely three people produces over 2.7 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year to operate the central heating boiler. The heater is, therefore, responsible for 10% of the total individual’s emission and about 20% of the greenhouse emission (Louis Lebel, 2009).\n\nThe water heaters in the showers also contribute to the carbon dioxide emissions. Hot water showers are currently installed in almost every house, and mine is not an exception (DuPont, 2009). Scientists and specialties in the field of energy conservation recommend to use the shorter showers and slightly lower temperatures to reduce the energy usage. The gas cookers at the homes also contribute a significant amount as well. The average person uses about 55 liters of hot water a day.\n\nThe cumulative amount, taking into account the whole family usage amounts to around 160 liters a day; hot and cold. This water capacity results from the cumulative water usage for showers, hand washing and, dishwashing. An amount of 40 liters goes to the baths and showers. Improving boiler efficiency, reducing water temperatures and reducing water volumes checks the high energy consumption (Jackson, 2012; Lucia A. Reisch, 2015).\n\nThe domestic lighting in the households also contributes a significant amount to carbon and other household appliances like fridges, freezers, washing machines and tumble dryers are electricity operated. Gas powered tumble dryers are however recommended to save on the energy consumption. The large screen television sets are also grand contributors to the carbon emissions. A smaller liquid crystal display TV would consume less energy and thus fewer emissions, but the desire for a classy lifestyle and social status is a challenge (Goodall, 2010). I also own skyboxes and a desktop computer which are capable of consuming power even when not in use.\n\nThe wet appliances we use to dry our clothes and dishes also contribute a significant amount of emissions ranging between 20-30% as projected by the international energy agency. Washing machine is an essential requirement in most of the households and averagely used 270 times a year; five or more times a week. A projected amount of 270kwh per year is consumed by the washing machines. When using the tumble dryers, one would not readily notice the increased energy usage. The machines are standard requirements in the middle-class homes in the UK (Goodall, 2010).The machines have become primary need since they make life easier and have almost eliminated the use of clothes line in drying clothes.\n\nOn average I spend about 400kwh of electricity a year on operating the tumble dryer. The dryer I use is fitted with a condenser, and close observation has shown that the energy usage has increased by about 10 percent. Operating the dryer 150 times a year with 3kg of cloth per cycle accumulates the wattage consumption to an alarmingly significant figure. The energy efficiencies of the dryers have been a meager concern of the authorities. As a result, the current dryers use more electricity than did the dryers ten years ago (Jackson, 2012). In addition, the electric kettles also used contribute to power consumption. This translates to increased carbon emissions to the environment.\n\nThe other small appliances often used irregularly are the iron, vacuums and microwaves (Goodall, 2010). Operating an iron for 90 minutes, vacuums for 60 minutes and microwaves for 20 minutes consume an average of about 250 kWh a year. However, the wattage varies widely with the household size. I evaluated the total consumption of these small appliances and concluded that the iron was the intense power consumer. Operating an iron on its own might consume a figure well above 150kWh.\n\nLastly traveling in motorcars also contributes appreciably to the carbon emissions. An average car produces about 170g of carbon emission every kilometer. Changing the car size to a small one with a manual transmission could reduce the carbon emission to a value well below 120g per kilometer. Heavy cars weighing over a tonne consume a substantial amount of fuel. Reducing the cars mileage could also reduce the carbon emissions. Hybrid electric cars also reduce the emissions (Goodall, 2010).\n\nManufacturers work tirelessly to produce more energy efficient cars, although the high number of cars on the roads washes away the results of their efficiencies. We could also embrace public transport in favor of the personal vehicles (Khi V. Thai, 2007). I may also consider replacing my current car with a new fuel efficient modern car. The result would be dependent on whether my old car gets scrapped or remains on the road, ration of the new and old cars fuel efficiency and the amount of energy consumed in building the new car. Neglecting these implications would have little if no significance to the environmental emissions level (Mick, 2012).\n\nValues and beliefs influencing my purchase decisions and consumption\n\nThe government sets aside part of the budget to help curb environmental degradation and hence adverse climatic change. Maintaining a sustainable environment is, however, a challenging task because our buying and consumption habit is influenced by many factors. Our purchasing and consumption habits are affected by our level of income, desire to a higher social status and the desire for a relaxed and comfortable life (Jackson, 2012). Some of the machines discussed above as the key contributors can be eliminated in our lives. A better replacement which requires environmentally friendly manual power can be done (Goodall, 2010).\n\nIt is, however, difficult as manual power is very inefficient in terms of time consumption and physical energy requirement. Environmental activists also propose shorter mileages and recommend us to use the cars whenever necessary (UK Government Report, 2008). This would mean that congestion would reduce on our roads. Reduced congestion might have the effect of encouraging other people to use their cars thus reducing the benefits of one’s choice to reduce using his car less often (Lehmann, 2013). The wealthy families own a fleet of classy cars fitted with additional structures which require more fuel usage and hence more carbon emissions. It is illogical to convince a rich person to purchase a small LCD screen TV instead of the large screen. The wealthy families also watch TVs more often compared to the low-class families.\n\nAs discussed above, the wealthy families use twice as much lighting bulb than the low-income level (Jackson, 2012). Children are most affected when it comes to applying manual labor in providing them with their needs. They suffer mockery instances from their peers. For example, wearing sun-dried clothes to school when others have tumble-dried clothes as there is a significant difference between tumble dried clothes and sun-dried clothes (Goodall, 2010).\n\nCompanies also suffer from the same scenario as do the human beings. The company’s sales volume is affected by their customers’ tastes and preferences. The companies are hence forced to manufacture as per the customers’ needs regardless of the equipment’s power consumption rates (Fadare, 2009). Successful companies are those that meet their clients’ needs. Furthermore, many people prefer products and services which consume large amounts of fossil fuels.\n\nPrimary obstacles to reducing negative environmental and social impacts\n\nControlling the amounts of carbon emissions is a collective responsibility. Each and every individual must take responsibility and refrain from consuming the products and services requiring high operational energy levels. It takes a lot of sacrifices to help embrace this behavior. An individual action to apply manual power, walk more often and replace the household appliances with the more efficient ones will not have significant effects on the environment as such if the whole population does not embrace the practice as well (Louis Lebel, 2009).\n\nApplying manual labor to most of the operations at home and in the offices is also considered very analog, laborious and time-consuming. Replacing the office consumer with a typewriter would mean reduced volume of the typed documents (Goodall, 2010). Furthermore, some people are not aware of the effects of their lifestyle actions on the environment.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe government in conjunction with the manufacturers should, therefore, manufacture and import environmentally friendly products and services in these current times of technological advancements. The current non-biodegradable packaging polythene papers should be replaced with biodegradable forms. The government should encourage tree planting and increase the forest reserve acreage. Trees are responsible for the reduction of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and the sun’s intensity.\n\nReference list\n\nDillon, J., 2014.

      "Colors in “Impression, Sunrise” by Claude Monet Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Color coding system\n 3. Color categories\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe image, “Impression, Sunrise”, is a complex and well-thought piece, that demonstrates some interesting facts. The most conspicuous interesting aspect of the image is the blend of colors in the image. The colors in the image are predominantly yellow, red, green, orange, black, and cyan, which is a blend of blue and green. These colors blend very well, which helps in bringing out the intended impression of the image (Maund, 2006).\n\nColor coding system\n\nUsing the RGB common color notation system, the colors contained in the image, “The impression sunrise” includes a blend of yellow and red, especially at the upper left section of the image. The blend is mixed to show dark yellow. At the part below the left-hand corner of the image is a blend of dark green, representing the figures that closely represent plants of some kind. Close to the green-colored figures are shades of cyan, which is a blend of blue and green, which is used to represent the water in the background and parts of the sky. There is a dark orange color, which is a blend of red, representing the setting sun in the background (O’Connor, 2010; O’Connor, 2012, pp. 1-5; O’Connor, 2012, pp. 4-6).\n\nThe greatest and an interesting facet of the image is the placement of the orange sun, which, despite being small and one that covers only a small area in the image, is contrasted to the artwork, as a part of the entire image. It is also portrayed as an intriguingly central part of the entire painting, as well as the clearest element, as shown through the image, which may have been used to show the impression of a landscape under the spotlight rather than a rendition. The color blending used for the picture is also representative of the weather and lighting conditions, which portray the interest and the liking of the artist (Feisner, 2000; Gage, 2000; O’Connor, 2012, pp. 1-5).\n\nColor categories\n\nThe colors that are dominant in the image include blends of red, green, and blue. These colors fall under the cool and warm colors category, and their attributes are used to portray a given intended message or impression. The blend of blue used in the image is used to represent the attributes of peacefulness and importance. For instance, the water and the background sky at the back of the image are portrayed as calm and essential to the whole system and the impression portrayed. The warm color used throughout the image, green, is used to give the impression of the environment, harmony of the portrayed systems, health, and growth.\n\nFor instance, the green color is used to represent the plant life in the area and its relationship with the other objects on the image. The green blend of colors is also used to show the kind of environment, the growth, harmony, and most likely the healthy status of the area shown through the image. Using Gestalt’s model, the objects shown in the image can be viewed as organized and structured into a whole, rather than independent parts (O’Connor, 2010, pp. 1-3). For example, the vegetation is shown as connected to the stream, which is the medium on which the canoe is floating over (Livingstone, 2002; Livingstone, 1988; Kopacz, 2006).\n\nIn the aspect of color concerning luminance, it may seem that the sun is the brightest section on the image, but is true of similar luminance to that of the incorporated parts of the sky when checked using a photometer. For instance, if you make the image a black and white portrait, the sun disappears relatively completely. Therefore, this makes the image a very realistic quality representation, as the cortex of most mammal brains registers luminance as opposed to color, meaning that the sun would become invisible to it (Hard, Sivik, & Tonnquist, 1996; Schwarz & Kuehni, 2008).\n\nThe impressionist nature of the image is also clear from the portrayal of a disappearing horizon, the sky, reflections, and the water, which are portrayed as fully matching together. The ships and the buildings shown in the background part of the image are more of vague additions, as the red-orange sun dominates the artwork (Albers, 1963; Hard, Sivik, & Tonnquist, 1996). This can identify with Monet’s comment that his aim was not portraying an accurate landscape, but a representation of the image, the feelings, the impression, and outlook perceived while looking at the work.\n\nThis hidden meaning, therefore, is represented through this artwork, which communicates an impression, as the painting looks more of a sketch, giving the impression of the idea or message they are communicating, more than an artwork that is explicit in its meaning (O’Connor, 2012, pp. 3-5; Gage, 1995).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe image is a well-thought piece, that exhibits some interesting facts, the blend of colors in the image being the most visible. The colors blend very well, and this brings out clearly, the intended impression of the image. The contents of the image fit into Gestalt’s model’s requirements, where using the model, the objects in the image can be viewed as organized and structured. This proves that the image is a well thought and organized piece of artwork.\n\nReferences\n\nAlbers, J. (1963). The interaction of color. New Haven, NY: Yale University Press.\n\nFeisner, E. A.

      "Minority Groups and Their Cultures in Georgia Research Paper\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to research on the different cultures of the minority groups found in Georgia and make a comparison or contrast of their cultures. Georgia, like many states across the U.S., is a multicultural State that comprises many different types of races and ethnicity. This multicultural State has a population of over 10 million people. Although Whites are the majority, they comprise just 61 percent of the total population, while the rest of the population is comprised of minority groups. African-Americans comprise 28 percent of the minority group while the rest of the percentage comprises Hispanics of Asians Americans, Native Hawaiians, and American Indians (Bartley, 1990)\n\nSince the African- Americans comprise the highest number among the minority group, a larger percentage of this group is heavily influenced by the fine and performing arts culture. This culture has heavily influenced the youth, especially those of the African and Hispanic races (Kanell 2009, Peter 1991). Due to this, there are several fine arts centers that bear witness to the influence of art in the State, for instance, the High museum of art, Telfair Museum of Art, among others; moreover, the State has one of the largest orchestras, the Atlanta Symphony orchestra, which majority of the group comprises of African- Americans and Hispanics- Americans.\n\nThe Georgia minority groups have some common themes and cultures in life, for instance, in arts and literature. This can be attributed to the common history of the majority of the minority group who are native Georgian’s and their previous generations had lived in Georgia since independence.\n\nLiterature in Georgia is quite unique as it is influenced greatly by Georgia’s past history and its geographical location in the south of the U.S., whereby there was a lot of racial discrimination that has influenced not only the academic sphere of this State but also the political tendencies. In addition, the American- Indians have influenced the literature culture with their traditions, which they continue to observe to-date. In addition, people also observe drama and film festivals. Due to the film culture, a state film commission was established to ensure that the film industry in Georgia grew steadily and that all the races in Georgia are well represented.\n\nIndian- Americans in Georgia have also held onto their traditional practices which they still practice to date; for instance, they observe their sacrifices and naming ceremonies (Walker 2005, Charles 1968).\n\nDespite the State being a cosmopolitan of many races, English and Spanish are the two languages that are spoken by the people. Furthermore, the state administration has embarked on a policy to ensure that all minority students have access to education, and all graduate in the end.\n\nFrom the above, it can be established that the minority groups have some cultures that they share and others that they do not. For instance, the Hispanics and the African – Americans share Arts and literary culture. In addition, due to their past history, they both have the same political tendencies, whereby they tend to have the same political ideologies (Coleman 1991). On the other hand, the Hispanics and the African- American have different kinds of meals and linguistics. The Hispanics speak Spanish while the Africans – Americans speak English.\n\nIn order to get all the basic facts for this research, I spoke to a number of librarians from different races and cultures who referred me to materials that could be useful to me. In addition, I interviewed several students who also represented different races who were able to point out some places where I could get reliable information (Bullard 2005).\n\nThe best sources of information were books from the State Library and peer-reviewed articles and the internet. This is because the internet provided information and statistics that were very current, and getting it was quite easy. In addition, internet information could be compared with each other within a short span of time. Secondly, books were also reliable as they provided in-depth information which had been researched over a long period of time, thus giving very accurate information.\n\nPeer-reviewed articles were also favorable sources to me as they provided information that had been reviewed by other professionals hence providing information that is more correct and updated, taking into consideration our changing times (Peirce, 1974). But the most important source of information on this research was from the primary sources. Although some of the information varied slightly from one person to another, this information was the most accurate source as the people could directly answer my questions, some of which the secondary sources could not address.\n\nAfter gathering all the information, I synthesized information that touched on the diversity of Georgia and researched more on this. In addition, I analyzed the information that I got from primary sources and relied on information that had a great degree of similarity in a given group or culture while at the same time comparing it with the secondary sources (William 2004, Patricia 1986).\n\nAs a teacher, I expect that my classroom will comprise of different races that have different cultures and races. Such interaction will need tolerance and understanding in dealing with each other’s different beliefs. Thus, as a teacher, I will be in a position to understand their cultures and appreciate them while at the same time teaching students to embrace diversity, respect, and learn each other’s culture.\n\nReference list\n\nBartley, N.

      "Managerial Decision: Leaving New York for Illinois Farm Case Study\n\nCase Description\n\nThere is a business opportunity to purchase 80 acres of prime farmland in Illinois for 80,000 dollars, which can be used to grow corn (Brickley, Smith, & Zimmerman, 2015). With the announcement by the US government to increase the production of corn-based ethanol as a substitute for gasoline, the idea is to sell corn to the refineries and extract a profit from that. According to various sources, the venture is risk-averse, as it is always possible to sell the land later at a profit, once the farmland prices grow. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the potential profitability of the venture.\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\n  * Strengths: Prime farmland would yield large volumes of corn, resulting in higher-than-average harvests.\n  * Weaknesses: Lack of experience in farming, additional expenses for employees, equipment, and preparation of the land for growing corn.\n  * Opportunities: Profits from selling corn to ethanol plants, benefitting from the overall increase in corn demand by 45% in 2020 (Doran, 2018).\n  * Threats: High competition, failure to provide the necessary volumes to break-even, lack of workers to collect corn.\n\nPorter’s Five Forces Analysis\n\nCompetition in the Industry\n\nCompetition in the corn industry in Illinois is high. Corn is one of the region’s prime crops, and there is a multitude of farms that produce it (“Corn,” n.d.). At the same time, the competitors already present at the market have a well-established list of contacts to sell their products to, which is something the new business would have to develop on their own.\n\nPotential of New Entrants to the Industry\n\nThe potential of new entrants to the industry is medium. To produce corn, it is required to buy land and farming equipment, such as tractors, tools, corn collectors, etc. Besides, farming corn would require hiring seasonal workers to plow the field and gather the crops. As illustrated by the case study, buying 80 acres of land in Illinois would require 80,000 dollars, and additional expenses needed to start the farming would estimate to just as much, amounting to a total of 160,000 dollars (Brickley et al., 2015).\n\nPower of Suppliers\n\nThe power of corn suppliers at the moment is medium-weak due to high competition. However, it is estimated to grow as the demand for corn for domestic consumption, and ethanol production would grow. Considering the existing political climate, food production plants and ethanol refineries are more likely to buy the products domestically rather than abroad, further improving the power of suppliers.\n\nPower of Customers\n\nAs it stands, the power of customers is medium-high because the US is the largest corn producer in the world, with access to foreign markets in China and Brazil. However, with the expected increase in corn consumption and the worsening of the relations between the US and China, domestically-produced corn is going to become more valuable, contributing to the diminishing of customer bargaining power (“Corn,” n.d.).\n\nThe Threat of Substitute Products\n\nDue to the iniquitousness of corn, it is considered to be the primary substitute product for many other crops and resources. It is unlikely for corn ever to be replaced in the food department. However, the interest in corn-based ethanol may fade due to economic inefficiency, the discovery of alternative power sources, and oil drilling. Thus, the threat of substitution in the food sector is low, and in the petroleum sector – medium-high.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe idea to purchase land in Illinois for corn has potential. Regardless of the US ethanol project, the overall demand for corn is likely to increase, meaning that the venture will continue to be profitable. However, the facilitation of farming operations would require additional resources besides the 80,000 dollars required to buy the land. Without them, it is unlikely to be able to get the venture going. Therefore, while the idea itself may work, the reasoning provided for it is incomplete.\n\nReferences\n\nBrickley, J. A., Smith, C.

      "War on Drugs and Terror and American Promise Essay\n\nThe war on drugs in the US has been raging for several decades (Frontline). Similarly, the war on terror was proclaimed at the beginning of this century (Brookings). However, the US seems to be losing both of them (Brookings; Foreign Affairs; Stanford). The outcomes of the war on terror include discrimination and violence in America, as well as other parts of the world (Brookings; Corrie 608-610). The results of the war on drugs also involve bloodshed in the US and other countries, including, for example, Mexico, and very little progress in reducing the use of drugs has been made (Frontline). These facts can appear surprising, but one of the potential explanations is that the two wars pursue incorrect targets and goals (Brookings). In particular, their objective may have never been a safer and healthier America.\n\nThe term “war” implies the possibility of victory. However, both wars do not involve battlefields or a specific, concrete enemy (Brookings). As a result, determining their goals may be difficult. However, it is possible to analyze the two wars for potential reasons. For instance, the logical explanation for the war on drugs would consist of a healthier America. However, as pointed out by Kurt Vonnegut, the war on drugs does not involve the ban on alcohol, which is the most dangerous substance (620). Similarly, nicotine, which is extremely unhealthy, is not outlawed. If the war is guided by the idea of improving the well-being of the people, it seems to overlook major issues. While the cause of this blind spot cannot be identified for sure, it should be mentioned that alcohol and nicotine are profitable.\n\nA similar problem can be encountered when analyzing the war on terror. Terrorism is a global issue, and while the US may achieve some outcomes in combating it in one country, it can flourish in another part of the world, endangering the Americans (Foreign Affairs). Furthermore, the tools that have been employed by the war are questionable. Zinn and Arnove highlight the fact that attacking Afghanistan or Iraq in the wake of September 11 made little sense. The majority of the terrorists who attacked the twin towers were from Saudi Arabia, and there was no direct evidence that would suggest that the governments of Afghanistan or Iraq had anything to do with the attack (Zinn and Arnove 603). It appears that the reasons for the major operations of the war on terror might not have been connected to combating terrorism.\n\nMany of the people who lost their people to the tragedy believed that the actions of the government after the attack of September 11 aimed for vengeance (Rodriguez and Rodriguez 603). They also warned that the objective would not bring peace; rather, it would produce more violence. However, other ideas were also voiced. For instance, Rachel Corrie’s letter noted the economic potential of attacking other countries, using subtle puns in Arabic (609). Kurt Vonnegut directly cited the addiction to “fossil fuels” as the reason for the war on terror, which he described as consisting of “violent crimes” (622). Corrie’s letter can help to illustrate those crimes; it is undeniable that the war on terror caused a lot of grief outside of the US. As a result, the people of the US have a reason to doubt that the war on terror is concerned with the safety of the world or even the safety of the American people.\n\nThus, some evidence indicates that the wars on drugs and terror may not be effective specifically because they were not meant to achieve the outcomes that would be expected to be associated with them. If the goal was never the safety or health of the American people, it is not surprising that drugs remain legal during the war on drugs, and violence remains acceptable during the war on terror. The objective which was never set cannot be attained, and the two wars have failed to make America and the world healthier or safer.\n\nThe American Promise\n\nThe American Promise was established in the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Constitution, and it is associated with democracy and equality (Zinn and Arnove 389). However, the journey towards the two values has been difficult, and it appears that it has not been finished yet. A few relatively recent political events can be used to illustrate this point and show that the US needs to remove the barriers to democracy and equality before the country can enjoy them.\n\nSome of the recent instances that are relevant to the topic are the issues associated with George W. Bush. Moore points out that equal opportunity in the US can be thwarted by a particularly famous name and uses the example of George W. Bush who was able to enter Yale and Harvard with rather low scores (Moore 601). This issue directly demonstrates the fact that equal opportunities do not apply to the cases of very powerful people. It is also indicative of corruption, which may directly prevent America from enjoying equality.\n\nThe same political figure can be used to illustrate the problems with the voting system of the US. As pointed out by Zinn and Arnove, George W. Bush was installed as the president despite not winning the elections of 2000, which demonstrates that power can get in the way of democracy (599). Additionally, the authors highlight the fact the voting system in the country has been dominated by two parties. The problems with the representation of varied groups seem to endanger the democracy of the US.\n\nFinally, the war on terror is another example relevant to the topic. Zinn and Arnove point out that while the lack of discrimination was proclaimed at the time, the USA PATRIOT Act targeted people of color (605). Maulik highlights the negative outcomes of September 11, focusing on the interpersonal racism and reporting the violence that Muslim people were subjected to in the aftermaths of the attack (606). Additionally, the author describes the Act as a way to institutionalize the anti-immigrant attitudes, pointing out that it has led to profiling. The fact that inequality and discrimination could flourish under the pretense of state security shows that civil rights in the US may require greater protection.\n\nFurthermore, the anti-war attitudes in the US are noteworthy (International Brotherhood of Teamsters Local 705 605; Lasar 605). The people sharing such views demanded the prevention of the wars associated with the war on terror, but their demands were not satisfied. Naturally, such attitudes never represented 100% of the population (Foreign Policy). However, should be noted that the Americans were not always provided with truthful information (Goodman 611-612). Technically, fact manipulation can be viewed as another approach to preventing people from defending their rights.\n\nThe mentioned issues were present at the beginning of this century. However, few would claim that modern US citizens live in a post-racism world or that the US government is not dominated by specific parties nowadays. It is noteworthy that despite the difficulty in fulfilling the American Promise, the country does not abandon the idea. Some of the issues that may prevent the US from achieving democracy and equality may include corruption, power imbalances, disinformation, and the insufficient representation of different groups in the government. Proclaiming a war on these problems could be the appropriate decision.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBrookings. “Can the War on Terror Be Won? An Article by Philip H.

      "Environmental Ethics: Opposing Sides Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Discussion\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nEnvironmental ethics are principles that describe relationships between people and nature. Although many specialists developed theories regarding this issue throughout history, this subject received particular attention in the mid-twentieth century. It was caused by the negative effect of new technologies and globalization on the environment. However, there are different points of view on this matter. The main goal of this paper is to discuss the problems of environmental ethics, highlighting opposing sides of this multisided issue.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThere are various opinions about what should be considered to be valuable in terms of environmental ethics. Judaism highlights the importance of “maintaining the proper balance which God has built into this world.” (Freundel, n.d., para. 18). This religion prohibits any destruction and promotes the environmental quality of life. However, Christians separate humanity from the planet and neglect their inherent holiness (Dobel, 1977). They undermine people’s superiority over the earth and thus permit the exploitation of nature. According to Nash, the main problem of environmental ethics is that different communities benefit from the denial of values of each other (Nash, 1989). Therefore, it always leads to conflicts of interest.\n\nTherefore, Jewish and Christian philosophies are deeply rooted in environmental ethics. Problems related to ecology cause many debates among these communities. When this issue got great attention in the 1960’, numerous specialists published articles about environmental problems that were based on Biblical and Rabbinic works. One of the most controversial topics was wartime as it is always a period of great need and destruction. This problem was discussed in various Jewish texts that promoted the idea that “destruction is certainly prohibited for anyone” (Freundel, n.d., para. 3). Traditionally, the Judaical religion was very strict regarding the importance of nature. However, the Bible offers another concept that is more lenient. The Christian scriptures forbid “to destroy, without purpose, any object from which someone might derive pleasure” (Freundel, n.d., para. 2). Therefore, the idea of the domination of people over nature stems from Christianity.\n\nAnother significant issue associating with environmental ethics is the distribution of responsibilities for reducing harmful emissions. Various ecologists raise the question of whether countries that produce greenhouse gas emissions have to compensate other countries on which they have a negative impact (Palmer, 2004). In fact, responsibilities for climate change rest on the shoulders of many countries. However, some contribute much more than others. However, there is no strong legal foundation that allows punishing anyone who violates the principles of ecology. Historical responsibilities are often used to justify such violations (Shue, 1999). Environmental restrictions that are imposed on industries that produce highly dangerous emissions hinder their development. It is necessary to achieve equal distribution of costs for protecting the environment as it has a direct impact on climate change (Torralba, Seguro, & Thomas, 2014). There is a negative correlation between the quality of the environment and income inequality. Wealthy countries bear a heavier burden as they have to contribute much more to restore ecological balance than less prosperous countries. Therefore, it is necessary to reduce such inequalities to achieve environmental stability.\n\nConclusion\n\nEnvironmental ethics cover various aspects related to international ecological problems. There are several serious questions on which different countries and communities cannot reach an agreement. Such contradictions are deeply rooted in historical and cultural backgrounds. Therefore, it is highly necessary to conduct analytical research aimed at resolving controversy and maintaining environmental safety.\n\nReferences\n\nDobel, J.P. (1977).

      "Kuwaiti Food Industry and Its Development Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe Kuwait food and beverages industry has gained much attention in the recent past. The increasing population, better income, and changing demographics are some of the forces supporting this industry. The industry has been identified as one of the best performing in the country. The report will discuss the historic development, performance, and future performance of the Kuwaiti food industry. This paper offers adequate recommendations that can be used by the Kuwaiti government to support the performance of the food industry. The discussion will also present facts to support the importance of the industry on the country’s economy.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe present report investigates the current performance and future prospects of the Kuwaiti food industry. The main aim of the report is to show that the food industry of Kuwait has the potential to drive the country’s economy and become the leading source of income (Oxford Business Group, 2014). Another goal is to analyze the implications of the industry on the country’s economy. In particular, the report attempts to answer the following questions:\n\n  * How has the food industry developed in Kuwait?\n  * Can the Kuwaiti government use the food industry as a main income for the country?\n  * How has the food industry been affecting the Kuwaiti Economy?\n\nThe report is organized as follows. First, the background section discusses the current position of the Kuwaiti food industry and the reasons why it has become one of the promising sources of income. Then, the analysis section presents the data from three sources regarding several aspects of the topic at hand, such as the positive performance of the food industry in Kuwait (Oxford Business Group, 2014). The report ends with conclusions from the analysis and goes further to present meaningful recommendations that can be used to support the industry’s future performance.\n\nBackground\n\nKuwait is one of the fastest growing economies in the region. This kind of growth is attributable to the existing political frameworks, business policies, and presence of powerful industries such as the oil sector. The conducive environment, business opportunities, and leadership experienced in Kuwait have attracted many tourists and foreigners from different parts of the world. Consequently, the hospitality and food industries have developed in such a way that they support this development. Being part of the retail sector in the country, the food industry has been projected to grow by 8 percent within the next few years. Chances are extremely high that the performance of the industry will outperform those of different Western economies (Oxford Business Group, 2014). The changing demographics and growth in income are some of the forces driving this industry. The industry is expected to become an opportunity for many investors in the country. Businesspeople, investors, and policymakers will be interested in the targeted findings in order to make adequate investment decisions.\n\nHistorical Context\n\nThroughout the last half of the 20 th century, more people migrated from one region to another. These movements catalyzed the wave of globalization. New ideas in business have emerged in different parts of the world. The Middle East has benefited from solid policies and political institutions that have continued to support international business practices. One of the industries that have benefited significantly from these changes is the food sector. Within the past 10 years, Kuwait has recorded a positive economic growth. More people have been getting better salaries than ever before. These developments have supported the food sector.\n\nThe Importance of the Kuwaiti Food Industry\n\nThe Kuwaiti beverage and food market is set for continuous growth in the next few years. This growth will increase the country’s GDP directly and indirectly. For instance, the industry is expected to contribute a lot to the government’s taxes and incomes (Alpen Capital, 2017). The industry is also expected to attract more tourists thereby expanding the sector. The industry will also push up trade operations and attract a large number of suppliers. These new changes will drive new developments throughout the supply chain process.\n\nAnalysis\n\nHow the Food Industry Developed in Kuwait\n\nThe Kuwaiti food industry is one of fastest growing sectors in the region. The industry started to grow around two decades ago. Towards the end of the 20 th century, the number of immigrants began to increase steadily in the country. From 2009 to 2014, the country’s annual production averaged 7.7 percent (Oxford Business Group, 2014). This was equivalent to over 570,000 metric tons. The major sources of food materials included vegetables, cereals, and milk. During the same period, food consumption rose steadily to around 9.4 percent. The increasing number of foreigners has led to increased spending. Currently, over 2 million foreigners and tourists spend around 3.5 billion US dollars at restaurants.\n\nFigure 1: The Kuwaiti food landscape. Source: (Alpen Capital, 2017, p. 18).\n\nThe presented figure shows how consumption in the country has surpassed production. The consumption rate has increased steadily from the year 2009 and 2014. It is also notable that the level of food production has been around 0.4 and 0.57 million MT during the same period (Altradius, 2017).\n\nUsing the Food Industry as a Main Source of Income in Kuwait\n\nThe Kuwaiti food industry has been promising within the past few years. The consumption of food materials has surpassed the rate of production. The country is also one of the leading importers of a wide range of food materials across the region. The government can support domestic production in order to promote performance. The tourism industry has led to increased number of people in the country willing to purchase food materials in the country. The retailing sector (including the food segment) has been growing at an average rate of around 16 percent (Altradius, 2017). The country’s population is also growing fast. More restaurants are expected to emerge within the next five years. The government can identify the right measures to support the industry and eventually make it a major source of income.\n\nFigure 2: Kuwaiti industries performance.\n\nThe above figure indicates clearly that the food industry is one of the best (fair) sectors in the country. This is the case because the industry is characterized by minimum credit risk (Alpen Capital, 2017). The business performance in the sector is average. The government has the potential to support the industry because it is projected to grow positively within the next few years. Consequently, the industry will support the country’s income and eventually drive economic performance.\n\nHow the Food Industry is affecting the Kuwaiti Economy\n\nAccording to the Oxford Business Group (2014), the food industry of Kuwait is supporting economic development. This is the case because the sector has been growing very fast. This development will be fueled by a number of forces such as increasing incomes and the positive performance of the tourism sector. The economic and political attributes in the country are attracting more investors and foreigners. The number of people currently spending on healthy Kuwaiti foods is on the rise. For instance, tourists and foreigners have been observed to contribute over 3.5 billion dollars annually to the industry. Through effective taxation systems, the government has been able to maximize its incomes.\n\nThe industry presents numerous opportunities that can sustain economic performance indirectly (“ Kuwait the worlds’ food capital by 2030 ,” 2017). For instance, the industry is attracting more people thereby supporting the tourism, communication, transportation, and oil industries. The industry is associated with the increasing number of malls in the country. More individuals have taken up new roles such as supply chain in order to support the industry. Global trade has emerged due to the nature of the industry.\n\nFigure 3: Change in food consumption vis-à-vis population and GDP. Source: (Alpen Capital, 2017, p. 69).\n\nThis graph shows conclusively that the level of food consumption is on the rise. This development will promote a number of economic drivers such as tourism and supply chain (Oxford Business Group, 2014). More people will be willing to consume a wide range of food materials and eventually support the nation’s economic development.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nIn conclusion, this analysis shows conclusively that Kuwait stands a chance to benefit from the rapidly growing food industry. With proper policies and incentives, the industry is a driving factor for other sectors such as transport, oil, and tourism (Oxford Business Group, 2014). Such policies will make it easier for the country to expand its GDP and become an economic powerhouse in the region.\n\nThe report recommends the following:\n\n  * The government should identify new strategies to strengthen the industry.\n  * Kuwait should implement powerful policies to create the best environment for the food sector.\n  * Attracting more foreign investors will become a win-win situation for the sector.\n\nREFERENCES\n\nAlpen Capital.

      "Oriental and Western Ceramics Essay\n\nThe paper at hand is aimed at comparing and contrasting two artifacts. They are two porcelain vases created in 18-19 th century. Whatever paradoxical it might seem, the subjects that belong to the same time period have completely different designs. It is assumed that this phenomenon can be explained by the fact that their designs refer to different ceramic traditions: the Orient ceramic school and the Western ceramics. It is presumed that these traditions have many distinguishing features that make them rather different than alike.\n\nThe first subject is a painted porcelain vase that dates back to the 19 th century. Historians cannot indicate the particular artist who created its design, though it is currently known that the vase was produced in either Guangdong or Canton province in the South of China.\n\nThe vase is a representative of the Oriental Ceramic school. It is designed in a classic Chinese style that is famous for its simple and conservative shapes (Leidy 2015). The vase is rather big and massive; in the meantime its shape is stream-line. In other words, no curved line or flection contradicts the harmony of the composition. Another distinguishing feature of this style is the abundance of minor details in the painted pattern. Thus, it is takes one long to distinguish all the minor elements of the surface painting.\n\nSuch vases perform few functions. Instead, people would purchase them for the purpose of decorating their houses. Chinese porcelain has always been a costly ware so it would serve to be a luxurious interior design item. Such vases are still rather expensive; nevertheless, they are considered to be an exquisite element of décor (Pierson 2009).\n\nThe vase is made of the high-quality Chinese porcelain. Its surface is covered with glazed enamels. It has a colorful design, though the general color palette is rather restrained. A warm color palette is evidently prevailing. The paintings that cover the vase illustrate the scenes from the everyday life of the relevant period. The scenes are depicted in details; looking at them, one might have an impression of studying a masterpiece in an art gallery. On the one side, there is a picture of a feast: there is a long table full of food and drinks, and people entertaining themselves. On the other side, there is a picture of a general near the city wall.\n\nThe second subject is the copy of the Portland Vase made by Josiah Wedgwood at the end of the 18 th century. Josiah Wedgwood was a famous English potter who has performed significant contribution to the development of pottery industrialization in Great Britain. His other famous works are Jasperware “Horse Frightened by a Lion” and the black vase on the stand. Wedgwood was not the first one to copy the Portland Vase. Meanwhile, history has shown that his attempt turned out to be the most successful.\n\nThe vase is designed in the classic Roman style. In fact, the Portland Vase appeared in Rome between the first and the second AD. Initially, they were made of cameo glass, and their surface was covered with the depiction of some mythological scenes (Whitehouse 2003). These depictions are still the matter of debate in the expert community.\n\nThe Portland Vase has no functional purpose – it was used as the decoration element of the interior. As well as the first vase, this element of décor refers to the luxury type.\n\nThe vase is designed in a blue color palette. Cold tones are dominating over the warm pallet. The painting that covers the vase illustrates white silhouettes that color of which contrast with the background. Presumably, it is the mythological characters depicted. Some scholars believe that one of the silhouettes is the figure of the ancient God of Love, Cupid (Whitehouse 2003). Unlike the illustration on the first vase, this painting is not detailed – the depicted objects have fuzzy outlines.\n\nThe vases belong to the relatively similar historical periods, but their visual concepts have a lot of differences. The design of the oriental vase contains more colors that do not contrast one with another, contrary to the white-blue color palette in the second vase. In addition, the painting on the western vase is less detailed than the carefully depicted illustrations on the oriental vase. The shape of the western vase is sophisticated while that of the oriental vase is simple and unpretentious.\n\nAs a result, the oriental ceramic is more elaborate in its design – its surface paintings can compete with classic oil paintings in terms of details and tones. In the meantime, it is simpler in its shapes than the western style.\n\nThe analysis of the two vases has shown that these items have more differences than similarities notwithstanding the fact that they belong to the similar epoch. Thus, the oriental ceramic tradition showed detailed surface painting and subdued color tones. The western ceramic school, on the contrary, showed vague surface illustrations and contrasting palette. In addition, the Western Vase has a more complicated shape whereas that of the Orient Vase is streamline and simple.\n\nReference List\n\nLeidy, DP 2015, How to Read Chinese Ceramics , Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, New York.\n\nPierson, S 2009, Chinese Ceramics , Victoria and Albert Museum, London.\n\nWhitehouse, D 2003, Roman Glass in the Corning Museum of Glass , Hudson Hills, New York, New York.\n",
      "Criticism and Discussion in Science Evolution Essay\n\nScience has always been the main cognition tool of humanity as it promoted the acquisition of new knowledge and contributed to the further evolution of thought. The great significance of the given phenomenon is also proved by the fact that people have always been trying to determine the frames that limit the further evolution of scientific thought and to obtain pure knowledge to guarantee the further progress.\n\nThe given approach to science gave rise to a number of concerns related to the objectivity of the obtained ideas and their possible usage. This issue became one of the main questions of science that promoted the appearance of numerous cogitations about the nature of science, its objectivity, and subjectivity.\n\nBesides, Longino assumes that the term objectivity is rather ambivalent and could be applied to theories, beliefs, etc. (Longino, 1990, p. 64). However, if to speak about science, there are numerous factors that have an effect on the concept and introduce the necessity of the precise investigation of any idea to guarantee at least its relative objectivity. Longing also states that it goes along with subjectivity and individualism that result from human nature.\n\nAny scientist is impacted by his/her personal beliefs and tries to contribute to the development of science-based on his/her own ideas that might be subjective. For this reason. Knowledge benefits from the existence of numerous points of view on the same question, while cooperation and consensus are also vital.\n\nLonginos ideas about the objectivity of science are taken up by Beatty and Moore in their article. Should we Aim for Consensus? They agree that any scientific thought or idea is rather subjective and results from the cogitations of a person who has his/her own preferences. That is why the question of whether consensus is needed or not appears. The authors state that in the case of science, the lack of consensus might result in the creation of a premature or mistaken idea (Beatty & Moore, 2012, p. 199), impacting the further progress and evolution of scientific thought. Yet, it is still vital for a scientist to be able to provide his/her ideas for the opponents to analyze them.\n\nIf to compare Longino and Beatty and Moores perspectives on science, it is possible to state the similarity of the approach to the ideas of objectivity and criticism. It follows from their cogitations that science benefits from vigorous discussions related to a certain concept or idea. In other words, the objectivity of a certain assumption is guaranteed by the existence of numerous points of view on the same question.\n\nFurthermore, the consensus could be established due to the long-term consideration of the doubtful question. That is why its necessity becomes obvious as it guarantees the further evolution of scientific thought. Beatty and Moore also investigate this idea in terms of the authority of a certain scientist. They tend to prove the idea that consensus and authority in science are closely interrelated (Beatty & Moore, 2012, p. 200).\n\nIn conclusion, the question of the objectivity has always been an ongoing issue for science. Being sure of the necessity of the existence of various points of view on the same idea, both Longino and Beatty and Moore recognize the great role criticism and discussion play in the evolution of science. That is why their works are devoted to similar issues and are closely interrelated.\n",
      "Dubai Airports Company’s Innovation Strategies Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Company Description and Market Analysis\n 2. Innovation Policies and Strategies\n 3. Recommendation\n 4. References\n 5. Appendix\n\nCompany Description and Market Analysis\n\nDubai Airports Company is classified as a publicly owned enterprise since it is managed by the Government of Dubai. The company consists of the two major international airports: The Dubai International Airport (DXB) located in Al Garhoud district and the Dubai World Central (DWC), otherwise known as Al Maktoum International Airport.\n\nAccording to the Oxford Economics statistics, aviation supplied “over 416 thousand jobs and contributed over $26.7 billion to Dubai’s economy” ( H.H. Sheikh Ahmed Bin Saeed Al Maktoum: Powering the Engines of Prosperity , 2015). Merely Dubai International Airports have provided three thousand four hundred employees a year with the job that are connected with the various spheres of the services provided by the company ( Dubai International Airport , 2016).\n\nHence, the areas of the marketplace that are covered by Dubai International Airports include a safe and world-class airport terminal, high-tech facilities and operations, diverse products and services in its retailers including Dubai duty free shops and diners, three hotels, as well as a number of business centres; catering the commercial flights; managing aircraft hangars; cargo services, etc.\n\nThe larger of the two airports is The Dubai International Airport (DXB), there are three airport terminals namely Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and Terminal 3 ( Who We Are: Dubai Airports , 2016). In particular, only two of the terminals are equipped to manage the international flights – the fact that restricts the airport potential. However, for The Dubai World Central (DWC), there are a lot of innovations that can improve the airport’s status in the future.\n\nInnovation Policies and Strategies\n\nIn the recent years, Dubai Airports Company was developing the strategies of how to turn the Al Maktoum International Airport at Dubai World Central, which is now second largest in the city into one of the biggest airports in the world. The details of the initiative were presented to the public in 2014 as Dubai Airports Company revealed the plan of investing $32 billion in introducing the innovations and expanding the structure of Dubai World Central (DWC) within the Dubai Airports Strategic Plan 2020 ( Dubai unveils expansion plans for ‘world’s biggest airport project’ , 2014).\n\nIn terms of developing the innovations for The Dubai International Airport (DXB), the company is intended to update and improve the passenger screening and passenger control technologies. The conceptual innovations will include the already implemented E-gate counters at Passport Control that will be improved for quicker immigration processing for inbound air passengers. In addition, the latest technologies of the integrated pre-screening will be implemented at all of the three DXB terminals, and it will involve retinal scanning and recognition. Such step is a part of the innovations in the sphere of safety policies, and it is going not only to improve the security systems of the airport and the safety of the passengers but also to enhance the security of the community in general.\n\nAnother recently introduced innovation in both of the airports was the Smart CIS. This mechanism helps to preserve the privacy of the inspection by using technological scanning and avoiding opening the passengers’ baggage. Such technology relates to the strategic policy of being customer-friendly and respecting the private space of the passengers, which will make their travelling less stressful.\n\nSince the UAE were entitled to be the host of the World Expo 2020, there is a lot of pressure on the aviation industry. As Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum stated in his interview “the aim is to attract 25 million visitors, with 17 million of those coming from overseas” ( Interview: Ahmed bin Saeed Al Maktoum , 2015, para. 2). Therefore, one of the challenges for the airports is that the large passenger flow creates a great demand for the different services, the capacity of catering the flights, and improvement of the security measures. For the details of the visitor expectations in Dubai Airports, see Figure 1 of the Appendix. Hence, for those reasons, the Dubai Airports Strategic Plan 2020 was developed.\n\nConsidering the passenger demand forecasts for the next years, one of the strategic initiatives for the Dubai Airports is the expansion of the terminals. Dubai World Central (DWC) and Dubai International (DXB) will be modified to fit the capacity of the 90 million passengers and 675,000 square meters of the terminals floor space by the year 2018 ( Strategic Plan 2020 , 2016). For the detailed plan of DXB’s Terminal 2 expansion, see the Figure 2 of the appendix.\n\nRecommendation\n\nThe innovative policy for building the expansions is that the construction relies on the passenger forecasts, and yet it is designed to make as small as possible impact on the environment. The duration of the project allows the managers of the project to conduct sustainable construction and be user-oriented at the same time. One of the possible suggestion is to introduce some flexible elements to the strategic plan. For instance, the guideline regarding some of the building sites are already planned now, but it would be reasonable to monitor the passenger forecasts constantly and be able to implement some changes for the smaller details of the project.\n\nIt would be a substantial step for managing some of the minor risks. Although the greater perspective of the Dubai Airports strategic plan cannot and should not be largely modified, it would be quite useful to have some room for adapting the minor details concerning the later stages of the project. It is also important to underline the fact that it would help to reduce the risks associated with the introduction of any new or innovative policies or technologies at the airports since it would be possible to have some more testing ground for the experimental ideas or new services.\n\nAlso, considering the differences in the scales of The Dubai World Central (DWC) and Dubai International (DXB), there are a lot of innovations that can improve the overall perception of the former. One of the crucial aspects is its size, which becomes more important since the demand for the airport capacity will be growing by 2020. Therefore, it would be a useful consideration to expand the Dubai World Central (DWC) as well because it would add up to the consistent development of the company’s structure and the gradual and even manner of introducing innovations.\n\nReferences\n\nDubai International Airport (BXM) .

      "Dubai Islamic Bank from Global Business Perspective Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis international perspective on business reports focuses on Dubai Islamic Bank. Dubai Islamic Bank (DIB) was established in 1975. Its vision is “To be the most progressive Islamic Financial Institution in the World” with the mission statement “To maintain and improve our position as the world’s leading Islamic bank through unsurpassed customer service, innovation, growth, and consistent employee engagement” (Dubai Islamic Bank, n.d, p. 1).\n\nServices\n\nThe Bank offers Islamic Financial Services, including online banking services. Some of these products and services are:\n\n  * Personal Banking;\n  * Johara Ladies;\n  * Wealth Management;\n  * Business Banking;\n  * Corporate Banking;\n  * Treasury.\n\nOver the years, the bank has grown, and it now has branches spread across various locations globally.\n\n  * Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan, Bosnia, and Turkey.\n  * Planned branches – other parts of the Far East, Middle East, East Africa, and the Indian subcontinent (World Finance, n.d).\n\nDubai Islamic Bank also boasts of another successful subsidiary referred to as Deyaar for real estate development. Deyaar is now found in “Lebanon, Kazakhstan, Turkey, United Kingdom, and the United States with impending forays into Saudi Arabia, Qatar, and India” (Dubai Islamic Bank, n.d, p. 1).\n\nDubai Islamic Bank Main Financial Data during the Last Three Fiscal Years.\n\nItems          2015        2014        2013      \n               AED’ 000    AED’ 000    AED’ 000  \nCapital        22,793,529  17,706,084  16,342,189\nTotal Revenue  7,545,940   6,230,527   5,288,470 \nNet Profit     3,839,260   2,803,726   1,718,029 \n\n\nWhy DIB Engaged in International Investment\n\nFor the Bank, the international investment offers opportunities for growth and expansion. Globally, the Islamic finance industry is worth about $3 trillion (World Finance, n.d). Besides, Islamic finance is fast gaining global acceptance (World Finance, n.d).\n\nFurther, Dubai Islamic Bank is keen to capitalize on its four-decade-strong position in the industry. The Bank is seen as a school of Islamic banking and finance and innovator and a modern face of the industry (World Finance, n.d).\n\nHow DIB gained Competitive Advantage Using Porter Five Competitive Forces\n\nSupplier Power\n\nIn the banking industry, labor, IT, and deposit supplies have the power drive costs of operations, but DIT is well-capitalized to manage such threats. Thus, supplier power is limited and as a result, the Bank can gain a competitive edge over its peers (Porter, 1998).\n\nBuyer Power\n\nCustomers of DIB may find it expensive to switch to other financial institutions. DIB handles a significant number of customers and, thus, buyer power is reduced given the nature of Islamic banking and Sharia requirements.\n\nCompetitive Rivalry\n\nThe Bank has positioned itself as the leading Islamic financial institution, an alternative to conventional banks and loan sharks. It is imperative to recognize that competitors are increasing, and they offer equally attractive products and services. In this regard, Islamic banking is not unique to DIB. Hence, other Islamic banks have emerged to compete with DIB.\n\nThreat of Substitution\n\nCustomers can opt not to use banking services – keep cash at home. This traditional form of keeping money is still real while other customers may use conventional banks and informal financial institutions. While the threat of substitutes is real to any bank, customers view DIB as a school of Islamic banking and finance (World Finance, n.d).\n\nThe threat of New Entry\n\nTime and cost of entry are expensive for potential new entrants in the banking industry. Besides, Islamic banking requires specialized knowledge. Despite all these, new technologies make it easier for ‘fintech’ to enter the industry by avoiding stiff regulations and massive capital required (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2015). In the near future, fintech firms will present new threats to established institutions, including DIB.\n\nWhy DIB should Perform Analysis of External Environmental Factors for Entry in a Foreign Market\n\nInternational operations significantly differ with practices in the domestic markets. Thus, the Bank should assess various operational parameters to determine its competitive edge.\n\nCompetitive\n\nDIB should perform external environment analysis to determine any market leader in Islamic banking, identify the presence of a pacesetter, innovator, and sharia-compliant bank. In addition, Islamic banking is relatively new in the global market and, thus, DIB should note years of experience in the industry against DIB’s 40 years. This process will also assist the company to determine capital requirements.\n\nEconomic\n\nDIB should assess the growth of sharia-compliant banking and the global capital of the Islamic economy in specific countries while evaluating the robustness of emerging economies. In addition, the Bank can collect information on the rising number of middle-class seeking banking services and investment opportunities.\n\nSocioeconomic\n\nSome factors related to socioeconomic issues, such as “tourism, hospitality, transportation, trade and infrastructure, fashion and clothing, cosmetics and personal care, pharmaceuticals, and media and recreation” (World Finance, n.d, p. 1) have improved uptake of banking services. The presence of these indicators shows favorable economic conditions for foreign investment. Besides, the Bank should also evaluate the relevance of these factors to establish a major socio-economic hub and determine saving and investment practices in the country.\n\nFinancial\n\nDIB should research if the 2008 financial crisis affected Islamic financial banking in respective countries. It should also gather data on increased private and public investments and focus on innovation in the sector, for example, the use of technologies and the development of new services and products.\n\nLegal\n\nDIB should assess the development of the necessary legal and regulatory framework across all financial sectors from banking, capital markets, and insurance to support Islamic banking in the targeted countries. Besides, it will also collect facts on legal complications in company registration processes and determine the extent of corruption across various levels of government – the judiciary and other law enforcement agencies.\n\nTechnologies\n\nModern banking is run technologies, and DIB should determine its position on technology and innovation for marketing positioning. It should also evaluate the disruptive effects of fintech in such countries and understand user or customer perception of technology (The Economist Intelligence Unit, 2015).\n\nPhysical\n\nDIB should determine if the country is physically located as a financial hub in the region (as the case of Dubai) for competitive advantage and assess if the geographical position support business\n\nPolitical\n\nIt should also assess the political stability of an attractive investment destination. Generally, relatively stable countries are favored for investment. At the same time, DIB should evaluate any emerging threats of terrorism and avoid the so-called ‘soft target’ locations.\n\nLabor\n\nThe bank should ensure that there is a sufficient supply of qualified human capital and gather facts on labor costs, costs of recruitment, and training. It is also imperative to understand if demographic shifts in the labor markets, such as younger and old employees, would affect operations. The Bank will also conduct analyses to identify the relevance of labor regulations and actions of trade unions and associations.\n\nSociocultural\n\nSociocultural factors will assist the DIB to determine if products will meet sociocultural factors of potential customers, including cultural sensitivity to money, promotions, religion, and language differences. Hence, DIB should focus on countries with a significant number of Muslims\n\nConclusion\n\nInternational business practices differ from domestic practices, but Islamic banking practices appear to be universal. Nevertheless, country-specific factors are critical areas for consideration. Islamic banking is growing rapidly, especially in emerging economies. It presents an opportunity for growth and expansion for DIB. DIB has significant industry expertise and capital to support foreign investments.\n\nThese factors and others give DIB a competitive edge over the competition. As such, it should only focus on external environments that support its spread in the following countries: the Middle East, Asia, and East Africa. In addition, the Bank should ensure that most external environmental factors are favorable to foreign market entry and, therefore, legal, labor, economic, competitiveness, political, sociocultural, and others are important for consideration.\n\nRecommendations\n\n  * DIB should continue to strengthen the balance sheet, enhance capitalization, ensure robust liquidity and improving asset quality to support the expansion.\n  * DIB should exploit robust platforms such as capital advantage to take advantage of the greatly improved and positive market conditions and trends globally.\n  * Enter with an individually tailored strategy for each country.\n  * The bank should utilize its leadership position to advance Islamic financial banking globally.\n  * External environment conditions remain critical points of consideration for DIB.\n      + Consider supportive cultures and economies.\n      + Regulatory and legal frameworks are critical points of assessment for the bank.\n      + The bank needs qualified human capital to run successful Islamic financial services.\n      + Customize products to meet the needs of the local customers – innovation is the center of banking.\n      + Utilize the latest technology and enhanced customer service in foreign markets.\n\nReferences\n\nDubai Islamic Bank.

      "Observation: Early Childhood Classroom Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Description of Classroom Composition\n 2. Types of Activities\n 3. Types of Instructional Strategies\n 4. Behavior Management Strategies\n 5. Overall Level of Engagement, Type of Teacher Talk\n 6. Overall Impressions\n\nDescription of Classroom Composition\n\nThe classroom observation was carried out in a kindergarten class of the Haring Center (located on the campus of University of Washington (Seattle, WA)). The classroom has an observation booth with a small window that enables researchers, educators or even parents observe the activities without attracting learners’ attention. The classroom walls are covered with pictures, numbers, letters, and various objects, which creates a positive learning environment. There is a schedule on the board where all classes are listed. The classroom has several areas including students’ and teachers’ desks, closets for tools and a play area.\n\nTypes of Activities\n\nDuring the observation, the children were engaged in several activities. The learners were divided into small groups (with a teacher in each group) during the larger part of the class. The activities included playing some toys, playing with plasticine, and listening to the teacher playing the guitar (in a playground outside the classroom). The learners played with cars and pet toys communicating with each other acting as the toy they had. Several girls were playing with plasticine making some objects while the teacher helped them use particular colors, make some shapes, use their rolling pins, and knives. The learners, who listened to the teacher playing the guitar, seemed very engaged as they listened very carefully (with smiles on their faces) though they did not dance or sing.\n\nTypes of Instructional Strategies\n\nCoach modeling and cooperative learning were major instructional strategies used during the class. Teachers were sitting next to the learners engaging them in conversations through storytelling. They also managed to provide assistance and materials needed to complete tasks. The coach modeling strategy involved the teacher asking some questions aimed at encouraging students’ self-reflection. For instance, when the girls were playing with plasticine, the teacher asked some questions that helped the learners choose the objects to make. As for cooperative learning, the teacher and students were building a castle (using Lego blocks). The learners modeled strategies used by the teacher to build the castle.\n\nBehavior Management Strategies\n\nThere were direct instructions. For instance, a girl wanted to come to me, but a teacher followed her and said, “Go back to the classroom.” Another child tried to put various things into his mouth, but the teacher always told him not to do that and explained that the objects were not for eating. The teachers also used an efficient strategy to draw students’ attention when the class was over by switching the light several times. The teacher asked the students (several times) to clean up.\n\nOverall Level of Engagement, Type of Teacher Talk\n\nThe level of engagement was high. Students eagerly participated in all the activities. For instance, the teacher in the group of learners playing with toys helped the students to choose toys and the topic for the conversation. She also encouraged a boy and a girl to talk as they seemed to prefer playing on their own. The activity lasted for 12 minutes, and the teacher told the students to put the toys in their places and go to listen to some music. Everybody managed to do that quickly and almost without any assistance. It is possible to note that there was almost a balance between the praise (and encouragement) and the instruction. The teachers were speaking loud enough to be heard but with kindness and encouragement.\n\nOverall Impressions\n\nFirst, I would like to note that the use of activity-based instruction is an effective way to teach the necessary skills. I was impressed by the way teachers used instructions as they were firm but kind at the same time. There was a great level of collaboration between the teachers and learners due to the teachers’ use of coaching and cooperative learning. They did not simply told students how to complete some tasks but encouraged the learners’ reflection. I believe the program is effective as children enhance various skills. I would also like to teach in this program as I would refine my skills in instructing and encouraging learners.\n",
      "Community Policing, Its Success and Failure Factors Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Increasing the success chances of this innovation\n 3. Factors that might increase the chances of failure\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nCommunity policing is the concept of working together between the police and communities. As Jarvenpaa and Majchrzak (2010) note, it is a new concept within the law enforcement department that seeks to incorporate communities into the mainstream policing services. As an innovative concept, community policing aims at reinventing the police force to be more people conscious in going about their work. As the society continues to integrate, the police force is no longer going to remain exclusive guardians to law and order. In essence, this concept brings all members of the society to partake of their oversight roles as their own keeper.\n\nAccording to Jordan (2000), community policing embodies the society and its members as active players in combating crime to secure their neighbourhoods. Usually, the police officers in communities may not necessarily be members of those localities, the concept of community policing injects into the system people with hands on experience of the concerns of the immediate community. Generally, systems that nurture community policing ensure a more enhanced security structure thus rendering the safety of communities, which is usually the prime focus of police force.\n\nIncreasing the success chances of this innovation\n\nCommunity policing as a concept has been successful in many areas; however, where the concept faces challenges, several options are available to increase the chances of its success. For community policing to be successful, it must seek to create stronger ties between the police and the community (Huq, Schulhofer & Tyler, 2011). Without stronger partnerships between these two forces, the concept faces systems failure.\n\nMoreover, before this concept becomes a necessity, the community itself must first identify their needs, threats, concerns, and challenges that make it necessary to warrant community policing. In addition, making community policing to have its ideal impact in the communities, there has to be a robust channels for crime control and prevention. Besides, there has to be emphasis in making the communities recognise that their active role in making this concept a success is supreme. Finally, the police force must play their part in recognising that their services in securing safer neighbourhoods is a requisite; they have to reach out to individuals who are ready to assist in this programme (Jarvenpaa & Majchrzak, 2010).\n\nThere is a great need to bring awareness to various groups of members of the community, and the pivotal role of the police structure may need to undergo certain changes to make community policing attainable. Guaranteeing safer neighbourhoods is usually the preserve of community policing programmes. Therefore, communities and the police service have both opportunities and challenges from which they might learn and grow.\n\nFactors that might increase the chances of failure\n\nAccording to Jarvenpaa and Majchrzak (2010), successful community policing demand great levels of trust, usually, between the police and the community. Where there is inadequate or no trust, the concept is headed for systems failure. Trust as a value has the capacity to underline and bond the various components of the police- community partnership that makes this concept a success.\n\nOther challenges that might impede the process of community policing entails lack of corporation from various groups, especially a community’s tendency in protecting the criminals. Too often, community policing has endeared the police officers to work in cahoots with the criminals, hence leading to a systems failure (Jordan, 2000). Related challenges often manifest themselves either within the police service unit or within the community, hence increasing the chances of failure.\n\nConclusion\n\nCommunity policing is a successful and innovative law enforcement concept that has a working motif for both the police force and the community. For this concept to be factual and meaningful, the communities for which it is intended must first identify their emergent needs and concerns that this endeavour must meet and solve. On the other hand, community policing may prove a very difficult task especially when faced with numerous systems failure.\n\nReferences\n\nHuq, A., Schulhofer, S., & Tyler, T. (2011).

      "Multicultural Teamwork Approaches Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Group work description\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the context of the modern world, there is a need to let people of different cultures collaborate and create things together. Becoming more conscious of our likenesses, accompanied by cultural alterations, should never split us (Browaeys & Price 2008). Through joint interests, we can find out how to render the differences into similarities. Therefore, the variance stops being a block to efficiency.\n\nIn proficient multicultural teamwork, the partakers must have an understanding of the shared determination. Nonetheless, they must realise that the diverse cultural cohorts may have divergent philosophies of how the frontrunners are selected and about how struggles and discrepancies should be coped with (Thomas & Peterson 2014).\n\nMulticultural teamwork entails a strategy, tolerance, and willpower to challenge the longstanding behaviours in novel ways by partnering with those who are typically not participating in the teamwork. The multicultural alliance will be operative if the individuals overcome the diversity to encourage an integrated determination. The teamwork may appear jagged in the beginning because of dissimilar aptitudes and knowledge. Nevertheless, if the accent is on the shared objective, common conclusion, and distinct team roles, the groups involved are going to achieve their goal.\n\nGroup work description\n\nCollaborating on this project was a great experience. My groupmates and I did a presentation together after watching the movie. To collaborate efficiently, we decided to split the roles. Therefore, two of us were working on the visual presentation while the other two members of the team examined the required resources.\n\nThis was done to provide the team with the essential elements of the presentation in a shorter period and show an adequate level of collaboration. We decided not to point out a leader but elaborated our presentation in a rather democratic approach where every member of the team could contribute to the overall success. Another indication of great teamwork is the fact that we peacefully (but rather enthusiastically) discussed the presentation and shared our thoughts to create an outline of the future presentation. We were all able to listen to each other and incorporate the best ideas into practice.\n\nI believe that the distribution of the roles was smart, and all the team members showed interest in completing the project. Another important part of our teamwork is that three Nigerian students and one Indian student were able to collaborate efficiently while not paying attention to the major cultural differences and rather converting them into the accommodating assets. We worked in a friendly, stress-free atmosphere, were capable of making reasonable decisions, and presented our work on time.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs our populace becomes further ethnically assorted, some social groups are going through more difficulties. If we find a way to comprehend and value the beliefs of others and perceive each other as fellow students with analogous interests instead of rivals, we will be more conferred in the clue of paying more attention to each other. Looking out for others bonds us not only in being multicultural students but also in resolving the problems that are typical of the community we live in.\n\nMulticultural teamwork can shape cooperative power to assist in making things better, and endorse the agreement that it is imperative to do so. This project presented us with a decent chance to resolve multipart difficulties in an atmosphere of confidence, collaboration, and reciprocated esteem.\n\nReference List\n\nBrowaeys, M, & Price, R 2008, Understanding Cross-cultural Management , Financial Times/Prentice Hall, Harlow.\n\nThomas, D, & Peterson, M 2014, Cross-cultural Management: Essential Concepts , Sage Publications, Los Angeles.\n",
      "Multicultural Literacy: Patricia Polacco and Roald Dahl Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the things that make man’s life intriguing is the diversity and variation exhibited by various people as a result of their differing cultures, personalities and physical appearance. Through the years, different groups of people have come up with cultures which help them develop spiritually, morally and mentally. As such these cultures have become building blocks in their lives and work places. The 21st Century has witnessed integration and increased cultural interaction among people on a previously unprecedented scale. The frequency of interaction is steadily on an increase mostly due to advances in transport and communication technologies (Gudykunst & Mody, 2002). The business realm is one of the venues where multicultural interactions have taken place.\n\nMulticultural literacy\n\nTourish and Hargie (2004) propose that a wider and more encompassing workforce should be employed by any given organization. Furthermore, most people from different cultures are more accommodating once they perceive that the other parties are interested in their culture and its values. The argument proposed by Tourish and Hargie (2004) has further been supported by the advent of globalization. Due to globalization, there has been an increasing interest in multicultural studies by business leaders, communication and cultural experts. By definition, multicultural literacy refers to the ability of an individual to acknowledge, appreciate and understand the similar and different aspect of his/her own culture, customs, beliefs and values as well as those of others ((Gudykunst & Mody, 2002).\n\nMany nations have come to appreciate the benefits of multiculturalism. This was not the case in the wake of the 20 th century. In this era, multiculturalism was greatly discouraged, as each culture tried to establish its superiority over others. Miscommunication was rife and intercultural interactions were unheard off. However, throughout history, a number of iconic people have been instrumental in facilitating change as regarding to multicultural cohesion. This study shall highlight the life of two people in regards to their works, efforts, and achievements. How each person contributed to their cultural heritage shall also be discussed.\n\nBiography of Patricia Polacco\n\nPatricia Polacco is a well renowned author and illustrator of children books. As Miller (2001) reiterates, Polacco got her ideas and inspirations from her life experiences and childhood memories. Who is Patricia Polacco? According to Miller (2001), Patricia Polacco is a talented female author and illustrator whose works have influenced the lives of many children and young adults alike. Born in 1944, Polacco was raised in her grandparent’s farm which was located in Lansing, Michigan. Her family was of a Russian and Ukraine descent (mother’s side) and Irish descent from her father’s side. The farm that she lived in at Union City is described in her biography as a magical place where her artistic side was conceived (Hadaway & McKenna, 2007). As the authors explain, it was during her life in this farm that she heard amazing stories about her roots and the time line of her peoples.\n\nChildhood and education\n\nConsidering her proven track record and achievements in her field, she should be hailed for being a lifelong achiever amidst her perfidious and challenging childhood. Hadaway & McKenna (2007) write that at the age of three years, Polacco’s parents divorced. Due to this state of affairs, she was forced to live with her mother and her grand parents in Union City until 1949 when her grand mother met her death. Miller (2001) state that Polacco had a hard time in school; she especially had troubles in reading and mathematics. Later, it was confirmed that she suffered from a reading disability called Dyslexia.\n\nIn her biography, Polacco affirms that she learned how to read at the age of fourteen. She further states that it was frustrating to see that all her friends could efficiently read and did well in class. At some point in time, she confesses that she thought that she was dumb. The revelation of her disability helped her cope with the situation and she learnt how to manage and capitalize on her weaknesses. She managed to complete her elementary, university and PhD education and excelled in all her educational endeavors.\n\nAdvent of career and inspirations\n\nShe attributes most of her works to the positive impacts that her grandparents had o her life. Evidence of this can be seen in her books such as Chicken Sunday, Babushka’s Doll, and Thunder Cake. In these books, the author highlights a relationship between a young person and the elderly in their societies. Her enriched multicultural knowledge came from her life in Ocean View Drive, Califonia where she interacted with neighbors from different racial, cultural and ethnical backgrounds Hadaway & McKenna (2007). Through these interactions, Polacco managed to learn about the diverse cultures. This knowledge is evident in some of her books where she vividly narrates some of the cultural norms that they followed and shared with the neighbors despite their differences.\n\nAwards\n\nThe experiences in her life shaped her career significantly. She started writing at the age of 41. In 1988 Polacco got the Sydney Taylor Book Award for her book “The Keeping Quilt”. A year later, her book “Rechenka’s Eggs” earned her the International Reading Association Award. In 1990 (March 10 th ), the Santa Clara Reading Council acknowledged her efforts and put her name in the “Author’s Hall of Fame”. Two of her books earned her the recognition of excellence at the Commonwealth Club of California. In 1992, she got the Golden Kite Award for Illustration for Chicken Sunday.\n\nIn the same year, she was awarded by the Boston Area Educators for Social Responsibility from whom she got the “Children’s Literature and Social Responsibility Award”. Between 1993 and 1998, Polacco received 7 more awards (Parent’s Choice Honors (1991, 1997 and in 1998), North Dakota Library Association Children’s Book Award (1996), Jo Osborne Award (1996), Show Me Readers Award (1997), West Virginia Children’s Book Award (1997) and the Humpty Dumpty Award in 1998) (Hadaway & McKenna, 2007).\n\nContributions\n\nHer books are very rich in multicultural facts. They have influenced the lives of many young children and provide valuable guidelines on how a diverse community can compensate on their differences and live harmoniously. In addition, her books give detailed information about different cultures. From these books, children and adults alike are able to learn about their cultural heritage and achieve multicultural literacy.\n\nBiography of Roald Dahl\n\nRoald Dahl was a famous writer whose works evolved around children’s books and short stories. In addition, he wrote scripts for various movies which originated from his books or ideas. According to Sturrock (2010), Roald Dahl was born in 1916 Llandaff, South Wales. His parents were of a Norwegian descent.\n\nChildhood and education\n\nHis childhood life was full of mischief and as Powling (2009) reiterates, Dahl was always up to no good. His father died when he was three years old. His mother took him to English schools as part of his late father’s wishes. The Llandaff Cathedral School was not an easy place to be. The principal (a clergy man) was strict and a firm believer in the cliché, “spare the rod, spoil the child”. To this effect, Dahl and some of his friends often found themselves on the wrong side of the stick and were regularly punished for their misdemeanors.\n\nPowling (2009) asserts that the cruelty experienced by Dahl during his early school life from older students and the principal, greatly influenced his works as an adult. From some of his works, it is evident that he portrays authoritative figures as cruel individuals out to inflict harm to others. In addition, he brings out the fact that people are not always what they seem to be. He described his school years as “days of horror characterized by an array of rules that had to be followed. This did not fly well with him. To this effect, he later declined his mothers offer to join university and opted to work for a company that would provide him with an opportunity to work abroad (Sturrock, 2010). At this point, his greed for adventure was slowly creeping in.\n\nAdvent of career and inspirations\n\nAfter graduating from high school (18yrs old), Dahl was employed by the shell oil company in London (1933-37) and later transferred to Tanzania (1937-39). It was in East Africa that Dahl got the adventurous life that he always dreamt of. He enjoyed the tropical climate, safaris and wildlife that characterized this region. In addition, he got a chance to interact with the locals and learnt how to speak Swahili. At the beginning of the Second World War, Dahl got a chance to serve his nation in the Royal Air Force which was located in Nairobi, Kenya.\n\nAs a pilot, he was responsible for shooting down enemy airplanes and he was shot down by the Libyans. After recovery, he was transferred to Washington DC where he served as a technical advisor to the government. This is where his writing career began. He started writing short stories which could be posted in the Saturday Evening Post . As his work got popular, the stories that he wrote could be found in other magazines. As Sturrock (2010) comments, the more Dahl wrote, the further his stories went from reality to fantasy.\n\nIn as much as his marriage to Patricia Neal (a movie star) never worked out, it bore him five children who became a valuable source of inspiration to his work. Powling (2009) states that Dalf could make up stories and tell them to his children every night before they went to sleep. He started writing in 1943 and his first published work was in 1961. His life experiences played a pivotal role in his works. However, adults often criticized his works saying that they portrayed the adults as cruel and devious people in the eyes of the children. Powling (2009) states that Dalf often defended his work by attesting to the fact that children liked his works not because it related to their life experiences but because they (the children) have a tendency to like cruelty and critic adults.\n\nContribution and awards\n\nHe later died on the 23 rd day of November 1990 due to illness. However, his works have been influential to many people who would like to change the cultural belief that all adults are cruel and grotesque in the eyes of the children. He managed to win the Edgar Allen Poe award, the Mystery Writers of America award (both in 1954 and 1959). His book “Charlie and the Chocolate Factory” earned him the New England Round Table of Children’s Librarians Award in 1972, the Surrey School award in 1973. In addition, he has also bagged the Federation of Children’s Book Groups Award, Massachusetts Children’s Award, New York Times Outstanding Books Award and the Millennium Children’s Book Award among others (Sturrock, 2010).\n\nReferences\n\nGudykunst, W.

      "Pharmaceutical Product Development Inc.’s McGinty-Moss Assessment Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Understanding the organization culture of the institution\n 3. Monitoring productivity quotient of the organization\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nPPD , Inc promotes its organizational culture to ensure the prosperity of its management. PPD , Inc is a CRO clinical research institution that deals with clinical research in the Pharmaceutical industry. Organizational culture affects the business venture of PPD Company as well as its employees. It is significant for PPD , Inc to understand its culture since organizational culture is the internal constitute (its character, beliefs, and values) of the institution. All these features affect the effectiveness and motivation of the PPD Company. It is essential for PPD , Inc to appropriately monitor its culture and create essential changes. The workers need to understand and assess their work culture. Equipped with this knowledge, employees are capable to enhance their work performance and become consistently part of their organizational culture. This paper aims to assess the organizational culture of the PPD , Inc through using the assessment test developed by the Debra Woog McGinty/Nicole moss.\n\nUnderstanding the organization culture of the institution\n\nAfter assessing the McGinty/Moss test, it is revealed that PPD Company possesses a stable or established culture. However, PPD Inc has a culture that is rigid although it is thorough. The organization makes certain that the institution and its workers are more developed through engaging in different training programs (Flamholtz and Randle, 2011). The institution has vital strategies to address business and organizational matters. However, the strengths of this institution may turn into weaknesses. For example, an organization that is too tough and rigid may in turn hurt and put off its employees. In this manner, the institution may hurt its management operations, therefore there is a need to adopt resourcefulness and flexibility.\n\nOrganizational culture is a manner in which people in the PPD Company operate both unconsciously and consciously on their daily activities. Through understanding the organizational culture, the institution can understand the culture that prevails, drives and supports essential programs to accomplish the strategic objectives of the PPD Company. The PPD Company understands that the key issue for running the business is to ensure that its workers are more productive and happy. The PPD Company believes that when its employees are more productive and satisfied with their job performance, their customers benefit a lot from the delightful workforce through efficient customer service and great productivity of the company.\n\nCurrently, the PPD Company strives to understand its organizational culture so that to attain its objectives and goals. It is learned from the experience that mismanaged and poorly developed organizational culture killed silently the corporate landscape. Ineffective culture sabotaged appropriate business strategies. Sylvia and Stanley (2008) opine that the company encourages its employees to raise their concerns regarding matters affecting the organization. Such issues raised by workers are enlightening and resourceful to the senior management. It is significant to know both the weaknesses and strengths of the organization to understand how to develop the company.\n\nMonitoring productivity quotient of the organization\n\nThe PPD Company identified that the key driver of productivity is employees’ morale. It is revealed that engaged (involved) and productive workers are more likely to be creative and interested in their work commitments. Satisfied workers are more eager to create positive results in their work. Douglas (2000) presents that whenever financial and objective results do not yield desired impacts, it is important to measure the effectiveness of the company’s management. It is significant to evaluate whether workers are satisfied with their contribution to the organizational goals. The company also strives to ensure that the needs of its consumers, customers, and clients are satisfied effectively. The organization makes use of measurement opportunity to look at its internal affairs by monitoring its productivity quotient (PQ).\n\nEmployees are also allowed to contribute their viewpoints regarding the daily management and operation of the organization. For the productivity quotient to become an effective tool, it is appropriate to ensure that workers and the management team both understand the collective perspective of the institution. Workers are likely to be creative and honest when they are not mistreated. According to Robert (2008), when employees feel vulnerable, they tend to be stressful. It is important to allow employees to present and contribute their viewpoints anonymously. Workers feel comfortable when their responses remain anonymous. This is to ascertain that nothing they claim either negative or positive are returned to hurt or haunt them. A useful way to create this anonymous feedback is to develop free quick online service for performing anonymous surveys. Although this tool is not a completely effective assessment device, it helps to begin identifying major issues which are required to be addressed.\n\nConclusion\n\nOnce the drivers of the productivity level of the institution are understood, the management team and entire employees can start to enhance the management systems of the organization. The company’s productivity can be highly increased when effective communication is promoted within the institution. When employees understand the business strategy of the institution and the job responsibilities, the company’s productivity is likely to be improved. Preparing a favorable work environment is important to put into consideration in addition to improving morale and motivating the employees. When employees understand that their work commitments are great contributions to the desired organizational objectives, the company’s productivity will immensely improve.\n\nReferences\n\nDouglas, R.

      "The Historical Investigation – Robert Salmon’s Crime Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Case Examination\n 2. Court Proceeding Analysis\n 3. Medical Negligence and Criminal Law\n 4. History of Medical Mistakes\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Reference List\n\nFor centuries, the humankind has been fascinated with crime. When the latest crime report is on the news, people share the story with their friends or relatives. This fascination was described in the Telegraph’s article written by Dean Burnett. He argues that since crime reporting has become an integral part of mainstream media and since crime topics have become subjects to entertainment the public seems to have an intense interest in such themes. By indirectly experiencing something connected with violence, theft, or conspiracy, a person is able to get an effective moral stimulation, not necessarily a positive one. On the other hand, there is curiosity as another driving factor of such fascination (Burnett 2014, par. 5).\n\nThus, this paper explores and investigates the crime committed by Robert Salmon in 1836. He was convicted of manslaughtering Mr. John M’Kenzie by prescribing him large quantities of medication that contained dangerous ingredients like cream of tartar.\n\nThe deceased John M’Kenzie was a Sea Captain induced to take the so-called Morison’s Pills as a laxative medication suggested by Mrs. Lane, the sempstress of his wife. As the health state of Mr. M’Kenzie worsened, Mr. Salmon was called for help. He advised increasing the dosage of the pills that caused to Mr. M’Kenzie’s health to deteriorate even further and led to his subsequent death (Ó Danachair 2009, p. 200). The examination conducted post-mortem had shown the evident signs of the prescribed medication being the primary cause of Mr. M’Kenzie’s life termination. It is also worth noting that the deceased had taken seventy-five Morison’s Pills within the day before his death (Bingham 2014, par. 4).\n\nCase Examination\n\nSince Mr. Salmon was convicted of the charge of manslaughter of Mr. M’Kenzie, it is important to give the definition of this type of crime and briefly explore it from the legal perspective. According to the Free Legal Dictionary (2007, par. 1), manslaughter is an ‘unjustifiable, inexcusable, intentional or unintentional killing of a human being without deliberation, premeditation, and malice’. Manslaughter is a specific crime that is not viewed as a lesser gravity than the act of murder which is usually intentional or premeditated. The primary differentiation between the two crimes is that the notion of malice is absent in the action of manslaughter while it is present in the action of murder.\n\nCommon-Law suggests that the offence that the act of manslaughter is divided into involuntary and voluntary. Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing of a person that is guided by some additional occasions that never excuse the killing of the person but might mitigate it in some occasions. The involuntary manslaughter is explained as a killing that was unintentional. Involuntary manslaughter is further divided into the unlawful-act manslaughter and the criminal-negligence manslaughter (Free Legal Dictionary 2007, par. 13).\n\nThe primary punishment for the act of manslaughter is imprisonment. The applicable statute of the particular states defines the exact time period which the offender should be imprisoned for. As a rule, the sentence for the act of involuntary manslaughter is lesser than that of the voluntary manslaughter. In the majority of criminal cases, the sentence imposed for unlawful-act manslaughter is lesser than that of the criminally negligent manslaughter (Legal Dictionary 2007, par. 13).\n\nCourt Proceeding Analysis\n\nThe following section of the paper will be dedicated to the examination of the actual court proceeding. The primary actors in the courtroom were Messrs. Bodkin and Clarkson, who conducted Mr. Salmon’s prosecution, Ann M’Kenzie, Mr. M’Kenzie’s widow, Thomas Daniel Allen, Mr M’Kenzie’s acquaintance, and other witnesses that will be revealed in the examination.\n\nThe proceeding opened with Ann M’Kenzie’s testimony who told the court about her husband’s health condition, about Miss Lane, who was working at their household and did some ‘needlework’ and also sold ‘Morison’s pills’ and suggested that Mr. M’Kenzie could take some to relieve his pain. As the health condition of her husband deteriorated and there was a new pain in his knee, Mrs M’Kenzie remembers that Mr Salmon came to her house saying that he had been sent by Miss Lane to see what was going on with Mr M’Kenzie. Mr Salmon advised to take more medication, and eventually, the pain will go away.\n\nAs known already, the medication only caused harm but no relief (Old Bailey Online n.d., par. 1). Mrs M’Kenzie was then asked questions about the number of the Morison’s Pills her husband had taken, about the price charged for them, the frequency of Mr Salmon’s calls and visits, and other details about the frequency and type of pills given to the diseased relevant to the case. Mrs M’Kenzie did not put any accusations forward about whether Mr Salmon was guilty or not ‘I do not know whether he has anything to do with medicine, except as the agent for Morison’s pills’ (Old Bailey Online n.d., par. 8).\n\nOther witnesses for the prosecution of Mr Salmon, Thomas Daniel Allen and Henry Timber Gray, an acquaintance of the deceased, gave testimony about the health condition of Mr Salmon and the last time they saw him and the prosecuted Mr Salmon. Both witnesses stated that there was a significant difference between the appearance of Mr Salmon before and after he had started taking the Morison’s Pills.\n\nA witness who was able to give a detailed analysis of the medication and the state of the diseased Mr Salmon called for testimony was William Spink Cumming, a surgeon, and an apothecary. The following statement was given concerning the state of Mr Salmon: ‘The moment I saw him he was extremely weak his eyes very much sunk, he breathed with great difficulty; and altogether his appearance was that of a man in a very hazardous state. I conversed with him he was not able to converse with me easily, he could not; he attempted to answer a question I put but was too exhausted’ (Old Bailey Online n.d., par. 17).\n\nFurthermore, Mr. Cumming was present at the post-mortem examination of Mr Salmon and corroborated the assumption that the prescribed pills contained gamboge which is a strong laxative, cream of tartar which increases the loss of water in the body, and asafoetida that could cause nausea and vomiting. High quantities of these components could have caused the side effects that contributed to the subsequent death of the patient.\n\nThe expert witness called at the hearing was Mr Richard Phillips, a Chemistry Lecturer at the Hospital of St. Thomas who was given Morison’s Pills for proper examination. There were two types of pills prescribed, and they seemed to be mixed together, so it was hard to understand the difference between the two. The witness also confirmed the availability of all above-listed components, however, the proportion of them was low. Thus, if taken in smaller quantities, the pills could have been beneficial for the health of the patient. It was also stated that other patients who did experience some positive effects had previously taken the Morison’s Pill.\n\nTo conclude this section about the court proceeding, the verdict of Mr Salmon was the following ‘Recommended to mercy, in consequence of his not being the compounder of the deleterious pills in question’, fined two hundred pounds (Old Bailey Online n.d., par. 31). Since Mr Salmon did not indeed make the Morison’s Pills, the act of him being guilty is linked to involuntary manslaughter. His negligence in the prescription of the medicine to the patient led to irreparable consequences. Furthermore, there were no direct accusations of Mr Salmon being fully responsible for the death of Mr M’Kenzie as the administered pills did in fact, have some positive effects for other questioned witnesses.\n\nThis account of the manslaughter of Mr M’Kenzie can be found in the Sixth Volume of Newgate Calendar edited by Donal Ó Danachair and Published by the Ex-classics Project in 2009. There was no evidence found of whether the media of that time published anything about Mr Salmon’s trial.\n\nMedical Negligence and Criminal Law\n\nNowadays doctors that pose any danger to the public are removed from medical practice or receive limited access to it. If comparing the medical practice of 1836 and of now, the difference is evident. The composition of medicine also has changed drastically in the course of history with the appearance of new technologies and innovations. The mistake Mr Salmon allowed to happen is quite rare in the modern sphere of medicine. This section briefly explores the fact of medical negligence and draws parallels with Mr Salmon’s case where applicable.\n\nWhen speaking of the UK law, legal medical negligence requires the duty of care and the subsequent breaching of the duty. In the case of Mr Salmon, there was no established duty of care since Mr Salmon was not a doctor but a pharmacist and agent for Morison’s Pills. Criminal law is often used in the UK to assess the act of medical negligence since during the 1990s and onward the country has experienced a dramatic increase in the number of charges for manslaughter brought against the employees of the medical profession. Furthermore, half of the doctors charged with negligent manslaughter were junior doctors.\n\nGross negligence and reckless behaviour are the notions that lie in the core of the charge for manslaughter, and the primary signs of which are seeded in arrogance. Already at the level of an undergraduate, a person may start developing this characteristic. If not addressed in time, arrogance can reveal itself in court and negatively affect the entire career (Naylor 2002, p. 203).\n\nThe notion of duty of care was first introduced in 1932 by the Donoghue versus Stevenson case. During the case, Lord Atkin was able to identify the fact that there is a duty to take general care in order to avoid any injury to the ‘neighbour’ that can be foreseen. The case investigated an instance when a woman drank a bottle of ginger beer until she discovered a dead snail on the bottom of the bottle. This resulted in the woman terribly getting ill and the case being presented to the company that manufactured ginger beer to receive compensation, Thus, Lord Atkin was able to identify the fact that the manufacturing company had failed to provide a duty of care for the customers and had exhibited negligent behavior.\n\nThe act of breaching of the duty was identified to relate to a ‘neighbor’ that is a person that had been affected by the breaching of the duty. According to Richard Goldberg in his Medical Malpractice and Compensation in the UK (2012, p. 143), ‘While establishing a duty of care owed to the patient in clinical negligence is not generally problematic, the establishment of the other two requirements: that the doctor was in breach of his duty of care to the patient and that this breach caused the patient harm is problematic’.\n\nOn the other hand, the act of medical negligence is related to the law term ‘tort’ which means to hurt someone. The idea of a tort or hurt is an essential notion that lies in the core of the act of negligence. A connection and the relationship between doctor and a patient is a sensitive subject. When the patient visits the doctor or gets admitted to the hospital, a duty of care on the part of the doctor is immediately established.\n\nMedical law academics have put forward an argument that every patient that has ever come across health care services was surrounded by the duty of care not only from the doctor but from other employees that must ensure that the duty of care is not breached. To illustrate, for instance, a patient that has a stroke in a corridor of a hospital must receive care from the first doctor that appears to be in close proximity or passing by (Bryden & Storey 2011, par. 5). If to compare with the case related to Mr Salmon, the outline of the duty of care is quite blurred since there was no established duty of care at the time of the trial as well at the time of an incident.\n\nHistory of Medical Mistakes\n\nUnlike today, doctors were encouraged to admit to their mistakes at the beginning of the nineteenth century. This was done in order to learn from the mistakes and make sure that similar mistakes do not occur in the future. In the majority of cases that had been conducted, it was concluded that there was no fault of the doctor. Furthermore, patients who accused their doctors of malpractice were punished which will be considered unfair and unethical in the modern time. On the other hand, the standards for doctors were increased due to the enhancement of cases connected with malpractice and the increase of expectations for the proper quality of medical care (Yu 2013, par. 3). In the past doctors were considered immaculate professionals that can do no harm and are to be trusted in any case while today patients demand high-quality health care services as well as scrutinize their doctors to find even the slightest details that can negatively affect their health.\n\nThe investigated case of Mr Salmon has shown that people connected with the medical practice were not judged in a harsh manner. On the contrary, they were often pardoned as medicine was considered a respected and reliable field that is integral to human existence. Despite the fact that Mr Salmon made a mistake in prescribing too many pills for the diseased Mr M’Kenzie, he was fined two hundred pounds without imprisonment. Even the wife of the patient who had suffered from the unfortunate incident the most did not blame Mr Salmon for being the responsible for the death of her husband as the Morison’s Pills were administered to many other people without any unfortunate consequences.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe analysis of the historical case of Mr Salmon’s trial had shown a significant difference in the way trials were conducted then and the way people are being prosecuted today. The notion of manslaughter was analyzed according to UK law withdrawing references to the case of Mr. Salmon. The fact that Mr. Salmon was related to the area of medicine did also make a difference in the outcome of the trial. The verdict is also drastically different to the verdict Mr. Salmon would have received in the modern days.\n\nThe death of a patient because of a medical mishap can lead to serious legal consequences that include imprisonment. Nowadays the notion of medical error is two-fold. For example, the fact that harm was caused to the patient in itself is not a reason for criminal punishment; however, a medical error should be treated in such a manner that it is not repeated in the future, especially on the part of the same doctor (Merry 2009, par. 14).

      "Accruals Information and Earnings in Stock Prices Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Hypothesis development\n 3. Formation of samples and measuring variables\n 4. Empirical results\n 5. Conclusions\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne of the most common practices in terms of controlling and monitoring financial reporting is to examine both normal and abnormal financial accruals, as well as cash flow indicators to make a forecast concerning future earnings. However, because in the situation, where earnings management has already taken place, it is harder to distinguish whether the stock prices that are reported in those documents did not undergo the process of smoothing earnings. For that reason, Sloan attempts to analyze to which extent such components as information in financial accruals and cash flow elements can indeed be used as indicators of the financial performance of a particular company and, therefore, influence the prediction of the company’s future earnings.\n\nIt is also important to point out that one of the most significant aspects, in this regard, is that in terms of earnings management, such components as stock prices defined from the accruals and stock prices based on cash flow indicators are not different in the extent to which they are managed. In other words, if earnings smoothing took place, both those components would be equally inaccurate for predicting the company’s future profits. Sloan in his article attempts to support and develop this idea based on the testable hypothesis using providing evidence.\n\nHypothesis development\n\nIt is paramount to have some benchmarks and tools in order to be able to estimate the organizational performance, power, and potential for future earnings. In common practice, the analysis of two types of financial reporting, such as financial accruals and cash flow, serve as such tools. Moreover, the researchers often emphasize the role of those two factors in making analysts’ forecasts and predicting the potential of a particular company in the future. There are, of course, different methods of evaluation, including various arbitrary services and amortization techniques. The main underlying factor of such type of valuation is that cash flow analysis and studying abnormal accruals are considered to be ultimately different in terms of smoothing earnings and representing information on the stock-related aspects.\n\nHowever, cash flow is associated with the current earnings performance of a particular company and its profitability, whereas the component of the accruals that also relate to the high earnings performance is less likely to be persistent in affecting the analysts’ predictions in the same way.\n\nThus, given the fact that both cash flow analysis and accruals analysis can be attributed to the forecast on the matter of profitability, there is less distinction between them than it is commonly thought.\n\nHowever, on the other hand, it is important to analyze the reasons why their linkage to components to the level of current profitability of a particular company and future predictions about its performance affect the forecasts differently. Thus, the first hypothesis developed by Sloan is that the intensity of current profits of a particular company “is decreasing in the magnitude of the accrual component of earnings and increasing in the magnitude of the cash flow component of earnings” (Sloan 291).\n\nAnother supporting hypothesis comes from the fact that expectations about future profits do not reflect the fact that analysts tend to rely more on cash flow components rather than accruals when they are defining future profits. Thus, the persistence of the former is bigger than of the latter. For that reason, it is more reasonable to monitor abnormal stock returns with a high degree of expectations in reported accruals relation to the period of the announcement of stock prices.\n\nFormation of samples and measuring variables\n\nThe data in the research conducted by Sloan include information from such databases as CRSP and Compustat; the sampling included the companies who reported their cash flows, accruals (normal and abnormal), and stock prices and stock returns information (Sloan 292).\n\nIt is also important to define the particular items in financial reporting that were considered the variables in the research. They included change in current assets and liabilities (including debt in liabilities), the difference in cash equivalents, income taxes change, and reduction in amortization costs (Sloan 293). In such a way, abnormal stock returns could be compared in all aspects to the normal operational returns.\n\nEmpirical results\n\nThe first couple of tests were designed to inquire about the first hypothesis. Thus, the analysis of calendar year returns compared to the position of the firm at the market in a long run and to the changes in non-cash assets demonstrated that the ability of financial accruals to forecast the future stock market returns is bigger than it was anticipated.\n\nAlso, the tests were developed to test whether it is more reasonable to monitor abnormal stock returns with a high degree of expectations in reported accruals in relation to the period of the announcement of stock prices. Based on dividing current assets and liability-related components by the average total assets, the hypothesis was proved.\n\nConclusions\n\nThus, in a broader perspective, analysts and investors are mostly unable to define future profits, if earnings were managed. The reason for that is in the patterns, in which cash flow components and accruals interact and how they affect the prediction of stock prices.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nSloan, Richard. “Do Stock Prices Fully Reflect Information in Accruals and Cash Flows about Future Earnings?” Accounting Review 71.3 (1996): 289-315.

      "Regency Plaza’s Project Scheduling Challenges Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Major challenges facing Regency Plaza\n 2. Major challenges facing Millers’ unit\n 3. Root causes of Millers’ challenges\n 4. Solution to these challenges\n 5. The most desirable options for Millers’ unit\n\nMajor challenges facing Regency Plaza\n\nIn project management, Kris Hodgkins was aware of time of the essences. The major challenges that the Regency Plaza faced included scheduling. Apparently, due to the dwindling local economy, the sales of condominium were very slow and, consequently, the project was behind the schedule. In addition, due to the unpredicted slow sales and a weak economy, the project’s budget kept on changing.\n\nThe number and frequency of changes that were happening as the project went on were a major challenge to the project manager. As a result, the cost of the project was increasing due to the changes caused by the cost of the estimation of the changes that took place. In project management, slight changes in the project may lead to a great cost.\n\nMajor challenges facing Millers’ unit\n\nOn the hand, the Millers were struggling to understand the high prices they had to pay for minor services in their condominium at the Regency Plaza. When purchasing the apartment, the closing date was fixed at 1 st of June, 2007. Due to the project’s slow pace, the Regency Plaza changed the closing date from 1 st of June to 1 st of August the same year. The Millers were skeptic about the company’s ability to finish the work by the deadline considering that for the last two months, very little had been done on the apartment. In addition to the scheduling challenge, the Millers were also facing a cost challenge. The Regency Plaza was increasingly over charging extra service offered.\n\nIt was agreed that if a customer purchasing a unit in the plaza wanted some customized changes made, he or she was to bear the extra cost. However, the Millers found the extra charges by the Regency Plaza sales team to be exorbitant. For instance, they were concerned that the changes in a simple kitchen cabinet cost them $1000. The price for an additional two wall outlet was $500. The Millers had the same outlets made in their Manchester home and the cost was significantly lower. Clearly, overpricing and delays were the major challenges for the Millers.\n\nRoot causes of Millers’ challenges\n\nThe Miller’s apartment was meant to be a luxury one. However, the contractors seemed to be more preoccupied with the schedule, speed and efficiency of the project rather than its quality. The contractor was not concerned that the apartment was to last for years, therefore, it needed a lasting finishing. The delays and frustrations that the Millers faced were as a result of the long processes of getting quotes\n\nSolution to these challenges\n\nThe Millers should have just bought the apartment as it was designed. Changing the design of the apartment to fit their needs was the main issue creating the loopholes for extra charges. In addition, if the Millers had not committed themselves in the purchase of the apartment with a down payment, it would have been easy for them to pull out. The agreement of purchase should have included the point regarding how the contractors would compensate the clients for delays and other eventualities.\n\nThe most desirable options for Millers’ unit\n\nFurther delays on the project would cost more. In case the client decides to retain the apartment without the changes, the cost of estimations would be incurred by the contractor. For this reason, the best option for Hodgkins was to hire a small group of contractors to finish up the unit before the closing date.\n",
      "Mexican Immigrants in the United States Term Paper\n\nDuring the 19 th Century, the industrial expansion that was taking place in the South attracted a huge number of Mexicans to the United States as temporal migrant workers. Industries in the South recruited and exploited the Mexicans for cheap labor. They worked in farms, mine industries, railroad companies, and in other manual jobs as well as in business in urban areas. Their huge migration to the US was due to the fast-changing wave of their economic condition in Mexico caused by the United States and other foreign capital (Rosenzweig 40).\n\nThey were willing to take any job in order to begin earning an income, after which they could gain the basis for acquiring better opportunities with the hope of going back home when they save enough money. They did not intend to naturalize in the United States. On the contrary, they preferred to maintain their Mexican citizenship. Since they saw enormous progress in the economy of the United States and believed that their sole purpose or mission to this country was to work, make money, and quickly return to their homeland, they were more than willing to endure hardship and discrimination.\n\nEven though they sometimes embarked on strike to voice their displeasure concerning their bad working conditions, most of them never engaged in radical actions because they were afraid of being sacked from work or even being deported. Their disinterest in the American ways of life and society allowed their employers to exploit them. However, a number of barriers made it difficult even to get the first job. The language barrier was the main challenge. Even in getting a low paying job, which required little or no English, it was difficult since employers demanded some language skills. This scenario played out not because the language was inevitable, but it served as a basis for exploitation. If you had no language skills, then you had no reason to complain if mistreated, since you were deemed unqualified in the first place.\n\nAlthough the main aim of these Mexican migrant workers was to work and make money and return home, the continuous lingering economic hardship and lack of economic opportunities in their homeland forced the majority of them to remain in the United States. Victor Hernandez’s parents were among those who chose to stay in the United States. Victor is the person I interviewed by phone for this project. Victor is 72 years old and the first child in a family of six. I met Victor in 2012 in Fresno, California. I have known him for three years now. Victor and I were both members of the Knights of Columbus in the Catholic Dioceses of Fresno. Given that I am barely six years in this country, and I do not have my parents in this country, I chose to interview Victor for the purpose of this project.\n\nAccording to Victor, his parents were mere laborers working on a farm near Los Angeles. Sometimes, his parents would travel to Bakersfield, which was about 45 minutes from Los Angeles. They had no car, so their employer often carried them in the truck to the farm. Victor was born in 1943, and he was the first child in his family. He attended elementary and high school in Los Angeles. He reiterated how difficult it was for his family to survive the hardship and segregation that they faced during that period. Assimilation was very hard for his parents since they spoke very little English, and they highly cherished Mexican values.\n\nVictor stated that many Mexican families at the time were “native-born.” No matter how hard they found it living in the US, it was worth it considering the fact that their country, Mexico, was actually worse. Where they lived in Los Angeles during that period, viz. the east side of Los Angeles, comprised mostly Mexicans. Nevertheless, they still experienced discrimination and segregation at a high magnitude. During this period, Victor said that racial tension was rampant in Los Angeles. Some sort of segregated high schools existed where minorities attended.\n\nMexican kids were made fun of on the street by white kids. Discrimination and segregation were everywhere. His parents were treated badly, exploited, and discriminated against in the workplace. Despite being born in the US, the situation was not any better for Victor. As part of the first generation of the American-born Mexicans, he went through opposing cultural experiences, for he had to learn the cultural values of his parents, and since he was exposed to Western values through peers and education system, he ended up experiencing culture clash. Unfortunately, the policy on multiculturalism was highly neglected, and it failed to protect the immigrants’ culture.\n\nThe first generation of the American-born Mexicans, where Victor belonged, continued to face alarming discrimination. When Victor finished high school education, he moved to racially segregated neighborhood housing together with his parents and siblings. They could no longer afford to pay the rent in their current place despite his father taking a second job in a bid to supplement the meager pay of his primary job. Given that he attended segregated high school, he had limited manual and academic training to enhance his lifestyle to that of the Mexican middle class. Such segregated high schools had little academic opportunities.\n\nFor this reason, Victor ended up doing farm and industrial works, just like his parents were doing in order to support his family. His generation of the Mexican-Americans was semi-skilled, unlike its unskilled parents. Due to the semi-skilled status, such generation was still unable to assimilate into American society. They were unable to join any labor union due to their race and skill level. White American skilled workers, who made up the membership of the union, accepted few if any Mexicans for membership (Rosenzweig 23). Due to their inability to join the union, they were often vulnerable to exploitation. According to Victor, the nature in which social, political, and economic discrimination persist created what he called “institutionalized prejudices.” The American dream of him became a nightmare.\n\nIn the middle of the Vietnam War, out of frustration, Victor joined the United States Army. He joined the army in 1963 at the age of 20. His sojourn in the army was an eye-opening experience. He was surprised to see how less discriminating white Europeans are on being stationed in France after leaving Vietnam. He felt liberated and contemplated not going back to the United States. Nevertheless, due to his parents and siblings, he decided to come back home. He said that even in their army base, their white American commanders still discriminated against him. On the street of Europe, people did not care much about one’s race or color. For the first time in his life, Victor felt like a human being and important.\n\nWhile in the army, Victor trained as a car mechanic. The skills he acquired in the army helped him in getting a job when he returned to the United States. On his return, he was in a position to get a job as a car mechanic in downtown Los Angeles. He said that the job paid well, at least enough to pay the bill. He worked for four years as a mechanic in the same company, most of his coworkers were whites, and some of them were ex-military men.\n\nHe could not stand the treatment that he got from his coworkers bearing in mind that he had made sacrifices for his country. Despite getting a new job, Victor realized that the pressure and stress were still mounting. Long working hours, cramped living quarters within insecure neighborhoods, and financial burdens from parents and relatives back homemade life unbearable. In addition, he had to bear with inconsistent wages, unequal treatment, and poor safety measures, yet he never complained because he thought he was there illegally. Through a friend, Victor learned about job training programs and various ways to enhance his skill level to get a better paying job.\n\nDespite being Americanized and possessing better skills, Victor had to rely on his network of friends to secure a place in college where he could acquire better skills. In a bid to reduce the pressure, he decided to quit the job. He left his family and relocated to the city of Fresno in central California. With the money that he had saved in addition to his G.I Bill grant, he was in a position to attend the Fresno City College. In addition, he was in a position to get a part-time job while attending school. He visited his parents and siblings in Los Angeles every other weekend.\n\nHe completed his college education with an Associate degree in Auto mechanics and certificate in electronics. Immediately after his graduation, having realized that he was not getting younger, he got married to a girl that he met in college. They worked for five years and were in a position to pull their income and resources together to open up a car mechanic workshop in downtown Fresno. My brother and I happened to be two of his many customers. During the time I interviewed him, I asked him whether he has ever wanted or been a member of any labor organization. He said no, for after trying many times without success. He gave up. He stated further that after opening up his own workshop, he did not have to worry about it anymore. Even though he confessed that life at work would have been a lot better if he had succeeded in joining the union.\n\nHe stressed that the belated working condition, incessant exploitation by his employer, and bad experience would have been reduced to the minimum if he had been a member of the union like the Anglo-Americans. I probed further to know the reason that barred him from joining any union since he acknowledged life would have been better if he had joined one. Victor said that after getting information from an American friend about the workers’ union, he was eager to experience the benefits, which seemed very helpful to any worker in American society. After trying to present his credentials, he was shocked to be informed that he did not qualify to join the workers union.\n\nDuring this time, there was a persisting perception that immigrants were undocumented and existed illegally in the United States. Lacking legal status hindered immigrant families from accessing help. Even with the documents like Victor, taking the initial step to reach out for information, he faced segregation and opted to stay away from trouble by avoiding these services. This move-in turn did not eradicate the trouble. Rather it made him vulnerable to exploitation and extreme segregation.\n\nGoing back to his war experience, Victor explained that many of the Mexican Americans, including himself, saw the war as a chance to escape a series of crushing poverty, which was evident in most Mexican American families all over Los Angeles. Furthermore, being in the war offered an escape from the hard jobs provided to the immigrants. Despite his father being aware of the local Legal Aid’s Farm Workers Unit, Victor said his father was too afraid to use it. Due to the influx of Mexican immigrants, it was easy for an employer to replace a troublesome employee with another Mexican immigrant who would be glad to take the offer.\n\nFor this reason, among others, he joined the army to escape what he called excruciating economic hardship and racial discrimination. Unfortunately, joining the army was initially disappointing because the army itself was segregated, just like in the rest of the United States at that time. He went for the army training in El Paso before being to Vietnam and later France. His experience during training was bad. After deployment, he started experiencing less discrimination. Nevertheless, it was a better experience for him compared to what he saw in Los Angeles.\n\nEven though the civil movement of the 1960s promised socio-economic freedom for all people, Victor said that the hopes could wait longer before immigrants could start benefiting from any changes. For a long time, most immigrants remained unaware that they had any legal recourse at times when they experienced segregation in schools, media, workplace, residential areas, or law enforcement entities. Due to the perceived institutionalized segregation, the Mexican immigrants continued to experience negative interactions with the law enforcement sector and particularly the police (Rosenzweig 32).\n\nHis family was often unfairly harassed during police raids, which were conducted in their neighborhoods purporting to flush out criminals. The residents described the police as the enemy who provided harassment, but not security. Victor gave a story of how his mother used to hide him in the ceiling during house inspections that sought to ensure that families with kids moved to larger households. Since his parents could not afford to move to a better house due to their little earnings, they had no option, but to defy the housing regulation for about two years, as it seemed to suppress the poor immigrants as opposed to helping them.\n\nHaving acquired better skills in college and acquainted with the American standards, Victor was optimistic about changing both his life and that of his family. Through his friends and customers, he had found a good source of information about the many social programs that could help immigrants cope with the challenges that they were facing. For instance, he says that his father’s place of work offered its employees various opportunities for self-improvement of which were rarely communicated to avoid demands from the workers and continue suppressing them. In addition, immigrants were afraid to access information or assistance about various specific segments of the law just because they were afraid of being deported or unfairly harassed. For instance, during his five years of work after college, the labor laws in Los Angelis were well defined only that he lacked the information.\n\nWith little understanding of the labor laws, Victor, as well as other immigrants, worked for long hours and were always afraid of quitting their jobs for fear of landing harder jobs and the threat of being sent back to their country of origin. When he started his own car mechanic, most of his customers were immigrants who had been involved in accidents and lacked insurance services to compensate them for the losses. Furthermore, others indicated being in accidents and failing to know how to resolve them not because of the language barrier, but because they lacked details about specific steps to follow when involved in a traffic accident. Contrary to their expectations, the traffic law enforcers did not assist them in solving their problems; instead, they victimized them because they were of an inferior race.\n\nFollowing the interview with Victor, many issues emerged pertaining to how immigrants perceived their place in the United States and the corresponding expectations of the host nation. From Victor’s point of view, the problems back in Mexico were extremely harsh, and it was worth working in a discriminating environment in the United States rather languishing in poverty-stricken Mexico. After close examination of Victor’s case, one can conclude that immigrants had higher expectations about the US, but they failed to consider that during this time, Americans were trying to cope with the deteriorating economic conditions exacerbated by the war. Despite these adversities, the US was gradually becoming conscious of immigrants’ rights. Government programs that could offer better housing or healthcare were available, but they were not well integrated to cover cultural aspects. For instance, Mexicans were unwilling to seek health services because they were afraid their cultural values would be undermined.\n\nDespite the availability of government programs, they did very little to solve the challenges that the likes of Victor were facing. Joining institutions such as the army as Victor did, was one way that helped immigrants to self-liberate. After being exposed to the European countries where discrimination was rare, Victor was in a position to shed an inferiority complex. This experience helped him to fight for his place. He later succeeded in establishing his own business. At last, he could decide his own working conditions free from the exploitation and fear of deportation. Victor’s experience revealed the misunderstanding that persisted between the immigrant and host communities.\n\nThe lack of information and fear to seek help were the key factors that increased the tension. The entire issue of segregation persisted due to these unintended tensions. However, the orientation sessions would have helped immigrant families in gaining acculturation skills as they adjusted to new environments. Even though Victor was an American-born Mexican, he went through the relatively same experience as his parents due to poor orientation platforms and the fear of immigrant communities to seek services. In conclusion, though it is unjustified to blame the American society for its role in the problems faced by Mexican Americans, it is worth noting that the United States could have done better in terms of facilitating the orientation process for the immigrants to enjoy the democratic space.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nRosenzweig, Roy.

      "The XYZ Company: Marketing Research Report (Assessment)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe XYZ limited company was established in the UK during the year 1990 to become the market leader in funding creative projects in England. The company is strong in the UK and neighbouring regions. Providing support to creative projects and forms of art is useful in ensuring that innovative creations are recognized and marketed worldwide (Grover & Vriens, 2006, p. 7). The main competitors providing these services include the Global Link Company and Access Ax Limited. The company is now considering supporting talented projects from upcoming youths in the UK and beyond its borders.\n\nObjectives\n\nThe objectives of this research are;\n\n 1. To examine the attitude of the society towards the project. This includes extending services to the other regions of the world.\n 2. To identify the consumers’ attitudes towards the services of the company and other competing brands.\n 3. The study also aims to determine the appropriate promotion platforms that can be used to launch and promote these services so that they can be accessed worldwide.\n\nDesk research purpose\n\nThe desk research will specifically collect information on the trends of individual projects. It will also evaluate how they were supported and funded in the past five years. At this stage, the research will also collect information and develop a list of other similar companies, which offer supportive services across the world.\n\nThe other purpose of the desk research will be to identify the number of projects that are likely to develop from the UK into the other regions in the world. It will also identify and establish the support mechanisms which have benefited the society through the development and registration of creative arts across the world. The research also seeks to identify the prices that customers pay in accessing these services from their competitors.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe research will begin internally within the XYZ Company by seeking permission from the management. The researchers will brief the managers on the requirements needed for the research, and hold a meeting with the administration of the organization for this purpose. The sales and marketing team will also be a part of this meeting.\n\nThe researchers will request for information on internal reports which indicate how the company has been performing on the market. Malhotra (2009, p. 14) argues that this is essential in the identification of the strengths and weakness associated with the company, especially in its marketing abilities.\n\nAn external survey will also be conducted, particularly about the organization’s competitors. The study will analyse the current market share of the company’s competitors such as Global Link. It will also review all the published information concerning its previous services. This will allow the company to identify the appropriate platform to pursue in the advertising and promotion of this new idea (Van Hamersveld, 2007, p. 20).\n\nQualitative research\n\nPurpose\n\nThe purpose of a qualitative research is to study and understand human behaviour concerning the support they normally get in developing their creative arts. The purpose of this research is to provide qualitative information about consumer behaviour related to financing and other support mechanisms they receive from the XYZ Company. The qualitative research will identify the following;\n\n 1. The type of support that individuals with different skills in art receive from various competitors.\n 2. The levels of support they receive.\n 3. The class of individuals that is likely to use the concept in developing their work.\n 4. How they benefit from these services.\n 5. Whether the target audience will be ready to welcome the new service in their environment.\n 6. Whether they will confuse the new service with others that exist in the market.\n\nPopulation and sampling\n\nWe propose three groups with the following profiles;\n\nGroup 1      Group 2      Group 3    \nRegion abc1  Region abc2  Region abc3\n\n\nThese groups will include;\n\n 1. Those who have benefitted from supportive companies.\n 2. Those who intend to benefit or get support in developing their projects.\n\nProcedure\n\nThe company will be required to introduce its new project to the society. This can be easily done through a variety of on-line platforms such as Facebook, where people can follow and understand the new product. The audience will follow the links on social media which will direct them on how the new project works, and support those who wish to market their creative arts.\n\nQuantitative research\n\nThe research proposes to conduct an on-line study because the target audience is geographically spread and reside in different nations. This strategy has been chosen because McDonald and Keegan (2002, p. 13) held that it is the cheapest way of contacting respondents, especially if they are geographically distributed.\n\nPurpose\n\nThis stage aims to quantify the number of people that have benefitted from projects that fund creative arts. It will also provide the classification of work which is funded or supported. Through the creation of this classification, it assists the researchers to know the class of people who benefit from these projects, and the prices that they pay (Churchill, 2001, p. 17).\n\nPopulation & Sampling\n\nThe research team made a decision to conduct 160 interviews in different households of different economic backgrounds. Churchill and Iacobucci (2009, p. 21) argue that a study which has a wide range provides a spread response, and the ability to identify interesting differences. It will be conducted on individuals who are aware of creative projects, as well as those benefiting from this funding.\n\nState  Male  Female  Total sample\nA      20    20      40          \nB      20    20      40          \nC      20    20      40          \nD      20    20      40          \nTotal  80    80      160         \n\n\nProcedure\n\nThe questionnaires will be developed by the research team and made accessible on the internet. The research team will develop an on-line system where participants will be required to log in, interact, and respond to our questions. The digital questionnaires will probe the following areas;\n\n 1. The type of creative work that is currently being funded.\n 2. The class of individuals who are likely to seek funding for their projects.\n 3. The type of creative arts the participants have some knowledge about.\n 4. Whether the society is ready to embrace the new project.\n 5. The chances that they will confuse the project with the others that exist in the market.\n\nReporting\n\nAfter the completion of the qualitative part of this research, a presentation report will be submitted. After this, a meeting will be arranged between the researchers and the organization managers. The phases of the research will form the main agenda of this meeting. An official declaration of the research findings will be released.

      "Yahoos Company’s Strategic Management’ Success Case Study\n\nA number of macroeconomics affect the search industry, but the shifting needs of consumers and the evolution of social platforms are the main factors. For instance, since the advent of Yahoo and Google, the search industry has undergone a radical transformation (Hill and Gareth 3). These days, people interact with the web through social channels such as Facebook.\n\nOften, instead of searching for a site or information on Yahoo, people are turning to the social platform to get anything they want (Hill and Gareth 5). For instance, a business page on Facebook offers excellent results for an establishment. In fact, it is one of the best ways of finding information instead of navigating through different business websites, checking for the business hours, and tracking down the information.\n\nCompanies are also shifting from traditional platforms to social sites as they are good sites to net potential clients (Hill and Gareth 4). For instance, before the emergence of social platforms, many companies had signed with Yahoo to advertise their products, but they have reduced drastically today as a result of social platforms. In 2009, the revenue of Yahoo decreased by 13 percent as a result of the lack of use of its traditional advertising forms by companies.\n\nYahoos prospect for the future is still bright as it has competencies that give it a sustainable competitive advantage (Hill and Gareth 4). The diversification strategy of Yahoo is one of its great competencies. That is in as much as its stocks plunged in 2011; Yahoo owns or has a stake of more than 40 percent in Alibaba, a Chinese search engine, whose stocks increased. Also, acquisitions made by the company also give it an added advantage in the search industry (Hill and Gareth 4-5).\n\nFor instance, Rocket mail which attracts clients in the email line, GeoCities which offers webhosting services to registered users who share their information with friends on the internet, and in 2000, the company acquired an eGroup which is a social networking site that allow registered users to link and share their information with friends (Hill and Gareth 4). All these factors have enabled the company to stay ahead of the competition in the search industry.\n\nThe dominance of Google in the search engine industry accounted for about 60 percent of all United States searchers in 2011, whilst Yahoo! Search engine received 14percent, and Bing received about 13 percent (International Business News par. 2). In addition, Yahoo recorded a lot of success init core business, such as Relevance Engine and Content Optimization (Hill and Gareth 2-3). These segments are receiving a lot of attention at the moment, even though the company has not changed its technology (Watson par. 1). In 2012, Yahoo reported an increase of 270 percent in clicks putting it ahead of Google and Bing. Also, the deal with Bing saw the company’s visits rise to about 80 percent beating Google with almost 20 percent (International Business News par. 2).\n\nWith this, I had the money I still would invest in Yahoo. The decision to invest rests partly with its recent performances and, more so, its recent technology of personalizing its homepage (Hill and Gareth 5). This aspect has given people tailored information which has enhanced page views. Since page views have increased threefold, companies marketing their offering will follow suit, and Yahoo will pick again. When its deal with Alibaba is sustained, Yahoo in as much it may underperform in the US market, the Asian market will emerge to be its competence, and as such it will be able to deliver not only on clients demand but also on the shareholders demand (Hill and Gareth 4).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nInternational Business News.

      "The Rise of Poverty in the US Research Paper\n\nThis paper is an analysis of the news article published in the magazine The Nation on increasing poverty, and inequality of income distribution in the US and government’s anti-poverty programs. Issues related to poverty are then analyzed using economic theories.\n\nSynopsis of the News Article\n\nThe article sheds light on the rise of poverty in the US, especially after the 2010 financial crisis. Written in early 2012, the article clearly shows how poverty, inequality of distribution of income, and lack of social welfare has plagued many parts of the US, even those, which were once affluent. The article also demonstrates the reluctance of the government to deal with the issue of poverty directly, as most of the time policies target the middle class of America, grossly neglecting the poorer homeless classes.\n\nThe article begins with an exposition of the incidence of poverty in the US. The main issue that is portrayed in the article is the presence of the invisible poor and the homeless poor in the US. First, the author expresses the condition of the homeless destitute, and at times has to make do with the minimum state support through food stamps and unemployment pays from the government. However, their lives are not any better for they live in dire necessity of proper housing, for most of them are homeless, and destitute. The reason as pointed by Abramsky is that, the wealthy in America “flourish atop a sea of state subsidies” available to them, but seldom reach the target group it is intended for (Abramsky, 2012, p. 12). The number of people below poverty line in America is alarmingly high and it is constantly increasing.\n\nAbramsky (2012) points out that even though there have been many social movements like the Occupy movement, none has actually been able to connect to the poor, who remained either ignorant or indifferent to its causes. The demand for food stamps has increased by 14 million since 2008 and has increased government spending on welfare activities by $65 billion (Abramsky, 2012). However, a research suggests that not all poor people receive government assistance. FRAC found that more than 40% of the poor in certain cities like San Diego, Los Angeles, and Denver do not receive government assistance. The increasing incidence of poverty in the US has increased with the rising pressure from the housing crisis and the prolonged recession. Recession has increased unemployment and has declining wages, reducing the purchasing power of the average American, which has affected the quality of life in the country.\n\nOn the other hand, are the invisible poor, who have an annual income above the poverty line set by the government, however, struggles to make ends meet. Abramsky (2012) points out that the incidence of poverty is increasing in the middle class of the country. The reason again is due to the prolonged recession and unemployment. Further, inequality in income distribution based on race shows that African-American and Hispanics are worst affected. The poverty line for an “individual is set at $11000 a year while it is $23000 for a family of four” (Abramsky, 2012, p. 14). Only 12 percent Asian-Americans and 10 percent whites are under poverty line. The article points out that 20 million people are living in “deep poverty” with their family income below 50 percent of the poverty line and an estimated number of 16 million children live in poverty (Abramsky, 2012).\n\nAnother issue pointed out in the article is of those people who do not qualify for the benefits but do not earn enough to cater to their needs. These people get a daily subsistence wage (called “living wage”) and almost no other benefits, and therefore, are at a risk of falling under an irreversible debt burden.\n\nMany of the families living in poverty do not receive proper medical facility nor do have the basic requirements like heating in houses and fresh water. The situation is worse for migrants who have to queue even for water. The article further points out that even though the level of poverty in American shot up after the country was hit with the worst ever financial crisis, no anti-poverty measure has been taken up by the government. Poverty alleviation measures were not on the policy agenda of the government that concerned itself with the problems of the American middle-class. Further, corruption in the country diverted many of the food stamps to millionaires who were in no need for the subsidy.\n\nOverall, the article starkly showed the rising poverty in the country and how there were various layers of present in it. First, there are people who live in extreme poverty with no work or place to live in. Second, are those who are temporary workers, and avail government subsidies; but even with that it is difficult for ends meet. The third kind of people are those who are just above the poverty line, receive no subsidies, but have to take loans in order to make ends meet. The fifth concern about the rising paucity is the increasing poverty among children and the older generation. The sixth issue related to poverty is the highly skewed income inequality of the African-American and Hispanics. The article points out that the inequality of income distribution based on race and the invisible poverty rising in the US are to growing concerns for rising poverty in the country.\n\nThe article clearly demonstrates three economic problems – poverty, inequality in income distribution, unemployment and government welfare spending, and anti-poverty policy of the government. Intuitively, the increase in the number of people above poverty line, are hurled in a debt-trap and are equally poor. Therefore, what needs attention is how the concept of poverty line is defined. What would determine who is below and above the poverty line and who would qualify for the government subsidies? Further, a clear understanding into the economic theory related to poverty, income inequality, and unemployment has to be understood from the point of view of the welfare economics.\n\nAn analysis based on economic theory\n\nClass based poverty Measure\n\nOne of the major problems of poverty is its distinct nature of class/race specific incidence. In the US, most of the people below poverty line are African-American and Hispanics compared to whites or Asian-Americans. This stark inequality in the incidence of poverty with respect to race brings out the question is poverty alleviation measure should be framed specifically for the races afflicted with the issue. Research has been conducted to understand the influence of class distinction in measurement of poverty (Foster, Greer, & Thorbecke, 1984; Sen, 1992; Sen, 1976). Sen points out that poverty line, as a measure of poverty incidence, ignores the individual characteristics of humans, for he believes that “poverty varies parametrically with personal characteristics and circumstances.” (1992, p. 111).\n\nHe believes that a measure of poverty line is incapable of demonstrating and addressing the real concern under a poverty-stricken situation. A few categories that must be considered while measuring the incidence of poverty are “class, gender, occupational group, and employment status.” (Sen, 1992, p. 111) Foster et al. (1984) shows that it is important to undertake an understanding of certain household factors in measurement of poverty. Their research also shows that the incidence of poverty is higher among people who are “short-term residents” or migrants. Further, they also demonstrate that a difference in class or race that forms subgroups must be considered while studying poverty.\n\nSen, in his 1979 article, presents a model of measurement of poverty. Sen devised a qualitative measure of the poverty called the poverty gap index that considered many welfare measures in it and did not just count the number of poor below a pre-determined poverty line. Sen’s model considered three aspects of measuring poverty with the help of poverty gap index and Gini Coefficient. The former provided an ordinal axiomatic approach to measurement of poverty from the welfare economic point of view and not in just cardinal terms as is done by poverty line. Further incorporation of Gini Coefficient in the measurement of poverty helps in measuring inequality in income distribution.\n\nTherefore, academic research into poverty measure demonstrates that a measure of poverty line in demarcating poverty is flawed in many ways. This has been observed in the news article. The article repeatedly talks of the poverty line as an annual income of $11000 per annum, however, it fails to show any other measure of poverty that is being used to demarcate the diverse inequality, and race based poverty in the US. The measure of poverty in the US must be based on some class-based sub-categorization of the poor. Further, their social conditions must also be considered as was in case of the elderly who have a rising medical costs while their income reduces with time. Therefore, if the same measure of poverty is applied in estimating poor in a country, it will definitely not-include many such households who can barely meet their daily requirements. In the US, there are no proper measure of poverty and understanding of the subgroup based incidence of poverty based on race, immigration status, age, gender, or family, condition is present.\n\nInvisible Poverty\n\nAnother problem as demonstrated in the article is the presence of invisible poverty in the US. A research article on the rural youth in the US shows that the number of poor in the US has been constantly under the pressure of declining income (Hodgkinson & Obarakpor, 1994). This sect has very low income and/or no employment. Census reports suggest that the rural youth are poorer compared to the youth in the metropolitan areas. Substantial difference has been found between the two groups based on daily wages, jobs, and rate of unemployment. Further wealth and income distribution has also been found to be skewed among rural youths. The report suggests certain policy changes directed to the development of the rural youth. Another book talk of the people who work, but are poor in America demonstrates the same observation by Abramsky (2012) of a Wal-Mart employee in the article.\n\nThis person is employed; however, her job is low paid and mounting debt due to her medical bills or educational loan (Shipler, 2008). These people are working in low-paid or temporary jobs and are trapped just above the poverty line. Due to their financial adequacy, by virtue of being above poverty line, they do not qualify for any state subsidy. On the other hand, rising costs, and burden of loans, make their situation even more precarious. These people are caught in a poverty-like situation, for the state’s measurement does not count them as poor, due to their low wages. Therefore, one of the increasing groups of poor in America, as Abramsky (2012) identifies are the working poor.\n\nInequality in Income Distribution\n\nThe inequality of income distribution in America is very high as there are people who are rich enough to spend extravagantly on their daily necessities and again there are those who skip meals to make ends meet. Economic theory has earlier demonstrated that a rising income inequality is good for economic development however, once the economy develops, the inequality reduces (Clarke, Zou, & Xu, 2003). Their research on income distribution in 91 countries shows that inequality decreases as the economy develops is consistent with prior assertions by economists like Kuznets (Kuznets, 1955). Kuznets’s research shows that developed countries have shown a rising per capital income except when they have faced some form of catastrophe.\n\nA recession in the US may be considered a form a catastrophe for the American economy. However, a measure of finding a ratio of the income of the people with high annual income and those with low annual income would show that if the ratio rose significantly with economic growth, the people with lower income was increasing at a higher rate with economic growth. Kuznets’s analysis definitely states that the distribution of income is directly related to economic growth. Since the American economy has been in recession since 2008, there is a definitive reason to believe that the income distribution has become unequal. However, a ratio of incomes of the rich and the poor would have demonstrated the nature of the inequality that America faces.\n\nFurther, Kuznets also suggests that a measure of inequality must exist based on the nature of industry. He exemplifies with the difference in income from agricultural and industrial sector and points out in order to understand inequality better a sector wise distinction must be made. Kuznets finds a positive relation between income distribution and economic growth in developed countries. He shows that the process of economic growth, demonstrated through changes in national income, unemployment rate, inflation, bank rates, etc., show that in the US, due to the increase in recessionary pressure, job-cuts, wage-cuts, and fall in realty prices, shows that an adverse effect on income distribution is imminent.\n\nThe analysis of the news article and the journal articles demonstrate that the incidence of poverty and its increase is positively related to the economic growth of the economy. However, better measures for poverty should be considered in order to identify people who are in poverty but are not counted as poor in America. Further, the working poor of America who have annual income just above the poverty line face a lot of problem, as they do not qualify for state support, neither can they meet the increasing prices in the economy, throwing them in a never-ending debt-trap. Further, the incidence of poverty has been found mostly in certain races such as African-Americans and Hispanics. However, no anti-poverty measure targets these minority groups.\n\nReferences\n\nAbramsky, S. (2012, May 14). The Other America 2012. The Nation , pp. 11-18. Web.\n\nClarke, G.

      "Airbus and Boeing Companies Comparison Case Case Study\n\nProduction processes\n\nTo begin with, both aerospace companies have engaged in production wars by taking the least time possible to manufacture their aircraft. This notion is also aimed at producing as many planes as possible in order to improve sales volume and secure a larger market share.\n\nFor example, the Airbus aerospace company presently manufactures the A320 series at a speed of forty-two aircraft per month. On the other hand, the rate at which the A330 series is produced is ten aircraft per month, while three aircraft are manufactured every month for the A380 series. Within the next three years or so, the company is aiming to increase the production of the A380 series to ten per month. In addition, the company is currently pondering over the possibility of starting a new line of products known as the A350 series.\n\nOn the other hand, the 737 series from the Boeing Company is currently manufactured at a rate of 42 aircraft per month. 8.3 per month is the rate for the 777, while the 747-8F is manufactured at a speed of 1.75 per month.\n\nAs can be seen from the above comparison, Boeing has a higher production rate than Airbus. This partially explains why Boeing remains the largest market shareholder in the aerospace industry. However, the company needs to probably reduce its production and focus more on quality so that the recent spates of mechanical problems reported by various airline companies can be eliminated. Besides, it is pertinent to mention that the production rates for aircraft in both companies have apparently strained the supply chain procedures. Both manufacturers have always geared up for large jetliners without considering the side effects in the supply chain processes.\n\nOutsourcing is yet another production feature of the two airline companies. The past few years have witnessed both companies outsourcing parts and materials before eventually assembling their jets. Supplies management, parts, and design are some of the aspects outsourced by the two manufacturers. While outsourcing has been a popular production practice for Boeing, it has equally led to myriads of production challenges, including long delays and overruns in terms of costs.\n\nAs of 2013, Boeing was still struggling to complete a fleet of about forty Dreamliners. Clients are now expected to receive their orders almost three years late. Although outsourcing was meant to lower the cost of production, the unforeseen effects have derailed the production process at Boeing.\n\nThe Airbus Company also suffered a similar challenge: delays and unnecessary costs after being disappointed by suppliers. Airbus has opted to collaborate closely with its suppliers in order to facilitate smooth coordination throughout the process of production. Contactors are also assisted by engineers dispatched from the Airbus Company.\n\nProposed Business Process Management (BPM) for Boeing\n\nAny BPM proposed for the aerospace company Boeing should keenly examine and manage processes that are currently executed at the company. These processes may range from production, storage, marketing, distribution, and sales. Boeing needs a BPM because it is currently facing production (delays) and quality crises.\n\nAs it stands now, the company lacks an effective monitoring phase in the BPM of its production. There is a need to track individual processes of production (such as outsourcing, assembling deadlines, dispatch of orders, delivery of supplies, and so on). Statistics on the performance of each process is necessary. The quality challenges noted in the Boeing Jetliners have been occasioned by poor monitoring of processes. A slight omission of a production process leads to poor quality.\n\nMonitoring will also improve the pace of processing orders from customers. At the people phase, the company should appraise the productivity of its employees on a regular basis alongside providing incentives to its labor force as part of the motivation. The people phase, viable tools, and methods should be availed to employees so that they can reduce defect rate and cycle time during production.\n",
      "Advertising Technology: Machine Learning Advancements Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe development of the field of computer science has intensified the use of online platforms like the social media, websites, blogs, and emails to promote the products of various entities. In this case, technical and software solutions have been fostered through the online platforms since the services can be accessed by clicking the ads (Bangia 76).\n\nThis paper focus on the description of advertising technology, the insights gained in its development, and the interpretation of machine learning coupled with how tech ads contributed to the development of machine learning and other technological advancements.\n\nAdvertising technology (ad tech)\n\nAdvertising technology, which is also referred to as ‘ad tech’, implies the integration of software or technical solutions and services that focus on the delivery, display, target, and control of online advertisements. Thus, numerous technology vendors have emerged to seize the opportunities available in the digital advertising platforms that have seen increased traffic from the tech-savvy generations (Ko, Cho, and Roberts 65). Consequently, the development of ad tech has elicited new insights among the vendors, online platforms, and the users.\n\nThe essence of ad tech has been monetized as clicking the ads interprets to financial gains for the vendors of the technical services and solutions. Besides, ad tech supports the growth of communication and social media platforms like Gmail and Facebook as it boosts revenues. Additionally, the development of ad tech has been instrumental for the career growth of personalities like Sheryl Sandberg and Gokul Rajaram, who found their way to the helm of Google and Facebook (Mims par. 2).\n\nMachine Learning\n\nThe concept of machine learning as pioneered by Rajaram infers to the aspect of computer intelligence that facilitates every Internet system to respond to the needs of the users (Mims par. 3). In this case, ads can be viewed as systems that integrate machine learning to respond to the unique needs of the Internet users through software and technical solutions. Further, the use of machine learning today is revealed by the useful search results, voice recognition, and enhanced interpretation of the human genome.\n\nThe pervasive use of the machine learning today has enabled the solving of the problems faced by humanity. This assertion holds because the growth of computer science has made it easy to obtain results without explicit programming. Thus, vast advertising platforms have emerged due to the advancements in machine learning that interprets the unique needs of the online networks users (Sethuraman, Tellis, and Briesch 468).\n\nWhy ad tech triggered the development of machine learning and other technologies\n\nThe growth of the machine learning technology was pioneered by the development of the ad tech as online-based corporations needed to foster product and services sales through advertisements (Smith 112). Therefore, academic programs were introduced to enhance knowledge concerning the creation of machine learning to facilitate the growth of ads in the online platforms.\n\nConsequently, startups have emerged to provide technical and software solutions in various sectors leading to a variety of machine learning uses. For instance, SigOpt integrated the ads to develop the machine learning system that could optimize the world (Mims par. 5).\n\nEconomic dynamics of the contemporary world also triggered machine learning advancements, as the two-sided markets had to be fulfilled. For instance, Uber and Airbnb adopted the technology that Google AdSense had previously integrated into its business and clients’ service delivery (Mims par. 4). Moreover, the ad tech industry has portrayed its presence in the military, construction, and transport sectors as the tech ecosystem embraces machine learning in providing solutions to the interested parties (Berke, Fulton, and Vaccarello 84).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBangia, Ramesh.

Corporate governance and its implications to managers\n 5. Management code of ethics\n 6. Codes organizations must take to make profits\n 7. Classical views\n 8. Bibliography\n\nIntroduction\n\nCorporate social responsibility, which is also referred to as sustainable responsible business or corporate conscience, is a self-regulation mechanism incorporated into the central part of a business. It concerns itself with monitoring and assurance of active obedience with: ethical standards, the general law and the international customs that govern business and non-business activities within an organization.\n\nEthics on the other hand, are the decisions and behaviors of an individual or organization that are considered morally fitting. Johnson and Turner (2009) in their study stated that, “ethics and corporate responsibility are matters for all firms whether they operate internationally or not”. The basis of this reasoning is the acceptance of the unavoidable ‘truth’ of relativism in relation to ethics and social responsibility (Iyer, 2000).\n\nValidity of statement\n\nTaking into consideration what has been mentioned above, an argument presents itself and with it, the question: how valid is the statement of that study?\n\nAccording to the aphorism “Nemo dat Quod non abeit” which literally means that it is impossible for one to give what they do not have; it follows that, an organization in a third world country may have integrated Corporate Social Responsibility into their mission statement , but lack the capability of following through due to lack of resources. Furthermore, “going global” brings with it new challenges (Iyer, 2009).\n\nTaking a case study example of Bolaji, Nigeria, organizations cannot leave the Corporate Social Responsibility dynamic in the hands of the government because governments in third world countries seldom fulfill the expectations of the people that elected them in.\n\n“The contemporary third world government need to put in place a working infrastructure that will engender business activities”. (Petkoski and Twose, 2003, p.16) After this is done, the corporate players can then be called upon to give back to the community.\n\nApplication of theories\n\nIn order for organizations to be able to effectively and efficiently adhere to the stipulations and guidelines of ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility, several theories need to be applied. More specifically, rights and justice theories need to be taken into consideration.\n\nOrganizations should recognize that their employees and other internal (and external) stakeholders have privileges and rights that go beyond national boundaries and cultures. Managers should be guided by fundamental human rights when making decisions that have ethical constituents (Suder, 2008).\n\nFurther, justice theories stipulate that economic goods and services should be distributed in a just manner. However, when an organization is engaging in social responsibility and the unequal distribution of goods and services has been viewed to work to everyone’s advantage, then this may be considered as an exception.\n\nCorporate governance and its implications to managers\n\nWhen we take a look at the Nigerian Banking system and its Corporate Social Responsibility aspects, we see that it would be necessary for management, more so of the Central bank (as the key player in the economy), to restructure.\n\nThis would be aimed at comprehensively dividing the roles of management from the management of fiscal policies ultimately creating a more effective social, environmental and economically viable banking system.\n\nDrawing from this example we see that, management has the responsibility to clearly outline the corporate structure so as to identify who will be held accountable for the implementation of Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nManagement code of ethics\n\nIn order for an organization to effectively conduct itself in the required manner, management should adhere to contemporary code of ethics (Cavusgil, Knight and Riesenberger, 2008). These ethics encompass responsibility, respect for people’s rights and dignity and integrity.\n\nManagement code of ethics focus on four broad areas:\n\nManaging the organization which involves creating and sustaining a positive work environment, managing the business by maintaining a viable business venture, managing people through maintenance of commitment and engagement and being mindful of human rights and lastly, managers managing themselves effectively so as to avoid bringing about stress related issues.\n\nThe code of ethics is meant to guide the management and ensure that the organization fulfills its overall commitments with respect to ethics and Corporate Social Responsibility.\n\nCodes organizations must take to make profits\n\nCorporate Social Responsibilities are grounded on opposing objectives with the ultimate goals of an organization of profit maximization. However, management should aim at finding the balance between the two objectives. An organization should always strive to adhere to the set out ethical standards because this ultimately increases business efficiency.\n\nBeing mindful of the environmental and social aspects external to the organization ensures that the presence of the organization is felt in the society. Giving back to the community that enabled your rise to success goes a long way in ensuring that an organization maintains its business.\n\nWhen all this is tied together, we see that adhering to ethics and Corporate Social Responsibilities brings business back to the organizations and facilitates profit generation.\n\n“On the macroeconomic level, participation in international business allows firms to achieve economies of scale that cannot be achieved in domestic markets”. (Czikota, Ronkainen and Moffett, 2008) It is, therefore, imperative that the ethics adhered to be of international standards.\n\nClassical views\n\n“While the work of Smith, Ricardo, and Mill went far in describing the flow of trade between nations, classical theory was not without its flaws”. (Ajami and Gorddard, 2006, p.50) The Friedman doctrine implies that; as long as an organization is operating within the law, then its only social responsibility should be to continue maximizing its profits.\n\n“Basically, he argues that managers as agents owe the owner of the corporation, the stockholders, a duty to pursue their interests”. (Crane, 2008, p.138) This is quite misleading because there should be a balance between sole profit making and integration of social and environmental objectives.\n\nCultural relativism suggests that companies should adopt the ethics of the cultures in which they find themselves operating in. This assumption stands to be corrected because in the contemporary world, diverse cultures should all be accommodated.\n\nLastly, the naïve immoralist argues that a manager should carry him/herself in the manner in which he/she sees the managers of other nations carrying themselves. This implies that, if the managers of other nations are not adhering to the ethical norms, neither should the manager of the multinational firm. This is a very misguided approach considering how stiff the competition is in the global marketplace (Hill, 2005).\n\nBibliography\n\nAjami, R.A. and Goddard, G.J., 2006.

      "Effects of the Indigenous Movements to the Politics of Modern Latin America Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. History of Indigenous Movements\n 3. Major Grievances\n 4. Features of the Indigenous Movements\n 5. Strategies Employed by Indigenous Movements\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe twentieth and the twenty-first centuries have been characterized by the emergence of indigenous movements in Latin America. Analysts and scholars have been engaging in thorough research to establish the real identity of these groups due to their demands.\n\nThese groups refuse to be included in the existing political and economic discourses, something that have given the administrations of Latin America a rough time.\n\nResearch shows that indigenous groups represent an approximated forty-five thousand people whose main objective is to institute legal and constitutional amendments that would allow their recognition in society.\n\nThese groups claim that they should be allowed to come up with their own administrative units that would govern their territories since they feel that they are misrepresented in the current governments. In other words, they push the government to grant them their rights that have been denied for years.\n\nJust like any other freedom fighting group or a group seeking justice, indigenous groups have to go confront economic and political processes, which are the main causes of their disadvantaged position (Kearney 89).\n\nPolitical and economic policies that the governments of Latin America put in place deny the indigenous people the right to own land, as well as their sovereignty. Globalization and the developments in the international system pose great challenges to the indigenous people of Latin America.\n\nFor instance, the emergence of multinational, which threaten to take away their land, is an issue of concern that forces them to form formidable social movements. These multinationals are in need of extra land for exploration of oil, gas, practice of agriculture, and acquisition of other national resources (Harvey 115).\n\nThis paper talks about the effects of the indigenous movements to the politics of modern Latin America. The paper discusses these effects through examining the ongoing activities of indigenous movements in Mexico.\n\nTo examine some of these effects effectively, the paper will first talk about the history of indigenous movements, the major grievances of the groups, some the basic features, and the measures that these indigenous groups have put in place to mitigate the problems affecting them.\n\nHistory of Indigenous Movements\n\nStudies show that the indigenous groups started demanding for the rights in 1960s owing to the global national liberation processes that started in the United States and spread to other parts of the world.\n\nIn the African continent and the Asian region, indigenous groups started demanding for their independence in matters related to self-governance. The indigenous groups noted that their freedom had to be granted since they had the capacity to manage their affairs, including the problems affecting them.\n\nIn Africa, the indigenous movements were in the form of revolutions whereby some few individuals led the movements with the use of arms.\n\nIn early 1970s, the indigenous people in Latin America demanded for representation in government since subsequent regimes implemented policies that were detrimental to the lives of many locals (Rus and Collier 89).\n\nThe indigenous groups resorted to the formation of social movements to put pressure to the oligarchs to concede power. The main problem affecting the indigenous people was forceful evacuation from their homes since multinational corporations were in need of their natural resources.\n\nThe first social movement was under the banner of worker-compesino alliance. Under such alliances, the locals demanded for cultural recognition since the government never cared for these displaced groups.\n\nIn 1980s, the demands of the indigenous people were more specific as compared to those of a number of social movements. Their main concern was the right to self-government and administration of justice.\n\nMoreover, they wanted the government to respect their territory and allow them to exercise their democratic rights of electing their own leaders. Through this, the indigenous groups noted that they would manage their own affairs if given the chance to exercise self-rule.\n\nThis would as well allow them to own property and even engage in business. After 1980, the demands of the indigenous movements were very different from those of other social movements, which were fighting for inclusion in government.\n\nAs social movements were fighting for involvement in governmental matters, the indigenous groups were demanding for nation-states meaning that they wanted to secede from the main land. They were questioning the structure of power in the state since no indigenous group was represented in government.\n\nSince the main government always sidelined them, they were not after forming a government of national unity, but instead they demanded to be given the power to form their own governments, which would be autonomous.\n\nThe groups were against the idea that they are the minority group, but instead argued that they were the real people of Mexico and they should have their own government.\n\nIn this regard, they should not have the same government as that of other groups because their culture and history is very different from those of other groups existing in Mexico (Santín 65).\n\nBy demanding self-government, the indigenous groups in Mexico were of the idea that they have the right to determine their own destiny meaning that they should not be given delegated authority.\n\nThrough the formation of their government, the indigenous people of Mexico would achieve their interests without necessarily bothering the national government.\n\nIn 1989, the international labor organization designed some of the policies that encouraged the indigenous people to demand for their right. Convention 169 demanded that the indigenous and tribal people were to be involved in the management of state affairs regarding employment.\n\nThe international law on labor recognizes the existence of the minorities and the indigenous people. Moreover, it also distinguishes the territories, the legal systems, and the administrative units set by the indigenous people. This law gave the indigenous people an advantage as regards to the demand for self-governance.\n\nThe locals should identify the most viable economic strategies and apply them to improve their standards of living. The law states that the central government or any other external power should not force the locals to engage in economic processes that do not support their culture.\n\nApart from the international law that recognizes the rights of the indigenous people, the regional laws also respect the views of the locals. The locals should not be dragged into supporting economic or political policies that do not match their socio-cultural life (Stavenhagen 81).\n\nMajor Grievances\n\nIn Mexico, a number of groups including the Chiapas and Mayans have risen up to fight for their rights claiming that the government is doing little to protect their interests. In early 1990s, armed gangs confronted the government for supporting neo-liberalism.\n\nIn other parts of Latin America, such as Columbia, other indigenous groups led by U’wa people were willing to lose their lives in case the government allowed the oil companies to enter their territories without their permission.\n\nIn 2000, the indigenous groups in Bolivia lobbied the legislature to terminate the term of the sitting president since he was suspected of supporting multinational organizations, which were accused of rendering the locals landless.\n\nThis means that the grievances of the indigenous people in Latin America are concerned with resource allocation. In particular, the locals are more concerned with the activities of the multinational corporations who use the government to deprive them of their rights.\n\nMultinational corporations are given access to exploit the forests and the local land in search of natural resources such as oil and timber. This forces the indigenous communities to seek alternative land since their ancestral land is taken away.\n\nIn 2002, the Inter-American Development Bank instituted some policies that would isolate the indigenous people economically. Plan Puebla Panamá was a free trade policy that would allow the free movement of people and goods.\n\nThis would definitely give other traders undue advantage, which would mean that the indigenous people would not have adequate opportunities in the economy (Gutmann 34).\n\nSince the indigenous people could not allow this to happen, they organized various demonstrations to force their respective governments to withdraw their memberships in the union.\n\nSome analysts would argue that the opposition to the FTAA came from students and professionals, but the reality is that indigenous groups were more opposed to the formation.\n\nThe argument of the indigenous people was that the trade arrangement among various regional governments would not benefit since they did not have equal opportunities in terms of academics and capital resources.\n\nThose to benefit in the labor market under the new arrangement would be those from developed countries such as Canada and the United States. The indigenous people are mostly marginalized, impecunious, and uninformed implying that they cannot match the skills that people from North America possess.\n\nIn 2002, the CIA suggested that the influence of the indigenous groups was posing a new challenge to the stability of the region. In fact, the report noted that the activities of the indigenous groups were meant to increase owing to the global networks reinforced by international human rights groups, as well as ecologists.\n\nOne wonders why the indigenous groups are against the new trend in the international system, which is related to regionalism.\n\nThere is a popular belief that increased foreign investment encourages economic development in the country. However, foreign investments rely on exploitation of natural resources, which is highly contested by the indigenous communities (Nash 76).\n\nDue to foreign investments, pollution in Mexico is inevitable while forests are being depleted. Indigenous communities are the only ones sitting on natural resources, which is the main target of foreign companies.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the IDB have always encouraged privatization of some of the communal resources owned by indigenous communities.\n\nThe Breton Hood organizations come up with some of the policies that affect the normal lives of the locals since they encourage private ownership of property. In this regard, the rights, sovereignty, and the territoriality of the indigenous people are under threats.\n\nThe locals depend on their natural resources for survival since the main economic activity is agriculture. They cannot afford to lose agricultural land to international private investors whose major aim is to expatriate resources to their home countries.\n\nThe indigenous groups have come up with some of the strongest human groups to defend what rightfully belong to them. In fact, some groups have gone a notch higher to suggest some of the economic options that would put off foreigners from admiring their natural resources.\n\nIn this regard, the sovereignty of the national government is always under threat, forcing them to adopt policies aimed at incorporating the indigenous groups into governmental decision-making processes (Leyva 78).\n\nFeatures of the Indigenous Movements\n\nEven though some scholars believe that the word indigenous is misleading, it has always been used to refer to those categories that feel their culture is not respected in any political system.\n\nOthers view it as an ethnic group with distinct culture. Indigenous movements are characterized by two major themes, including political consciousness and political actions aimed at liberation.\n\nThe indigenous groups have developed unique identify mainly because of subordination and subjugation as witnessed in the political systems. Therefore, they aspire to force the government to listen to their grievances through application of force.\n\nAnother feature that distinguishes indigenous groups is the application of Marxist ideas in interpreting their situation. Marx noted that the interest of the rich in society is to acquire governmental power and subjugate the poor.\n\nIndigenous movements concur with the ideas of Marx since the central government has never provided equal opportunities that would uplift the standards of the locals. Therefore, they aim at restructuring the existing social structure to reflect the interests of all, including the minority (Lynn 80).\n\nAccording to indigenous groups, globalization serves to extend the interests of the ruling class because it does not provide chances for the poor. Multinational organizations engage in massive production without considering the plight of the poor.\n\nBased on Marx’s class analysis, the indigenous people will one day form a movement that would overthrow the existing status quo and institute a social structure that caters for the interests of all people. The capitalists are represented in central government meaning that the indigenous people cannot rely on the state for solutions.\n\nIn other words, they believe that the state is a property of the ruling class because state machineries are always used to intimidate the indigenous groups. For instance, the locals are often harassed when they attempt to demonstrate against the idea of exploiting the natural resources.\n\nThe elected leaders in government do not represent the interests of the people, but instead they represent the wishes of foreigners and multinational corporations.\n\nBased on this idea, the indigenous can determine their own destiny by uniting against the common enemy, which include the central government (Van der Haar 112). This idea encourages the indigenous groups to engage the government in constant conflicts.\n\nStudies show that indigenous groups have regained their power as far as the management of state affairs is concerned. They are now considered the major state actors before they force the government to change its domestic and foreign policy.\n\nIndigenous groups are against globalization, even though the government of Mexico supports it. Indigenous groups are always the leading opponents of status quo whereby they demand for an economically just society. Indigenous movements are known for demanding a number of changes.\n\nOne of the demands is that the international law should be adjusted to reflect the wishes of the poor. All laws related to global trade should be reviewed because they do not benefit the poor in the global society.\n\nIn this regard, they support convention 169, which states that the poor locals have the right of determining how their resources would be used. Domestically, they demand that the state should design policies aiming at liberating the indigenous people from the ongoing problems brought about by globalization (Martínez 21).\n\nMultinational corporations are polluting the environment yet the government is doing nothing to stop them.\n\nA law should be designed, which prohibits foreigners from exploiting the local people.\n\nThe third demand is that the indigenous people should be granted their rights regarding sovereignty and territoriality meaning that they should be allowed to form their own governments that would oversee the exploration and distribution of natural resources.\n\nThe fifth demand of all indigenous groups is that the central government should withdraw the military from the zones they occupy and ensure that peace prevails. This would allow the locals to engage in commerce and other economic activities (Lynn 826).\n\nThe presence of the military in their zones is an economic impediment to the realization of their goals. Since the central government has always advocated for policies aiming at displacing the locals, a law should be designed, which would illegalize displacement of people.\n\nMoreover, the central government should stop threatening the indigenous people with military attacks and fumigation.\n\nFinally, the government of Mexico should respect the UN declarations giving the indigenous people the right to coexist. These are the major concerns of the indigenous people, which have always brewed controversies over years (Vlachova 98).\n\nStrategies Employed by Indigenous Movements\n\nIndigenous movements have ensured that the locals are sensitized to form strong local councils, which oversees the exploration processes. These councils force the government to consult the locals before implementing some of the policies.\n\nIn Mexico, there are various groups including the Council of Nahua Peoples of the Alto Balsas, the Council of Tlapaneco Peoples of the Guerrero Mountains, the Union of Indigenous Communities of the Isthmus (UCIRI), the Chinanteco Indigenous Council, and the Traditional Council of Indigenous Peoples of the state of Sonora.\n\nAll these groups aim at safeguarding the interests of the locals in Mexico at the council level. At the provincial level, indigenous movements have ensured that the interests of the locals are also well catered for.\n\nIndigenous groups are able to influence the national politics through provincial councils because they are more diversified (Lee 30).\n\nThrough the provincial councils, a number of national councils have been formed, which are mostly the result of the mergers between provincial councils. In Mexico, National Indigenous Plural Assembly for Autonomy (ANIPA) is one of the national bodies in charge of overseeing the interests of the indigenous communities.\n\nIt has achieved a lot, even though it experiences a number of challenges. Other groups fighting for the rights of the indigenous in Mexico include the human rights groups, which operate globally and regionally.\n\nStudies show that feminist organizations have also contributed a lot in ensuring that the indigenous people achieve their objectives (Puechguirbal 15). However, feminist groups are not yet well developed. The formation of the production associations is viewed as landmark in the fight for independence.\n\nThe associations are determined to ensure that the indigenous people improve their economic standards in order to catch up with the rest of the world.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGutmann, Matthew.

      "Impact of ICT on Firm Performance Analytical Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Influence of Cloud Network on Businesses\n 3. Efficiency Improvement\n 4. Cost Reduction\n 5. Risks\n 6. Disadvantages\n 7. Summary\n 8. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nGlobalization has created expansion opportunities to businesses in nearly all industries. Most businesses have opted to join overseas markets in order to expand their market shares and to increase their profits. However, joining new markets often involve high administrative and operating costs.\n\nAdopting modern information and communication technologies can enable investors to manage and expand their businesses in a cost effective manner (Berman, Marshall and Srivatbsa).\n\nThus, this paper will attempt to analyze the extent to which ICT impact firm performance in the domestic and overseas markets. The analysis will focus on the use of cloud network in businesses.\n\nThe Influence of Cloud Network on Businesses\n\nCloud network technology has tremendously changed the methodology of doing business in various industries. In general, it has influenced the way businesses store data, develop new products, serve customers and manage their costs. The specific influences include the following.\n\nTo begin with, most businesses are adopting cloud networks to optimize their capacity to improve customer value propositions. Optimizers are normally interested in offering great value in the market without undertaking major risks (Berman, Marshall and Srivatbsa).\n\nFor example, North Carolina State University found it difficult to provide enough computing resources to over 30,000 students. In order to enhance its value proposition, the university adopted cloud network technology by creating a virtual computing lab.\n\nConsequently, the university has been able to attain flexibility in the provision of computing services to its students.\n\nCloud network is also being used to facilitate innovation. Innovators use this technology to extend their customer value propositions in order to create new revenue streams. In this context, cloud technology enables businesses to change their roles in their industries, as well as, to join new markets.\n\nFinally, disruptors use cloud technology to identify new customer needs and to create new value propositions (Berman, Marshall and Srivatbsa). For example, in 2011, Comcast Corporation adopted cloud technology to respond to emerging needs in the entertainment industry.\n\nConcisely, Comcast used the technology to provide internet, entertainment and communication services to its customers via internet enabled devices. The technology has enabled Comcast to provide content via more devices than before. Additionally, the company is able to develop new applications faster and cheaply.\n\nEfficiency Improvement\n\nCloud network technology has enabled businesses to improve their efficiency in the following ways.\n\nFirst, it facilitates easy storage, retrieval, as well as, maintenance of records or data (Yang, Goodchild and Huang 305-329). The network uses web-based applications which eliminate the need to store, maintain or process data within the business. These activities are outsourced and the user has real time access to his data.\n\nSecond, it enhances internet communication by enabling all employees to interact using the same interface and data (Cloud Computing World).\n\nThis improves consistency and eliminates chances of miscommunication. Cloud technology ensures that the data or information being used by business executives is accurate and current.\n\nThird, the technology improves efficiency in sales and marketing. In this case, it enables marketing executives to rapidly access sales data which are fundamental in developing marketing plans.\n\nFor instance, managers can save time by having automatic access to data which is often organized in easy-to-understand formats such as tables and charts. This improves the manager’s ability to respond immediately to customers’ needs.\n\nFourth, cloud network technology promotes efficient resource allocation. By entrusting most information technology (IT) functions with a third party, the business can significantly reduce its fixed and variable costs (Plummer 3-41).\n\nConsequently, the business will have more time and financial resources to implement important programs such as developing new products. Finally, cloud technology improves management efficiency. It enables investors to monitor the performance of their businesses using the most accurate and updated information.\n\nCost Reduction\n\nCloud network technology enables businesses to reduce costs in the following ways. To begin with, cloud networks facilitate cost flexibility. It facilitates a shift from capital to operational expenses, thereby reducing fixed IT costs (Berman, Marshall and Srivatbsa).\n\nCloud technology eliminates the need to acquire computer hardware and software that is required to store and process data. Consequently, it eliminates the cost of purchasing IT equipment and software license fees.\n\nCloud network services are often provided through a pay-per-use model. Users of the network are expected to subscribe for services according to their needs and ability to pay.\n\nConsequently, businesses save money by avoiding expenditure on services which are not fundamental to their IT needs. Storing data in a cloud network is also cheap as compared to building data centers. Heavy users of data such Netflix have been able to reduce their operating costs by adopting cloud technology.\n\nSimilarly, small businesses that are not able to build their own data centers can reduce costs by adopting cloud technology. Small businesses can obtain large data storage space at a relatively low price since the cost of using the network is shared by many users (Sridhar 1-41).\n\nRisks\n\nThe risks associated with cloud network technology include the following.\n\nFirst, there is a risk of losing security over sensitive data. Even though passwords are used to protect the data stored in the network, the service provider can still access it easily. Additionally, criminals can hack the system and access users’ data illegally.\n\nSecond, there is no guarantee for service delivery, especially, in public cloud networks (Berman, Marshall and Srivatbsa). Since the services are provided by third parties, users have little or no control over their provision.\n\nFor example, businesses using cloud networks are likely to incur huge losses if the service providers stop their operations without giving notice of closure.\n\nThird, the network users are likely to be exposed to the risk of high prices and poor product quality if the service provider is a monopolist. This is likely to affect companies with operations in Africa and Asia where cloud technology is yet to be fully adopted.\n\nDisadvantages\n\nCloud network services are often provided in a standard form (Yang, Goodchild and Huang 305-329). Consequently, businesses might not be able to access services that are tailor made for their IT needs.\n\nEven though specialized services can be accessed through hybrid and private networks, these options tend to very expensive. Thus, small and medium size companies might not afford them. Using cloud networks also increases reliance on outsourced services, and this can disrupt expansion plans.\n\nFor instance, companies that intend to join countries where cloud network services are limited will be forced to incur additional costs in order to establish an ICT department.\n\nFinally, there is a risk of losing data in a cloud network. Destruction of the equipment used to store data in the network can lead to a massive loss of data (Sridhar 1-41).\n\nThis risk is exacerbated by the fact that the network users have no control over the equipment or infrastructure used to store their data. Thus, users can not ensure security over the network infrastructure.\n\nSummary\n\nModern information and communication technologies are being adopted by businesses in order to improve productivity and competitiveness. Multinational companies often adopt modern information technologies to facilitate efficient coordination between their headquarters and their overseas subsidiaries.\n\nLocal companies also use information technology to enhance their competitiveness. In general, ICT is used by businesses to enhance efficiency, product development, provision of customer services and monitoring operations (Sridhar 1-41).\n\nCloud network technology is one of the ICT products that are increasingly being used in the contemporary business environment.\n\nOptimizers often use cloud technology to improve the quality of their products without facing the risks associated with investing in new ICT equipment or infrastructure (Berman, Marshall and Srivatbsa).\n\nIn this regard, cloud technology enables businesses to optimize their existing capacities. Innovators tend to use cloud networks to create new products and to improve the quality of existing services. Thus, cloud technology provides an excellent opportunity for product and process innovation.\n\nDisruptors use cloud technology to respond to emerging market needs. In this case, businesses use cloud networks to identify new needs in the market. They also develop new products and business processes to respond to the identified needs.\n\nCloud networks enhance efficiency in businesses by facilitating easy storage and maintenance of data. Besides, accessing data in the system is often fast and easy. The technology is also capable of facilitating significant cost reduction. Cloud networks delegate IT functions to third party organizations (Sridhar 1-41).\n\nThus, it eliminates the expenses associated with the acquisition and maintenance of IT hardware and software (Yang, Goodchild and Huang 305-329). The risks associated with cloud networks include inability to control service provision and to ensure adequate security over users’ data.\n\nThe disadvantages of cloud networks include the fact that users are not likely to access specialized services. Furthermore, the users are likely to lose their data if the network infrastructure is destroyed.\n\nThe strengths demonstrated in this report include a detailed research on the use of cloud network in businesses. The report has attempted to cover various aspects of cloud network such as its influence on businesses, its risks and disadvantages.\n\nThe use of real companies as examples has helped to shed light on the application of cloud network in businesses. Furthermore, the findings in this report are based on current information about cloud network technology and its application in a business environment.\n\nThe difficulties encountered in the process of completing the report include unavailability of information. Access to most peer reviewed journals required subscription fees.\n\nAdditionally, cloud network technology is a recent innovation. Thus, there is a dearth of information about it. Besides, the existing literature about cloud network is based on inconclusive research findings.\n\nThe scope of the report is one of the areas that should be improved in future. The application of cloud network in business is a wide topic that cannot be easily covered in a short report. Additionally, further research should be conducted in future in order to verify existing findings about cloud network technology.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBerman, Saul, Marshall, Anthony and Srivatbsa Robin.

Different sources point at how men are required to behave and present themselves in order to appear like male. With time, the different aspects that would associate with masculinity are gradually fading and new ideas quickly emerging to define masculinity. In the past, people used masculinity to identify with one’s gender (Clark “Fight Club” 411).\n\nNevertheless, the onset of equality in the contemporary society is gradually making it hard to see the distinction between femininity and masculinity. In the United States and other developed countries, capitalism is putting immense pressure on masculinity. In her chef-d’oeuvre article, Ta laments how capitalism, through the aspect of creating and accumulating profits, has affected masculinity in the American society (265).\n\nMoreover, increase in advertisement programs is making people change their views regarding masculinity. It is becoming hard for modern men to achieve definite ideals attributed to masculinity (Clark “Fight Club” 413-419).\n\nIn trying to assert his masculinity, today, the contemporary man portrays his masculinity through addressing his pain and fears, as well as through violence. This paper seeks to bring out the theme of masculinity in the masterpiece, Fight Club .\n\nNature of masculinity\n\nFight Club is one of the narratives that effectively bring out the state of masculinity as well as the nature of masculinity in the modern western culture. In addition, the novel brings out the level of crisis in masculinity, which is prevalent in the current capitalist culture. It would be imperative to note that masculinity does not necessarily portray in an individual’s physiological attributes.\n\nInstead, one’s behaviors portray masculinity. Both men and women may display masculinity based on their behaviors. Consequently, masculinity is not entirely an exclusive male attribute. In Fight Club , numerous scenes portray the theme of masculinity.\n\nFor instance, in one of the scenes, Jack opts to attend the meetings held by the “remaining men together” as a way of helping him retain his masculinity ( Fight Club ). This group consists of men who have lost their testicles due to cancer.\n\nNevertheless, their association helps them retain their masculinity. Being together allows them to engage in activities that are mostly associated with masculinity, thus regaining their masculinity.\n\nIn her article, Ta posits that Jack endures a false emasculative fear, which borders on the baseless belief that all things are terrifying to his priapic abilities (270). The only way to overcome this suffering is by ensuring that he associates with other men and partakes in games or fights that are attributed to masculinity.\n\nWomen may portray masculine features, while men may exhibit feminine features. Normally, attributes like autonomy, affluence, and strength represents masculinity. Nevertheless, traditions dictate that females should not exhibit masculine characteristics (Faludi 547-551). With time, changes in the Western culture have resulted in male victimization.\n\nThe emergence of consumerism and capitalistic culture has given way to a crisis in masculinity. In her book, Susan Faludi shows how consumerism has led to male victimization. She posits, “After World War II, manhood signified the guarantee of novel borders for their lads to surmount a culture where historical inherent qualities of masculinity could be carried on” (Faludi 597).\n\nAccording to Faludi, the consumerism culture led to men embarking on the business of enriching themselves, and in the process, they abandoned activities that once portrayed their masculinity (599). Initially, features like scars, muscles, and courage portrayed masculinity. Nevertheless, capitalism has substituted these features with affluence and power (Foucault 123).\n\nMore and more women have become wealthier than men have, thus leading to male victimization. In Fight Club, male victimization has affected Jack mentally, eventually forcing him to come up with a fight club. He establishes the fight club as a consolation since it gives him an opportunity to meet with other men and engage in activities that assure them of their masculinity.\n\nMasculinity and identity\n\nOne of the roles of masculinity is that it helps in establishing one’s identity especially in men. In Fight Club , Jack struggles to establish his identity. He ends up attending numerous support groups and tries to associate with them in the name of seeking self-identity. He ultimately joins the fight club after realizing that he could only establish his identity in such a place ( Fight Club ).\n\nIn her well-researched book, Men and Masculinity, Sweetman, “Identity only becomes an issue when it is in crisis, when something assumed to be fixed, coherent, and stable is displaced by the experience of doubt and uncertainty” (14).\n\nIn Fight Club , Jack perceives this uncertainty and qualm as a change in masculinity. In the past, features like endurance, strength, power, and knack to tolerate pain were regarded as some of the masculine traits (Palahniuk 65).\n\nHowever, since the onset of the Industrial Revolution, technology has significantly substituted these traits. Faludi posits that the industrial revolution led to a transition from creation of goods to the creation of knowledge (487). Consequently, industrial revolution took away most activities that satisfied men’s masculinity, thus leaving them with limited activities. Currently, men enjoy “ornamental” masculinity.\n\nMen like Jack were confined in rooms to work with phones and computers. The masculine rebirth that Jack and Tyler are going through compels them to establish the fight club (Palahniuk 65).\n\nThe fight club gives Jack and other men an opportunity to engage on physical combat, which that reinvigorates their masculinity. In one of the scenes Tyler posits, “We have no great war, no great depression… our great war is a spiritual war…our great depression is our lives” ( Fight Club ).\n\nThis assertion confirms Tyler’s belief that men can only regain their masculinity through violence. When Bob meets other men in the “remaining men together”, he reminds them “We’re still men” ( Fight Club ). Bob goes on to apply some masculine techniques during his fight in the club. He uses these techniques as a way of showing others that despite losing their testicles they are still men and thus have all it takes to be men.\n\nOne of the factors that make Jack join the “remaining men together” group is that it allows him release his emotions as a man (Palahniuk 68). Some activities can lower one’s masculinity if done in public; for instance, if a man cries in public, it would show that he is not mature enough.\n\nHence, at times, men suffer emotionally in the name of preserving their masculinity. Therefore, joining the “remaining men together” group gives Jack an opportunity to release his emotions through crying.\n\nMedia and masculinity\n\nIn the Fight Club film, Tyler makes numerous comments regarding consumerism and identity. For instance, when travelling in a bus, he makes a comment on a Calvin Klein advertisement. Tyler uses the advertisement to bring out his perception on what men ought to look like. In his elaborative book, Masculinity and Culture, Beynon goes ahead to coin a new word, viz. “mediated masculinity” (64).\n\nHe shows the different ways that media portrays masculinity. Today, media has a significant influence on masculinity. Different media presentations and advertisements portray masculinity in different ways making it hard for people to identify the real and ideal masculinity. For instance, in a bid to come up with a mental representation of Tyler, Jack almost buys to the masculine ideas brought out by media.\n\nAccording to Jack, Tyler carries all the ideal qualities that he believes a real man ought to portray. He has everything that entails masculinity and that Jack lacks (Lee 418-421). It would be correct to assert that Tyler is a super-masculinized replica of Jack. At the end of the film, Tyler returns in a more advanced masculine state. His muscles are well pronounced and he has shaved his head as a symbol of asserting his masculinity.\n\nCastration and masculinity\n\nFight Club refers to castration as one of the aspects that kill male identity. In the later scenes of the film, Tyler makes some remarks on Jack’s house after it is destroyed. He tells Jack to relax and be thankful that nothing worse happened like a woman cutting off his manhood and disgracefully tossing it out of a speeding vehicle ( Fight Club ).\n\nAccording to this remark, Tyler shows that material things do not necessarily portray masculinity. In spite of Jack losing his house, he still has his masculinity. Losing manhood is one of the ways through which men may lose their masculinity. Throughout the film, Tyler shows how castration is a major threat to masculinity by threatening to chop off the manhood of those men opposes his policies of the project mayhem.\n\nTyler feels that people in the higher echelon of capitalism are responsible for the rampant emasculation witnessed in the society. Therefore, to ensure that he overcomes this emasculation, he threatens the perpetrators with castration. Later in the film, Jack kills himself as away of eliminating Tyler ( Fight Club ).\n\nIn a way, this move symbolizes castration. Tyler possesses numerous masculine qualities that Jack lacks. Hence, to do away with these qualities, Jack opts to kill himself as an avenue to eliminate the masculinity attributes in Tyler.\n\nMale bonding\n\nFight club brings out numerous insights into the elements that underscore the current mode of bonding amongst men. Throughout the film, men relate with one another by shunning what they perceive to be feminine. In one instance, Tyler and Jack discuss their fathers and the responsibilities bestowed on them as men.\n\nJack claims that his father abdicated his responsibility as a parent by leaving him in the hands of his mother for upbringing. Rather than taking care of Jack, the father went out to marry numerous women.\n\nOn the other side, Tyler goes on to claim, “We’re a generation of men raised by women; I’m not sure if another woman is what we need” ( Fight Club ). This aspect signifies the level to which men in the capitalistic society are trying to do away with issues to do with feminism as a way of retracing their masculinity. They feel that associating with women would make it hard for them to regain their masculinity.\n\nCapitalism has made it hard for men to have a father figure that acts as their role model. Hence, the modern man is turning to media in pursuit for a male role model. Throughout his early life, Jack lacked a father to look upon as his role model. Hence, he did not develop a burly male bond. Therefore, to ensure that he develops a male bond, Jack opts to only associate with fellow men and do away with women.\n\nTyler goes on to claim that he has not managed to achieve all the expectations bestowed on him by his father (Palahniuk 67). He posits that at different stages in his life, he is expected to complete his college education, get a job, and marry. Nevertheless, he asserts that he is not ready to get married since he still feels immature.\n\nDue to lack of proper fatherly upbringing, Jack and Tyler are incapable of assuming their responsibilities as men. Fight Club shows how capitalism is leading to the emergence of a generation made up of “eternal adolescents” (Palahniuk 69). There is no paternal bond between fathers and their sonnies.\n\nThe overriding bond between the two protagonists underscores another type of attachment in the film. Prior to learning that Tyler is a replica of Jack, one may treat the two as different personalities. At the beginning, jack views Tyler as the exact opposite of himself. Later, he develops interests in Tyler’s entire viewpoint on life and perceives him as his chance to snub capitalism and its weakening effects (Palahniuk 45).\n\nAnother male bond stands out conspicuously in the fight club. Jack is strongly attached to the cohorts of the project mayhem. Initially, the bond between Jack and Bob is emotional, but later it becomes violent upon the establishment of the fighting club. The establishment of the fighting club brings together men from different backgrounds that are tied together by their desire to surmount the emasculation caused by consumerism.\n\nAs the film progresses, the fight club transforms into project mayhem, that is, a group established with the sole objective of fighting capitalism, which the group members perceive as the main cause of their emasculation.\n\nConclusion\n\nFight Club brings out the current level of emasculation caused by capitalism as well as the possible risks posed by the current crisis. Capitalism and its effects receive a vehement condemnation throughout the book as well as the film. The film blames capitalism for the prevailing meagerness of the contemporary masculinity.\n\nMichael Clark warns that violence would do little to help in curbing the current level of emasculation that men are experiencing. Rather than resulting to violence and discrimination, Clark assets that the way out is probably “not to battle consumerism, but to abandon it, to begin increasingly making other, non-consumerist kinds of choices, within the web of relationships that constitute our…communities of life” (“Faludi, Fight Club” 74).\n\nAccording to Clark, men ought to come up with solutions that involves all the stakeholders rather than excluding women in their struggle (“Faludi, Fight Club” 76). This move would help in bringing together the two genders to solve a common problem.\n\nIt would help men to shun from engaging in self-destructive activities like the establishment of fight clubs. Instead, both men and women would come up with strategies to reignite the sense of social efficacy, thus encouraging cooperation and somehow convince men that their masculinity is not under threat.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBeynon, John.

      "“The Role of Native Language Phonology in the Production of L2 Contrasts” by Eckman and Iverson Critical Essay\n\nIn their article, Eckman and Iverson (2013) present the research conducted to confirm or deny particular hypotheses regarding the acquisition of the contrast between English [s] and [ʃ] among native speaking Koreans and Japanese. The authors provide adequate literature research and explain the background, clearly identify the topic and hypotheses, describe the study itself and discuss its findings; although the article does have some drawbacks, it is still a well-written one.\n\nSummary of the Article\n\nThe study by Eckman and Iverson (2013) focuses on the way how the contrast between [s] and [ʃ] (as in English words sip versus ship , for instance) is manifested in the native languages of the participants. Although in both languages, the phones [s] and [ʃ] are present, and both in Korean and Japanese /s/ is pronounced as [ʃ] before the high front vocoids, the significant difference can be observed.\n\nWhile this rule is allophonic in Korean ([s] and [ʃ] are distinguished as the allophones of /s/), it is neutralizing in Japanese (the contrast between these two sounds is merged). In both languages, s-palatalization can be observed but it is manifested in different ways.\n\nConsidering all of this, Eckman and Iverson (2013) state that Korean and Japanese are expected to have different paths in acquiring the contrast between [s] and [ʃ], as well as make different types of mistakes. In other words, the mistakes and the way, in which every participant will acquire the contrast, are predictable due to the character of the same contrast in their native languages.\n\nThe authors assume that Korean participants will apply the rule of perceiving [s] and [ʃ] as allophones of /s/ to English words, which, as a consequence, will lead to errors. Japanese, on the contrary, will apply the rules of their own language, which result in other errors. As the authors conclude, Korean participants will make so-called NL transfer errors when /s/ is pronounced as [ʃ] before high front vowels while Japanese participants will make hypercorrection errors when /s/ is pronounced as [s] even when it should be pronounced as [ʃ].\n\nOn the basis of these statements, hypotheses are created. To test those, the authors have chosen 49 learners of English, 23 of whom are Japanese and 26 of whom are Koreans. To gather data, the stimuli of 90 words and a program created in MATLAB have been used. The last one was needed to communicate with the participants: show a set of pictures and give commands, such as Wait or Speak , for example.\n\nThe data was recorded at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, and after that it was transmitted to the Ohio State University where the assistants who received it knew nothing about the hypotheses. In the end, the hypotheses turned out to be correct.\n\nCritique of the Article\n\nTo start with, Eckman and Iverson (2013) clearly initiate the topic, tell why the study is important and prove that the same issue has not been addressed yet. Besides, the article has a precise structure and is organized conveniently. It is easy to navigate, even though the article is quite long.\n\nThe introduction is not lengthy and contains all important ideas of the study, which are discussed briefly and laconically. The background part is rather important: it provides both good literature research showing what has already been done on this topic and explains particular characteristics of Korean and Japanese languages, which are needed for the study. It should be noticed that only relevant characteristics are provided, without any redundant information.\n\nThe study is described clearly and in details. No questions have arisen regarding the way in which the study was carried out or how the participants were chosen. Additionally, the level of language of the respondents is indicated. As for the research itself, it was conducted wisely.\n\nThe authors’ aim was indeed to test hypotheses, not just confirm them. All data gathered during the study was transmitted to assistants who knew nothing about the hypotheses created by the authors. Hence, the final conclusion was drawn based on bare facts, without any bias.\n\nHowever, the study also has several drawbacks. First of all, specialized terminology usually is not identified, which is why an individual without more or less deep knowledge in the topic will need to conduct additional research to define unknown words and concepts. Secondly, while the research itself is described in details, the methodology is not clearly determined. The article does not tell about the research method or research design, for example.\n\nFinally, no limitations or constraints of the study are identified, as well as no directions for the further research are suggested. For example, knowing how the contrast between [s] and [ʃ] is acquired among native speaking Koreans and Japanese, the authors could have suggested what other aspects of the same languages should be investigated or what other languages should be taken into account.\n\nStill, all of the drawbacks mentioned above are insignificant and do not deny the importance of the study conducted by Eckman and Iverson (2013). The article can serve as a strong base for further research and has already been cited in several related works.\n\nReferences\n\nEckman, F., & Iverson, G. K. (2013).

      "In what ways did Globalization affect financial management? Essay\n\nThe integration of regional economies through trade was generally seen as a unifying factor due to the reduction of international trade barriers. The objective was to increase material wealth of the people improving the economies of the nations through good global relations, competition and specialization.\n\nAccording to Clark (1998, p.482), globalization refers to the process driven by political, socio-cultural, economical, technological and biological factors with an aim of creating free trade within the nations of the world.\n\nEconomist and social scientists speculated a growth in almost all the sectors of economy such as finance, agriculture, information and technology, politics and governance, medical and educational sectors with respect to human rights and biodiversity.\n\nHowever, these projected benefits of globalization were later watered by critics who argued that it is a movement aimed at, not only lowering people’s standard of living through ethnic conflicts, urban decay and poor health, but also one leading to criminal violence, terrorism, illegal trade, environmental degradation and economic meltdown (Fiss, & Hirsch, 2005, p.30).\n\nHowever, as the paper tables, though globalization has its strengths that cannot be compromised, it is also worth highlighting how it has significantly affected the financial management of the US in several ways during the recent witnessed recession.\n\nEffects of Globalization\n\nDuring the recent witnessed recession in the US, globalization came in as a disaster that significantly favored the recession. The disastrous financial and economic problems in the USA and widespread protest against the World Trade Organization (WTO) and consumer boycotts in the developing countries were due the hazards of globalization whose concepts were regarded positive.\n\nWhile globalization has its own merits, the paper tables the many ways, both positive and negative, that it affected the aforementioned issue of recession in the US.\n\nGlobalization has created a different situation in USA according to a poll conducted for Wall Street Journal and NBC news in, 2008. Its impact has been so great on jobs and career in the financial sector such as banking, finance, insurance industries and their intermediaries in addition to securities, commodities and other investments.\n\nThus mutual distrust amongst major financial institutions in the global market for inter-bank loans created credit crisis in the US, which made it difficult for the banks to receive loans (Pascal, & Bob, 1993, p. 25).\n\nFinancial service sectors were consolidated and restructured in an attempt to improve and increase their productivity and the capacity to compete on regional and global markets thus increases employment in the other sectors. This extensive merging of firms displaces several workers with some remaining jobless.\n\nTherefore, the act of seeking economies of scale by financial service sector adversely influences the ambition and wish of Americans who were eying the sector.\n\nFor instance, prior to recession employment in the insurance branch was estimated to rise by about seven percent between 2006 and 2016, but this was constrained only by corporate downsizing, and automation. This means that any job opportunity in the sector would mainly be to replace departing or retiring workers (Armstrong, 2000, p.466).\n\nSince financial sector has been the epicenter of the financial and economic crisis in the USA, its job opportunities have been strongly affected to an extent that the banks minimize the layoffs from independent mortgage brokers and other independent contractors who provide subcontracting services to such financial institution.\n\nHence restricting the number and type of mortgage on sale through brokers by offering top rates only to customers who approach them directly, this tends to marginalize mortgage brokers by stopping them from offering loans as a means of denying them jobs (Thompson, 1999, p.141).\n\nEven though the banks showed that this was a reflecting move towards conservative business practices, it was only a mere move to eject more workers from the banking sector while the real cause was globalization.\n\n“The economic fate of workers initially depended on the fate of national economies” (Fiss, & Hirsch, 2005, p.44). However, with globalization, they are compelled to “compete directly in the global job market where wages do not depend on the failure or the success of the individual economies” (Wade, 2001, p. 325).\n\nGiven that industries have to improve their products by skillfully applying technology in order compete effectively, jobs, wages and income distribution reduces In addition, job insecurity increased as people were under pressure of losing their jobs to competition.\n\nConsequently, this resulted to lower standards of living. Employed persons in the financial sector were therefore disturbed with the threats of business being outsourced.\n\nGlobalization has created economic liberalization where workers can emigrate and take jobs in industrial countries and/or work in outsourced industries in their home countries (Bhagwati, 2004, p.34). Most of the US nationals have therefore lost jobs due to cheaper labor provided by these emigrants, some whom are political refugees.\n\nHowever, this has mainly hurt “unskilled labor lowering the quality of life due to growing gap between the income of the rich and the poor” (Reinsdorf, & Matthew, 2009, p.25). Notwithstanding substantial proportions of labor, forces of many nations are in fact working in the USA despite difficulties.\n\nMoreover, globalization has led to human mobility opening the airways to the transcontinental movement of infectious diseases in the US. For example due to immigration about five hundred thousand the US national had suffered from the chagas disease. In addition, since good health is vital to any type of job, people were compelled to drop the jobs (Daly, 1999, p.36).\n\nThe mobility of highly skilled professionals is so high that the US financial opportunities attract the attention of professionals from almost all the nations in the word. For instance, a Kenyan doctor can act as a secretary to American doctor other than treating Kenyan patients simply because of high salary.\n\nThis leads to brain drain, which has a negative effect of denying the US nationals those opportunities hence fewer individuals may want to undertake courses related to finance as a career (Fiss, & Hirsch, 2005, p.50).\n\nAlthough the US state of joblessness is considered a factor of financial crisis, some causes and consequences have resulted from business practices.\n\nBusiness process outsourcing enabled cheaper services jobs but displaces some service sector jobs because globalization has allowed the US corporation to spread service jobs from high cost locations to less developed economies to benefit from cheap manpower hours. Consequently, less jobs in high cost locations while, creating great economic activities in the poor countries (Clark, 1998, p.492).\n\nMoreover, the surplus in cheap labor together with an increased number of companies has weakened labor union in the USA. The unions have become ineffective due to reduced membership and power to question the corporations.\n\nThese corporations can easily replace workers or even stop offering unionized jobs. For instance, accountants, editors and even programmers have lost jobs due to outsourcing to cheap locations (Reinsdorf, & Matthew, 2009, p.28).\n\nGlobalization has affected the USA strongly due the strong sense of individualism and insufficient social spending by the government. It led to the collapse of subprime mortgage market in the USA resulting into a greater global financial crisis and recession.\n\nIt is noted that failed regulation of Wall Street’s Investments bank and government deregulation were the contributors to the subprime mortgage crisis, which made the USA citizens to lose jobs. This effect was due to financial interdependency.\n\nIn addition, the government has reduced the expenditure on the finance sectors while increasing the spending on military installations. Notwithstanding, the US government spent about seven hundred dollars to permanently install Kandahar Air Field in Afghanistan, in 2009 (Fiss, & Hirsch, 2005, p. 28).\n\nAlthough some sectors of US economy have benefited out of globalization, it has mainly benefited few in the finance sector due to profit maximization. However, there are no significant pros of globalization to the financial sector in relation to jobs and careers in the same.\n\nLack of proper management of the globalization process in the US was the main “cause of the Great Recession in the US and subsequently in many other nations” (Francis, 2001, p.89). Many Americans wondered the suitability and inevitability of globalization while others considers the relative decline in the US power as being due to its high trade imbalance because of globalization.\n\nIt is therefore worth believing that it has destroyed the national industry and jobs, as claimed by reformists and revolutionists who argued that income inequality of the nations is due economic globalization (Pascal, & Bob, 1993, p.30).\n\nReferences\n\nArmstrong, D.

      "The Notion of Educational Philosophy Report (Assessment)\n\nThe concept of education is categorized as the most dignified and crucial human undertaking. This is because all the extra goings-on have been built on education. The importance of education can be clarified by the fact that in the eventuality of eternity, it will still go on.\n\nEducation helps people to attain their utmost potentials whether communal, personal, corporeal, spiritual or intellectual. One factor that evidently discerns animals from humans is the ability of being skilled. One advantage that education has is that it changes a person and in the process lets the individual effect the transformation in their setting.\n\nThe notion of educational philosophy may be used to refer to philosophy that is practical to edification as a particular part of human undertakings.\n\nThis entails bringing forth the significant manifestations that may commonly typify the concept of philosophy in a manner that may offer direction and sway the array of tenure as well as familiarities that are commonly called edification. The existence of philosophy of education is not within a vacuity but within a specific chronological as well as communal perspective (Armstrong, Henson, & Savage, 2009).\n\nThe process of learning is founded on interdisciplinary aspects that amalgamate inventiveness, supposition as well as realism. This approach lays emphasis on the part played by visualization in the learning process and the ability to build up the thinking capabilities that incorporate a logical as well as innovative factor into an individual.\n\nThe stipulated goal of the educational philosophy is to endow youngsters with a strong foundation which they may use to enhance themselves into ethically conscientious, liberated and integrated persons. It may also enable all youngsters to attain satisfaction by realizing his/her distinctive fate. The fact remains that tutors as well as institutions are proffered substantial autonomy to delineate the curriculum within any given institution.\n\nThe process of learning ought to stick to the procedures that are complacent with the stages that an individual undergoes right from childhood. This enables an individual to understand properly, the formula that is the ultimate goal in the never ending pursuit of edification. By undergoing the various stages of education that was earlier defined by Piaget, an individual would go through the three distinct stages of development.\n\nThese stages lay emphasis on the impartial improvement of creative, cognitive as well as realistic proficiencies i.e., heart, head and hand (Dewey, 1938). In these cases, it is accentuated that the tutor has the liberty to enhance more resourceful techniques.\n\nThese techniques are applicable in the stages that involve early childhood tutoring, basic and secondary stages of edification. This is evidently the most efficient method which many people will agree since the first stage takes place through replication. This is whereby the tutor offers the child a healthy setting as well as realistic activities to engage in. The infants ought to be exposed to good things initially.\n\nThen comes the elementary or basic stage which is focused on arts and the focal point is the tutor’s innovative influence. At this stage, the youngster ought to come across splendor.\n\nFinally the most crucial and determining stage is the secondary stage. This stage of edification is aimed at enhancing the mental power, decision making abilities as well as the matter-of-fact optimism of the individual. At this stage in the process, the young adult ought to face reality.\n\nReferences\n\nArmstrong, D., Henson, K., & Savage, T. (2009). Teaching Today: An introduction to Education.

      "Starbucks Marketing Plan for VIA Instant Coffee in India Report\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince ages Indians have been more inclined towards tea rather than coffee. As such, marketing coffee in India can be a tough job. But owing to the marketing strategies of companies like Starbucks, a trend of coffee drinking has started picking up, especially among the younger generation.\n\nIt should be understood that the market trends differ from country to country. The existing managerial literature proves that the marketing strategies available for internalization are not basically the same across cultures (Cayla & Arnould, 2008; Mitra & Golder, 2002).\n\nThis report analyzes and justifies a marketing plan for the introduction of Starbucks VIA instant coffee into the Indian market. Appendix 1 demonstrates the graphical representation of the marketing plan.\n\nVIA instant coffee is a venture that has been over two decades in the making for Starbucks as the corporation readied itself to have a commanding market share in the $21 billion instant coffee market (Business Pundit, n.d.).\n\nThe major reason behind Starbucks decision to introduce the product is to capture the immense consumer market available in India as the country is home to at least 1.03 billion people and is the second most populated country in the world after China (Johnson & Tellis, 2008).\n\nIn this report, we shall analyse the performance of Starbucks using SWOT and PESTEL analysing methods.\n\nCompany Overview, Mission & Objective\n\nStarbuck’s principal mission is “…to inspire and nurture the human spirit – one person, one cup and one neighbourhood at a time” (Starbucks Company Profile, 2011 para. 4).\n\nMarket Analysis/Audit\n\nExternal Audit\n\nThis kind of audit is done on variables that the organization cannot control. One of the most commonly used tool for analysing the market of any product is PESTEL. It means the Political, Economical, Social, Technological, Environmental and Legal aspects that may affect any business.\n\nFigure 1: PESTEL Analysis\n\nEconomic\n\nIndia is currently the fifth largest economy in purchasing power parity, not mentioning its growing middle class and youth with more disposable income (Johnson & Tellis, 2008).\n\nPolitical\n\nIndia is a huge democratic country and the government is engaged in the welfare of its citizens through various economic policies. The infrastructure system of India is becoming better day by day.\n\nTechnological\n\nIndia is a fast developing country and as such, the modern technological inventions are being adopted in all spheres of life.\n\nSocial-cultural\n\nStarbucks may experience uncertainty avoidance from local consumers due to the predominantly Indian tea-drinking culture. The company may also face a cultural distance between its own marketing strategies and those of its partners in joint ventures (Heerden & Barter, 2008). Mistakes arising from misunderstandings of Starbucks brand names in the speciality coffee industry may also arise.\n\nThe enormous diversity of India, which is typified by inconsistent policies and social-economic inequalities, may also serve as a hindrance (Johnson & Tellis, 2008). As groundwork for foundation, Starbucks has been engaged in some social activities in India.\n\nAccording to Sandra Taylor, Senior Vice President of Starbucks’ Corporate Social Responsibility observed, “We have one effort with our Tazo division and with Mercy Corps, where we are supporting projects in 24 villages in Darjeeling, India, a tea-farming area. One project is to improve water and sanitation.” (As cited by Michelli 2006, p165).\n\nLegal\n\nIndia has stringent policies regarding foreign-owned businesses.\n\nEnvironmental\n\nThere are many social groups in India that are engaged in the preservation of the environment against pollution. These groups stage protests against companies that are responsible for any kind of pollution. If Starbucks has to face such protests, it will tarnish the company image. But since Starbucks follows the ‘Fair Trade Movement’ policy, it doesn’t have to worry.\n\nMarket trends: According to BusinessWire (2011), “…the market for coffee in India has been growing steadily as consumers are becoming more acceptable towards international and premium brands” (para. 4).\n\nInternal Audit\n\nThis type is done on variables than can be controlled by the organization\n\nCurrent Market Position\n\nStarbucks is the unparalleled market leader in the coffeehouse business, operating more than 17,000 retail outlets in over 55 countries around the world (Starbucks Company Profile, 2011).\n\nTarget Market\n\nTraditional target market for Starbucks includes the “affluent, well-educated, white collar customers” between the ages of 25 and 44. As the company expand internationally, an emergent target market consists of the “younger, less well-educated customers in a lower income bracket” (Moon & Quelch, 2003).\n\nProfit Margins\n\nThe company posted a 28% increase in fourth quarter profit of the 2011 fiscal year on sustained strong sales at existing retail outlets. For the quarter, “…Starbucks earned $385 million, or 47 cents a share, up from $278.9 million, or 37 cents a share, in the same 2010 period” (Andrejczak, 2011 para. 1).\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nStrengths Analysis\n\nTaking advantage of opportunities\n\nStarbucks VIA instant coffee provides a good opportunity for entering the rapidly growing instant coffee category that other multinational coffee houses cannot match, not mentioning that the company has a good retail opportunity due to its foodservice and product line-up (Thompson & Arsel, 2004).\n\nStrong financial base\n\nStarbucks is a very profitable enterprise reinforced by a strong financial base, thus allowing the entity to expand globally through undertaking new business ventures.\n\nInternational recognition\n\nStarbucks brands in the speciality coffee industry has won international recognition. The company continues to maintain a global presence. Its extensive brand recognition has turned into brand preference and eventually into brand loyalty, assisting the company to maintain a strong customer base (Johnson & Tellis, 2008).\n\nWeaknesses Analysis\n\nWeak position in the Indian market\n\nThe company is yet to make inroads into the Indian tea-drinking culture and it is expected that it may meet challenges trying to establish itself (Johnson & Tellis, 2008).\n\nHigh concentrations in the United States\n\nThis implies that the company may suffer great financial losses if the U.S. retail stores underperform because of harsh economic conditions or intense competition.\n\nOpportunities Analysis\n\nOpportunities for Global Expansion\n\nStarbucks can expand its revenue base by expanding its global operations in countries with rapid economic growth such as India and China (Johnson & Tellis, 2008).\n\nCo-branding\n\nStarbucks can enter into brand-franchising agreements with other partners in emerging markets to boost its sales, reputation and competitiveness (Johnson & Tellis, 2008).\n\nThreats Analysis\n\nHighly competitive market\n\nThe main competitors of Starbucks in India are Cafe Coffee Day and Barista.\n\nSocio-political Groups\n\nThere are certain social and political groups that are opposed to foreign products. Even though the number of such groups is limited, they can create unnecessary nuisance.\n\nAssumptions\n\nAssumptions are critical in any marketing plan as they function to standardize the planning environment (McDonald & Keegan, 2002). This plan assumes that: VIA instant coffee will achieve a market segment of 10 percent before December 2012 as Starbucks engage more partners and franchises in the Indian market. Price competition for the instant coffee market in India will force price levels down by 15% across the board\n\nMarketing Objectives & Strategies\n\nMarketing Objectives\n\nCreating a Starbucks experience that makes customers in India to visit established outlets for the coffee, stay for the striking environment, and return for the connection\n\nTo build an image and reputation separate from competitors aimed at creating brand loyalty\n\nMarketing Strategies\n\nStarbuck’s market strategy revolves around “…a deal to buy coffee beans from Tata Coffee, an Indian Company, and work with that firm’s affiliates to open stores in hotels and inside other retail stores” (Bajaj, 2011 para. 2).\n\nSegmentation & Positioning: Venkatesh (2011) notes that “…market segmentation is a strategy in which a large heterogeneous market is broken down into small homogenous segments and a separate marketing program is developed for each segment” (p. 15). The market segment selected for VIA instant coffee is the high-end consumer segment and the strategy used will be price discrimination.\n\nEstimation of Expected Results\n\nIt is expected that the introduction of VIA instant coffee into the Indian market will assist Starbucks to rapidly expand its retail operations and increase growth in its speciality sales and other operations. It is also expected that customers will achieve higher satisfaction levels\n\nIdentification of Alternative Plans and Mixes\n\nAlternative Plan\n\nBased on initial sales of VIA instant coffee, the company may decide to introduce a new instant coffee product to target the middle class. Sheth (2011) observes that “the new middle class, especially in large population markets in China and India, is creating large-scale first-time buyers of everything” (p. 167).\n\nMarketing Mix for VIA Instant Coffee\n\nProduct\n\nThe product – VIA instant coffee – falls under the category of convenience products since it can be purchased from selected retail outlets and supermarkets. It lacks the signature bitterness and darker-roast temperament of brewed Starbucks coffee, thus is seen as an excellent choice to compete in traditional tea-drinking cultures such as India (Business Pundit, n.d.).\n\nPrice\n\nVIA instant coffee will be marketed to the higher-end consumer bracket, thus will retail at a premium price. The company wishes to use the high price tag to demonstrate the high value of the product and its commitment to adequately satisfy customer needs and demands. Chan et al (2010) are of the opinion that an effective price discrimination strategy communicates the unique value of a particular product to the customers.\n\nPlace\n\nThe place where a product first premiered and the distribution networks that exist to ensure the product is adequately restocked are critical success factors for any internalization exercise (Chandrasekaran & Tellis, 2008; Douglas & Craig, 2011). VIA instant coffee is set to premier in the cities of Mumbai and New Delhi due to their affluent upper class and high population rates.\n\nPromotion\n\nPromotional activities are critical in exposing the product to the local audience and in targeting marketing communications with the view to elicit positive responses from the targeted audience (Narayan & Manchanda, 2009). Starbucks promotional activities revolve around the word of mouth.\n\nBudget\n\nMarketing and other related activities are costly and, as such, organizations intending to launch new products into global markets must prepare adequately if they are to succeed in their endeavours. Starbucks financial objective obligates management to use the lower store-opening costs model (of up to $ 315,000 per store) when expanding to ensure that expenditures do not exceed returns (Moon & Quelch, 2003; Keller, 2011).\n\nFirst Year Implementation Programme\n\nStarbucks will embark on partnering with local enterprises that share in the values and commitments of the company. The product will be initially introduced into two of such partnerships in Mumbai and New Delhi to evaluate uptake before comprehensive roll-out strategy into other major cities across India is kicked off in Mid March 2012.\n\nAlthough TV commercials will be aired in mainstream channels to introduce the new product, the main promotional strategy will be through word of mouth. A Market research survey will be done in September 2012 to assess customer attitudes and market share.\n\nConclusion\n\nStudies demonstrate that most organizations target to enter international markets not only to exploit their existing competitive advantages (Tsai & Eisingerich, 2010; Mayrhofer, 2004), but also to sustain and develop their strategic positioning (Couturier & Sola, 2010; Gregory, 2002).\n\nOther factors, such as profits and growth targets, international market opportunities, economies of scale, intense competition in traditional markets, saturated existing market and proximity to global consumers, may also account (Hollensen, 2010). With the introduction of VIA instant coffee into the mainstream Indian market, Starbucks will not only be aiming to enhance its competitiveness but also its strategic positioning.\n\nList of References\n\nAndrejczak, M., (2011).

      "Global Economy & Security: China’s Aggression and Insecurity Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Case of China\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nIncreased economic integration due to movement of people, goods, capital and ideas has led to a global economy. A global economy presents many and unique challenges to various countries. The bigger the markets the bigger the profits; leading to an availability of greater wealth and capital to invest in development (Globalization 2011).\n\nThe perceived effects of a global economy however excite strong feelings, tempting many people to see it as a potential genesis of global insecurity. Unhealthy competition for resources in the third world, illicit drugs trade, a thriving black market and military competition are perceived as some of the negative influences of the global economy.\n\nThe Case of China\n\nTowards the end of the past decade, China experienced a steady economic growth. China was the fastest growing country in Asia since the beginning of economic reform in 1979; between then and 2001, China’s growth averaged at 10% per annum (Lawrence 2002). China was an upcoming superpower, its fast and steady growth attracted speculation that if China became a superpower, it would pose a threat to the global security.\n\nThis formed the basis of the China threat theory that came up in the beginning of the 1990s. However, Chinas growth plummeted from the average to 10% per annum to less than 6% per annum towards the end of the past decade; this was predicted to impact on the world economy negatively (Hosking 2010).\n\nThe world’s superpowers (i.e. USA and Japan) were worried by China’s growth since such a direction meant competition for world markets, resources, funds, ability to acquire weapons and expand military. It can be argued that economic competition is often related with military competition (Waltz 1993). Oftentimes Ideologies crash too. It worries many that China: a traditional aggressive communist, has powerful weapons at its disposal.\n\nChina’s past and recent aggression has undoubtedly confirmed these fears. China’s government has been using assertively strong language in its sovereignty claim over stretches of international waters near its shores that have been disputed. This has resulted in mounting tension between China and the USA; which stepped in to ensure a fair resolution of the South China Sea disputes, but China dismissed this as an attempt by the USA to contain China (Wasserstrom, 2010).\n\nBefore branding China a threat, considerations should be made that the military superiority sought maybe for different reasons other than war. For many years, China was a powerful country; it built a civilization that was marked by rich innovations and culture.\n\nAfter its fall, China was left impoverished with civil unrest among many other problems. In spite of a fast growing economy, China is expected to direct its energy at solving the internal problems that it faces instead of playing the menace in global security.\n\nConclusion\n\nCompetition and sometimes a crash of ideologies are characteristic of globalization. The recent rapid expansion of China’s military coupled with China’s recent aggressive activities on the high seas left little if no doubt that China could be a threat to the security of other nations, including her (China) neighbors. But one should also not forget that China has the right to develop its military capacity (like any other country for protection) should they feel threatened.\n\nHowever, it is greatly feared by western powers that as the influential power of China Increase, communist ideologies could expand worldwide. In several respects, communist ideologies are immiscible with some aspects that western societies average as irreducible human rights.\n\nThe core principle behind such a conflict between communist and capitalist ideologies lies in the fact that while capitalism has primarily focused on a person; communism seems to consider a country as more important in priority to a person.\n\nReference List\n\n“Globalisation.” Global Education. 2011.

      "STD/HIV Health Promotion Evaluation Plan Essay\n\nEvaluation questions\n\nProcess evaluation\n\nEvaluation questions form the basis on which a health promotion program is driven (Issel, 2009). The following questions have been refined to ensure they provide significant feedback on the program’s quality, utility and impact on the target population\n\nProcess evaluation examines the delivery of a program to its target population (Nutbeam, 2009). In this regard the following questions have been formulated:\n\n  * Has the program been implemented as planned?\n  * What factors influenced the implementation (negative and positive)\n  * What proportion of the target group received the program?\n\nImpact evaluation\n\nThis type of evaluation is aimed to assess the immediate effect of the health promotion program on the priority population (Farell, et al., 2002). Such effects may include levels of knowledge acquired, skills, attitudes and change in behavior. Key questions here are:\n\n  * Have the program impacts been achieved?\n  * What difference did the program make on populations facing the greatest risk?\n  * Have all strategies been appropriate and effective in achieving the impacts\n\nOutcome evaluation\n\nOutcome evaluation is normally carried out at the maturity stage of a program. It seeks to assess long term outcomes such as mortality, morbidity, quality of life and equity (Silva-Sanigorski, Bolton, & Meloni, 2009). Questions prepared for outcome evaluation are:\n\n  * To what extent were intermediate outcomes achieved?\n  * How were the intermediate outcomes achieved?\n  * Did the primary target group receive the greatest benefits of the program?\n\nSTD/HIV Health Promotion Evaluation Plan\n\nGoal\n\nThe primary goal of this program is to reduce prevalence of STD/HIV in men who have sex with other men (MSM).In the case of this program MSM group comprise of gay and bisexual men. Recent Data by CDC, indicate that gay and bisexual men though making up only about 2% of US population, account for most new HIV infections(61% in 2009) (Prejean,et al.,2011; CDC,2011).\n\nTarget populations\n\nThe primary target population is men who have sex with men (MSM) (gays and bisexuals between 20 and 40 years of age without any racial exclusion) living in urban centers. Others are health service provider of gay and bisexual men, gay and bisexual right groups as well as family and friends of gay and bisexual men).\n\nConsistent with best practices and laid down guidelines of similar programs, the objectives of the program are:\n\n  * Discover behaviors likely to contribute to reducing incidences of new infection of STD/HIV in MSM\n  * Increase rates of condom use in gay and bisexual men\n  * Increase STI and HIV testing in MSM\n\nThe desired outcomes of the Health Promotion Program are:\n\n  * Condom culture in gay and bisexual men is developed and maintained\n  * Condom use among gay and bisexual men is increased\n  * Condom use is supported by those who influence sexual activity-porn stars\n  * Regular condom users maintain healthy behavior\n  * Testing and testing services and accessibility to testing is increased.\n  * Adoption of healthy sexual behavior that will promote good health.\n\nActivities\n\nActivities are the operations that are necessary in order to achieve the objectives and overall goal of a health promotion program (Holt, 2009 ; Mckenzie, Neiger, & Thackeray, 2009).\n\nOutcome: Adoption of healthy sexual behavior that will promote good health\n\nKey activities:\n\n  * Sponsorship and participation in gay and bisexual community events.\n  * Celebrity modeling of behaviors i.e. endorsement from prominent gay figures\n  * Interaction and engagement with key community leaders e.g. religious leaders\n  * Sponsorship of gay events or related social activities to communicate safe sex behaviors messages.\n  * Mass communication targeting the gay and bisexual men on safe sex.\n\nOutcome: Promote and increase access to HIV/STI testing services for MSM\n\nKey activities:\n\n  * Increase access to testing services online and offline\n  * Rewards for testing\n  * Social movement to encourage testing, text reminders, viral online marketing\n  * Promote “bring your partner” testing schemes\n\nOutcome: Increase condom use between MSM\n\nKey activities :\n\n  * Media campaign countering unprotected sex in pornography\n  * Promote condom culture through organizations highly influential among MSM\n  * Use of mass communication channels to promote condom use.\n  * Partnership with key health providers for gay and bisexual men\n\nPrimary evaluation questions\n\nThe primary evaluation questions for this program are:\n\n  * Have all the program impacts been achieved?\n  * Was the program implemented as planned?\n\nThese questions will be used to assess whether all the desired short term and intermediate outcomes have been achieved within the stipulated time and whether the program has remained on course as planned. These questions are important because they ultimately determine the preliminary success and/or failure of the program.\n\nProcess , Impact and outcome variables/indicators\n\nAn indicator is a measurable variable of a program activity (Keleher, Marshall, Murphy, & Round, 2003 ; The Health Communicaton Unit (THCU), 2007. The measureable variables of the program are outlined below:\n\nProcess evaluation measurable variables\n\n  * Participation: Number of gay and bisexual men absorbed into the program\n  * Resources distributed: Number of condoms distributed within a particular period\n  * Training session held: Number of training sessions conducted for priority groups.\n  * Reach: Number of gay and bisexual men reached per month\n  * Client/staff satisfaction: Benefit /challenges of the program reported by the target population and implementation staff\n\nImpact evaluation (Immediate impact variables)\n\n  * Levels of Improved health knowledge on gay sexuality. Assessed through knowledge test at the end of a discussion session/discussion. Program aims scores of over 60%.\n  * Levels of Improved protective skills and confidence as reported by participants in open-ended questionnaires. Program aims for high improvements in these areas.\n  * Participants report on their quality of life through survey questionnaires. Project aims for Improved quality of life in the target group\n\nOutcome evaluation: short term impact variables\n\n  * Organizational development: Policy changes, reward systems, number of legislations, made in favor of promoting the health of gay and bisexual men.\n  * Benefits to participants; participant to report at least five benefits\n  * Participants’ satisfaction; program aims for high satisfaction among the respondents\n  * Barriers to participants. As few as possible should be reported\n  * Increase in number of people reached -Target is an increase of about 10% /month\n\nIntermediate outcomes (impact measures)\n\n  * Changes in service utilization: the rate of condom use and positive change in testing numbers in gay and bisexual men\n  * Changes in sexual behavior in gay and bisexual men in pre/post introduction of the program. Change should favor adoption of safer sex practices.\n  * State of knowledge, skills or attitudes; assessed through observation and demonstration of skills and self-report records.\n  * The extent of policy implementation. New policies enacted during on implementation.\n\nOutcome evaluation: long term\n\n  * New infection rate and mortality rate of gay and bisexual gay men. Programs targets double digit decrease in new infections by the completion of the program.\n  * Morbidity/mortality: Death related to HIV/STI positive gay and bisexual men before and after the program\n  * The quality of life according to participants own views\n\nEvaluation design\n\nThe evaluation will be largely process and impact-based and will be executed using a mix of descriptive/non experimental and experimental designs. Process evaluation will emphasize on quality and suitability of the interventions and approaches of the program. A critical aspect of process evaluation will be to determine and track the ‘reach’ of the program.\n\nImpact assessment will be carried out to determine the immediate effects of program’s interventions on the priority population. The evaluation will not involve comparison of the target with control groups as this approach is simply unethical. The choice of this design model is due to the fact that such designs are easier to implement and least expensive (Mckenzie, Nieger, & Thackeray, 2009; Victoria Department of Health, 2009).\n\nThe benefits of the program will be measured before and after implementation of the programs. The program will employ a number descriptive evaluation methodology such as case study, cross-sectional design as well as correlational design and will borrow significantly from established protocols to accelerate implementation and meet reliability and validity requirements.\n\nMethods of data collection\n\nIndividual and community level impacts will be measured using a mix of qualitative and quantitative methods. Qualitative methods entail gathering detailed information that is contextual in nature (Issel, 2009). Quantitative methods present quantifiable result with high degree of generalizability (K.Farell, et al., 2002). The quantitative methods to be used in the program include: mail/telephone surveys, process tracking records, analysis of large datasets as well as direct measure of health indicators mainly STI/HIV.\n\nSome of the qualitative methods expected to be used include: focus groups, in-depth interviews, open-ended survey questions, dairies, consensus building as well as forums/discussion groups/audio/video recording.\n\nActual collection of information will entail questionnaire, surveys, interview conducted in person, by telephone or email, analysis of documents or records to obtain opinion, practices, or belief from the target population. The questionnaires will used to access individual level impacts of sexual behavior, sexual health literacy and quality of life.\n\nMeasurement tools\n\nMeasurement tools expected to be developed and used in the evaluation program include questionnaires, moderators guide for forum sessions, recording forms, observation forms, dairies, survey software, audio recording systems, and government health statistics. Screening tools for STI/HIV will need to be developed to enable on-site assessments. Focus groups, in-depth interviews and observation will be used gather data with behavioral dimensions such as attitudes, opinions, knowledge and skills.\n\nSampling\n\nCluster sampling will be employed as the program aims to cover a large geographical area. Survey areas will be picked from county clusters in target areas. Random sample will be made from these cluster and all individuals included in the survey.Based on funding, the program expects to reach as many gay and bisexual men as possible in major urban cities.\n\nA sample size, sufficiently large enough to produce significant changes will be selected. The sample population will be recruited via online campaign and through gay and bisexual organization. The timeframe for sample recruitment will be defined before embarking on the exercise.\n\nStrength ,Weaknesses & Threats to reliability and validity of measurements\n\nStrengths : The program will be run by highly skilled and knowledgeable coordinators to ensure realization of its intended goals. The program also boasts of a clear goal and objectives augmented with necessary procedure and policy guidelines.\n\nWeakness : Potential weaknesses are limited funding and time constraint. The absence of a control in the program, owing to the nature of the program, means that results will be open to different interpretations.\n\nThere are several possible confounding factors that may affect the reliability and validity of the measurements. History may serve to confound the findings when other events occur between the first and the second measurement. Others are changes in instrument calibration, non-response and changes in participants or values between successive measurements.\n\nThe program coordinator will ensure that all interview themes are approved by statutory vetting agencies. Interview and focus groups will be analyzed by an independent research fellow who will not be involved in other affairs of the program.\n\nPoor response rate are a common problem in many programs (Round, Marshall, and Horton, 2005). Counter measure for poor response include: providing stamps for mail surveys, reward schemes as well as SMS and emails reminders. The program will also favor the use of widely used quality-proven existing data collection tools rather than developing new ones.\n\nApplication of evaluation results\n\nThe evaluation results will be used for:\n\n  * Making progress decision such as abandoning the less successful interventions while concentrating and sustaining the more receptive and successful ones\n  * Device best ways to enhance service utilization\n  * Making necessary changes so as to spearhead realization of the desired impacts\n  * Providing accountability for program funding\n\nReferences\n\nCDC (Centre for Disease Control).

      "Total Supply Net Work of Coca Cola Report (Assessment)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Supply Network of the Coca Cola Company\n 3. Factors Affecting Coca Cola out Sourcing Decisions\n 4. How Coca Cola Company Has Planned for Location of its Capacity\n 5. Reference\n\nIntroduction\n\nA supply network refers to interrelated business processes whose main aim is successful delivery of products or services of an organization to its end users or consumers. The aim of this task is to identify and describe the total supply net work of the Coca Cola Corporation and to identify factors that have influenced its determination of the parts of business to outsource or keep in-house.\n\nThe Supply Network of the Coca Cola Company\n\nCoca Cola Company is one of the biggest multinational companies in the world, with business operations in virtually all independent nations. Busa and Wright (2007, p. 92) states that Coca Cola Corporation has for over a century been manufacturing and selling bottled beverages.\n\nThey further add that the actual manufacturing and bottling of its beverages is carried out by its world wide system of business partners. The Company has local bottling branches in various countries world over where its products are made and packaged for markets in the immediate environs.\n\nIn reality, success of the production network of a company like Coca Cola which acts globally relies mainly on how well the logistics collaboration between partners is working Stangford-Smith, et al. (2002, p. 640).\n\nThese authors argues that the Coca Cola Company maximizes the possible saving possibilities within the European food processing sector through an enhanced collaboration in production systems Stanford-Smith et al. (2002, p. 640). With respect to the supply section the company has automated order taking processes especially in the developed countries.\n\nFor instance, in USA its sales agents does this by entering sales on transportable terminals while out in the field which are in turn transferred automatically to the companies main database Scott (1986, p. 33).This enables the company to maintain a superior customer service and satisfaction.\n\nFactors Affecting Coca Cola out Sourcing Decisions\n\nBusiness out sourcing process refers to situation whereby an organization’s part of its business is done by another partner as opposed to its actual employees. For example, a company can seek I.T services for its business from another organization specializing in provision of services in that field.\n\nAn organization’s decisions regarding business process out sourcing is influenced by many factors which can be economic, social, and political in nature. Russell and Taylor(2005, p. 245) for instance argues that the Coca Cola Company can not in its endeavors to out source reveal its formula to another partner even under circumstances where secrecy is guaranteed.\n\nMost of the factors that have influenced Coca cola Corporation decisions on what parts of its business to out source and which to keep in-house are socioeconomic in nature in that most of the services outsourced are geared towards cutting the cost of operating and enhancing a superior customer service that guarantees satisfaction.\n\nThe company for instance aims at reducing its labour and distribution costs through partnership with companies that specialize in certain kind of business processes like distribution. Government policies also play a critical role in determining how Coca Cola Company makes its decisions regarding business out sourcing process.\n\nHow Coca Cola Company Has Planned for Location of its Capacity\n\nCoca Cola Company capacity is largely hinged on its ever expanding global market floor space and other competitive strategies such as purchasing of own premises like warehouses in its operational bases. In addition to expanding, the company partners with other organizations whose business activities impacts directly upon its activities.\n\nUnited Nations Economic Commission for Latin America for instance points out that various companies in the food and beverage sectors have been breaking into new markets by either competing or partnering with MNCs like Coca Cola UNECLA 2008, p. 67).\n\nReference\n\nBusa, R. and Wright.

References\n\nIntroduction\n\nInformation Technology has revolutionalized the way business is done around the world. The change in business models goes beyond interaction with outside players to encompass how internal processes or players interact. This research paper explores in detail what an ERP solution is. Technology comes with numerous challenges or risks that have to be borne into mind.\n\nTherefore, this paper will further explore the risks involved in implementing an ERP solution. To make clear why, despite some risks, it is worthwhile adopting an ERP solution, this paper outlines the benefits of implementing an ERP System in an organization.\n\nEvery new technology has its own complexities and ERP solutions are not an exception. Through discussing the methodologies used in applying an ERP solution in an organization, the paper helps make clear considerations that organizations have to make when it comes to implementation.\n\nThe final considerations, in this paper, are some of the organizations that have embraced and implemented ERP solutions. From the case studies it is clear that adopting an ERP solution helps improve efficiency and effectiveness in organizational operations.\n\nERP System\n\nERP system is an Industry term that denotes an Information technology solution use to integrate a broad set of activities and resources in an organization. An ERP system basically helps to shape and redefine businesses in the management of vital parts of its core business. The Structure and the information that is accrued from an ERP system facilitate optimal performance necessary for attaining organizational objectives (Betz, 2007, p.83).\n\nERP is an acronym for Enterprise Resource Planning. The main feature of an ERP system is capacity to integrate businesses through application of modern technology and relevant business management practices. The integration of business processes with new information technology is critical towards success in the world of today.\n\nThis integration has been transforming businesses to operate in modern information age. Necessarily to adapt to the new information age, organizations are forced to discard the traditional way of conducting business or managing organizational resources (Betz, 2007, p.90).\n\nAdvancement of information technology has been beneficial to many organizations because it has enhanced service delivery to both internal and external customers. With a touch of new technology, business processes have been made faster and easier thus improving organizational output.\n\nThe ERP system is composed of three aspects; information technology, specific business goals and business management practices (Betz, 2007, p.100). Due to its capability, the ERP is designed to provide much needed facility to geographically dispersed businesses across a multi platform with its functional units.\n\nThis functionality of the ERP system is important and advantageous to all organizations but more particularly to those whose executives have to travel a lot. Due to integrated databases facilitated by the ERP system, executives on the move have access to much needed details to support business decision making wherever they may be (Chorafas, 2001, p. 56).\n\nERP architecture has evolved overtime to enhance a variety of services housed in its individual unit programs. The different functional units of an ERP system have elaborate database and are interlinked as to work in unison under a single umbrella. For utmost output to accrue, the ERP system should be integrated with a facility which allows for flexibility, reliability, security and stability (Chorafas, 2001, p. 79). Apart from the mentioned, the system should also have a global focus.\n\nERP System Implementation Risks or Bottlenecks\n\nBefore implementing or adopting a new technology, organizations have to look into risks associated with the implementation or adoption. ERP implementation involves some major risks. Without proper risks identification and mitigation when implementing an ERP solution, a lot of time, resources and knowledge can be wasted. Early risk identification ensures that success is achieved when deploying an ERP system. A quality culture demands that risks are mitigated long before the actual implementation starts (Grant, 2003, p.39).\n\nSome of the risks or challenges associated with the Implementation of an ERP system relate to the complexity of an application, lack of end user experience and lack of clear job definition for members handling the project. For any systems to successfully be utilized in an organization, good end user support is important.\n\nLack end user support poses a huge risk in implementing an ERP project in an organization (Grant, 2003, p.46). If end user’s are not properly engaged, they may tend to sabotage the project. Workers may basically refuse to use new applications or resort to vandalism in extreme cases.\n\nWithout proper roles specification, the project team can jeopardize the implementation of the ERP system. The project team should be able to grasp and understand the technical complexity of the application they are to implement (Grant, 2003, p.56). Understanding the complexity and role one has to play helps towards better coordinated efforts in the execution of the project.\n\nLack of proper coordination within the project team notwithstanding, poor liaising between the organization’s top management and the project team can also result into project failure.\n\nIn most cases, ERP implementation requires an enabling organizational structure. ERP alone cannot really improve performance in an organization unless all the business functions are made responsive to market demands. Companies or organizations have to restructure their operational processes to fit the functionality of an ERP system. Top management has to believe in the value of an ERP solution i.e. the implementation should be seen as a business initiative (Somers & Nelson, 2001, p.2).\n\nWithout proper top management support and organization-wide acceptance and participation of employees, an ERP system implementation can easily be scuttled.\n\nBased on the two foregoing paragraphs, it should be clear that top management, project team and organizational employees have a stake or a say in ERP implementation. Therefore, problems in implementation can occur in case any of the groups lost project control.\n\nThe risk is highest in case the ERP project team lost control to employees. Secondly, the risk is also highest if top management lost all project control to the project team (Somers & Nelson, 2001, p.2). Control in an organization is very important. It provides for order and delineates a chain of command thus ensuring decisions are only made by authorized individuals.\n\nIt is imperative that the implementation process is well planned and coordinated; bringing all stakeholders on board from the word go. To ensure effective decision making and enabling proper ERP implementation, information collection and dissemination with regard to the system has to be an ongoing endeavor (Stein & Hawking, 2002, p. ix).\n\nThe information collected and disseminated should help all involved understand the technical aspects of the system and developing functionality. A good reporting structure has to be established and the project team allowed enough autonomy necessary for awesome execution. The reporting mechanisms ensure that feedback on the project is shared continually; both upwards and downward communication.\n\nOnce an ERP solution has been implemented, it tends to decentralize and devolve certain functions in the organization. For example, information that was originally not easily accessible to low cadre employees becomes accessible. An ERP system reduces the power distance between top employees and lower cadre employees.\n\nUnless, organizational structure and culture is streamlined, an ERP system may precipitate a crisis in an organization (Brown et al, 2003, 10). The ERP solution demands or leads to the empowerment of lower or middle level employees. Management has to redefine control measures and realign the organization towards a more decentralized power structure.\n\nCosts management is another area an organization has to look into before choosing to implement an ERP system. To set up an ERP system, an organization has to spend heavily on software, hardware, consultation, implementation costs and training. If costs are not managed properly, an ERP system implementation becomes too expensive. Costs can be managed through identification of right software and using competitive implementers.\n\nManagement has to consider the time available for the implementation of the system. ERP implementation projects are known to take longer than other ordinary Information management systems. The time spent on ERP implementation may cost the company business. Therefore, contigent plans have to be instituted to deal with any possible inconveniences to business due to ERP implementation.\n\nThe final risk consideration management has to make before embarking on an ERP implementation is available house skills. If relevant knowledge and skills are lacking in the organization, the implementation team has to be sourced from outside the organization. Secondly, means that organization has to work on equipping staff with skills necessary before switching to ERP use (Booth et al, 2002, p.7). To effectively deal with these risks, management has to be well versed in change management practice.\n\nBenefits of ERP Systems\n\nDespite the mentioned implementation challenges or risks, an ERP system can benefit an organization in a very big way. An ERP solution integrates the functions in an organization (Accenture, 2004, p. 15). Integration of business processes in an organization is very important.\n\nWhat it means is that department, sections and sectors in an organization can communicate with each other in real time. Employees can access information from other parts of the department on demand without having to follow long bureaucratic processes. How the system integrates the different functions in the organization determines how well they interrelate.\n\nThe efficiency and effectiveness of the interrelations between different units and departments in an organization is what leads to cost reduction and time management efficiency.\n\nWhen time and performance is managed properly with a concern for costs, an organization operates more optimally than otherwise (Booth et al, 2002, p.5). A good ERP solution ensures different departments or divisions in an organization are connected. Interconnectivity makes it easy to share files or to access relevant information. This consequently increases production and performance in the business.\n\nERP solutions assist organizations to fuse business processes from all departments within the organization. Further, an ERP system helps in fusing departmental databases and consolidating then into a central database (Accenture, 2004, p. 17). This is achieved without incurring more costs or wasting much time hence making it easy for accessibility and smooth flow of work.\n\nMerging is achieved by building a database repository that allows integration with a variety of application software. By so doing, business statistics and other information from various departments within the organization becomes accessible from a central point (Accenture, 2004, p. 18). To have an ideal ERP Solution, the system should have an ERP structure which is made up of integrated central database repository in a fused environment.\n\nDay to day management of an organization is simplified by the use of ERP systems. Use of ERP facilitates centralized storage of data; through a process widely known as data warehousing (Ray, 2004, p.77). Data warehousing provides better data accessibility thus management has access to up to date information for better decision making (Mukherjee & Talbot, 2003, p. 12).\n\nAn ERP system plays an important role in supporting strategic planning (Bardhan, 2003, p. 8). Strategic planning is a vital process in any organization because it helps in defining goals and objectives pursued by all in an organization. The strategic planning process leads to the formulation of plans and strategies that guarantee organizational success.\n\nERP systems due to their integration functionality help towards better resource planning and deployment. For instance, costs are easily traced to specific tasks due to integrating financial information. It is noted by Booth et al (2002, p.17) that ERP makes it easy for organization to adopt new management accounting practices. In the human resource department, total employees and their designation is easily established due to centralized data bases. This helps eradicate ghost employee related fraud.\n\nIn large companies, where multiple departments and business units exist, the ERP solution assists in standardizing business information formats across the organization. Standardization of communication tools helps towards effective and efficient communication in an organization. Good communication, both to internal and external players, gives organizations a big edge over competition.\n\nMethodologies for implementing ERP\n\nA variety of methodologies are applicable when implementing an ERP system. Given the complexity of the system, some organizations spend much time agonizing on how to implement an ERP system. Before adopting an implementation methodology, management has to consider risk related to each (Shields, 2001, p.89).\n\nOne way of easily implementing the system is outsourcing implementation to vendors (Somers & Nelson, 2001, p.3).\n\nThere are organizations that specialize in the sale and implementation of ERP systems. Therefore, one easy way of implementing an ERP system is contracting such organizations. Such an option comes with related outsourcing risks e.g. security of confidential organizational information. However, the vendors are professional bodies and with close monitoring, they can do a marvelous job.\n\nAnother fact to consider in choosing an implementation strategy is related costs. Organizations have seen the need of not going it alone when implementing the ERP systems. Joint venture with sister organization or a provider of the System has been a major boost in realizing swift implementation (Shields, 2001, p.97). Joint venture ensures the spread of implementation costs and risks.\n\nHowever, joint venture implementation has its own complications. Therefore, doing alone methodology has been seen to work better. Doing it alone means that the organization carries all the risks. Nonetheless, if the risks are calculated and proper mitigation plans instituted, it is the best methodology for any company (Vaman, 2007, p. 67). Doing it alone involves the company analyzing its financial capability, technical expertise and management policy necessary for the system implementation. By going alone, the company is able to have full control over the implementation procedure.\n\nOrganizations also can choose between either partial or full implementation of the ERP solution (Vaman, 2007, p.77). Depending on the needs of an organization, only certain functions, people or departments can be chosen and appropriate ERP Software used to integrate them. However, depending on resource availability, organizations are encouraged to go for full implementation (Vaman, 2007, p.109).\n\nSteps for success\n\nERP implementation is financial and technical resources intensive (Williams, 2008, p.56). Therefore, for successful implementation and use of an ERP system proper planning is very crucial. ERP project planning allows an organization to identify its peculiar needs.\n\nThe organizational needs or characteristics further frame the organizations goals and business objectives. Financial estimates have to be accurately projected by help of experienced professionals. Given the project is complex and cost intensive, professional project teams have to be established to guide the process.\n\nThe first task of the team is project planning. Project planning provides an opportunity for an organization to re-evaluate project in a more detailed manner (Williams, 2008, p.69). If the project is not justified during the initial planning phase, organization should not hesitate to cancel it.\n\nUser Training and education about the ERP system has to be a continuous concern. This is important in ensuring employees understand what is going on and can thus contribute meaningful in customizing the system as necessary. Training allows users to understand the capability of the ERP software and its documentation (Somers & Nelson, 2001, p.2).\n\nArchitectural design for the system is another critical factor to consider for successful implementation of ERP system. The architectural design determines system relevancy to organizational characteristics. If the design does not respond to organizational characteristics, obviously the project would have failed (Malaga, 2005, p.49).\n\nAn ERP system requires integration with other or existing e-business software. Secondly, the system has to accommodate or conform to legal requirements or procedures. For example, if an organization is security sensitive or the laws of the country are sensitive to security of employee’s personal information, the system has to guarantee the same (Malaga, 2005, p.66).\n\nThe planning process has to give room for proper end user introduction to the system. The Success of the ERP systems is more likely when implementers adopt he phased implementation approach. The complexity of the ERP systems would be easily managed if its implementation is broken down into manageable units.\n\nCase studies\n\nAccording to Accenture (2004, p. 9) most companies that have employed ERP systems are satisfied or happy to have done so. An example of a company that has implemented an ERP system and benefited immensely is NIBCO INC. This is an international company; one of the leaders in flow control (Brown et al, 2003, 5).\n\nThe company is involved in manufacturing of a variety of valves, piping products and fittings which targets; commercial, residential, irrigation and industrial markets (Brown et al, 2003, 3). NIBCO has a diverse manufacturing division. It builds its commodities using a wide material range i.e. from steel, iron and bronze. NIBCO has over the years concentrated on consolidating its distribution chain and increasing markets for its products.\n\nA consolidation of NIBCO services led to increased service and product delivery to its customers and suppliers (Brown et al, 2003, 7). However, the consolidation of processes increased pressure in terms of information management. NIBCO has, over time, concentrated in standardizing its internal operations as well as focusing on customer issues and processes. The company realized that ERP would help it achieve this. ERP was seen as an appropriate technology to improve its operations (Brown et al, 2003, 8).\n\nThe objective for adopting the ERP was to increase customer and supplier participation while lowering the costs of operations. Before adopting the technology, NIBCO customers suffered from late shipments of their products, errors in their orders and information in invoices was inconsistent.\n\nNIBCO’s key marketing concern was to develop a web based platform where customers would easily get market information regarding distribution and promotion of the company’s’ products. The ERP was seen as a better platform to improve its profitability by helping towards efficient delivery on what the customer needed.\n\nThe Implementation of ERP at NIBCO started with the establishment of a strategic IT team, which assessed the need of the system (Brown et al, 2003, p. 12). The team presented its recommendation on the need of the solution and they were adopted by top management. NIBCO implemented the solution a bit fast but in a comprehensive way.\n\nThe implementation of the solution followed a well choreographed strategic plan facilitated by the project team. A dedicated team comprising of IT experts, business manager and change management experts were involved. They worked cohesively and the system went live in 1997(Brown et al, 2003, p. 14).\n\nSince the adoption of the system, many benefits have accrued NIBCO as an organization. For example, there was marked improvements recorded in the processing of sales orders, inventories, and purchases and in production processes (Brown et al, 2003, pp. 15-30). ERP solution was, therefore, able to address and correct NIBCO’s challenges once implemented (Brown et al, 2003, 31).\n\nThe second case study is TransAlta. TransAlta is a wholesale marketing and power generating company. It has 49 facilities based in Australia, Canada, USA and Mexico (TransAlta, 2010). Prior to introduction of SAP solution, the TransAlta Company was using Reliability Centered Maintenance.\n\nThis solution was localized at different locations by the use of point solution. TransAlta wanted an Enterprise-Wide System which would offer strategy development and provide understanding of vital assets, monitor overall risk in the organization and give optimized operations concerning maintenance costs.\n\nThe implementation of the SAP ERP solution involved integrating the existing Reliability Centered Maintenance (RCM) to facilitate wide accessibility (Transalta, 2010). The RCM enabled creation of a central database for the organization that can be standardized across a uniformed platform hence providing optimized maintenance.\n\nThe implementation of the solution has enhanced success in fleet management because information is dispersed to a centralized depository allowing easier communication and accessibility. The RCM solution has motivated staff to work every day in SAP. Consequently, the company can push the RCM methodology and cultivate it deeper within the organization (Bardhan, 2003, p. 7).\n\nConclusion\n\nAdvancement in information technology is a key driver of organizations’ competitive advantage in modern times. It is for this reason that organizations are embracing information technology changes as fast as they can (Accenture, 2004, p. 5). An ERP system plays an integral role in enhancing an organization’s growth. Organizations, which have endeavored to carefully and systematically implement ERP systems, have registered many benefits. One such benefit is fast delivery of services due to integrated processes.\n\nHowever, because of the complexity involved in implementing ERP applications, organizations should have well choreographed plans. The implementation of the system requires closer coordination among all stakeholders. Necessarily, the project management should be left to experts. However, the participation of all employees is very vital.\n\nReferences\n\nAccenture, 2004, The Return of Business Solutions to Pacific Asia: Directing a Blockbuster, Accenture.\n\nBardhan, R.

      "Apple Company’s Present and Future Essay\n\nApple Inc. was started by Steve Wozniak, and it has grown into a multinational company. The Company is located in California U.S., and it designs and manufactures IT software and hardware. The current CEO, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak founded the company in April 1976.\n\nThe success of Apple Company in the early 1970s and 1980s made the company to become a bench market for the industry. This essay will reference Apple Inc. by specifically explaining how the Apple launched and diversified their iPhone products, its distribution and promotional approaches to advance these products.\n\nThe introduction of the iPods, iPhones, and the launching of the table computing with the iPad was what led to this success. The success of Apple was through the company’s detail strategy management, which is a process of thorough understanding of their organization, competitive environment, and implementing their strategies.\n\nThe research involved the company creating objectives, which aided in accessing the organization resources and capabilities as well. It also leads to the exploration of the external environment competitive opportunities and threats. Apple achievement was through focusing on providing high-quality products and services, and at the same time, cultivating good public relationship with their clients in every business deal (Capozzi, Kellen, & Smit, 2012).\n\nThey made sure that they applied those principles of the business to maximize their profits and brand reputation. They remained honesty and truthful to their clients, and they handled their customers and suppliers with due respect.\n\nThey also protected their product copy right by not revealing the company’s confidential information to the outsiders and especially their business rivals. Finally, they conducted businesses in a way that benefited the communities they served by employing high work performance team (HWPT) that remained royal and devoted to the company.\n\nMoreover, the Apple Company had to deal with other forces that affected the PC industry. These included; long term growth, lifestyle and social concern as well as globalization. Additionally, there evolved some key factors that were required by the company in order to obtain compelling profits. These included marketing, skill, technology, manufacturing, and distribution. After considering all these factors, the company was able to compete in global industry.\n\nMoreover, Apple used the macro-environment to determine its success. Internet growth enabled Apple to provide a strong competition to its competitor by staying tuned to customer’s demands and by updating their research through creating new technologies such as Smartphones and tablets (Tariq, Ishrat, & Khan, 2011).\n\nFurthermore, the Apple Company used a type of business model known as “Porter’s Five Forces Model”, which they used as an analysis taken to examine the pressures that were applied to the PC Industry. This enabled Apple to build a loyalty brand with its consumers. Consequently, as the new market expanded due to globalization, the cost of products lowered resulting to rivalry among the competitors.\n\nAccording to Karlgaard (2012), Apples’ prices are quiet higher compared to other PC industry competitors. For example, in 2009 and 2010, Apple’s average net profit margin was 0.2, while HP was 0.07 and Dell was 0.04. The popularity of Apple’s software and hardware systems, as well the iPhone and iPad, resulted to this competitive advantage to the company in the market.\n\nAnother pricing strategy that Apple Company planned and employed was a continual investment research and development, which assisted in improving their current products. The company is also looking forward to expand its distribution methods in order to yield increased and quality sales. The idea behind this move is to provide consumers with quality value products (Helft, 2011).\n\nOwing to the researches of different technologies, various companies have come up with new opportunities that enable low cost manufacturing and innovation.\n\nThis new trend is seen with PC companies like Apple, Amazon, and Android. Through these technologies, quality products are produced leading to increased product cost by the end user. Internet growth is making it easier for consumers to have access to direct sales all over the world. Apple Company own such retail outlets, which allow for constancy of brand image and reputation of product; and this enhances local instant feedback\n\nIn addition, Apple Company enjoys a competitive advantage over reputable brand recognition. The ability of the company to maintain this based brand recognition is the prime power in their brand. Through revolutionary of computer to mobile device, brand recognition enabled the transfer of company’s image from product to product.\n\nMost of the large consumer electronic companies suffer thin profit margins, which is brought about by global competition. Some companies are initially accepting lower profits so as to attain volume sales. Apple Company, together with other top computer makers in the U.S., underwent such distress while they were in the process of product innovation and differentiation in order to raise capital needed for the innovation (Schlender, 2012).\n\nRival companies, such as Microsoft, started producing their own tablets version, which doubled the opposed PC market. To deal with strategic rivals, the Apple Company focused on smaller devices. Further, it had effectively made use of online advertising to advertise and utilize campaigns on its brand, and hence increased the product awareness.\n\nApple Company is also looking forward to attaining prospective profitability. Finn-Enrik says that despite the company being huge, for a large growth, there are some opportunities for tablets and other media devices in the near future in some parts of America and Asia.\n\nThe Apple is also faced with macro-environment such as global factors due to economic conditions, technological factors, legal, demographic societal and lifestyles as well as natural environmental factors. Due to these macro factors, the company suffered a stiff turn down in 2008 and 2009, but it gained a slight recovery in 2010 (Fisher, 2011).\n\nThe US government employed certain measures by encouraging local manufacturers through incentives. The government has employed some measure on cutting down the pollution, which led the Apple Company to set up a recycling plant. These measures of restricting hazardous substances have regulated the production of quality products.\n\nApple Company went on the fore front campaign, by showing social and environmental concerns and challenging on waste disposal.

      "London: History of a Business City Creative Writing Essay\n\nThere is hardly anything as enticing as taking a time travel. At times it seems that there is nothing left of the old-time England in the present-day London; however, when looking closer at what it looked like a couple of centuries ago, one can possibly see the track of London progress. However, embracing the entire city in every single epoch is practically impossible; hence, the points of the time travel will be 1500, 1740 and 1880, while the key sights will be Borough High Street, the City, the Strand and Westminster.\n\nIt is 1500 outside, it is the middle of summer, and it is unbearably hot. It seems especially hot in London; even the Suffolk Place, with its usually stone-cold walls, seems steaming. Just a single step is taken, and the Borough Street devours the traveler with its quietness and semidarkness. It is better not to make much noise here – well-known for its criminal masterminds, the street is quite dangerous (Elmer & Grell, 2004).\n\nFinally, the City appears in its glory, hassle and smell of fish and rotten food. In the middle of a working day, it is hard to stroll down the street in a nonchalant manner – merchants of all sorts, driving carriages or walking on foot, hardly seem to care about manners. Eventually, the City ends, and the brick walls of Somerset Savoy of the Strand shines through. Next goes the Westminster; and, though the brick wall is in the way, it is easy to imagine Henry VII dealing with his monarch issues and dreaming of Anne Boleyn.\n\nThe next stop is 1740. Though nearly 250 years have passed, for a present-day city dweller, this is pretty much like travelling to prehistoric times. The Borough Street, however, has changed a lot – taking a great chunk of St. George’s Fields, it has stretched considerably. What is more important and pleasant, there are less people in there. Perhaps, built up to East Side, it has room for more criminals and their shady deals (Rule & Wells, 2003).\n\nAnd here is the City; to think that it used to be pretty much the entire London! The latter has stretched, squeezing the City to a size of a very small area. By the way, the virus of trade has entered this place as well: one out of eight families trades gin here now. The Strand has suffered changes as well – instead of a has-been first Somerset House destroyed by the fire, St. Mary le Strand is built, and the Westminster has acquired its famous western towers.\n\nAt last, 1880 comes. Sir Horace Jones has taken over the Borough Street. There is no more place or the criminals, and the place is much cleaner. The City is now a small part of huge London. However, merchants are still there – every now and then, one can hear them lavishing their goods, and the Strand welcomes Gilbert and Sullivan’s The Pirates of Penzan .\n\nAs for Westminster, it still remains just as glorious and grandeur, and somewhat corrupt (Stephen, 1996). Queen Victoria reigns now, and it seems that the women of England’s elite have never been as virtuous and pious as in XIX century.\n\nTaking a retrospective on this short but inspiring time travel, one has to admit that London has changed greatly over these centuries, which is quite expected, given the fact that the travel embraced several epochs and four and a half centuries.\n\nHorse-drawn carriages are no longer anywhere in the vicinity, a lot of famous buildings have been demolished and the famous smog has vanished without a trace once and for all together with steamers. However, it is necessary to mention that there is still a certain air of refinement and traditions mixed with a pinch of sensation and a famous five-o’clock in the air. Perhaps, some things are never meant to be changed.\n\nReference List\n\nElmer, P., & Grell, P. O. (2004). Health, disease and society in Europe, 1500 1800: A sourcebook .

      "Agrarian Reforms in the Countries of Latin America Essay\n\nThe twentieth century was the period of many significant agrarian reforms in the countries of Latin America. In spite of the fact these reforms were developed in order to address the interests of peasants and landless rural population, in most cases the definite results of these reforms were not associated with the social and economic aspects, but reflected the peculiarities of the political situation in the countries.\n\nHowever, to have the opportunity to make certain conclusions about the phenomenon of agrarian reforms in Latin America, it is necessary to concentrate on its peculiar features. This paper will focus on the examination of the positive and negative results of the agrarian reforms for the rural population in the countries of Latin America because each process or phenomenon always has two sides of its representation.\n\nPositive Effects of Agrarian Reforms\n\nThe period of agrarian reforms started in Latin America with the Mexican revolution which was developed at the beginning of the twentieth century and ceased with the progress of neoliberal policies in the territories. Providing agrarian reforms, governments were inclined to attract the rural masses and contribute to their political goals.\n\nThat is why the question of the agrarian reforms’ positive effects for all the social classes is rather controversial. The poor peasantry was not discussed as the potential force for the progress in the field of the countries’ economy and agriculture. All the accents were made on the capitalist farmers. Their activity was connected with the income distribution. Thus, the opportunities to invest in agriculture and to develop the land market appeared (Gwynne & Kay, 2004, p. 233).\n\nHowever, the situation changed with the period of neoliberal policies when the governments began to accentuate the importance of privatization land taxes. Thus, the advantages which were acquired by the poor peasantry as a result of the agrarian reforms were incomparable with the benefits which were provided for the developed capitalist farmers.\n\nNegative Effects of Agrarian Reforms\n\nIn spite of definite positive shifts in the sphere of agriculture, the majority of the rural population is not satisfied with the agrarian reforms because the main promises are not completed (Gwynne & Kay, 2004, p. 235). Poverty and landlessness remain the main issues for the rural population of the countries in Latin America.\n\nFrom the social point, the agrarian reforms had not positive effects on the changes in the situation of unemployment and poverty in the territories. From the economic point, many agrarian reforms in the countries of Latin America can be considered as the causes for the development of the further more influential and even dramatic reforms which were the part of the political context.\n\nPeasants remained to be the weakest class in the social system which were also negatively influenced by the implemented land titling projects (Gwynne & Kay, 2004, p. 233). Thus, the agrarian reform in Cuba was closely connected with the revolution and developed in the political field. Moreover, many results of the reforms were rather unexpected for the governors and that is why are difficult to be overcome effectively.\n\nThe agrarian reforms of the twentieth century in Latin America can be discussed from the point of their positive and negative effects on the rural population of the countries. The positive effects are connected with the development of the countries’ market, the change of the position according to the global market, and the role of the capitalist farmers. The negative effects are associated with the position of the peasants and the situation of poverty of the rural population which are more influential from the social point.\n\nReference\n\nGwynne, R.

      "Comparison of the Inaugural Speeches Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Similarities between the two speeches\n 3. Differences between the two speeches\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nNations from different parts of the globe have gone through certain stages before reaching their current state. The inhabitants of other countries have colonized the citizens in most of the nations because of their resources. The acts of colonization were accompanied by several negative impacts on the colonized countries. Among the serious impacts were wars.\n\nWars occurred in an attempt to attain freedom. The war led to financial and economic instability in the concerned countries. Presently, some countries have become economically stable while others are still striving to return to their previous states. The concerned countries have signed treaties amongst themselves while others have sought financial help from their neighbouring stable nations. This paper will give the comparison and contrast between the JFK inaugural address and the Truman doctrine speech.\n\nSimilarities between the two speeches\n\nFirst, both speeches are talking about the same country. The JFK inaugural address is being directed to the new generation of the Americans. The person describes how the United States has been interrupted by wars. The person goes ahead to describe how the old generation has shed blood for their peace.\n\nThe speech describes the efforts that they will put in to ensure that peace and freedom is attained in the neighbouring countries. Brewer denotes in this speech as follows, “let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and the success of liberty” (22).\n\nThe Truman doctrine speech is also focussed on the United States of America. The speaker talks about the impacts of war in Greece. Press denoted in his book that, “Greece is in desperate need for financial and economic assistance to enable it to resume purchases of food, clothing, fuel, and seeds” (18).\n\nThe speaker goes ahead to talk about the efforts of the United States in ensuring their fellow countries resume to their former state. According to the report in the speech, the government of the United States of America funded other countries with $341,000,000,000 to enhance world freedom and peace.\n\nDifferences between the two speeches\n\nIn the JFK inaugural address, the speech is made after the Americans have already attained the freedom that they wanted. The speech is addressed to the citizens of the new generation who never witnessed the blood shed during the time of war. In his book, Sondhaus denotes that, “we observe today not a victory of party, but a celebration of freedom—symbolizing an end, as well as a beginning—signifying renewal, as well as change” (45).\n\nThe Truman doctrine speech was addressed after hearing pleas from Greece. The citizens of Greece were seeking economic and financial assistance from the US. The main motive of the speech was to address the issue of war. The aim of the speaker was to elucidate on the negative impacts of wars. He also wanted to urge the citizens of the United States that it is their responsibility to ensure that peace and economic stability are attained in Greece and Turkey.\n\nAccording to the JFK inaugural address, individuals of a country have a responsibility of ensuring that freedom is attained in a country. The evasion of poverty in a country will depend on the ability of its citizens. Furthermore, the speaker attests that the rights of the citizens of a country emerge from the creator and not the kindness of the country.\n\nPress attests that, “the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state, but from the hand of God” (30). In the Truman doctrine speech, the speaker states that a nation can attain its freedom through assistance from another country. While addressing the Americans, he attests that nations from different parts of the globe look up to the United States for help.\n\nIn this speech, he affirms that “the free peoples of the world look to us for support in maintaining their freedoms”. In the speech, he denotes that if the government of the United States does not assist Greece and Turkey, then the impacts will be much more devastating.\n\nIn the first speech, the speaker urges the neighboring nations on the south of America to join hands with them in ensuring that absolute peace is attained. They also pledge the citizens in the other countries to try their level best to oppose aggression. In the availability of wars amongst nations, peace may not be attained.\n\nThe second speech, which is the Truman doctrine, talks about how the citizens of Greece have been living in fear and horror of attacks. He also talks about the financial aids of different countries in an attempt to bring financial stability in Greece. Even though the country has many resources, it is languishing in total poverty that was brought forth by the colonial governments.\n\nConclusion\n\nConclusively, both speeches have tried to address the negative impacts of warfare. The main theme of both speakers is to tackle the issues of aggression and promote peace and freedom amongst the citizens of various countries. They have also tried to address the importance of sustaining peace in a country. In fact, it is very important to ensure that peace is sustained in various countries of the world. This should be the responsibility of all citizens.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBrewer, Susan. Why America Fights: Patriotism and War Propaganda from the Philippines to Iraq.

      "The Main Guidelines and Industrial Hygiene Concerns Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Worksite analysis\n 3. Exposure limits\n 4. Recognition and control of hazards\n 5. Work practice controls\n 6. Administrative controls\n 7. Training and Education\n 8. Conclusion\n 9. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nDespite that the 21 st century has realized numerous developments in technology, civilization and administration of human safety, calamities are still cropping up. This has called upon the focus on industrial hygiene in the endeavors of ensuring safety of all human kind. Basically, industrial hygiene entails all process of recognizing, anticipation, controlling and evaluation of the workplace conditions.\n\nThis is aimed at identifying and preventing conditions which may cause injury or illness to the workers serving in the station. Various strategies are adopted by industrial hygienists so as to detect the level of worker exposure. Some of the approaches include analytical and environmental monitoring methods.\n\nIn response to the case of New Orleans Hospital which has been affected by the Katrina disaster, the concept of industrial hygiene should be adopted in the recovery process. This is aimed at ensuring optimum safety of all personnel serving at the site. Analysis of the current situation has demonstrated a very devastating condition.\n\nThis is evident in the state of the buildings, equipments, power supply, surgical suites and clinical laboratory among other elements of the hospital. With this in mind, optimum care and expertise should be adopted in addressing the situation and bringing the hospital back to its state. The main guidelines and industrial hygiene concerns in the clean-up process will be adequately addressed in this paper.\n\nWorksite analysis\n\nAn extensive worksite analysis should be undertaken so as to offer an insight on the real situation. This is a very crucial step that should be executed in determining the potential problems. The rescue team should at first be well versed with the real ground situation.\n\nBy undertaking a worksite analysis, the rescue personnel will be able to identify the problem tasks, exposures and risks. It should be noted that the worksite analysis should be undertaken in a very elaborate and intensive manner.\n\nThis should entail all work activities, operations and jobs to be undertaken. In this particular scenario, the clinical laboratory, surgical suites, and pharmacy are filled with debris and trash. This situation demonstrates the massive amount of work that needs to be carried out in the rescue process. An evaluation of cases of public intrusion after the event should also be conducted.\n\nAs evident in the case, muddy footprints and open cabinets signify intrusion by the public thus calling for concern. Based on the current situation, the industrial hygienists and the rescue personnel will carry out research, inspection and analysis on how the physical, pharmaceutical, chemical and biological hazards affect worker health.\n\nInformation gathered from the analysis of the situation will lead to provision of guidelines and recommendations on the appropriate course of action (Nims 27).\n\nExposure limits\n\nWith regards to the messy and tempered state of the clinical laboratory, surgical suites, pharmacy and power terminals in the hospital, optimum consciousness should be held so as to prevent toxic exposure of the recovery workers. It should be observed that all operations within the recovery site should be carried in a responsible, safe and compliant manner. All employees working in the recovery site should be maintained at acceptable exposure limits.\n\nThis is in avoidance of the toxic nature of the physical, biological, chemical and pharmaceutical agents at the site. Some of the main approaches in minimizing the exposures include engineering controls, hazard elimination, administrative controls, and personal protective equipment.\n\nAll personnel should be brought to task in executing this policy on acceptable exposure limits. The organization should be responsible for offering all material resources for protecting the workers at the site (Talty 48).\n\nRecognition and control of hazards\n\nIn light with the ideas of Talty (48), safety of workers in the recovery site should be administered through reduction of employee exposure. Employee exposure can in this case be reduced through appropriate work practice, engineering and administrative controls. In the case of engineering, the rescue team should remove or reduce hazard at the source.\n\nThe workers can also be isolated from the hazard. At the hospital site, a lot of debris, mud and trash have been identified to be scattered in the ground floors. This should be safely removed so as to avoid any toxic exposures or risks to the workers. The surgical suites, pharmacy and clinical laboratory have also been noted to be overwhelmed by debris, trash and public intrusion.\n\nThis might have significant impacts on the wellbeing of the workers due to possible toxic exposures. In response to this situation, these places should be handled with great care. The rescue personnel should remove all toxic chemicals at the site and replace them with less hazardous ones.\n\nOn the other hand, work operations in the recovery site should be confined or enclosed in safe sites. Additionally, local and ventilation systems should be installed. This would ensure comfort and safety of the workers following the tempering of the original state of the offices (Talty 48).\n\nWork practice controls\n\nWork practice controls should also be administered during the recovery process. Some of the key work controls include inspection and maintaining control equipments and processes in regular basis. Workers should also be guided to follow proper procedures which have minimal exposures in executing the recovery process.\n\nImplementation of good house-keeping procedures should also be undertaken which ensures that all activities are accounted for. The concept of good supervision should also embraced, which in this case ensures that good conduct of all personnel is maintained.\n\nFrom another perspective, work practices concerning the issues of drinking, smoking, eating, application of cosmetics, and chewing gum or tobacco should be prohibited in the regulated areas (Nims 27).\n\nAdministrative controls\n\nIn order to ensure optimum safety of the workers, administrative controls should also be undertaken. This can include controlling of employees from direct exposures through the adoption of scheduling procedures.\n\nFor instance, operations with the highest exposures can be scheduled when fewest employees are present. This will ensure highest safety of the employees. The administration should also be steadfast in ensuring appropriate respiratory equipments among other protective equipments (Talty 48).\n\nTraining and Education\n\nIn execution of the rescue process, adequate training and education to the workers should be administered. This should not only be conducted to the workers but also the general public which may be in the vicinity of the rescue process. Some of the information services can be administered through technical advice, audiovisual, and speakers for special engagement.\n\nThrough the provision of education, essential tips on health and safety will offered. The public as well as the workers should be adequately enlightened on how to safeguard themselves from the toxic exposures as well as future incidences (Nims 27).\n\nConclusion\n\nBy adopting the above highlighted recommendations and industrial hygiene concerns, the workers will be able to ensure safety in the recovery process.\n\nThe health of the workers is a priority in the recovery process and should thereby be considered. The basic and most crucial issues of concern are the worksite analysis, exposure limits, training, education and recognition and control of hazards. With adherence to these aspects, efficiency in the recovery process will be realized.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nNims, Debra. Basics of Industrial Hygiene . New York: Prentice Hall, 2009.\n\nTalty, John.

      "The Effectiveness of Public Relations and Relationship Marketing to the Successful Promotion of an International Event Essay\n\nEstablishing effective relationships with customers has become the norm and one of the major challenges for both marketing executives as well as public relations officials. As explained by Pecky (1999) the purpose of establishing good relations with the public is primarily for building strong brand image for the company. Most importantly, public relations is effectively established through relationship marketing.\n\nThere are various tools which can be used in relationships marketing. According to Gregory (2000) the media is one of the most effective tools in managing customer relations. In view of this, Sriramesh (2009) and Guiniven (2007) postulate a number of media theories in relations to public relations issues. Suffice to say that some of these theories were developed during the communist era. While some of the theories are outdated, others, such as the libertarian theory are still relevant in today’s business world.\n\nThis theory as well as other relationship marketing strategies are analyzed in relation to one of the major trade fairs in the world, The London Toy Fair.\n\nFurthermore, the effectiveness and application of the philosophies outlined in this theory as well as other strategies identified herein are evaluated Vis a Vis both the traditional media as well as the emerging web based media, herein referred to as e-media. Finally the essay offers suggestions on the new ways through which The London Toy Fair can utilize unexplored public relations and relationship marketing strategies through e-media.\n\nThe London Toy Fair is among the biggest exhibition event in the UK, and is devoted to toys and children games. Started 58 years ago as a small exhibition event, the trade fair has grown in leaps and bounds and now attracts more than 250 exhibitors, thousands of traders as well as international media.\n\nAmongst the exhibitors at the event include new entrants as well as major toys and children games brands such as Hasbro, Vivid Imaginations and others. Exhibitors also include small and large retailers of toys. Due to the size and the caliber of the fair, the event attracts world renowned media houses such as BBC, The Telegraph, The Times, among others.\n\nMore than 300 accredited journalists cover the event. Suffice to say that The London Toy Fair is not a public event. It is purely designed as a business event and attendance is vetted. Visitors to the event include, and not limited to Merchandisers, Play station specialists, creators of toys, sales and marketing agents, suppliers and distributors of toys and educational experts.\n\nThe event gathers all these under one event with only one purpose: to make business through networking and learning. Primarily exhibitors use the fair as a launching pad for new and innovative products as well as exhibiting range of current products on offer from manufacturers and merchandisers, with view of creating strong brands.\n\nHowever, the event is evolving into a networking hub, where industry players meet, interact and learn new trends in the toy and children games industry. Industry players congregate at the fair with the intension of making new business through meeting other players, as well as discuss future plans for the industry. As such, the success of the event is hinged on relationships making and as such is a perfect case study for this assignment (Toy Shop UK 2011; Toy and Hobby Association 2011).\n\nAccording to Masterman and Wood (2005), event managers incorporate a variety of communication tools to promote and market events. In this view, communication has become a key strategy in marketing events to exhibitors. While communication is used as a key marketing strategy by event managers to popularize events, effective communication is also a useful marketing tool used by exhibitors within these events.\n\nSuffice to state that companies have specific and tailor made marketing and communication strategies. However, company managers understand that specific company communication strategies need to be aligned with other communication tools for sustainable business. In the current age of innovation, company managers need to incorporate innovative techniques and tools that will aid in business marketing and communication. Such tools include exhibition events.\n\nThese events present major opportunities for companies to establish effective business communication environment as well as channels with other exhibitors for sustainable business\n\nIn view of Masterman and Wood‘s (2005) thoughts, The London Toy Fair 2011 fulfils the assertion that organizations can use event as part of business communication strategies to improve the overall business performance as well s as public relations strategies.\n\nThrough The London Toy Fair, developers of toys have used opportunities presented by participating in the event to establish communication channels with other industry players. Mind Candy, the maker of online game children games found The London Toy Fair 2011 as the most effective strategy to establish mutual communication channels with retailers of children’s games from within and without the UK (Duarte 2011).\n\nThrough The London Toy Fair 2011, the CEO of Mind Candy Michael Acton Smith, sees opportunities not only to communicate to the retailers but also to train and educate them on Mind Candy’s products.\n\nThis creates mutual relationships between Mind Candy and its customer’s through the retailers: through The London Toy Fair 2011, Mind Candy hopes to establish useful links with consumers through mutual relationships with retailers. As such, events, especially The London Toy Fair 2011 are effective relationship public relationship tools which also aids marketing for Mind Candy.\n\nThe London Toy Fair 2011 utilizes the mass media as a major communication and public relations tool. Suffice to state that various scholars have suggested a number of media systems theories in relation to public relations issues. These include the social communism theory, the authoritarian theories and the libertarian theory.\n\nWhile all these theories serves to explain the relationship between the media and public relations, some of the theories, such as social communism have been negatively critiqued and termed as outdated. In view of this criticism, it is imperative to state that the libertarian theory is still relevant in today’s public relations issues. Under this theory the media is given absolute freedom, at least from government control on the content and the manner of broadcast.\n\nWhile this theory implies that the media is self regulating, professionals within the public relations industry assert that media, through two-way communication, must meet the needs of the audience (Hiebert 1992). As mentioned earlier, The London Toy Fair 2011attracts the attention of international media such as BBC Breakfast, The Times among others.\n\nHowever, following the libertarian theory, The London Toy Fair 2011 managers recognize the freedom of the media in free market economies and thus understand the potential pitfalls that might emanate from such media freedom. Therefore, journalists have to be vetted through a strict process.\n\nOnly those journalist involved in broadcasting content for children are allowed to cover the event. By allowing only journalist who broadcast children based content, The London Toy Fair 2011 managers tend to further follow the libertarian theory’s assertion on meeting and responding to the needs of the audience, by speaking to the right audience directly. This helps The London Toy Fair 2011 managers to foster positive public relations through vetted media.\n\nSriramesh (2009) asserts that the mass media, contrary to popular belief does not affect the masses but the individual. In relations to a study conducted by Schultz and Kitchen (2000), Sriramesh (2009) asserts that the mass media has both long and short term effects on the individuals.\n\nThe media gathers and disseminates messages effectively to the individual rather than to the masses. Sriramesh (2009) asserts that the effect of mass media on the individual viewer is much more effective in marketing communication. In view of this assertion, Sriramesh explains that international media stations such as CNN, BBC and others have been successful through targeting the individual viewer as opposed to the mass audience.\n\nIt is imperative to state that international Media companies such as The Gadget Show and BBC Breakfast have been part of The London Toy Fair 2011 (Toy and Hobby Association 2011). These media have predominantly targeting to the specific viewership: children. Furthermore, the shows within these media are interactive with viewers having a chance to call in. This further follows Hiebert‘s (1992) assertions that effective public relations through the mass media is attained through a two way communication.\n\nWhile these forms of traditional media has been effective in the past in maintaining contact with the preferred audience, if falls short of affecting the individual in the intended manner. This is because through such media as BBC Breakfast and The Gadget Show, The London Toy Fair 2011 have not managed to retain direct contact with individual members of the viewership interested in the event.\n\nIn view of this, traditional media has been effective to the extent that it is a public relationship and marketing tools for the masses, and not individual audience.\n\nSriramesh (2009) assertion on the effects of the power of the effectiveness of the media in marketing communication through the individual fails to account for the individual effect theory in The London Toy Fair 2011.\n\nSriramesh (2009) views on the effects of the mass media on the individual however, tends to be collaborated in Breakenridge’s (2008) assertions on the effects of new web based media, which supplements the traditional media in enhancing PR and marketing communication.\n\nWhile Chaffey and Smith (2008) explains that there are new e-marketing tools useful in relationships marketing as well as enhancing public relations, Breakenridge(2008) offers useful insights on companies can choose the appropriate e-marketing tools available from e-media. Chaffey, Ellis-Chadwick, Mayer and Johnstone (2009) corroborates Sriramesh (2009) views and explains that internet marketing is effective through online PR since the effect is greater on the individual, rather than the mass members of the e-audience.\n\nFrom the assertions mentioned above, it is clear that marketing and PR professional have realized the need to use new e-media such as Facebook, twitter, MySpace and others to supplement marketing and PR through traditional medias such as TV. The London Toy Fair 2011 portrays tendencies to follow this and has thus engaged e-media tools that purposely target individuals directly.\n\nThrough the social media such as Facebook and twitter accounts, The London Toy Fair 2011 managers seem to follow Breakenridge (2008) and Sriramesh (2009) media-individual-effect theory. The London Toy Fair 2011 utilized the communication platform to individuals provided within social media as part of its PR and marketing communication initiatives.\n\nThrough the e-media tools mentioned above, fair managers have not only met the needs of the consumers but also learn and get valuable feedback about the event and products. While the event tends to benefit from social media, the public is equally benefiting. Since the event is only open to the business participants, the public can follow the event through live updates on social media and learn about the latest gizmos to expect.\n\nSince there is no evidence to show that the followership of the event through the traditional media is declining, it can be thus argued that, in view of Breakenridge (2008) arguments, The London Toy Fair 2011 is utilizing e-media such to the extent of supplementing the effectiveness of traditional media.\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the purpose of The London Toy Fair 2011 is to help exhibitors meet, display and popularize their brands, as well as launch new products. Through such popularization, exhibitors aim at using the platform provided by the London Toy Fair 2011 to build a brand for each of their products.\n\nAs explained by Sharma, Sheth and Kellstadt (2010) public brand building is one of the most efficient ways of maintaining public relations. This is attained through the media, which is an effective tool for covering activities that are aimed at exhibiting the strengths of particular brands.\n\nIn particular, public relations is effective in covering public awareness programs (trade fairs) on company’s brands. Following this notion, companies such as Fisher-Price have found The London Toy Fair 2011 as the opportune platform to build and enhance their world leading brands in toys for toddlers and preschool children.\n\nThrough The London Toy Fair 2011, Fisher-Price has found an opportunity to build a strong brand presence for some of its games such as Kungfu Panda. Through networking with retailers and traders during the fair, Fisher-Price hopes to establish public relations links with its clients (Fisher-Price 2010). This, thus follows Sharma et al.’s (2010) assertion that branding, through public awareness programs is an effective concepts in establishing public relations.\n\nWhile The London Toy Fair has effectively utilized both the traditional form of media as tools and avenues for creating and maintaining strong public relations. There are other strategies that the event managers need to consider. As explained by Breakenridge (2008) e-media is a “thicket of expanding Internet tools.” The London Toy Fair has utilized some of these tools, such as Facebook and twitter.\n\nHowever, there are other more effective tools that would create an even bigger impact for the event. Through available social media tools the event managers can create an online newsroom (Durieux and Stebbins 2010) to run concurrent with the event. This will not only give other unaccredited journalists a chance to have a glimpse at the event but also allow the public to get direct media briefing online.\n\nAs Breakenridge (2008) further suggests, e-marketing should look beyond social media to more engaging tools such as RSS feeds and podcasts. Specifically, the event mangers should aim at utilizing opportunities provided by RSS fees. As explained by Arnold (2011) RSS feeds are useful web tools in conveying both audio and video updates online.\n\nFurthermore, through podcasts, The London Toy Fair managers can, as Morris, Terra and Williams (2007) explain overcome the problems of live streaming and publish instead short video and audio scripts to audiences outside the event.\n\nThrough podcasting, online newsroom and RSS feeds, PR as well as marketing professionals at the event will be able to not only carry out their PR duties but also engage the public creative thus creating strong relationship with clients that enhance brand loyalty.\n\nThis essay aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of both the public relations and relationship marketing, in regard to promotion during trade fairs. As analyzed through existing literature as well as using real examples, public relation as well as relationship marketing have been found to have a great impact in promoting trade fairs.\n\nWithin this essay, the media systems theory especially on libertarian has been found to have a bearing on the way the media, related too public relations issues. The London Toy Fair has successful utilized the theory’s philosophy on the freedom of the median, yet ensured that there were certain control mechanisms to vet that freedom and ensure that only the most appropriate media has access to the event. Suffice to say that the event has provided exhibitors with valuable opportunities to build the brands of their products.\n\nThis is one of new concept of public relations. The existence of communication channels through the traditional media as well as e-media ensures that exhibitors establish relationship with their clients. As such both public relationship as well s relationship marketing have been found to work for The London Toy Fair.\n\nReference List\n\nArnold, J. 2011. E-Mail Marketing For Dummies .

      "Yield Management in Hotels Report\n\nExamination of the concept and procedure of yield management used in the hotel industry today\n\nExamination of the concept of yield management in the flourishing hotel industry is extremely essential in obtaining maximum yields from this industry. I will commence by explaining in much details what we mean by yield management especially in the hotel industry. To be precise, this term generally refers to an activity greatly used in the lodging and transportation industries in an attempt to maximize profit.\n\nIt is generally a measure to skyrocket revenues and the profits. It refers to a procedure that deals with establishment of different prices for the services that are the same and then subsequent allocation of these services in a manner that increases the revenue. Within a hotel set up, there should be a preliminary way of room allocation for a given period. This measure will ensure that there are many alternatives in terms of pricing. This will result into accountability for all the rooms found in that particular hotel (Kumar 2010).\n\nYield management concept has never been new to hoteliers. Both staff with much experience and those with little experience carry out this practice. They do this with a talent that is variable. They anticipate demand that is overall for given periods like days, weeks or even years.\n\nRevenue/yield management is normally a discipline that is economic in nature. It is normally relevant to a myriad of industries that offer service to clients. In this case, service segments in the market pricing are added to analyze statistics. This enhances expansion of the market for an increase in the revenue or yield per each unit of capacity.\n\nForecasting of demand characterizes management of yields in hotels. It utilizes optimal procedures in the determination of requests on booking to comply with the objective of maximizing profit. Nearly all main hotel chains like Hilton practice simple or compound yield management procedures.\n\nThis is to ensure maintenance of control systems in the inventory. These hotels have come up with their own hardware and software measurements combined with corporate systems in screening of the market for profit maximization (Ismael 2002).\n\nStrategies used in hotels to maximize occupancy and maximum rate to achieve maximum revenue\n\nIn order to maximize profits, serious hoteliers pay a lot of attention to the following key areas: Bookings, cash flow, and customers. In most cases, they are the top and key areas for the hotelier to ensure profit maximization. The hotelier should put the above items into reality in order to make them tangible and functional.\n\nThey also require much effective strategies, which can work well on all aspects of operations in a hotel. These strategies can be applied in sales, profit management, and marketing. Therefore, the following are the strategies that hoteliers need to put into application to ensure maximum yields (Jagels 2006).\n\nOne, they require to practice what we call revenue management strategy. It is very important for hoteliers to possess an effective and efficient profit management strategy. This is to ensure that the enterprise is imperative in the much competitive market of today. A good system also ensures that managers avoid controlling prices and other important variables in a manner that is proactive instead of a manner that is reactive.\n\nThe second strategy is a strategy whereby hotel managers forget completely about the computer set system. They should in turn embrace the online set system. Forgetting the traditional computer set system completely is inevitable for them. The focus should be on the comparison of their price with that of all their competitors within a given destination. Through possession of the whole picture, there would be a rise in their capacity in terms of generation of bookings that are very high.\n\nThe third strategy is the strategy called, “Go fourth and integrate”. Integration is important in increasing efficiencies of all operations in the hotel. Instead of using multiple systems or even tools that cannot coincide with each other, they should use a more consolidated system.\n\nPutting this system into place avoids that scenario. It should be very much user friendly and should give high optimization flexibility in terms of pricing. There should also be a distribution that is online and a webpage that is competitive in terms of positioning and control of the inventory (Jagels 2006).\n\nAnother strategy put into use is having a booking channel that is new. This becomes possible through getting your mobile on. Hoteliers should consider coming up with a website called mobile Commerce.\n\nIn this particular website, customers can hastily access the hotel and the information they require. They can directly book from their respective mobile phones. This saves on cost and time.\n\nThere should also be proper management of different channels in the hotel. Hotels should ensure availability of room inventory that is present for buying in all channels. These channels are normally available. In order to seduce the customers to come to their respective hotels, the rates across all the available networks should be equal.\n\nThe use and role of technology in yield management in hotels\n\nSystems of technology enhance hotel stakeholders with tactics to improve sales and revenue. Proper management of revenue normally ensures improvements in profit margins. Through subdivision of a particular meal into its constituent sections, a manager may get to know exactly the particular systems to put into application at a given stage in order to provide the highest revenue margins in a given hotel.\n\nIn technology adoption, it is always necessary for the managers to carry out analysis in finance. This will aid in determining whether the cost of technology will be greater than that during the period the business began. This is reflected in terms of improvements in revenue. Given that monetary mathematics is favourable, the hotel management should think of returns to both the hotel customers and employees.\n\nThey must also factor in the issue of consumer and employees views. This should be in terms of utility in technology and their ease in terms of use. In devoid of these important articulations in place, technology will be at a point of having little success despite how much promising the financial benefit may be.\n\n“The latest eTRACK Full Year 2009 report on hotel bookings demonstrated that today, online channel is the sole channel of growth in the hospitality industry (Jagels 2006, p.39). This enhances shifting from offline to online bookings in the hotel industry because of reducing voice channels.\n\nTechnology at Hilton Hotel Corporation\n\nHilton Hotel Corporation runs a chain of hotels in almost all continents in the world. It is therefore a worldwide business venture in the hotel industry. In May 2003, it came up with an IT system that they called OnQ (Cuneo 2003) The Hilton considered that there was need to embrace technology as their future financial prosperity in terms of profit margins depended on it.\n\nThe top management recognized the fact that to continue growing, technology was inevitable. OnQ was able to integrate all the office operations. There was an initiative to provide picture profiles of hotel customers to the hotel workers. The guest profile was an inclusion of customer’s recent stays and a writing of any difficulties the customer may have experienced.\n\nOther technologies used at the Hilton include computers, mobile telephones and many others. Both customers and hotel staff make telephone calls when it comes to booking of rooms. Computers are normally used in data entry and recording. The hotel staff enters customer details into their database to monitor the customer stay at the hotel facility. It is also very important for the hotel management to ensure that there is security surveillance.\n\nThis is to enhance customer safety during his or her stay within the hotel premises. Digital cameras installation within the rooms and at strategic points within the hotel building ensures observation of each activity that take place inside the hotel. In case of a crime being committed within the hotel premises, it will be easy for hotel staff to establish under which circumstances the crime occurred.\n\nIn conclusion, without embracing technology with both hands, stakeholders in the hotel sub sector will continue to report a decrease in revenues. Technology is thus a thorny issue that hotel management has to be keen on to ensure yield management (Cross 1997).\n\nReference List\n\nCross, R., 1997.

      "Korea as a link between the continent and Japan Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Korean relations to China\n 3. Korean relations to Japan\n 4. Korea As link between Continents\n 5. Discussion and Conclusion\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nNortheast Asia is the most influential region in the Asian continent and affairs in this part of the continent have an impact on the whole of Asia. China and Japan are the two super powers in the region and their geographical proximity and economic interdependence means that the two countries are deeply connected.\n\nEven so, the history of these giants is turbulent and there continues to be a mutual hostility between them. At the present, there exist a number of significant issues facing Northeast Asia. These issues include: China’s rapid economic growth and her increasing role in international affairs and Japan’s possible remilitarization which is cause for concern for her neighboring countries.\n\nKorea stands between these two powers and her geographical positioning together with her history with both nations gives her particular relevance in the region. Korea has a shared history with both China and Japan and both countries consider her an important player in their international strategies. This paper shall discuss the role of Korea as a link between the continent and Japan. In particular, the paper shall analyze the Korean relationship to both Japan and China so as to highlight Korea’s role as a link.\n\nKorean relations to China\n\nThe Korean Peninsula has historically enjoyed close relations with China. This relationships have in part been as a result of China’s security concerns. Historically, some of China’s invaders have made use of the Korean peninsula to perpetrate their attacks against China. The border has also served as the arena for conflicts between China and her traditional rivals; Japan and Russia.\n\nThis security concerns are part of the reason why China is concerned about the affairs of Korea since she would not want Korea allying herself with nations that China perceives to be enemies. The renowned scholar Quansheng Zhao best articulates the relationship between China and Korea by stating that “Chinese interest in the Korean peninsula has been based on the combined factors of national interest and the historical connections between China and Korea” (102).\n\nChina-Korean relations date as far back to the year 6 AD when Korean emerged as a unified state. In this period, Korean rulers sought to establish relations with China which was an influential actor in the region. From its relationship with China, Korea obtained numerous cultural influences including language, philosophy and even religion. China on the other hand had a market for her products as well as a sphere of influence.\n\nThe relationship was mutually beneficial for both nations although it was the Koreans who gained more from the more civilized China. Korea also paid tribute to the Chinese court since China regarded herself as the superior party in this relationship. Even so, Korea saw the relationship as mutually beneficial and regarded themselves as equals.\n\nSelig asserts that Koreans regarded the relationship as suzerainty where the paying of tribute was of little consequence and real independence (309). Korean kings constantly sought and received protection by China from both internal unrest as well as external aggression which was mostly from Japan. As such, the history of China and Korea was based on development as well as security concerns.\n\nThis historical relationship continued amicably until the fall of the powerful Ming dynasty. This fall was precipitated by the rise of the Manchus in the early 17th century. This dynasty was regarded by the Koreans as weak and barbaric in comparison to the Ming dynasty.\n\nThis weakness led to the creation of factions within China and many historians blame this lack of a centralized command for the defeat of China in the Sino-Japanese war. Following this defeat, the Shimonoseki Peace Treaty was reached upon. The first article of the peace treaty which was signed after the Sino-Japanese called for China to accept Korea as a completely independent country. This loss of Korea to Japan hence severed the historical tie between China and Korea.\n\nChina had a chance to assert her influence in Korea following the defeat of Japan in the Second World War. As an aftermath of the war, Japan was required to relinquish control of the Korean colony (Oberdorfer 230). This led to the emergence of a vacuum which China was quick to fill. China therefore became the closest ally and supporter of North Korea. To demonstrate her commitment to this, China sent in her troops to defend North Korea from imminent US invasion in the Korean War (Wang 480). China has continued to be a key actor in Korean affairs up to date.\n\nKorean relations to Japan\n\nThe relationship between Korea and Japan was historically one of violence with Japan constantly making attempts to invade Korea. Zachmann reveals that in the 1590s, Japan engaged in disastrous campaigns against Korea that further alienated it from both Korea and China (8). These campaigns also resulted in the upsetting of the balance of power in Northeast Asia thus contributing to the downfall of the powerful Ming dynasty and the rise of the Qing dynasty.\n\nEven so, Japan did attempt to establish good relations with Korea for reasons of domestic authority as well as economic considerations. As of 1607, Japan welcomed the first embassy from Korea and sought to establish international relations that would guarantee Japan’s authority. China was able to deter Japanese aggression in Korea effectively up until the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895.\n\nJapan was keen to expand her influence on Korea and in 1876, Japan pressured Korean into a Treaty of Amity. This was a western-style imperialist treaty by Japan and it purposed to remove Korea from the “hermit nation” stance that it had taken. In 1888, Japan openly supported a planned coup d’état in Korea where pro-Japanese factions purposed to take over the leadership. In this case, Chinese troops intervened and quickly extinguished the coup at the request of the Korean government.\n\nThis Chinese action enraged Japan since it once again symbolized China’s dominance in Korean affairs. However, Japan let the matter to pass and proceeded to sign a treaty with China where both sides agreed to withdraw their troops from Korea (Zachmann 17). In addition to this, both parties agreed that in case of future disturbance in Korea, troops from both sides could only the sent upon notification of the other party. Following this incident, Japan pulled out of Korea and did not object to increasing Chinese influence in Korea.\n\nAs a matter of fact, Japan and China at times worked closely to keep Russian influence in Korea at bay. Despite the temporal withdrawal, Japan was still keen on establishing her dominance in Korea and in the 1880s, Japanese leadership began an intensive military build-up of Japan’s forces.\n\nEven as the military preparations took place, the hypothetical enemy was not Korea but rather China. The Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 which is regarded by historians as a watershed for both Japanese and Chinese modern history was a major turning point in Korea-Japan relations since it resulted in the abject defeat of China. The war was as a result of the Tonghak riots which took place in June 1894 in Korea.\n\nFollowing this riots, the Korean government requested for Chinese military assistance to help quell the uprising. China sent in her troops to assist but Japan also responded by sending her own troops allegedly to protect Japanese citizens and diplomats living in Korea. Japanese troops were excessive and this provocative action resulted in the situation escalating.\n\nEventually, Japan declared war on Chine on August 1894. Japanese forces were immensely successful with the Japanese navy defeating China in the Yellow Sea while the Japanese army gained victory in the battle of Pyongyang. This resulted in the negotiation of a peace treaty which was largely on Japan’s terms\n\nDuring the course of the war, Japan viewed herself as a liberator who was saving weak Korea from the cunning interference and exploitation by China (Zachmann 34). In fact, the Sino-Japanese War was popularly considered by the Japanese population as a “just war” for the sake of Korea (Zachmann 25). However, following the decisive victory obtained in the Sino-Japanese war, Japan took the opportunity to advance her interest in Korea.\n\nThis resulted in Japan expanding her influence to Korea and subsequently colonizing the country for half a century. At the onset, Japan’s policy with Korea was hoped to be one of non-interference insofar as possible with the goal being for Korea to stand up by herself (Tsuzuki 132). This policy was not implemented for long since other powers wished to exert their influence on the weaker Korea. In particular, Russia aimed to extend her influence in Korea and thus challenged the role of Japan as Korea’s protector.\n\nKorea As link between Continents\n\nKorea has historically had a huge bearing on China and Japan and Ilpyong reveals that under the influence of China, Korea was seen as a “dagger pointed at the heart of Japan” (28). Similarly, China viewed a Korea under Japanese rule as a dagger pointed at it. These fears are not unfounded as if evident from Japan’s expansion into Manchuria and its subsequent occupation of China’s northern territory following the colonization of Korea at the onset of the 20th century.\n\nZachmann proposes the Sino-Japanese rivalry over Korea was as much a matter of prestige and the need to perpetuate dominance as it was a security issue (16). Security wise, Korea plays the role of buffer state between China and Japan. The possibility of a common border with Japan has been a historical fear by China.\n\nFollowing the annexation of Taiwan by Japan, there was fear that if china remained inactive, Japan would attack Korea and the loss of Korea would result in a common border between China and Japan (Waltz 143). This was seen as unacceptable and China prepared for war with Japan from 1879 onwards in anticipation of Japan take over of Korea. Following the Korean colonization by Japan as a result of Japanese victory in the Sino-Japan war, China felt threatened by this occupation of Korea by a hostile power.\n\nThe relationship between Japan and china continue to be strained despite the huge economic progress that both nations have made through the decades. During the cold war era, Japan and China were on opposite side with Japanese favoring the Unite States while China favored communism and the Soviet Union. Even after the end of the cold war, the two countries still continue to regard each other with suspicion.\n\nThe United States-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines which was come up with in 1995 is one of the grounds on which China and Japanese differ. To China, This pact is regarded as a sign of Japanese militarization and a means through which Japan can expand its influence in the region. China also perceives the US-Japan defense agreement as a move to undermine its influence in the region and isolate it from other countries in the region.\n\nPresently, there is growing rivalry between China and Japan and as China’s power grows, there is the dangerous possibility for the peace and stability of the region. Both China and Japan are keen to maintain stability and peace in the Korean peninsula. For China, the stability of the reason is good both for its economic interests and security interests. Japan also considers a stable Korea as being good for the security of the region.\n\nKorea therefore acts as a key link between these two countries that have a bitter history and view each other with suspicion and mistrust. Korea (South) is uniquely positioned to play an important role to encourage better relations in Northeast Asia (Denny 23). Heo, Roehrig and Seo state that part of the power that Korea has is that it has never attacked any one of its neighbors nor given any indication that it intended to do that (107). Korea is seen as a legitimate mediator between China and Japan without being perceived as a competitor or a threat. This strengthens the effectiveness of Korean mediation.\n\nDiscussion and Conclusion\n\nWhile Korea is the significantly small power when compared to the big and powerful China and Japan, it is not a powerless party and indeed has the ability to shape the future of her powerful neighbors. This is because both China and Japan regard Korea as an important actor in their foreign policies. While China and Japan have an entrenched enmity due to their tragic confrontations of the past, Korea is of interest to both countries and therefore forces them to interact. Korea acts as a link between these two traditional enemies and if there will ever be the formation of an Asian power bloc, the role of Korea will be monumental.\n\nThis paper set out to discuss the role of Korea as a link between China and Japan. A brief history highlighting the relationship between Korea and the two countries has been given so as to underscore the importance of Korea in China-Japan relations. This paper has highlighted that there exists an intense and deep-rooted suspicion and competition between China and Japan.\n\nEven so, a level of cooperation between these two powers is necessary for the peace and stability of the Northeast Asian region. The paper has then analyzed how Korea acts as a link between Japan and the continent. From the discussions advanced in this paper, it can be stated that while Korea lacks the economic and military might of China and Japan, she plays a significant role in the affairs of Northeast Asia by serving as a link between these two giants.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDenny, Roy. “China and the Korean Peninsula: Beijing’s Pyongyang Problem and Seoul Hope”.

      "Educational Plan For Health Care Students Essay (Article)\n\nAlong with pointing out at the existing gap between the nursing theory and practice, modern scholars emphasize the importance of taking into consideration the peculiarities of certain student groups while developing educational programs for specific groups of nursing students. This paper will discuss the most influential factors and the main steps which need to be taken for developing an effective educational plan for health care students.\n\nTaking into account the diversity of student population, it can be stated that the flexibility of educators and programs is crucial for complying with the needs of the wide range of learners. The first step in constructing an effective action plan is reviewing the latest theoretical studies and defining the main parameters of the student learning preferences and the desired learning modes which need to be taken into consideration for selecting the most appropriate teaching strategies.\n\nThe study conducted by Chan et al (2006) in Hong Kong universities focused on the seven main factors affecting the learning outcomes of particular learning programs. These factors comprised the learning atmosphere, the level of learners’ autonomy, material, motivational aspects, direct instructions and structure of the programs.\n\nAll these parameters should be taken into account by nursing educators for exploring the specific needs of particular groups and adapting the programs to their peculiar demands. Chan et al (2006) concluded that most Chinese students have developed receptive skills, but may have difficulties with expressing their thoughts in English. Thus, even the ethnic origin and cultural background of learners should be taken into consideration for selecting the most appropriate teaching mode and strategies.\n\nChoi et al (2009) emphasized the importance of giving serious consideration to students’ cultural and learning experience in constructing effective educational programs. The evidence shows that the effectiveness of the same strategies and learning exercises can vary in different classrooms, depending upon the learners’ peculiar features. Meehan-Andrews (2009) conducted a research for exploring the preferred and the most effective learning modes in nursing students.\n\nRegardless of the findings that kinesthetic was the learning mode preferred by the majority of learners, and the practical session was regarded as the most effective teaching strategy, Meehan-Andrews (2009) concluded that there is no single right way for providing the materials to nursing students. Thus, the investigation of the learners’ needs and preferences along with the readiness to combine several different approaches is the first step in the action plan for designing an effective educational program for nursing students.\n\nThe second step after defining the cultural background, preferred learning mode, learning experience, and needs is the evaluation of the level of communication skills. Taking into account the specific demands of the nursing profession and the importance of successful team work and nurse-patient communication, special emphasis should be put upon the development of communication skills in students. Chant et al (2002) noted that the communication errors can cause a lot of troubles to the clinical setting.\n\nFor this reason, focusing on the development of communication and interpersonal skills in medical students, teachers will be able to improve not only the staff and patients’ satisfaction with the level of professionalism of the future registered nurses, but also improve the healthcare outcomes in general. While conducting a research on the student’s preferred learning styles and experience, a teacher can also identify the level of their communication skills and detect the gaps which should be filled in future.\n\nIn that regard, the role of nursing teacher is central to only structuring and organizing the learning process but also developing students’ interpersonal skills and cooperation abilities as a significant part of their professional expertise. Landers (2008) admitted that healthcare educators play an important role in bridging the gap between nursing theory and practice and can prepare students for the beginning of their professional career in real life clinical setting.\n\nRecognizing the importance of not only acquiring theoretical knowledge, but also preparing for the implementation of theoretical data in professional practice, educators should provide students with opportunities for developing their interpersonal skills and designing the learning activities which would be favorable for improving the students’ communication skills.\n\nThus, the second step of the action plan is detecting the level of the students’ communication skills and incorporating the activities aimed at improving them into the educational program.\n\nThe third step is the choice of the most effective approach to the nursing education for designing the most appropriate activities. A wide range of recent studies have demonstrated the benefits of problem-based learning (PBL) for clinical nursing education. Conducting a study at a Swedish university, Ehrenberg & Haggblom (2007) concluded that the PBL approach to the organization of the learning process has positive effects upon the learning outcomes.\n\nAs opposed to the obsolete strategies which mostly focus on the acquisition of theoretical knowledge, PBL allows nursing students prepare for the beginning of their professional career which will require their profound skills of applying theoretical knowledge in the process of expert decision making.\n\nThus, imitating the real life working situations in the learning process, nursing educators can prepare their students for the challenges they will face in their professional daily practice. Barrow et al (2002) assumed that disregarding the additional stress for the students associated with the change of the learning mode and the increased expectations, the PBL approach has positive effects on the students’ learning outcomes.\n\nThough this mode shifts the burden of directing their learning upon students, the increased academic load is worth the corresponding improved outcomes. Jerlock et al (2003) noted that ability to make decisions using their expertise as well as inductive and deductive learning strategies for collecting the necessary data and evaluating it is crucial for medical practitioners.\n\nThus, solving the learning problems, students will be able to prepare to the situations in their professional practice. Dochy et al (2003) devoted their study to the exploration of the positive and negative sides of PBL and concluded that despite of the fact that through the implementation of PBL approach, students gain slightly less knowledge, but tend to remember larger part of the acquired materials.\n\nIn general, it can be concluded that regardless of certain disadvantages of PBL, including the increased load and additional stress for educators and students, this approach can enhance the effectiveness of the nursing programs and has a positive impact upon the students’ outcomes. Thus, the third step in the discussed action plan is the consideration of the PBL approach for developing the students’ professional skills which would be required for meeting the challenges in their daily professional practice.\n\nOne more significant component which should be taken into account while developing nursing education programs is the development of reflective skills in nursing students. Burton (2001) admitted that the assignments aimed at developing the reflective skills in nursing students should become central to the heath care educational programs because the practice of reflection fosters the enhancement of students’ professional knowledge.\n\nThe developed reflective skills developed during the student years and afterwards would allow the practitioner to become a more critical thinker and implement an evidence-based approach to making professional decisions and taking actions. With the current efforts to bridge the gap between nursing theory and practice, none of the sides of the learning process should be underestimated. It is doubtless that abilities to apply theoretical knowledge in practice are critical for becoming an expert in the sphere.\n\nStill, the process of acquiring theoretical knowledge is equally important for enhancing the professional expertise as the PBL approach and development of communication skills. For this reason, serious consideration should be given to proper design of theoretical parts of the courses. Cotton (2002) pointed out at the diversity of perspectives and dimensions which need to be taken into account for developing the appropriate assignments and enhancing the reflective skills in nursing students.\n\nThus, proper design of theoretical assignments and incorporation of tasks aimed at developing students’ reflective skills is the fourth step in the action plan for designing an effective educational program and bridging the gap between nursing theory and practice.\n\nSumming up the above-mentioned data on the most influential factors recognized by the contemporary scholars in the nursing education, it can be concluded that the preferred learning mode, cultural background, PBL in the practical part and the development of reflective skills in theoretical part are the main steps which should be takes for developing an effective program.\n\nReference List\n\nBarrow, E., Lyte, G., and Butterworth, T.

      "The Local Inhabitants of the Mountain Side Essay (Movie Review)\n\nMountains Summary\n\nFormerly, many held the idea that earth is only made up of planet core and soil. Surprisingly, it is composed of many other strange details; in fact, it has more than what any one of us can imagine. In introduction, a world which is both frozen and alien is highlighted. That is not being amazing enough, the world’s hottest mark is let out to the audience of the video. This smudge is, according to the video, found in Ethiopia, a place the narrator terms as the other extreme part (documentareorg, 2011).\n\nA brief preamble on how volcanoes are formed follows. Such mountains are usually associated with sporadic distributions just in the mountain range (Smithson & Briggs, 1986). This prologue is then followed by illustrations on the formation of Ethiopian mountains.\n\nThen goes a presentation of the local inhabitants of the mountain side. Some of them seem to have fully adapted to that place and its conditions. The best illustration issued is on the Gelada Monkeys. The narrator then vehemently affirms that the species (Gelada Monkeys) is very changeable (documentareorg, 2011). This scenario is intriguing indeed.\n\nThe narrator then switches the gear and takes the herbivores lane. He makes a vivid description of the local herbivores – the puma. They are best described as The Andes Lions. The real hot climatic conditions of the region were made clear to the audience. Beside the thrilling experience, the narrator outlines several risks that one passing by the area should be careful of.\n\nMost of these dangerous circumstances are generated as a result of gradual increments in the number of the dangerous species, a process the narrator describes as avalanche. The best example of the dangerous species outlined is the puma. After they have enormously grown, they pose a serious safety issue.\n\nAs the narrator goes towards conclusion, the highest sky-touching mountain is vividly brought to the audience. This mountain is The Everest Mountain. The narrator shortly narrates how a crane, demoiselle, met its untimely and tragic death. The crane was wandering around the mountain in search of nestling.\n\nUnfortunately, it encountered what it would have regretted the rest of its life, that is, if it could have survived; the eagle. With a sigh of relief for a free gift, the eagle preyed on the crane. The entire narration process clearly brings out the vast nature of mountains. This at least brings to light the reason why mountains and the surrounding regions are usually guarded by most nations. Who can really ignore the thrilling feeling and notion brought about by the topic on mountains?\n\nReferences\n\nDocumentareorg (2011, January 31). Planet Earth 02 – mountains .

      "Role of NGOs in the sustainable development policy apparatus Exploratory Essay\n\nThe role played by Non-governmental Organizations (NGOs) both at the local and international level cannot be overstated. Intergovernmental organizations have been donned with campaign groups seeking to inject their contribution on important matters of sustainable development such as those revolving around slavery elimination, production and disposal of hazardous wastes as well as setting standards on environmental activities such as land mines.\n\nNonetheless, NGOs are also focusing on the activities of some major state and multinational corporations whose activities directly or directly impact on people’s lives. Hence, their concern has gone beyond forging ties with government and intergovernmental organizations. This has been occasioned by the fact that most governments across the globe have slightly shifted their interest from active regulatory activities especially with the impact of trade liberalization.\n\nThese powerful multinational corporations may even the authority of some governments and hence, NGOs come in handy to bridge the sustainable development gap left by governments.\nThe environmental and social parameters of most business ventures have received a major boost from NGOs, a phenomenon that has been precipitated by developments made in information and communication technology.\n\nFor instance, the working condition of employees across several multinational organizations has been challenged by NGOs particular in cases when the working environment is pathetic. Such pressure from NGOs has indeed aided to improve the overall worker conditions. Besides, the very NGOs have been very instrumental in fighting against human rights abuses even at their places of work.\n\nWhen businesses are extremely pressured by NGOs to change their bad business habits, they eventually bow down and as a result, they positively contribute to sustainable development.\n\nBy using stakeholders to reach out for business organizations that are flouting regulatory laws, it has been possible for these organizations to take care of their externalities over and above preparing environmental or consumer audit reports on their business activities.\n\nAdditionally, pressure from NGOs has also enforced multinational and local organizations to not only carry out reporting of their business activities but also institute and tailor down new systems and structures of management. The new designs largely aim at incorporating the process of decision making with sustainable development both for the concerned organization, the environment and the entire population.\n\nOn a wider scale though, some NGOs operate beyond the borders of a single nation. They are well staffed in order to carry out their activities in a more professional and vigorous manner bearing in mind that these organizations work through asserting their demands through pressure groups and multiple campaigns.\n\nInternationally, NGOs have been very instrumental in alleviating human suffering especially in less and least developed countries. Although the economies of these poor countries are usually underperforming, governments in these nations have come to the realization that sustainable development can be accelerated through the activities of NGOs. However, some of these NGOs have been on the receiving end following bitter criticisms from host countries.\n\nAs part and parcel of establishing sustainable development in poor countries, there are various methodologies used by NGOs in achieving this momentous goal. For example, NGOs do fund both on-going and new projects. Such projects may include building of social amenities such as health centers and schools as well as water projects.\n\nThey also contribute towards relevant training and capacity building of the local communities by offering vocational training services at subsidized or free costs. Besides, they also assist targeted communities in understanding disease prevention measures by boosting their awareness. In achieving this, community based organizations are used.\n\nAccording to Desai (2005), the role of NGOs the entre society has been positively impacted by the activities of NGOs. For instance, men, women and children have been positively impacted by NGOs. In cases whereby counseling is required, there are NGOs which come in handy to offer psychological support to various groups of traumatized individuals such as those traumatized by war who may be suffering from post traumatic stress disorder. Besides counseling groups, NGOs are also instrumental as advocacy groups.\n\nThey also ensure sustainable development of the poor populations by availing micro credit fin ace to the masses. In the event that legal aid is required, there are NGOs which have specialized in assisting communities and even individuals who may be in need of justice but are unable to meet associated the legal costs. Some of these services offered by NGOs are meant to boost people’s ability in managing their day-to-day affairs as part of gaining full control of their personal affairs and finally being independent.\n\nIndeed, the position held by most NGOs is that an independent minded individual is a vital human capital resource for both current and future sustainable development.\nOn the same note, Stromquist (2002) reiterates that NGOs are important drivers in the delivery of the much needed services by the society such as initiating the acquisition of basic skills and knowledge and providing relief to disaster stricken communities.\n\nSecondly, the author observes that NGOs are also crucial architects in the provision of educational services to the less fortunate in the society. At this point, it is pertinent to note that no major sustainable development can be attained in a society marred with high levels of illiteracy. By initiation education programs to the less educated lot, NGOs promote e healthy ground for socio-economic development both at present and the foreseeable future. Similarly, NGOs also play lead role in advocating for environmental protection issues.\n\nThrough the advancement of microcredit, Baccaro (2001) observes that women can indeed benefit from NGOs offering such services. By so doing, the population is economically empowered to manage itself without any undue interference. The author defines empowerment as and scenario whereby economic, political, psychological as well as psychological control is within the reach of either individuals or society.\n\nNGOs facilitate empowerment through variety of ways and means. For example, they ensure that people have access to the much needed information for sustainable development. Moreover, NGOs will ensure that individuals who are assisted to obtain credit facilities are well placed in making the right investment decisions. This goes along way in improving self-efficacy of individuals who undergo education and training programs.\n\nHence, Non-governmental Organizations will work towards setting the right platform for sustainable community development since the long term support eventually leads to self reliance of the community. Langran (2002) emphasizes that the main reason why NGOs are formed is to enhance the capacity of both individuals and the community at large. By the side, sustainable development and community advancement have been considered as two important elements of growth that cannot be separated from each other.\n\nThus, the roles played by NGOs in fostering community development should be far reaching if they are to bring forth sustainable development in targeted communities. The importance of NGOs towards sustainable development has been emphasized by Hibbard and Tang (2004). According to the authors, NGOs are vital in creating equilibrium among the three important elements of development in the community. These elements are the immediate environment, the economic and social factors.\n\nBy creating such a balance, NGOs are well positioned to jumpstart the overall economic and social well being of people. Furthermore, NGOs act as the epicenter of decentralization of government activities that are tailored towards empowering local communities and individuals in particular. In fact, in the event that the local communities do not have adequate knowledge and skills to carry out specific technical projects, NGOs have been found to offer real time solutions to such deficits.\n\nFor instance, they can assist by offering professional help in designing sustainable development plans necessary to kick start certain projects. It should be noted that such development plans portfolio are purely under the government docket. Consequently, the emergence of NGOs is indeed momentous in precipitating sustainable development agenda not just within the local level but also on global scale depending on the scale of operation of the given NGO.\n\nHibbard and Tang (2004) also conclude that the services offered by NGOs toward sustainable community development may not yield the expected results if the targeted community does not fully participate and throw their weight behind the strategies set forth by respective NGOs. In other words, sustainable development through the action plan of NGOs is a process oriented venture that can only succeed if both the community and NGOs work hand in hand.\n\nNeedless to say, the broad and specific functions of NGOs in sustainable development are assumed to take five main bearings. These are the fine-tuned roles of NGOs circumnavigating the economic, social and political life of targeted group or groups of people in a given population. The first bearing or dimension that most NGOs have taken is broadening the economic diversity and income generation patterns of a community.\n\nSecondly, NGOs are poetical creators of local markets through their advocacy programs. In turn, individuals are able to be self-reliant and significantly the commonly known dependency syndrome common in most poor economies. Expansion of local markets is also directly responsible for enhanced integration of economic entities situated at the local level.\n\nThird, NGOs through their environmental pressure groups have worked tirelessly hard to reduce energy use that may be detrimental to the environment. For instance, extensive use of fossil fuels when there are other alternative clean sources of energy is being discouraged by NGOs.\n\nAlongside this measure is the initiative put forward by environmentally-based NGOs of emphasizing recycling of used materials as one way of minimizing environmental degradation. Fourth, NGOs are also on the forefront in cautious management of natural resources in addition to enhancing biological diversity.\n\nThese are conserved as inevitable considerations that should be borne in mind if sustainable development is to be realized, be it at the local or internal level. The last dimension taken by NGOs in ensuring sustainable development is dedication to social justice. This form of justice touches on the entire society. It is against this backdrop that there are NGOs which deal with social justice throughout their operations.\n\nA case example of such NGOs is Amnesty International (AI). This Non-governmental organisation s radically against all forms of human rights abuses that tend to contravene social justice and the rule of law.\nIn a nutshell, it can be summed up that NGOs play integral roles within governments and intergovernmental organizations. Their functions toward sustainable economic development are innumerable and cannot be overstated.\n\nReferences\n\nDesai, V. 2005. NGOs, gender mainstreaming, and urban poor communities in Mumbai.

      "Qualitative vs. Quantitative Research Essay\n\nA qualitative research is a subjective research study which focuses on concepts, meanings and characteristics of different phenomena. A qualitative study is usually done to find out the most common trends regarding a particular subject.\n\nIt uses individual methods to collect and analyze information from different sources using individual interviews, small focus groups and observation. This study is done to uncover underlying causes which make a certain problem occur and how they affect subjects involved. A qualitative research normally has a small sample of respondents who are chosen to represent a specific focus group.\n\nThese respondents contribute information regarding issues faced by the group being surveyed. The study uses unstructured techniques to collect more data and information about a problem being studied. In a qualitative study, researchers test a general hypothesis to determine its impact. The quality of findings which are gathered by the study are heavily influenced by the researcher’s own skills and competence.\n\nA quantitative research is a study which is objective in nature. It is more concerned with generating data to explain why a particular phenomenon is occurring. This type of study also looks at the frequency in occurrence of a particular phenomenon and how people feel regarding its occurrence. A quantitative research uses a large number of respondents randomly chosen by researchers. The respondents chosen to participate in the study have characteristics which are similar to the population sample being studied.\n\nThis study gathers data and information through structured processes such as questionnaires and general interviews. The study focuses on statistical relationships between different phenomena to come up with generalized results, which can be used to solve problems in other populations. In this study, researchers test a specific hypothesis to come up with results, which are not heavily influenced by the researcher’s skills.\n\nPositivism and Constructivism\n\nPositivism is a school of thought which argues that scientific knowledge is the only form of reliable knowledge because it is supported by valid measurable evidence. Positivism theory argues that ideas which have been taken through measurable scientific processes are more valid than those which are not influenced by science.\n\nPositivism focuses on empirical evidence which outlines how a process has been conducted to come up with rational and objective results. This theory further argues that empirical processes used to conduct different studies and experiments need to be tested to determine their accuracy and reliability.\n\nPositivism was developed in the 19th century by August Comte, a French philosopher. Comte was driven by philosophical and scientific ideas, which advocated for the use of strong empirical methods to uncover additional information about a phenomenon. Positivism theory has been used to advance knowledge in law, social sciences and politics because of its strong emphasis on rationalism.\n\nConstructivism is a school of thought which argues that international systems of governance are formed by social processes, which are heavily influenced by human actions. Therefore, these capabilities have a direct impact on the way states relate with other states in international relations.\n\nCore concepts of constructivism are identity, ideologies, debates and social interactions, which have an impact on international issues such as human rights, global security, international trade and regional cooperation. Constructivist theories have been widely used in international relations, especially after the collapse of the Soviet Union and communism.\n\nThe theory shows that social issues are influenced by people’s intentions and actions, which make up different social systems. It further argues that international issues are heavily influenced by different values, strong ideas and national identities, which combine to shape the way international systems function. Therefore, many ideas related to this school of thought have been used to explain different political and social events that have happened in different parts of the world in the past two decades.\n\nInductive and Deductive Approaches\n\nAn inductive approach is a research approach which allows a researcher to give subjective explanations regarding a specific phenomenon using real life examples.It is more flexible because it does not require a researcher to use a pre-determined process when collecting data and information regarding a phenomenon being studied.\n\nThe researcher is free to use different statistics and information to come up with a multi-dimensional conclusion which explains the problem being studied. An inductive approach assumes that knowledge is gathered effectively, based on the way a researcher experiences a specific phenomenon he is studying.\n\nThis approach helps a researcher to come up with a theory based on the research problem being studied. It is linked with interpretivism because the processes used in the study move from specific perspectives to generalized theories and observations. An inductive approach when used to conduct a research study makes a researcher to reach generalized conclusions, which have an element of uncertainty.\n\nA deductive approach is used by a researcher who has a general idea about a phenomenon, to uncover more details that enable him understand the issue better. It has close relationships with positivism theory because it is influenced by specific outcomes gathered through a measurable research process. This research approach makes it possible for a researcher to come up with a hypothesis using different data and information to confirm its validity and relevance.\n\nThis enables the researcher to use theory, observation and confirmation processes to come up with strong conclusions which explain the topic under study. A deductive approach makes a researcher to have a more logical conclusion, which is backed up by reliable facts from the research process. This approach also allows a researcher to come up with specific findings which give factual evidence about issues related to a particular phenomenon.\n\nResearch Methods\n\nThe most commonly used research methods are explained below:\n\nSurveys\n\nSurveys are used to gather information regarding a specific phenomenon being studied. It targets specific respondents out of a sample population to uncover specific information related to a research study. Surveys are used to gather responses from different people and these responses help a researcher to come up with conclusions, which explain why a particular issue is happening.\n\nSurveys are usually done by collecting and analyzing data and statistics, to show their effect on the specific phenomenon being studied. They are also used to evaluate patterns of opinion as revealed by respondents of a particular study.\n\nParticipant Observation\n\nThis is a research method through which a researcher observes a social situation within a particular area to gather more data about a phenomenon being studied. The researcher takes time to understand more about issues experienced by research subjects, in environments where they occur.\n\nTherefore, a researcher gets access to a social group and studies different issues which affect the population living there. Afterwards, a researcher analyzes and interprets all issues he witnessed, which contribute more knowledge to the study.\n\nInterviews\n\nThis is the interaction between a researcher and a respondent, where the researcher asks the respondent direct questions. Interviews allow researchers to engage respondents through face to face communication. A researcher is able to know more information about an issue because of the willingness by a respondent to share what he knows.\n\nTherefore, a researcher can be more flexible because he can ask the interviewee new questions related to information he or she has shared. The interviewer can observe the personal demeanor of an interviewee during the process, to ascertain what influences him to act that way and how this influences the research process.\n\nDocumentary Research\n\nThis is a research method where the researcher uses other published and electronic sources to uncover more details about an issue being studied. The researcher selects various published materials, and analyzes their relevance to the study being conducted. The researcher then synthesizes gathered information which he uses as evidence to support his study’s hypothesis.\n\nDocumentary research is favored by many people in academic studies because it exposes the researcher to a wide variety of resources, which help him uncover more information about the study. A documentary research helps a researcher to compare different published sources to come up with more arguments which strengthen the main hypothesis.\n\nResearch Instruments\n\nQuestionnaires\n\nQuestionnaires are normally used to gather information from respondents regarding different phenomena being studied. It consists of a series of questions which are given to a selected sample of respondents who are affected by the issue being studied. An interviewer should use open ended questions because they allow respondents to give out more information regarding an issue being studied. The researcher then analyzes the responses given after the questionnaires have been handed in to evaluate their contribution to the study.\n\nUnstructured Interview\n\nThis is a form of interviewing where a researcher can modify questions to suit the respondent’s level of education, understanding, culture, personality or intelligence. This form of interview allows an interviewer to engage the listener and evaluate the level of knowledge he or she has regarding questions that need to be answered in the interview.\n\nAn unstructured interview allows the interviewer to come up with new questions, which help to uncover more information. The interviewer analyzes all the information gathered to make his conclusions on the study.\n\nTests\n\nSome researchers use tests to gather specific results about a particular phenomenon. Tests are used in qualitative research studies to gather more information about causes and effects of a particular phenomenon, which is experienced by a specific sampled population.\n\nTests are normally conducted by medical researchers to find out more details about the incidence of disease, malnutrition, maternal death and pollution in a specific area. Tests make it possible for researchers to get specific details about an issue being studied through the use of empirical processes, which show how certain phenomena occur.\n\nScales\n\nScales are used to measure different attributes in a subject being studied by a researcher. Scales are used to measure time intervals and other variables which influence the way different events occur in a particular population. They make it possible for researchers to analyze data which has been collected to come up with specific conclusions about how it affects the phenomenon being studied.\n\nResearch Ethics\n\nResearch ethics are moral principles which a researcher needs to be aware of before conducting a specific study. Research ethics make it possible for a researcher to perform his duties properly to ensure the process used to conduct the study is credible, accurate and reliable. A researcher needs to seek the consent of all people he wants to include in a research study before it is conducted.\n\nThe research process should be done with a clear objective to ensure results which are obtained are not misused or altered to suit a researcher’s own interests. It is important for a researcher to use accurate data analysis and collection tools to make it easy for interested parties to scrutinize the research design. This ensures that research findings are accurate and credible. This helps to strengthen the reliability of findings uncovered by the research.\n\nResearchers need to ensure that all participants who choose to take part in a research process sign consent forms to show evidence of their involvement. However, it is advisable that participants remain anonymous to make them more willing to share information with the interviewer. This ensures that outside sources who get access to the gathered data are not able to reveal identities of respondents who participated in the study.\n\nResearchers have a moral duty to ensure that all humans and animals used to conduct a particular study are not harmed. Tests and other procedures need to be assessed to ensure they conform to the required standards before they are administered. Researchers should not offer inducements in form of cash or gifts to potential respondents because this affects the credibility of their studies negatively. Researchers need to observe all legal processes that are related to research to ensure they conduct studies which are fair and accurate.\n\nResearch Process\n\nA research process can be described as a set of procedures which are used to gather more information about a specific phenomenon using scientific methods. A researcher structures a plan of action which he uses to locate different sources of information and data for his study. He follows an approach which outlines steps that he needs to follow while gathering and analyzing data obtained from the study.\n\nThe researcher plans all the processes that need to be used and allocates adequate time for each process that is going to be used to conduct the study. A researcher needs to identify a topic of interest and plan on techniques he is going to use to gather more data about that topic. A topic needs to be narrowed down to a specific issue with a sizable scope, which the writer is able to handle comfortably.\n\nA researcher should have basic information about the topic he has chosen by conducting a background study. A background study is mainly done through reviewing books, journals, websites and other publications which reveal more about the topic to be studied.\n\nThis will help the researcher to determine how much information exists about a topic he has chosen to research on. A researcher needs to refine his topic to ensure that it is more appropriate to the kind of study he wants to conduct. If a topic has too much information, the researcher should narrow it down to make it more specific.\n\nAfter refining the topic, the researcher needs to collect and organize materials which will help him to conduct the study. He needs to assess their relevance and credibility to ensure that they provide relevant information to the research study. Afterwards, he should take notes and compile all the information gathered from different sources in a logical format to help him carry out the remaining part of the study. After all these processes have ended, a researcher can begin working on the research project.\n\nData Analysis\n\nThis is a process through which gathered data in a research study is assessed, edited and proofread to make it more accurate and logical. It helps to make the data easy to interpret by different people who have a direct interest in its findings. Data analysis makes it possible for data to be aggregated.\n\nTherefore, a researcher is able to reveal processes used to come with findings of the study more clearly. During the process of data analysis, a researcher is able to use different techniques to edit the data gathered to make it more coherent and logical. This makes it possible for him to evaluate if there are any gaps in information and how they affect research findings.\n\nData analysis also enables a researcher to choose the most effective format through which results of the study gathered can be displayed. It also makes it possible for a researcher to look keenly at the quality of measurements done by different research instruments used to conduct the study.\n\nThis allows a researcher to look at the variance of statistical tools used to measure different variables to assess whether they contribute positively to the study. Therefore, data analysis enables a researcher to find out if the study conducted has satisfied the specific objectives outlined in the research proposal.\n",

PESTEL Analysis of the French Business Environment\n 4. Political Aspects\n 5. Economic Aspects\n 6. The Socio-Cultural Environment\n 7. Legal Aspects\n 8. Conclusion\n 9. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nFrance is one of the developed economies in Europe. This country is one of the most attractive markets in the world. Officially known as French Republic, this country is located in West Europe, but has overseas territories. It is the largest country in West Europe, and is considered to have the second biggest economic zone in the world.\n\nFrance has been one of the world’s leading powers economically, politically, culturally and even in military. This country was one of the leading colonial powers between 18 th and 20 th century. The economy of this country is very strong, considered as the second largest in Europe, and fifth largest in the world. It is the ninth largest economy based on the purchasing power of its populace. According to the report by Kurtz (94), this country is the wealthiest nation in the entire Europe in cumulative household wealth.\n\nThe living standard in the country is comparatively high, with good education and health facilities. According to Shovlin (67), the French are known for their love for flashy goods, especially those that show status. These are some of the factors that make this country an interesting business environment. This study is focused on understanding cultural, political, economic and legal aspects of doing business in France.\n\nExternal Business Environment of France\n\nCultural, political, economic and legal aspects of a business make up the external environment of a business. External business environment is very important because it will always determine success or failure of a business. A firm cannot survive in a business environment that is hostile.\n\nAccording to Kurtz (12), external business environment always dictates growth and development of a business. In order to understand business environment of France, a PESTEL analysis will be important. This economic analysis tool will help us understand France as a business region, and its viability in supporting growth and development of firms.\n\nPESTEL Analysis of the French Business Environment\n\nEnvironmental scanning can be done using PESTEL Analysis. This involves the analysis of political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal environments.\n\nPolitical Aspects\n\nFrance is one of the leading democracies in the world. This country became a republic in 1792, after being Kingdom of France since 843. The country is headed by the president as the head of State, and a prime minister who is responsible for running cabinet affairs. Politically, France has a very stable government.\n\nThe country has experienced a long period of political stability that has made it conducive for business. It has a very stable government that is supportive of business operations. According to Schaffer (29), the political environment of France has been very supportive of business operations. This scholar says that the political class has created a clear distinction between politics and business environments.\n\nThe transitions from one regime to another have been very peaceful, and none has ever had a serious negative effect on the business fraternity for almost the last five decades. Lack of political stability would mean that various businesses are not in a position to conduct business normally. Some firms may even be forced out of the market with huge losses in case the instability is accompanied by looting and arson. The government has also developed goodwill in helping develop the private sector.\n\nThe government has liberalized the economy, a fact that has allowed other firms to enter into this market from other countries globally. In order to encourage entrepreneurship in the country, the government has developed a number of incentives, including reduced taxation, or tax grace periods for the entrepreneurs. The government has also created a good environment for foreign investors by removing bottlenecks, especially during the registrations process.\n\nEconomic Aspects\n\nAs was stated above, France has the second largest economy in Europe on the basis of Gross Domestic Product. Although the GDP is always very important when analyzing the attractiveness of a country in sustaining a business, the most important factor is always the wealth held by individual citizen.\n\nThis country is the wealthiest nation in Europe in average house hold wealth. This means that its citizens are the strongest, in terms of purchasing power. This makes the country a very attractive market for firms interested in venturing into it. The report by Fortin (94) also shows that this country is ranked ninth in purchasing power parity by GDP. This means that wealth of the nation is not held by a few clicks of individuals.\n\nThis increases the purchasing power of the country. The French are considered to be one of the highest spenders. The French do appreciate the need to spend, but they also spend a good part of their income. It is important though, to appreciate the fact that this country has also been experiencing economic recession that has been affecting the world from time to time. The country was affected by the 2008/2009 that hit the United States and European economies.\n\nFirms in this country were faced with economic recession that hit various countries in the world. This had serious negative effects on the firms’ revenues as many customers would consider some of the products as non-basic. When the economy of a country is on a decline, the purchasing power is reduced, and this reduces the viability of various businesses.\n\nThey will be forced to cut down their operation levels, as the market will have a reduced capacity to sustain them. During such times, weak firms are always faced out of the market. The government has however, worked very hard to ensure that the economy of this country is maintained at a stable rate. The French government came up with various policies immediately the 2008/2009 economic recession was ended. The government has endeavored to ensure that the economy of the country do not experience difficulties it faced.\n\nThe Socio-Cultural Environment\n\nIt is not possible to analyze the cultural environment without looking at the political environment of the country. France has one of the richest socio-cultural environments in the world. Kurtz (39) says that France has a very rich cultural heritage that makes it stand out among many other countries. The socio-cultural environment of this country is diversified. This is because this country has people from all over the world.\n\nThere are those countries that cherish equality, and women have equal economic strength just as men. In such countries, the firm does not segment the market based on sex, but age. France is one such country. The country has been known for its ideals and declarations of rights of man. This strange socio-cultural belief of the French was seen even during the colonization period. They embraced assimilation as their policy.\n\nIn this policy, the government of France and the society in general accepted the colonized people who accepted to transform themselves into Frenchmen to become French citizens with equal rights as other French citizens. It is one of the few western countries where discrimination on the basis of race was at its lowest even when such powerful states such as the United States discriminated against some of its citizens.\n\nOn the basis of religion, this country has several believers who are from different religions. The leading religion is Christianity. However, there are Muslims, Jews, Hindus, and Pagans among other religions. All these religions have been co-existing peacefully and without any form of friction.\n\nHowever, each group has its own beliefs that make them unique in the market. For instance, the Muslims do not eat pork. Although their population is not very high in this country, they have an impact in the market. A business unit must therefore, be careful when segmenting the market.\n\nAccording to Hardwick (112), there is a unique character that makes the French market different from others. The French generally love leisure. They also like attractive products that symbolize love for life and for others. This is the reason why it is one of the leading markets for flowers. The country is also the most sensitive when it comes to issues about colors. They have cultural beliefs about some specific colors.\n\nEach color has a specific attachment, and is therefore, suitable for different occasions. A firm must take a keen consideration when choosing colors for its products. This society is also very careful about diction. Every word has a special meaning. As a marketer, one would need to be very careful with the choice of word used during the promotional campaigns. Any wrong usage of word may cost a firm its market share.\n\nThe technological environment in this country is very dynamic. Technology inventions and innovations, especially in the field of communication have been the main challenge and strength of various firms at the same time.\n\nWhile these firms is left with nightmares of trying to guess what their competitors in the market are going to come up with overnight, some have used this technology to emerge as the leaders in the market. Technological changes are so unpredictable and firms are struggling to come terms with these changes. The dynamism of technology in this sector has forced some firms out of the market.\n\nLegal Aspects\n\nAccording to Campbell (96), no firm can operate in an industry that has no clear laws and regulations to help in general governance. Laws and regulations are always enacted to help define the relationship between a firm and the government, a firm and the public, and a firm and other firms.\n\nThis law should be clear on various operational issues in order to ensure that operations of one firm do not affect that of another firm. Some governments always enact laws that may discourage growth of one industry, while impeding the growth of another country. Other laws may also be enacted to discourage foreign firms from investing in the country. The government of France has enacted laws that liberalize the economy.\n\nThe laws have encouraged growth of the private sector through public-private partnership. Legally, most firms have not faced major challenges. The laws that govern trade in France have been very favorable to most firms. However, some firms have faced serious litigation cases for failure to follow some of the industry rules and regulations. Of importance to note is that this country is largely a Christian state.\n\nMost of the laws of this land are based on the morals and beliefs of Christianity. For this reason therefore, there are some businesses practices that are not allowed in this country. Failure to follow the industry and national laws and regulation may not only lead to serious fines imposed by the government on the firm, but even a total closure of the firm.\n\nThe government has clearly defined how firms should relate amongst themselves. Such issues as advertisements are closely regulated, with various agencies keenly monitoring content of the adverts.\n\nThis is specifically so due to two main reasons. The first reason is to ensure that an advert for company A does not have a direct negative effect on products for company B. This is to create a healthy competitive environment where firms have respect for one another. Another reason for this regulation is because of viewers of the adverts who are below the age of majority.\n\nThere is a standard language that should be used when advertising in order to ensure that children’s mind do not get polluted with contents meant for adults. The law is also strict on advertisement of alcohol and cigarettes. Advertisements of such products as cigarettes must be followed with warnings to the users about their health. The country has illegalized trade in hard drugs such as cocaine, heroin among other hard drugs.\n\nThere are some environmental concerns that have legal implications. France is one of the developed nations in Europe. There are environmental agencies that have come out strongly to defend nature. Firms operating in this country should be aware of the laws that are enacted to protect the environment. Contravening these laws may result in litigation against the firm. This can cause serious financial consequences.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrance is one of the developed nations in the world. It is one of the leading economies in Europe. Business environment of this country is unique. In order to have a comprehensive analysis of this market, PESTEL analysis is very vital. Politically, this country has had a long period of stability.\n\nDifferent regimes come to power and leave, but with a lot of peace. The nation has had a long period of peace, without any serious civil strife that could affect business units adversely. Economically, this country has one of the largest economies in the world. The purchasing power of the French is very high because the wealth of the nation is not held by a single individual, but spread among many. This means that most of the citizens of this country have the capacity to make purchase of their desired products.\n\nThe socio-cultural background of this country is diversified. The country is home to various people from different cultures and religious beliefs. They have co-existed peacefully, but with each practicing beliefs that they believe in. This rich culture has seen this firm rated as the highest visited country by tourists in the world. The country has legal systems that help ensure that there is sanity in the business environment.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCampbell, Dennis. Legal Aspects of Doing Business in Europe .

      "The Sociology of Religion Aspects Essay\n\nDiscussing the aspects of sociology of religion, it is necessary to refer to the religion as the social phenomenon when the religious groups can be determined and analyzed as any other social groups according to their specifics and goals. The sociology of religion as the sphere of knowledge is developed by sociologists in relation to their discussion of the issues of religion in its connection with the society.\n\nThere are a lot of problematic questions studied by sociologists in this field of knowledge which are associated with the nature of the people’s religious beliefs and realization of their religious practices in the social life. It is important to pay attention to the fact that religion as the concept within the sociology of religion is discussed and examined with the help of the scientific methods used in the field of sociology.\n\nHowever, the subject matter of such an examination is the people’s religious beliefs and practices. Thus, following Johnstone’s discussion, it is possible to state that sociology of religion can be defined as the study which focuses on determining and analyzing the people’s attitudes to the sacred notions, their beliefs and practices, and their visions of the definite sacred beings and events.\n\nThere are questions about the relevance of discussing religion not as the individual choice or practice but as the social phenomenon studied by sociology of religion. Nevertheless, sociologists provide many arguments to support the idea that religion should be also examined in the context of sociology and that this subject is really important (Furseth).\n\nTo support the vision, Johnstone analyzes Simmel’s considerations in relation to the issue and states that “society precedes religion. Before religion can develop, there must first exist general patterns of social interaction – that is, a society – that can serve as a model” (Johnstone 30).\n\nThus, it is possible to conclude that any religion cannot exist without society because it emerges within it. From this perspective, the subject is important because it refers to both the society as studied by sociology and people’s religious visions. It is important to concentrate on studying sociology of religion because religion develops according to the definite patterns of interactions used within the definite social group (Furseth).\n\nFurthermore, in his statement, Turner provides the answers to the questions about the nature of the sociology of religion and its importance. According to Turner, “religion refers to those processes and institutions that render the social world intelligible, and which bind individuals authoritatively into the social order.\n\nReligion is therefore a matter of central importance to sociology” (Turner 284). Religion is important for the sociological studies because it is one of the major spheres of the people’s life, and it can influence the development of the social group in relation to determining the definite religious practices and rituals along with following the certain moral presumptions.\n\nThe religious visions of different groups are also different. That is why, the study of the religious practices can provide researchers with the important information about this or that group of people as a kind of the social community.\n\nAccording to Turner, the examination of the religious phenomena among which it is possible to determine magic and myth can be effective for developing the sociological knowledge (Turner 284). In his turn, Johnstone states that religion is closely connected with studying the group dynamics as well the social impact that is why religion can be discussed as the subject matter of sociology (Johnstone 2).\n\nMoreover, the study of the members of the group and their interactions is significant to explain their religious beliefs, practices, and rituals. To understand the particular features of the social development, it is necessary to pay attention to the ideas and beliefs which are interesting for the representatives of the social groups at the spiritual level of their perception of the world.\n\nSociologists are inclined to determine a lot of theories according to which the religious visions were developed and perceived by the public. It is necessary to accentuate the rational choice theory as the most appropriate one to explain the origins of religion from the sociological perspective.\n\nAccording to Johnstone, the rational choice theory is a theory that tries “to deal seriously with not only the persistence of religion but also the observation that some form of religion appears to be ubiquitous among societies, even if some individuals deny the validity of the religions that surround them” (Johnstone 36).\n\nIn spite of the fact there are many opinions that the rational choice theory cannot be discussed as relevant to explain the origins of religion because of its rationality and appropriateness to refer to the economic processes rather than to the moral and spiritual choices, this theory is effective to discuss the people’s choice of religion as the conscious act to receive some benefits from this choice (Bruce).\n\nThe rational choice theory can be used to explain how people make the necessary choice in relation to their religious vision. People are inclined to act rationally in almost all the spheres of their life, basing on the definite personal or public’s experience (Corcoran). To make the choice, it is important to examine the situation and its implications with references to the positive and negative perspectives. Johnstone accentuates the fact that people make the similar rational choices also in relation to choosing the religion (Johnstone 36).\n\nThis choice is based on the experience and on the proper examination of the information about different religions, their rituals, practices, and moral presumptions. Johnstone stresses that “people have a set of mental images stored in their brains with which they make decisions as rationally and sensibly as they know how” (Johnstone 36). From this point, it is necessary to concentrate on making the right choice because of the variety of the possible religious visions which exist in the contemporary world.\n\nSociology of religion began to develop in the 19 th century, and a lot of its aspects require their further discussion by researchers because of the significant controversy in vision of the main theories used in sociology of religion to explain its main ideas or the nature of the religion as a phenomenon.\n\nThe characteristic feature of sociology of religion as the study discussing the people’s religious beliefs and attitudes to the sacred points is the dependence on the empirical information used to examine the main aspects of this sphere of knowledge. Thus, the religious concepts and the people’s beliefs and practices are examined with the help of the sociological methods which are rather scientific, and they allow speaking about religion as the social phenomenon which can be observed and studied with references to the definite social group.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBruce, Steve. “Religion and Rational Choice: A Critique of Economic Explanations of Religious Behavior”.

      "Through a Computer Display and What People See There: Communication Technologies and the Quality of Social Interactions Opinion Essay\n\nIntroduction: Communication Technologies Come to the Rescue\n\nIt is hard to deny that communication technologies play a great role in the lives of billions of people all over the world. With the rise of technology and the surge of innovations that have opened new possibilities for communication between the people in different parts of the world, ordinary live conversation seems to have faded into the background, making more room for new means of communication.\n\nBecause of the current fascination with technological advances and the active use of the latter, people are rapidly losing the skills of live communication, which is likely to lead to a number of difficulties in socializing, both concerning people’s personal life and business affairs.\n\nReaching for the Most Remote Corners of the World: The Positive Aspects\n\nOne of the most obvious advantages of communication technologies is the fact that with the help of the latter, one can keep in touch with the people who live miles away, which would be completely impossible without the recent innovations.\n\nTherefore, it can be concluded that with the help of the current developments, the distance between the subjects of communication is no longer a problem, not to mention the fact that new forms of media have offered the methods for distanced learning (Atkin 71). However, there are still a lot of issues about communication technologies that need to be revisited.\n\nGetting Lost in the Virtual Reality: Where Technologies Fail\n\nLosing touch with the real world is the hazard that everyone has talked about; ironically enough, even the new forms of media that the given problem concerns have been used to discuss it. Indeed, with the growing impact of social network, people seem to be losing the skills of live communication, which is likely to lead to considerable problems in future. Moreover, frequent use of technology as a communication tool can lead to negative social effects, such as the need to stay anonymous (Levi 262).\n\nHence, the threat of deindividualization becomes much more tangible: “The members of virtual groups are more anonymous. This leads to what psychologists call deindividualization, which is the loss of self-awareness and evaluation apprehension caused by feeling anonymous” (Levi 262). It is worth mentioning, though, that the latter concerns rather online chatting than the use of mobile phone or social networking.\n\nHumans vs. Machines: Concerning the Probable Prospects\n\nHence, it seems that technologies will definitely be of great help in providing high-quality means of keeping in touch. However, it still must be admitted that technologies will never be able to replace personal contact, while they should not.\n\nAccording to Partee, live communication is essential for people: “We humans need personal contact to communicate values” (Partee ix). It is clear that once the current communication technology takes over the world, the tradition of personal conversation will disintegrate into a mess, since people will most likely lose the necessary skills required for a live conversation.\n\nAnother Means to Raise the Stakes: Technologies Have a Chance\n\nOne must give credit to the developers of the modern communication technologies, though; it is clear that, when used reasonably, these technological advances can help greatly. Therefore, it can be assumed that, when used with due care, communication technology will not make people less sociable, but will help them keep in touch despite the distances between them (Shih and Hung, 67).\n\nAbout Use and Abuse: A Reasonable Solution to the Problem\n\nTo balance out the use of live and virtual communication, it is necessary to realize what the current technological advances offer (Konijn, Utz, Tanis and Barnes 19).\n\nTherefore, it is necessary to consider such innovations as mobile phones, smartphones, computers, etc. not a substitute for live communication, but an additional opportunity to get in touch with the one who is currently not available in person. With such an approach, it can be expected that technological advances will be used as a complementary communicational tool, and not as the only possible one.\n\nConclusion: Looking for a Compromise\n\nIt is hard to ignore the fact that communication technology in many aspects is very helpful, since it provides chances for people to arrange something concerning not only their personal life, but also their business issues, which means that communication technology development boosts business processes.\n\nWith all due respect for the engineers who have provided the humankind with the existing technologies for even more efficient communication, one still has to admit that in many ways, the given technologies kill the tradition of live conversation slowly, but steadily.\n\nSince technologies have become so fully integrated into people’s lives that rejecting thee technologies means losing a huge chunk of their lives, at the given stage, a compromise between virtual and live communication must be provided. Therefore, technologies must be used only when the alternative method of communication is not available.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAtkin, David J. “Communication Technology and Social Change: Theory And Implications”.

      "Influence Of Nationalism And Communism On The Non-Western World Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Nationalism and Communism in Asia\n 3. Nationalism and Communism in Sub-Saharan Africa\n 4. Nationalism and Communism in Middle East\n 5. Work Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nNationalism is defined as the advocating of national interest, independence or national independence. It is understood as the consciousness of nationalism of an individual group. It is the awareness of distinguishing characteristics of individual nations like language, culture, customs and traditions. During the 19 th century, all countries of the globe had been brought together by the single world system; this system linked people and regions both economically, socially and politically.\n\nDuring this period, the world was dominated by the countries of Western Europe and North America. In colonized worlds, nationalist groups began challenging the European control due to the inspirations of the democratic traditions of Western Europe and America or the fascism and communism of east Europe. In India, for example, there was the emergence of the nationalist congress that supported liberation.\n\nNationalism and Communism in Asia\n\nIn countries like Japan, class mantra was the order of the day in the areas that were controlled by communists, the CCP which was the main political party was against agrarian radicalism and hence abandoned the class oriented war and its policy of compulsory acquisition and allocation of property. All this effort was centered on national salvation, and it resulted in land lords lowering their rent rates, and the interest rates though the peasants had to work for them.\n\nThese programs of the Mao and the CCP resembled those of the KMT where the landless population was considered the real force behind Red Revolution through the political eminence in the Communist Party. Indeed, there was a clear-cut relationship between Japanese invasion and the expansion of communism since it was motivated by the desire to create nations where none existed or to streamline the already existing states (Duiker and Spielvogel 563).\n\nDuring the 20 th century, countries such as China, India and Vietnam which were old societies were swept by the aspirations of nationalism and convulsions. This was largely motivated by a national feeling since the overriding tactic emphasized by Lenin as instruments of communist’s revolutionary was the desire to forge ahead and devise a united front with nationalistic movements.\n\nWith regards to a country like Korea, Russia due to its ability in machinery started training and installing a communist government and placed it under the leadership of Kim 11-Sung, and this led to the division of south Korea into two namely: the Peoples Republic of North Korea and the Republic of South Korea.\n\nEastern Asia is the region that bore the brunt of pro and anti communism battle. During the period of 1920, nationalism and not communism was the main driving force and there were several nationalist groups in Vietnam, Burma, Indonesia and Malaysia. It was as a result of the nationalisms that the sympathy for communism slowly developed.\n\nThe threat of communism was indoctrinated by satellite media stations that were dominated by the USA, and it was concentrated in South-East Asia and particularly Vietnam and Cuba or Western hemisphere as well as Africa. Just like communist revolutions in Europe, nationalism was the powerful political instrument that characterized revolutions in Africa, and it was spearheaded by African Marxists and Kremlin communists.\n\nVarious nationalist leaders had rejected egalitarian or a classless society but when they managed to overthrow the imperialists. The communist’s parties turned against their allies in liberations to execute power and to perpetuate socialist revolution.\n\nUSSR was considered to be the epitome and an advocate of nationalism. Lenin had the strategy of fanning communism all over the world or beyond the boundaries of Europe, according to him; this was to be realized through his policy of communist international or shortened as Comintern.\n\nComintern was an organization of communist parties that was oriented towards the advancement of world revolution. The headquarters of Comintern was in Moscow where communist agents were trained on the concept behind communism, and they were sent back to their countries to form or establish Marxist parties that would promote the cause of social revolution.\n\nCommunism did not command a lot of influence in the Middle East and only appealed to communist minorities like Armenia and Jews. The main proponents of Marxism in the non-western world were rootless intellectuals who were motivated by patriotism or egalitarian communism reasons to join the movement (Duiker and Spielvogel 564).\n\nIn Confucian societies like China and Vietnam, communism had a great impact because the traditional belief systems had failed to counter the westerns challenge. In Buddhist and Muslim societies, communism recorded minimal success due to the existence of traditional cohesive religions.\n\nCommunism and Marxism had a strong impact in China as evidenced in the formation of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) by a group of young radical Chinese as consequences of the 1911 failed revolution. By 1920, there existed nationalism-communism alliance that threatened to eliminate any central authority in China.\n\nThis period was characterized by the emergence of two competing political forces namely: the nationalist party that sought to solicit international assistance to facilitate its national revolution and the CCP that was aligned towards the strategies of Lenin (Duiker and Spielvogel 524).\n\nNationalism and Communism in Sub-Saharan Africa\n\nThe degree of communism influence on African nationalism is a subject of debate. It can be true to posit that indeed communism influenced African nationalism since nationalists sought for aid from the communists powers to overcome the capitalism that was tied to colonialism.\n\nIt is indubitable that agents of communism were critical in nurturing the infant African nationalist movements regardless of the fact that there existed philosophical and ideological incongruence. The communists support for FRELIMO for several years resulted in a Marxist Mozambique. The collapse of Portuguese colonialism which was the weakest of all the European domination in African led to the emergence of communists governments like Angola that joined other socialist elites like Tanzania, Guinea and Congo.\n\nNationalism originated from the west, and the nationalism in the non-western world is a pirated version of the western type of nationalism. The industrialization that took place in the west is what determined nationalism since it began spreading to other parts of the world. In sub-Saharan Africa, the strategies and the tactics of the Soviet Union worked.\n\nAfrican nationalists derived their ideologies from the theses that were titled: the socialist revolution and the right of nations to self-determination as well as a form the second congress of the communist international.\n\nCommunist side did not place a lot of interest on Africa not until the Second World War, but they target India and China but world war tow placed USSR in a better position to influence affairs outside Europe. The victory of Mao was considered as a victory for communism. Countries like Germany, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria also upped their efforts to introduce communism in Africa and their interest appeared to parallel those of the USSR only that they lacked an elaborate strategy.\n\nThe commercial ventures and their political activities in the sub-Saharan Africa fell under the elaborate network of the Soviet policy. The one party state structure and the absence of official opposition that dominated the African politics is a characteristic of communism.\n\nIn countries lime Indonesia, the influence of Marxist and communism was aimed at maintaining neutrality towards Islam, in this regard the nationalist opponents emphasized the atheism of communism, but this was not enough to deter community coup in Indonesia.\n\nCountries of Latin America experienced hard economic problems due to their heavy reliance on export and there was also increased hostility between the Latin America countries and the USA, and they began modeling their governments along the fascist regimes of Germany and Italy (Duiker and Spielvogel 532).\n\nNationalism and Communism in Middle East\n\nThe Arab nationalism which was a nationalist ideology was motivated by the desire to end western and European domination in the Arab world and the overthrow of those governments that heavily dependent on the western world. The nationalist individuals considered themselves as the descendant of Ottoman Empire and Damascus was chosen to be the coordinating centre of the nationalism. This happened following the establishment of France and British mandate.\n\nVarious parts of Asia and Africa experienced some rise in movements that championed for national independence, and it was spearheaded by native leaders who had obtained education in western and European countries. The civil disobedience of Mahatma Gandhi was instrumental in freeing India of British rule. There was also the emergence of communist movements in parts of Asia, and it was considered an alternative way of overthrowing western powers and eliminating imperialism (Duiker and Spielvogel 532).\n\nWork Cited\n\nDuiker, William and Spielvogel, Jackson.

      "Intergenerational Communication at Call Center Organization Essay\n\nIntergenerational communication is a communication that involves conversations among people of all ages; the old, adults, young people and sometimes children.\n\nFamilies are the most used and best examples of intergenerational communication because there are communications between parent and child, child and grand parent, parent and parent (father and grandfather), aunt and niece and many others (Kaplan 9).\n\nHowever, intergenerational communication also takes place outside the family unit. For example, it may occur in the fields where young people interact with adults while practicing or training. The aim of this context is to examine an intergenerational communication at the work place that involves all the primary means of communication. The best example to explain this is the Call Center Organization workforce and modes of communications involved during internal and external operations (Greenberg 38).\n\nImmediately after my high school education, I got an opportunity to work at a certain Call Center Organization as a casual employee. The function of the Call Center was to install home networks to clients, receive calls, voice messages, and pass them to necessary parties and carry out cable installation activities.\n\nThe organization contained all workers from all age groups; young people, grown-ups and older individuals. In my department, the supervisor was an elderly person while senior manager and field coordinator, MR. Scott was a middle-aged person.\n\nThese two individuals were strong friends, but they never agreed sometimes due to their age and life span experience differences (Hummert 17). About 80 percent of the field personnel were younger people headed by an old person, Mr. James who was in turn under a middle-aged person, Mr. Scott. This supervisor commented on almost everything associated with us (young workforce) especially the personalities.\n\nHe could never fail to comment on the dressing mode which he disliked. We used to wear casual clothes in most occasions because the organization ignored how the field people wore. The organization issued aprons which we only wore during the actual operations in the field either during installation of cables or home networks but not during any other time.\n\nMr. James was against T-shirts and jeans, which we loved most, and he wanted us to dress on shirts and office trousers as he did. At one time, he told us that, “I wish I was the head of this organization; everybody would be wearing official as an employer, but since senior manager is a middle-aged person, he is not much concerned with dressing.\n\nAs a manager, you should ensure that everything runs officially in a smart way to portray a good organizational image. I wonder why I did not head this Organization after Mr. McDonald retired; I think I am the right person to head it” (Nussbaum et. al 23).\n\nAccording to his words, I noted that age difference is also a significant factor influencing the performance of organizations. Mr. James could have been a dutiful manager in the organization, but then he could not be in clear terms with young people because he criticized almost everything we did. When installing cables and networks, he could criticize computers due to their multi-performance that he said they mislead young people.\n\nHe only noted the negative use of computers by young people, for example, watching porn through the Internet, the use of face books, online dating and such things, but he never noted the positive influence of computers in Organizations and society (Greenberg 90). In fact, despite working at a technology-associated Organization, technology was a mess to him because computers, for example, performed tasks that could be performed by people, meaning that they denied people opportunity to work.\n\nMoreover, Mr. James once told me that young people do not deserve a decent wage because they waste a lot of money in unimportant things like purchasing jeans clothes, going to party in clubs, dating and many other related things. He wished that he were the manager so that he could pay us minimal wages that could only be enough to meet the primary needs.\n\nThis clearly show that the organization could not perform competitively because some youths would move to other Organizations or just resign because I do not think there is a young person who could withstand such principles from Mr. James (Mahwah & Angelis 44).\n\nMr. Scott, on the other hand, was a likeable person who was responsible for the operations and performance of the organization. He interacted well with young people who were the greatest workforce in the organization. He ignored the clothing because in as much as we wore casual, we looked decent, and the performance was excellent (Kaplan 92).\n\nThe only problem was that he did not allow us to use the computers exhaustively especially in accessing the Internet. He thought that we could waste a lot of time using email and web sites such as facebook and twitter. We could not use email to communicate to him because he hated typing back in reply and, therefore, he only wanted us to call him or see him in his office to talk face-to-face in case we wanted to communicate to him (Greenberg 114). They forced us to visit Mr. Scott’s office anytime we wished to see him.\n\nThis is because he did not want us to write to him. In fact, he could frequently arrange meetings to communicate to us about everything concerning the organization while young workforce preferred to remain at their working positions and communicate through emails. These differences resulted from the difference in age and life span experience (Mahwah & Angelis 80). He was extremely comfortable and confident with the way we carried out the duties both on the field and in the organization although he sometimes differed with us.\n\nFor instance, he abundantly educated and urged us to work together as a team to help each other whenever a need arose. This is because he had noticed that young employees loved working in isolation with their attention on their individual tasks. They did not mind checking and helping one another particularly during classification of projects.\n\nOften, the reply was, “That is his job not mine: I am working on mine,” (Nussbaum et al. 23) when he approached some of us to help colleagues accomplish their tasks. Mr. James implemented the same during field installation works where he urged us to help one another in different areas to accomplish the work quickly and perfectly.\n\nTherefore, apparently, middle-aged and older workers are at ease incorporating numerous parts of a scheme, and they expect to play a part in discussions concerning every bit of the project without counting on who was to accomplish the task. This show that elderly people view it as shared responsibility while young workforce views it as interference (Hummert 32).\n\nMy conclusion from the interaction during the normal operations is that age matters at the work place. In fact, the diversity of ages in the workforce is what determines how individuals learn about generational crowds distinct from their own intergenerational communication experienced at home.\n\nThis is the similar case in nonprofit Organizations during volunteer circumstances where an intergenerational leading board makes issues tough. It is effective in comparison to governing boards with most members coming from similar age groups. The differences develop from the fact that we were individuals who have lived through distinct history eras with distinct values (Mahwah & Angelis, 81).\n\nMoreover, different age groups had different skills and habits holding to distinct standards of behaviors. Therefore, diversity of age, background, ethnicity, language, history, gender and other characteristics are particularly essential in all organizations because they present different views that contribute to the growth of the organization. Therefore, intergenerational communication is significant in organizations because it helps them grow and builds on skills and values of the workforce.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBeliefs about Intergenerational Communication across the life span. 2010.

Since the invention of wheel in the ancient world, improvement of transport sector has dominated human activities. Over the years, infrastructure has improved in virtually every country.\n\nThis is attributed to economic developments, which are spurred by the need to move goods and services from one place to another. This has enabled man to improve their infrastructure as well as vessels and resources required for transportation. For instance, modes of transportation have increased and improved with inventions after inventions. Moreover, improvement on vehicle models have enabled man to reduce on energy costs.\n\nAs much as these developments have made work easier in improving economic development, this has come at a great cost to human lives since most of these vessels use energy from fossils, which are being depleted repeatedly. In fact, fear is gripping the world on its future since exploitation of fossil fuels has reached its peak.\n\nMoreover, these fossil fuels have increased the world’s susceptibility to natural calamities like famine, unpredictable weather, and global warming, among other severe effects. This has led to research and investment on alternative energy, which is aimed at conserving our environment. This paper will therefore explore the roles of alternative energy resources in shaping global transportation infrastructure. In this regard, it will emphasize on the invention and use of electric cars to achieve environmental conservation (Sperling & Deborah, 2009, p. 22-26).\n\nElectric cars (PHEV)\n\nPlug in electric cars have gained popularity in the recent past, especially with rising concern on depletion of fossil fuels as well as their effect on environment.\n\nThese automobiles employ electric motors to propel their movement. To achieve this, the motors draw electric energy from batteries or in some cases, other energy storing devices. Its popularity flourished mainly in the early 20 th and late 19 th century. Since then, it has continued to gain popularity as people resort to green energy.\n\nLater on, ideas came up on how to deal with issues such as driving range in electric cars, recharging time, and the lifetime of batteries, among others.\n\nIn addition, most potential customers feared that the batteries might lose its power before they reach their destinations. All these concerns along with gas emissions in both hybrid and conventional ICE cars led to calls for merging. In this regard, a new car came up, which is now known as Plug in Hybrid electric vehicle (PHEV). These cars are already increasing in popularity and numbers. It is expected that within the next 10 – 20 years, their costs will drop significantly.\n\nThe fall will be attributed to increased investments and grants on electric car batteries. For instance, the United Sates federal government has put in place a project to manufacture electric car batteries through grants among other, incentives. Owing to their significance in reducing environmental pollution through emissions, and noise, as well as depletion of natural resources, a huge market is expected to flood PHEV cars (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nEffects of environmental pollution have led to various natural calamities as well as health risks to human lives. For this reason, adopting PHEV cars would be beneficial to health and environment. This is mainly due to the impressive advantages of green energy as well as destructive effects of fossil fuels. In addition another reason for rush towards green energy is because it is cheap and favors recycling. Use of these vehicles has declined shortly in the 20 th century due to the introduction of cheaper gasoline vehicles.\n\nMoreover, ways of producing alternative fuels such as biofuels have increased speculations on its viability. However, despite its high production cost, electric cars are still considered the best model of cars that would help save our environment. This is mainly because fossil fuels are non-renewable, meaning that continued exploitation would result in exhaustion. This has driven oil prices to very high levels that had never been witnessed before.\n\nIt is also quite important to note that Use of biofuels is quite withdrawn since it negates food production. Furthermore, the world is undergoing tough times, with famine and drought, among other calamities. Planting crops or fuel would be unwise compared to using electric cars. In this regard, invention of electric cars remains one of the best in human history. It has several advantages that include reduction in pollution through noise, greenhouse gasses, among others.\n\nHowever, it is also of major concern to note that production costs for electric cars are still way ahead of most people. There are several models of electric cars. These include Nissan leaf, Buddy, Tesla Roadster, and REVAi, among others (Kirsch, 2000, p. 153-162).\n\nStatus of the PHEV (Pug-ins electric vehicles) technology\n\nThis technology combines the two methods, use of electric motor to propel the vehicle as well as (internal combustion engine. This is very helpful as it mitigates the drawbacks of electric vehicles as well as those of highbred vehicles. This results in low greenhouse gas emissions, pollution, as well as cost of transport. Another factor that receives attention is driving range, which has been faulted in electric cars.\n\nFortunately, PHEV is well prepared for such eventualities, since it has both electric motor and ICE for fuel. Therefore, in the event that battery runs out, hybrid vehicles can convert to ICE powered propellers. This makes it easy for owners and improves the vehicle’s driving range. Merging of these, two technologies have improved efficiency of PHEV in terms of recharging periods. However, the only barrier to its full usage is he cost of production.\n\nThis is major concern as in the case of purely electric cars. However, recent research have shown that by 2020, their costs will depreciate considerably as prices of rechargeable lithium batteries will fall by about 50%. Green stimulus packages that are currently rolled out by most governments are working to promote building of more PHEV cars. This is good news to the world as people seek to reduce on greenhouse gas emissions (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nEven though electric cars provide man with ways to conserve their environment and reduce on greenhouse emissions, they are very expensive. This is mainly because additional cost of its Lithium ion battery.\n\nOn the other hand, conventional combustion engine of vehicles release emissions that continue to deplete the Ozone layer. In effect, people are torn between the two, either since they can buy cheaper cars with high maintenance cost or expensive ones with cheaper maintenance cost. In addition, potential customers shy away because of its unpredictability.\n\nInfrastructures that have been laid down cannot support recharging of electric cars. This would mean that whoever buys them must have a private recharge facility, which is more expensive. Furthermore, there are no guarantees that power may not run out before one reaches his/her destination.\n\nElectric cars are propelled by electric motors, which are in turn powered by electricity through a controller. This technology allows for storage of electric energy in rechargeable batteries. These batteries can then be recharged at common places such as recharge centers or even with household electricity. However, its use has not received wide support concerning driving range.\n\nIn addition, as opposed to conventional fossil fuel engines, recharging takes time and increases costs on the buyer when the battery needs replacement. The car utilizes motor and battery to increase its efficiency. It is also quite important to note that these cars produce no emissions from tail pipe; this makes them more efficient and environmental friendly. Another advantage of this technology is the fact that it gains torque faster and in silence.\n\nGenerally, it seems more efficient to combine the two. This has market the newest technology on electric cars by combining its electric elements with hybrids. These cars are referred to as plug in hybrids. It combines hybrid facilities with electric motor thereby improving on drawbacks of purely electric cars (Sadden, 2011, p. 1).\n\nStart-to-End supply chain for PHEV\n\nThe world is preparing for a huge roll out of new models of PHEV cars within the next 5 years. The market is expected to receive over 30 products and models of PHEV cars with different brands to choose. Most PHEV vehicles have been utilized in neighborhood movements, but this is set to change as the world prepare for a major transformation in transport infrastructure. Several charging stations are set to increase in the United States and other dominant countries in the world like Australia and Canada (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nMethods of conversion and consumption\n\nPHEV technology allows a car to be charged throughout the night. The vehicle then utilizes this stored energy during day. The technology is very popular as it improves vehicles’ efficiency as well as gas mileage. These vehicles utilize two methods of energy consumption and conversion.\n\nThese are electricity and gasoline. This means that when the battery is low, then gasoline can be used for transport. Energy consumption by PHEV cars are considerably low, for instance, when the battery has power it runs on electricity thereby minimizing gas emissions.\n\nThis saves fuel usage and is more economical compared to conventional car. For instance, in United States, the calculated total energy consumed annually is quite high. It is estimated that PHEVs run on 0.33 kWh of energy per mile. On the other hand, cars that use gasoline would pay more than twice it costs to drive PHEV cars (Motavalli, 2011, p. 1).\n\nCurrent infrastructure status (production, transportation, and consumption)\n\nBecause of high production cost of electric cars, many people withdraw from buying them and instead opt for cheaper conventional internal combustion engine cars.\n\nMoreover, the transport infrastructure does not allow for introduction of many electric cars. There are very few recharging centers all over the globe; in fact, some continents like Africa have not felt the impact of electric cars. Most countries are therefore using fuel driven cars, as they can afford them.\n\nHowever, this will change in the future as prices of batteries continues fall significantly. The fall will be attributed to increased investments and grants on electric car batteries. For instance, the United Sates federal government has put in place a project to manufacture electric car batteries through grants among other, incentives.\n\nIt is also predicted that as production volumes continues to rise, and manufacturers get more contracts to produce batteries, this will reduce its cost. Another development that could spur development of global transport infrastructure on PHEVs is the recent studies, which have continued to fid ways of building batteries with same lifetime as their respective vehicles. This would make cars affordable to a variety of people in the world (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nWhat will happen to all the batteries once they are drained and how do we recycle them\n\nElectric car batteries are very expensive, in fact they have attributed highly to the total cost of these vehicles. These batteries require some hours to be recharged and just as the normal lithium cell batteries, they have to be replaced after exhaustion. The cost of replacing these batteries is still high, and disposal of used and already exhausted batteries. In addition, these batteries can be recycled to make back up grid for infrastructures.\n\nFor instance, technological research on Lithium ion batteries has not reached their peak, leaving ways for more technological developments on the same. Furthermore, it is known that even after use, PHEV batteries still hold more than 60% of energy. These can be utilized in management of Grid load, storage for renewable energy and as backup power for communities, among other uses. This makes them even more useful after use in motor vehicles (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nKey issues for growth of the clean energy resource\n\nGrowth of green energy has been sought for decades after it became clear that oil wells were being depleted. In the process, several proposals have come up.\n\nThese included nuclear power, electricity, and geothermal energy, among other renewable sources of power. This did not leave transportation infrastructure aside because it is one of the main contributors to pollution and environmental degradation. In this regard, hybrid and electric cars were introduced.\n\nConsequently, plug in hybrid electric vehicles have come up with various challenges to growth of clean energy resource. It is quite important to note that PHEV vehicles have contributed significantly to the reduction of emissions to environment. However, it is of essence to continue towards achieving the objective, which is a clean energy resource (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nSeveral key issues may spur growth of clean energy. These include conversion from the traditional internal combustion engines into electric motor vehicles. Besides, achieving the objective is yet to be made. This is mainly because most power productions in the United States are derived from coal mining, another resource that risks exploitation.\n\nMoreover, the high risks associated with nuclear power plants as witnessed in Japan would not make the world safer. It is therefore important that people learn of ways to help conserve the environment. The following key issues shall therefore be discussed concerning growth of energy resource (Randall, 2004, p. 1).\n\nSecurity of supply – how to ensure uninterrupted supply of the alternative energy resource is available at reasonable cost\n\nEnergy supply is very important in if it can be sustained. Security of supply is therefore necessary for continued conservation of the environment. Another important aspect sustainability and security is cost. It is very important for energy to be supplied at a reasonable price.\n\nSecurity of demand – how to ensure consistent demand for the alternative energy resource (e.g., for producers, one concern is security of demand. If consumers take large quantities one year and none the next, producers make huge losses).\n\nSecurity of demand for alternative energy is also very essential to producers. To ensure this, importance of PHEVs should be made known to potential buyers. In addition, they need to ensure that their products are efficient. In this regard, PHEVs would suit buyers since it has a wider driving range.\n\nReliability of energy supply forms another alternative energy security issue. Energy delivery reliability is an increasingly contentious topic (e.g., wind is not reliable for year round use).\n\nReliability is very important for sustainability of the resource. Electricity is reliable and sustainable since it can be produced through many ways that are reasonable and secure. PHEVs are quite reliable in that they have the capability of propelling either electric motor or internal combustion engine.\n\nPhysical security of installations and personnel – Energy security includes the physical security of alternate energy installations against acts of sabotage, terrorism, piracy, and other harm. What specific steps are needed?\n\nTo ensure physical security of alternative energy, production of the energy should be done in accordance with the laid out procedures. Chemicals utilized in production facilities should be protected against potential sabotage, piracy, or even terrorism.\n\nExplain current technology availability and specific technology advancements required to implement this future alternate energy vision\n\nThe current technology combines electric motor with internal combustion engine to prolong driving range.\n\nProvide expectation of future governmental policies that will affect your selected energy choice\n\nMost governments have focused their policies on transforming transportation infrastructure. In addition, In addition, governments all over the world are continually shifting towards green energy. To achieve this, they have laid out strategies that include stimulus packages and incentives.\n\nFor instance, the United States government is giving grants of up to $5000 to people who buy electric cars. Moreover, additional benefits such as incentives on packing fees have also been introduced in major cities like London and New York to push for green technology. All these are aimed at improving dependence on clean energy resource (HybridCars, 2011, p. 1).\n\nAssess the selected energy infrastructure, size and level in 2010, 2015 and 2020 (e.g., gallons used, number of alternative cars, number of refineries, etc.)\n\nResearchers are predicting continued increase in production of PHEVs. According to these estimations, plug in hybrid electric vehicles will grow beyond 150 000 by 2012. This production is expected to be constrained until all the required facilities and infrastructure is in place by 2020.\n\nGenerally, it is also estimated that production will rise at an average rate of 20% until 2020. The current assumption is that there are about one million plugs in hybrid electric cars in the world with hundreds of thousands being built annually (Abuelsamid, 2009, p. 1).\n\nProvide key determining factors that will be critical in the assessment\n\nAssessment of these figures will depend on consumer response to emerging markets. It is clear that most people are still gripping with effects of recession. In this regard, a good number will not be able to afford PHEVs in 2010. However as we move to towards 2012, and with the assumption that economic growth will improve, more people will consider purchasing these cars.\n\nIt is also of essence to note that expected high number of productions will lower prices significantly. This will act to reduce cost of battery infrastructure. Other key issues that will critically affect this assessment include the surging fears of global warming. There are very few recharging centers all over the globe; in fact, some continents like Africa have not felt the impact of electric cars. Most countries are therefore using fuel driven cars, as they can afford them.\n\nHowever, this will change in the future as prices of batteries continues fall significantly. The fall will be attributed to increased investments and grants on electric car batteries. For instance, the United Sates federal government has put in place a project to manufacture electric car batteries through grants among other, incentives. It is also predicted that as production volumes continues to rise, and manufacturers get more contracts to produce batteries, this will reduce its cost.\n\nVarious parts of the world are currently experiencing unpredictable weather. This will be very instrumental in pushing for green energy to conserve our environment. Another key issue that will spur movement towards PHEVs is depletion of oil resources, which are estimated to be severely depleted by 2050. As expected, this will put pressure on fuel prices, leading to its unsustainability in motor vehicles.\n\nThe outcome will be increased demand for PHEVS and alternative energy, leading to rise in production and hence lowered cost. Furthermore, more research is being conducted on Lithium ion batteries to find ways of increasing its driving range and sustainability. In addition, governments all over the world are continually shifting towards green energy.\n\nTo achieve this, they have laid out strategies that include stimulus packages and incentives. For instance, the United States government is giving grants of up to $5000 to people who buy electric cars. Moreover, additional benefits such as incentives on packing fees have also been introduced in major cities like London and New York to push for green technology. All these are aimed at improving dependence on clean energy resource (Chang-Ran, 2010, p. 1).\n\nAssess which countries will be early adopters\n\nElectric cars have been in existence for some time, and mainly in the developed world. Countries such as the United States, Japan, China, India, South Korea, among many European Countries have already adopted strategies to move towards green technology through electric cars.\n\nFor instance, the United States government is giving grants of up to $5000 to people who buy electric cars. Moreover, additional benefits such as incentives on packing fees have also been introduced in major cities like London and New York to push for green technology.\n\nOther countries such as Australia, Germany, France, and Britain have made progress in production of electric cars. However, with every country now focusing on green energy, and the expected fall in prices, more people throughout the globe will shift towards PHEVs and hence reduce on greenhouse emissions.\n\nThis is mainly because these countries have governments that show great concern for exploitation of fossil fuel. In addition, they have resources and the work force to research and develop new ideas that would shape global transportation infrastructure (Yuri, 2010, p. 1).\n\nConclusions\n\nOver the years, infrastructure has improved in virtually every country. This is attributed to economic developments, which are spurred by the need to move goods and services from one place to another. These developments have enabled man to improve their infrastructure as well as vessels and resources required for transportation. For instance, modes of transportation have increased and improved with inventions after inventions. Moreover, improvement on vehicle models have enabled man to reduce on energy costs.\n\nAs much as these developments have made work easier in improving economic development, this has come at a great cost to human lives since most of these vessels use energy from fossils, which are being depleted repeatedly. In fact, fear is gripping the world on its future since exploitation of fossil fuels has reached its peak. Moreover, these fossil fuels have increased the world’s susceptibility to natural calamities like famine, unpredictable weather, and global warming, among other severe effects.\n\nIntroduction of PHEVs has continued greatly to development in the world, as governments tend to shift towards green technology. This is done in an effort to mitigate on effects of global warming. Recent research have shown that by 2020, their costs will depreciate considerably as prices of rechargeable lithium batteries will fall by about 50%. Green stimulus packages that are currently rolled out by most governments are working to promote building of more PHEV cars.\n\nThis is good news to the world as people seek to reduce on greenhouse gas emissions. Moreover, additional benefits such as incentives on packing fees have also been introduced in major cities like London and New York to push for green technology.\n\nOther countries such as Australia, Germany, France, and Britain have made progress in production of electric cars.

      "Personal position on Inclusionary practices Research Paper\n\nThe campaign for inclusive education has been going on since Mann’s proposition of “common schools” in the early 19 th century. The current American society is more heterogeneous hence, the rationale for inclusionary education practices.\n\nNevertheless, what is inclusive education? Inclusion refers to a community of learners, which involves a variety of races, cultures, religion, and level of learners in terms of different learning styles, strengths and weaknesses, physical and cognitive disabilities (Miller and Katz, p. 20). Inclusion thus creates a friendly learning environment that grants learners an experience of the heterogeneity in the society.\n\nInclusion means educating students with disabilities in the regular classrooms as well as mixing students from different ethnic, religious and socio-economic backgrounds under one classroom (Hastings and Oakford, p. 87). This provides a free and appropriate public education system for all children irrespective of their race, culture, financial background, and capabilities.\n\nHence, inclusion promises success for the disadvantaged child. Inclusionary practices provide a vehicle for realizing federal and state mandates such as the No Child Left Behind Act ( NCLB ) and the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act ( IDEA ) that require educators to grant all children an equal opportunity to education.\n\nFurther, putting students with disabilities and other limiting factors in a regular classroom provides an opportunity for the less fortunate children to experience their full potential in an inclusive community and hence have a sense of belonging both in school and in the community.\n\nInclusive education in practice is more complicated hence requires certain strategies for its success. For inclusive education to be successful, all parties must share the values of inclusion. This means that everyone involved in the education system must be aware of the importance of mixing all types of students irrespective of their race, culture, financial background, disabilities and so on in one classroom.\n\nThis will go a long way towards ensuring that learners do not feel left out and discriminated against. Consequently, children will develop a sense of belonging and will be able to perform to their full potential academically.\n\nChildren with cognitive limitations may think and reason at a much slower rate than ordinary children. Putting them in a class with students who have a higher IQ helps them in that their minds are triggered to work almost as fast as their counterparts do. Such children should be encouraged to be able to cope in the classroom.\n\nHence, it is important for teachers and students to value these individuals and appreciate their differences (Hastings and Oakford, p. 90). As Shafik Abu-Tahir states, “Inclusion is recognizing that we are one even though we are not the same” (Dattilo, p.26)\n\nOne of the major barriers to inclusion is negative attitude. Students and teachers have a tendency of developing bad attitudes towards students who are not of their race, or because they come from a poor background. Teachers may not want to include them in school activities such as school trips and symposiums.\n\nThis may make such students feel unwanted and left out and eventually develop a low self-esteem. As a result, such students may become rebellious, and register poor academic performance, anti-social behavior and other unruly traits. Therefore, it is imperative that teachers and students understand and appreciate each other regardless of their different backgrounds.\n\nIn conclusion, inclusion is the solution to the problems our schools face due to increased social heterogeneity in the society. Once students from various backgrounds, including those with disabilities and other limitations develop a sense of belonging, their self-esteem will rise and their interest in school will be at its peak. Hence, students will be able to realize their full potential because of the equal opportunities granted to them.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDattilo, John.

      "Human Rights: Analysis of Ludlow Massacre and the “Valour and the Horror” Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Ludlow Massacre\n 3. The valour and the Horror\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nHuman rights movement and activists rely on historical information in finding the nature and extent of historical injustices in the society. The future of the society depends on their clear reflection and view of the historical background as the society tries to navigate the daily challenges.\n\nThe contemporary society is the product of the history hence historical events and injustices are integral factor that determines the bearing of the society. The importance of historical information begs a question of how valid is the historical information and how credible are the historians.\n\nAccording to Zinn, “everyone is biased, whether they know it or not, in possessing fundamental goals, purposes, and ends (48). Due to inherent biasness and partially in historical information, Zinn is caution us not to rely on historians and journalist but be flexible to consider omissions and de-emphasis of vital information before making any conclusion on a historical event (49).\n\nZinn conclusively argue that, “All written history is partial in two senses. It is partial in that it is only a tiny part of what really happened …it is partial in that it inevitably takes sides, by what it includes or omits, what it emphasizes or deemphasizes” (49). This essay is going to describe Zinn’s argument in detail and evaluate its validity using two major historical events: Ludlow massacre and the “Valour and the Horror” documentary.\n\nThe Ludlow Massacre\n\nThe events that lead to the Ludlow massacre were the series of coal workers strikes at the Colorado mines under Rockefeller’s Corporation. The workers were under strict watch by the police not to form any labor union to champion their rights and the Rockefeller Corporation detectives shoot dead the labor organizer Gerry Lippiatt.\n\nHis death enraged coal workers in the Trinidad, they held meeting to condemn his killing, and they vow to continue to fight for the rights. The organizer of the United Mine Workers, Mary Jones addressed them saying, “What would the coal in these mines and in these hills be worth. Unless you put your strength and muscle in to bring them….You have collected more wealth, created more wealth than they in a thousand years of the Roman Republic, and yet you have not any” (Zinn 52).\n\nThe workers resolved to strike and were evicted from the Rockefeller company houses and they moved to the tents at the United Mine Workers where they were they were threatened by the gunfires at their tents so that they can end their strikes but they persisted. The workers were lured into the massacre after a series of fights with the detectives that made the mine owners to resort to massacre, by brutally attacking and killing innocent children, women and men because they demanded their rights (Zinn 54).\n\nAccording to Zinn, the reason why this historical massacre was not in the historical books nor taught in the class is that, politically, the Rockefeller Corporation was a more important industry than workers rights and industrialization was everything no matter the bloody cost on the lives of the workers.\n\nTo harmonize the view of historians and industrialists, Zinn concluded that, there is “a certain unspoken understanding lay beneath the writing of textbooks and the teaching of history: that it would be considered bold, radical, perhaps even “communist” to emphasize class struggle in the United States” (58).\n\nHence, there is a culture or ideology of focusing only on economic achievement rather than social impacts of the industrialization because the objective a high school book entitled Legacy of Freedom is to “aid the student in understanding the economic growth and development of our country” (Zinn 59). So here, legacy of freedom is not human right but it is an economic growth and development, which is a partial and biased objective of the freedom legacy.\n\nThe Ludlow massacre is an example of a historical event that was omitted by the historians since the source of the story did not come from the historical books but from the song artist and English literature. The story is about labor struggles of the Colorado coal miners that eventually lead to the massacre.\n\nThe important historical event that shows how the Americans suffered and endured hardships during their labor conflict struggles. I wonder why such an important historical event that depicts the labor conflicts and the cost of the lives of the Americans was not part of the college history curriculum. I think is due to political and historian deliberate deception not to reveal how the government blundered in the brutal killings of innocent workers instead of championing their rights.\n\nThe valour and the Horror\n\nThe valour and the horror is a documentary showing Canadian involvement in the World War II. The documentary aimed at provoking the society to ask “hard and critical questions” about Canadian involvement in World War II where together with the Britain they bombed German civilians. The documentary summed up that, “Let us celebrate the valour, but speak the evil and the horror” (Dick 254).\n\nThe historical documentary has stirred differing views of interpretation from journalists, politicians and the public depending on their values and interests.\n\nThe documentary received great reception in the media and public arena but great resistance from political arena. The controversy ensued over the historical interpretation of the World War II participation by the Canada. The critics of the documentary argued that, “the series was unfair and inaccurate and denigrated their role in World War” (Dick 253) and they launch a strong campaign against the broadcast and the documentary.\n\nThis controversy evokes lot of questions as to why and how can a historical fact be subjective to many interpretations. The broadcast protested about the Senate subcommittee decision to investigate the controversial documentary arguing that, “we believe it will be difficult for fair-minded people to take any notice of findings arrived at in such an obviously biased process and we regret that the Senate has chosen to proceed in this fashion (Dick 255).\n\nWith much pressure, they were compelled to review the documentary to reflect “greater journalistic balance” (Dick 256). The radio and television commission carried out their review and concluded that, “history cannot be considered as a single immutable truth” (Dick 256).\n\nThe historians were ironical in that they have been actively criticizing Canadian military involvement in the World War II in their own books and articles but this time round, they have strongly protested against the documentary (Dick 265). The controversy over a factual historical event, even by historians themselves has clearly proved beyond reasonable doubt that historians and their records are partial and biased in their entire objectives and can never be relied upon.\n\nConclusion\n\nBasing on the two historical events, historians and historical records are biased. The reporting and analysis of an historical event depends on the historian interest and the overriding political interest. The Ludlow massacre was neither found in the historical books, nor taught in colleges, because the American political ideology was at that time focusing mainly on economic development, nobody had much concern about the civil rights, and champion for the interest of workers.\n\nIn the “Valour and Horror” documentary, the political interest overrides the public interests in the quest of the truth about historical injustices that led to bombing of innocent German civilians in World War II. Hence, the validity of any historical information is subject to powerful political figures and biased historians who would otherwise change history to suite their ends.\n\nThe great controversy that ensued in the documentation of the military involvement attracted more political interest and public to the extent of recommending the regulation of media. History deals with factual events but the problem lies in the subjectivity of the interpretation and documentation of important historical events.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDick, Ernest. “The Valour and the Horror” Continued: Do We Still Want Our History on Television.

      "The Reasons and Justifications of the ‘Middle East’ Naming Research Paper\n\nThe name ‘Middle East’ is a common name for everyone, yet it is not understood in full by most people around the world. The name ‘Middle East’ needs to be clearly defined worldwide because of the controversy that the name ‘Middle East’ evokes among the people. In fact, it is thought by some people that such name as the Middle East does not exist. Therefore, to prove the existence of the ‘Middle East’, several questions have to be answered as well as identify those who named the place, and the reasons behind its naming.\n\nThis paper is, therefore, an in-depth analysis of the ‘Middle East’, by trying to give reasons and justifications of its naming. Later in the paper, the effects of holding the name will be discussed with more emphasis on how it affects the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) states.\n\nSeveral years ago, such names as “Near East” and ‘The West’ were given to the place currently known as the Middle East. Normally, geographical locations are used in defining and naming various regions. However, the naming of the Middle East has proved to be difficult even with geographical locations. Geographically, the Middle East is located in the Southwestern part of Asia and in the North Eastern side of Africa (Bilgin, 2004, p.27).\n\nThis area lies in between Europe and East Asia commonly referred to as the Far East. As such, it includes nations such as Cyprus, Gaza, Israel, Iran, Turkey, Lebanon, Egypt, Iran, and other nations in the Arabian Peninsula including Kuwait, UAE, Oman, Saudi Arabia, along with Yemen.\n\nThis list of countries making up the ‘Middle East’ is not conclusive because different writers and historians have different thoughts regarding the number of countries to be included in that list. For instance, some have included Egypt and Libya in the Middle East nations, while others have omitted these countries.\n\nOne would wonder why there has been the cause of disagreement in the term ‘Middle East’ for such a long time. As such, most international organizations have campaigned for the acceptance of the name ‘Middle East’ given its familiarity among people. On the other hand, there are those who claim that the name of the place is purely symbolic. Hence, another name should be adopted to replace the name ‘Middle East’.\n\nThe research done indicates that nations located in the Middle East suffer from economic and social effects because of the fact that the ‘Middle East’ is associated with the Arab World, as such, all countries that are united by one name are thought to be of the Arabic culture (Essaid, 2009, p.1).\n\nNevertheless, this is not true because there are other countries associated with the ‘Middle East’ but that are not of Arabic culture. It is interesting to note that the term is also misunderstood even by the people who are living in the region (Essaid, 2009, p.1).\n\nMany writers and historians have tried to popularize the term ‘Middle East’ in a bid to have it globally accepted. Among numerous writers is Alfred Thayer whose article popularized ‘Middle East’ in the year 1902. His intention was strategic since most of the super power nations, such as Great Britain and the United States of America had refrained from supporting the ‘Middle East’ nations given the controversy in its name.\n\nThis impact can be evidenced even up to date. Before oil was recovered in the Middle East, the term had been used to refer to the region in the midway of the two important regions of the world. However, currently, the Middle East has been broadly redefined to include the Gulf Cooperation Council states, such as North Africa, Iraq, Iran, as well as Levant (Pappé, 2005).\n\nThis is the mostly understood and accepted definition of the term ‘Middle East’ as viewed by the western nations, political leaders, and international bodies. However, the naming of the Middle East has significantly affected the GCC nations in terms of the economic analysis. Most often than not, Middle East nations are now believed to start mingling with the Indian continent, thus, becoming an obstacle for those who want to do business with the GCC states.\n\nIt is clearly evidenced by the fact that the trade between GCC nations and Asia is far much better and beneficial than the trade with the Arab world. As such, the GCC nations can be considered as being part of the West Asia given the good relationship they have with India and China. Recent statistics shows that much of the energy used in China’s manufacturing firms originates from the GCC states (Molavi, 2011, p.1).\n\nIt can, therefore, be concluded that the name ‘Middle East’ should not be changed since it totally suits the region named. It is, nonetheless, expected that the nations located in the Middle East must be well defined, which will not only solve the controversy in the naming but it will also create an understanding of what it entails for the entire world.\n\nReference List\n\nBilgin, P.

      "Design Concept for a Convention of Medical Doctors Essay\n\nTo provide a successful entertainment party for 500 medical doctors, it is very important to consider a number of steps: to choose an appropriate convention center, to evaluate the building and think about proper lighting and decorations, to understand how it is better to locate tables, and to occupy the guests with interesting and funny activities.\n\nConsidering the fact that it is a cocktail party where guest will not be seated, no speakers are invited, and icebreaker reception is required, it is necessary to pay more attention to available event space and design concept.\n\nThe Grand Prospect Hall, to be more precise the Grand View Ballroom, is the chosen convention center. It is located in Park Slope, Brooklyn (The Grand Prospect Hall, 2007) and is considered to be one of the most amazing historical places in New York. Cocktail parties are available for more than 500 people ( Cvent Supplier Network , 2010) so that each guest may enjoy the offered comfort and beauty.\n\nThe size of the hall provides planners with numerous opportunities to develop any kind of entertainment and invite some famous singers or musicians. Such idea meets the requirement set – all guest will mingle and certainly feel relax. There is no need to organize some thematic party and oblige guests to dress themselves accordingly.\n\nNow, more attention should be paid to the design concept for the chosen event. Subdued light is a successful decision to be made because guest may relax, be unnoticeable if necessary, and choose any attitude. As all guests do not have an opportunity to seat, it is necessary to have an empty space in the middle of the room: cocktail tables should be located around the whole room, and some space should be provided between the tables so that the guests are free to stand there and enjoy the time spent.\n\nIn spite of the fact that there are no places for sitting, it is crucially important to consider some space with chairs in case some guests will be in need to sit and relax. It is also necessary to take into consideration the tables for empty glasses and plates.\n\nIt is an entertainment party, so, it is possible to make use of funny posters or even helium balloons may be appropriate. It is necessary to consider the fact that these balloons should not prevent appropriate illumination of the room. Another considerable part of entertaining program may be a concert of some singer-star. There is no necessity to listen to the whole concert offered by a star, still pleasant background music seems to be appropriate for a party.\n\nIcebreaker reception for guests may become paper badges with nicknames for each guest. To succeed in such activity, the planner should be aware of every guest and have solid background about all of them. Such badges will be helpful for all guests specially for those who are not familiar with each other in a good way.\n\nDrinks should be also properly chosen for an entertaining party especial for such party where guests will not be seated (Shock & Stefanelli, 2008). It is wrong to have some strong alcoholic drinks like vodka or whisky because guests should be able to control their behavior and communication with each other.\n\nIn general, the design concept for the event where 500 medical doctors entertain is based on appropriate illumination, a number of balloons to put the guests in a good mood, background life music, and control over drinks.\n\nReference List\n\nShock, P.

      "The Major Point in Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong Analytical Essay\n\nThe book criticizes erroneous approach of the majority of textbooks in history\n\nThere can be no surprise that the school is the place which forms the basis for the development of critical thinking of many people. Children get their basic knowledge in the most important disciplines. One of the most important disciplines is history: there is even the famous saying that people / nations who do not know their past are doomed to repeat it.\n\nOf course, American scholars understands the importance of students’ understanding of past events, however, some academics claim that there are too many controversies in history that are not revealed in textbooks on history which can produce negative consequences for the development of the entire nation.\n\nOne of such academics is James Loewen who considers the controversies of history education in the USA in his famous Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong . The entire book is permeated with the idea that students in schools are taught “refined” history which distorts their perception of reality.\n\nLoewen states that the vast majority of textbooks provide only one-faceted opinion, they present the “Disney version of history” omitting controversies and blemishes in the American history (Loewen 27). He also states that such erroneous approach to history education can lead to wrong passive position of people who believe in their heroic country which had no difficulties throughout its history.\n\nThe role of text-books in education and their drawbacks\n\nLoewen points out that the majority of people in the USA know the history of their country from the school course and the textbooks. He states that many textbooks have few references to secondary sources. Thus, Loewen stresses that there is a large gap between the knowledge of historians and the amount of facts the rest of Americans are taught (Loewen 267).\n\nMoreover, Loewen provides the results of the research held in 1990 which revealed that 40% of teachers (who participated in the research) had a B.A. or M.A. (Loewen 280). This situation only contributes to the fact that students get information about the history from their textbooks only.\n\nOf course, not only textbook authors but teachers as well try to omit any controversies in history. It is easier to enumerate particular names, dates and events without discussing various backgrounds, downsides and impacts on the further development. Thus, textbooks authors pick up some historic events that seem to them heroic or essential and omit many other details associated with these events.\n\nUnrevealed Wilson’s blemishes\n\nOne of such erroneous representation of facts is illustrated by the period of Woodrow Wilson being the President of the USA. According to Loewen numerous textbooks depict this personality as a hero who led glorious policy, but in reality introduced many controversial changes in political and social life of the country (Loewen 25).\n\nFor instance, Loewen pays a lot of attention to Wilson’s racism and anti-communism (Loewen 25). There is no information in the majority textbooks as for Wilson’s policies in these areas. Numerous textbooks omit mentioning suppression of African-American people. It was Wilson who succeeded in depriving African-Americans from their rights; for instance, even positions in government which were assigned for African-American during Wilson’s presidency were occupied by white Americans.\n\nMany textbooks ascribe the witches hunt to Wilson’s government not him, but, in fact, he was a great supporter and initiator of many anti-communism campaigns (Loewen 29). Thus, textbooks in history have created a heroic president instead of a man who made many mistakes, however, at the same time introduced lots of positive changes.\n\nPositive example of Lincoln’s development remains unexploited\n\nAnother good illustration of the wrong representation of historic events which Loewen provides is another American president, Lincoln. Loewen stresses that correct depicting of this remarkable leader can be very useful for the development of analytical skills of students who could learn that politics address every audience in different ways and that it is important to analyze officials’ words rather than take them literally (Loewen 172).\n\nMoreover, the “internal struggle” of this man can be a very good example how people can develop under the pressure of circumstances (Loewen 172). Loewen points out that it is essential to provide different points of view instead of trying to create positive image of the country and the government. People should understand that sometimes their government may act inadequately, erroneously. Students should learn about various blemishes in the history of their country to be ready to some controversies in their real life.\n\nSocial controversies are also unrevealed in textbooks\n\nLoewen also mentions that textbooks in history are often produced from the perspective of the upper-class. He states that such sources omit dwelling upon some social issues since a “theory of social justice” can hardly be in line with the data about wealth distribution in the country (Loewen 206).\n\nAnother disputable question is a depiction of immigrants. As a rule, textbooks in history reveal successful stories of immigrants who became respectable members of society, but they do not dwell upon those difficulties immigrants had to cope with (Loewen 195). According to Nieto Loewen raises very important issues in his book: he stresses the importance of presenting different points of view on the same event or personality (Nieto 44).\n\nThe “linear and fixed” representation of events from the perspective of the dominant group makes student think that they are “passive in making any changes” (Nieto 44). Of course, such dangerous perception should be changed.\n\nLoewen’s suggestion to problem solution\n\nLoewen stresses that students should be able to analyze the historic events carefully and make corresponding conclusions. He suggests a possible way out and states that it can be helpful to include fewer events in textbooks and pay significant attention to discussion of controversies or different points of view on the same event (Loewen 309). Thus students will be able not only to remember some important landmarks in the history, but will understand the background of these events and their impacts on the modern life. Of course, students will have critical perception of the reality and will be able to influence the course of history when it is necessary.\n\nThe main idea of the book\n\nThus, the main idea Loewen reveals in his book Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong is that students should have the opportunity to consider various points of views and different facets of the same historic event to have the right perception of the past, present and future.\n\nStudents should know about the controversies of the American history to respond adequately to different events taking place in the contemporary times. Students should know that not only wise government is responsible for the development of their countries: first of all, each person should make the necessary contribution to build a strong and really democratic state.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nLoewen, J.

      "Cindy Mason liked this time of the day. It was just getting dark and swirls of snow swept past the windows. It was almost time to lock up the library and go home for the holiday weekend. She paused by the histoncal section and peered down into the street. All the office workers were streaming out for their cars, heading for the bars and other strange attractions they went for. Cindy gave a slight sneer of disapproval. They were not her kind of people, most of them, definitely not refined enough. And most of them thought of her as a stuck-up bitch, she knew. Well, better to be stuck up than as disgusting as most of them were. And the crude sexual jokes they cracked as she passed in the corridor-they were the most disgusting of all. She was probably the only person left in the building now. She turned back to her desk. She had just a little bit of sorting to do and she would go, but she had to be sure. As Head Librarian, it was her duty to make sure everything went smoothly. That meant she should probably check the upstairs part of the library, not leave it to chance and the whim of Arnie the janitor when, and if, he came in tomorrow. He would probably be too drunk anyway. The only good thing about him, in Cindy's opinion, was that he left her strictly alone, didn't make any of those comments the other workers made. Vainly Cindy posed in front of the full-length mirror on the wall. She knew she was beautiful, with her long dark hair flowing down to her shoulders and her soft face with its wide brown eyes and full, sensual mouth. She also had a wonderful pair of legs, and she knew that too, loved to show them to the best advantage, show the men what they wanted and couldn't have. But she was proudest of her tits, two swelling, full, melon-like mounds that pushed the front of her tight blouses until it often seemed they would burst. She stared at herself, knowing that under the frilly white top, her nipples pushed against the nylon of her bra, outlined clearly against the thin silk of her very expensive blouse. That blouse had been a gift, of course. She got many of those from men who wanted to fuck her, use her for their disgusting ends. But Cindy knew all about that, and they wouldn't get her pussy. Her mother had been right, always telling her that you didn't give anything to a man until you were married and then only the minimum you had to to keep their disgusting lusts satisfied. And then you had to be careful because they always tried to get more than they needed. \"Just like your father, Cindy,\" her mother would say. \"Always wanting to, to use me. But I put a stop to that. It was a good thing he ran off with that slut of a secretary of his, a good thing, very good.\" Cindy's mother was certain of a great many things like that. Cindy was probably going over to see her mother on Sunday. Her mother would like that. Perhaps, perhaps not. Cindy would have to go to church first of course, and there would be so much to do. But perhaps, if she found the time. Work took up so much of her time she was very glad she had a long weekend to herself. She sat down at her desk and pulled the pile of papers to her. In the utter silence of the darkening evening there was only the occasional thump from the old heating system as it cooled or heated up against the stone walls. As she worked, Cindy thought she heard the door behind her open. It was strange. All the downstairs doors would be locked and no member of the public could get in now. She turned and the shadowy figure of a man stepped out from behind one of the bookcases and walked toward her. Cindy gave a slight scream and covered her mouth as she leaped to her feet. \"Hi, Cindy,\" said the man. Cindy fell back into her ci'talr with relief and a lot of anger. \"What are you doing here?\" she almost shouted. \"I said I never wanted to see you again.\" She sat there, her tits heaving. \"Well now,\" said the man, coming up to her desk and sitting on it with complete assurance. \"I thought you'd be glad to see me.

      "Okay, you've heard the jokes: \"mini\" phones are, at this point, considerably larger than the \"big\" high-end phones of previous years. So let's just assume that whenever Samsung employs the word \"mini\" in the name of a device, it means \"looks kinda like the other one, but cheaper.\" Such is the case with the Galaxy S5 Mini, the third mini phone to spring off of Sammy's flagship line.\n\nThe S5 Mini's screen is 4.5 inches large with a resolution of 720p. Which, at this point, is merely average in terms of Android phones. It's got a 1.4Ghz quad-core processor (probably a Snapdragon 400), 1.5GB of RAM, and an 8MP rear camera twinned to a respectable 2.1MP front-facing cam. And of course, the phone features Samsung's Holy Trinity of cell phone design: a Super AMOLED screen panel, a removable battery, and a MicroSD card slot. Which is good, since 16GB of storage won't go very far these days.\n\nWhat's surprising is that Sammy managed to cram a lot of the standard Galaxy S5's features into the smaller and presumably cheaper build. Water-resistant IP67 body? Check. Pulse oximeter? Check. Fingerprint scanner? Check. It even includes things you might actually use, like Android 4.4 (with all of Samsung's apps and TouchWiz visual customizations) and an ultra power saving mode. The phone's looks and physical design are essentially identical to the S5, it just feels like it went through the dryer.\n\nSamsung says that the Galaxy S5 Mini will go on sale in Russia later this month before it expands to global markets. It will be available in black, white, blue, and gold. Expect it to pop up on some (but not all) American carriers in a few months.\n\nSource: Samsung Tomorrow",
      "Artbound's editorial team has reviewed and rated the most compelling weekly articles. After putting two articles up for a vote, the audience chose this article to be made into a short-format documentary.\n\nThe phrases \"public housing\" or \"low-income housing\" do not generally conjure thoughts of architectural innovation. Instead, one may envision rows of faded pastel cubes surrounded by dead lawns and tall fences, or looming concrete towers gridded with small windows. Both schemes are typically weighted with a grim institutional air, appear to have been built as cheaply as possible, and often address only one problem, shelter, amid many others.\n\nBut it doesn't have to be that way, as several recent housing developments in Los Angeles prove. Instead, they pose the question: What if low-income housing was perceived as leading the vanguard of innovative, responsive architecture?\n\nTake the recently completed Star Apartments, located in the heart of downtown's Skid Row. Commissioned by Skid Row Housing Trust, and designed by renowned L.A. architect Michael Maltzan, it provides permanent housing and social services to the formerly homeless. Star Apartments is also breathtaking architecture, consisting of a staggered row of four-story white blocks hovering over the existing ground level. Between these two levels is a large terrace, providing communal outdoor space away from the street. To save on cost and construction time, the 102 housing units within the blocks were prefabricated and lifted by crane on top of each other like blocks. Maltzan states that it's the first multi-unit housing to use this method since the mid-20th century, a time when prefabrication was celebrated as a modern, mechanized solution to the housing problem.\n\nBesides offering permanent subsidized housing, Star Apartments features an on-site wellness center, medical clinic, and community areas for socializing, making art, using computers, and exercising. As Theresa Hwang, Community Architect at the Trust notes, these additions to the residences represent a unique architectural investment in community-building activities. \"It's really pushing the typology of permanent supportive housing,\" she says.\n\nStar Apartments is Maltzan's third design with the Trust for this population. His Rainbow (2006) and Carver (2009) apartments also offer spaces for socializing like courtyards and communal gardens and kitchens. It's an especially urgent design element for a population that can feel extremely cut off from public life. Skid Row Housing Trust, a non-profit diversely funded by the city and state, federal tax credits, grants, and donations, is driven by the question: \"How can the homeless become viewed as equal if their housing is not?\" As to questions about spending more than the bare minimum on their projects, there's an equation. Living in equal housing creates a sense of pride which in turn encourages permanence for the residents. As the Trust maintains, if the residents remain in stable housing, that means they're at less risk of ending up with medical emergencies or being arrested and sent to prisons; it ultimately saves taxpayer money.\n\nBesides Maltzan, the Trust has partnered with Koning Eizenberg Architects, Killefer Flamang, Perkins + Will, and other notable local firms. The results are an emerging landscape of strikingly designed buildings, responsive to the needs of their residents, and far more compelling, architecturally, than many of the indistinguishable condos rising throughout downtown.\n\nIn fact, these residences are creating a new design-trail, with requests to tour the buildings pouring in daily. \"If our buildings become an 'architectural playground' that could be a positive thing,\" says Hwang. \"It helps break down borders between people.\" It may also help to integrate this kind of housing into more affluent neighborhoods that often attempt to bar it.\n\nNoting that most urban transformation often results in huge centralized projects like L.A. Live or The Grove, Maltzan points out the unique geographic dispersion of the Trust's buildings, which are building up \"a series of small points on the map over time. If you were start to draw lines between them and create an imaginary web, you realize that that also can have an enormous effect on the whole perception of the city.\" He adds, \"Frankly, I think that's what the Trust is achieving. They're changing the city one increment at a time, but it's starting to become a very large and powerful influence.\"\n\nIn addition to innovative architecture, the Trust's design process itself is unique. Each architecture firm has meetings with staff, property managers, and current and future Trust residents to discuss the design plan and how it should be altered. \"This way the aesthetics of the project are deeply linked to its functionality from the beginning,\" says Hwang. Hiring architects willing to experiment, listen to the residents' needs, and create uplifting designs the city can be proud of, is something the Trust (as well as similar organizations like Santa Monica's Community Corporation and West Hollywood Community Housing Corp",
      "The fall of Pokemon GO\n\nWith the new API about to be fully reversed (It's still not done but shouldn't be much longer, definitely this week-end), there are a few points I'd like to discuss about the recent changes made by Niantic.\n\n\nI understand about a company trying to keep the integrity of its game. As long as it doesn't hurt their userbase that is.\n\nNiantic has made pretty terrible choices lately and I believe they're self-sabotaging the game on purpose to try to to \"control\" the growth of their game.\n\n\nFor me, the tracking isn't the biggest issue with Pokemon GO, it's all the security measures Niantic is taking in trying to stop people from tinkering with their codebase which in turn hurts the real users.\n\n\nHas anyone noticed how battery hungry the game has become after the 0.37.0 patch? How sluggish the game feels since 0.37? How the game doesn't run on some phone brands anymore unless you do advanced manipulations?\n\n\nThose are all measures they implemented to try to stop us, reverse engineers, from trying to understand their game protocol and logic.\n\n\nLet's tackle the first issue, battery usage increase due to their obfuscation.\n\n\nPrior to 0.37, to do 1+1, the only issued \"command\" was 1+1 (simplifying, this isn't how arm assembly works) , it was a single cpu cycle. Right now, to try to hide the real 1+1 from us, they do lots of random operation such as 5*39, 45/9.45, 1+1 , etc etc, which add a lot of cpu cycle aka battery usage + lag.\n\n\nThis is why reversing the API has taken a long time this time around, this obfuscation adds lots of bogus code flow and instructions that are useless for the end result, they're just here to slow us down from trying to understanding the code. In the long run it doesn't stop us. But it stops older model phone from running the game smoothly because what was once a game that ran on almost most android 4.4+ is now a game that can be run smoothly on only 600+€ devices.\n\n\nThe second issue is SafetyNet which in my opinion is Niantic/Google's dumbest business decision. SafetyNet is like GameGuard for Android. It stops root and modified kernel from running the game. Side effect: Most chinese brand, blackberry are blocked without even being rooted.\n\nThe android ecosystem is dev friendly and encoruages rooting as well. Cheaters don't need root to cheat. Reverse engineers can bypass safetynet easily to deobufscate & reverse engineer the code. Once again this security measure doesn't stop us but it stops legit users from playing.\n\n\nSafetyNet was meant as a measure to make Android Pay run only on trusted environment. It wasn't meant as an Anti Cheat system.\n\n\nNow this is my message to Niantic: Keep obfuscating if you don't care about performance issue on your game, keep using SafetyNet if you want to block 5-6% of android phones.\n\n\nBut don't be surprised if your userbase is tanking and don't be surprised about the huge backslash from the community.\n\n\nDon't be another Hello Game. Listen to your community and open the api. You can still save Pokemon GO.\n\n\nWe'll keep reversing your game as long as your game is popular.\n\nFastPokeMap will continue to come back no matter how hard you try to kill it.\n\nBut if you keep trying to kill it don't be surprised if soon there won't be anyone playing your game anymore.\n\n\nThe hotspot in my area used to have 300-400 people playing. Since all your changes + changing the api there are only 3-4people playing.\n\nThe game is dying and it is all because of your poor choice to try to fight the wishes of your community.\n\n\nThis is where you show off your true colors:. Are you making the game mostly for profits or for your community?\n\nReply · Report Post",
      "Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell unveiled a revised GOP health-care proposal on July 13 — but two other Republican senators released a competing plan. Here's how it all breaks down. (Peter Stevenson/The Washington Post)\n\nThere are rare moments when the national spotlight falls upon a theretofore little-known member of Congress and everyone waits to see what that person's decision will be on a critical issue. For instance, prior to now it would be shocking if more than 1 in 100 Americans outside Nevada had ever heard of Dean Heller, the most vulnerable Republican senator up for reelection in 2018.\n\nBut he is about to decide whether tens of millions of Americans lose their health coverage, millions more face skyrocketing costs and millions lose the security they've enjoyed for only a few short years.\n\nNot just Heller, actually. There are a few other Republican senators whose votes on the gruesome Republican health-care plan are still up in the air. Two Republicans — Rand Paul of Kentucky and Susan Collins of Maine — have said emphatically that they won't support this bill. Because the GOP has only a 52-48 advantage in the Senate, all that's needed is one more to vote no and the bill is dead. According to The Post's whip count, there are seven others who have indicated they have concerns about it: Shelley Moore Capito (W.Va.), Bill Cassidy (La.), Bob Corker (Tenn.), John McCain (Ariz.), Lisa Murkowski (Alaska), Rob Portman (Ohio) and Ben Sasse (Neb.).\n\nConsider the nature of the choice they're faced with. Let's be clear that almost no one thinks this bill will actually be good for Americans. It will leave 20 million fewer Americans with health coverage, scale back the help that middle- and lower-income Americans now get to afford insurance, increase deductibles, lead to skyrocketing premiums for older people and gut protection for those with preexisting conditions, to name just a few of the things it does. Despite the removal of some of its biggest tax giveaways, it still contains many provisions that benefit the wealthy while waging an all-out assault on the poor. It is, in short, an abomination.\n\nSo perhaps it's not surprising that when Republicans are asked about this bill, they can't even bring themselves to make an affirmative case for it. They say one of two things, and often both: First, that Obamacare is terrible, so something has to be done, and second, that they promised for seven years that they'd repeal it and they have to keep that promise. Neither one of those is an argument in favor of this bill.\n\nSo as these senators weigh their options, on one side they have the somewhat abstract notion of keeping a promise to GOP primary voters, and on the other side they have the substantial and demonstrable harm the bill will do to their constituents. That this is a remotely difficult choice for them tells you a lot about who these people are.\n\nLet's take a look at just one piece of this puzzle, the effect of the bill's evisceration of Medicaid. If this bill succeeds, not only will the ACA's expansion of Medicaid be rolled back, but also the program will be slashed even further and converted to a block grant, which would give states the \"flexibility\" to kick enrollees off their insurance and scale back benefits. While we're awaiting the Congressional Budget Office's score of this latest version, the Medicaid provisions haven't changed from the previous version the CBO scored, in which it said that 15 million people would lose Medicaid. The Center for American Progress took the CBO's estimates and broke them out by state; here are the figures for what our wavering senators would do to the people they're supposed to represent:\n\nNevada (Dean Heller): 87,300 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid West Virginia (Shelley Moore Capito): 83,700 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid Louisiana (Bill Cassidy): 188,800 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid Tennessee (Bob Corker): 395,000 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid Arizona (John McCain): 246,200 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid Alaska (Lisa Murkowski): 17,200 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid Ohio (Rob Portman): 396,300 people losing Medicaid\n\npeople losing Medicaid Nebraska (Ben Sasse): 81,200 people losing Medicaid\n\nTo clarify, these numbers don't represent everyone who would lose coverage, only those who would lose Medicaid; the total numbers would be even higher. And there may well be other senators who could be persuaded to vote no. But each one of those senators has to understand the spectacular human suffering he or she might unleash. How do you say to a family who lost health coverage and is thrown into a pit of worry, despair, financial vulnerability and in many cases literally even death (yes, people die when they can't get medical care), \"Sorry about that, but primary voters would have been",
      "Alex Haigh, who had come to London seeking work, sentenced to 12 weeks in prison for occupying flat without permission\n\nA 21-year-old man arrested at a flat in Pimlico, central London, has become the first person to be jailed under the government's anti-squatting legislation.\n\nAlex Haigh, originally from Plymouth, has been sentenced to 12 weeks in prison after pleading guilty to occupying a housing association flat without permission.\n\nThe Crown Prosecution Service confirmed that Haigh was the first person to be given a custodial sentence under section 144 of the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act, which came into force on the first day of September.\n\nWest London magistrates heard that police officers had gone to the flat in Cumberland Street on 2 September in search of another man. They arrested three people, one of whom was Haigh, on suspicion of squatting and all three have been convicted; the other two are awaiting sentence.\n\nThe law criminalises squatting in residential premises. Housing charities have warned that it may trigger a surge in homelessness as squatters are forced on to the streets in order to avoid a criminal record.\n\nThe squatters' rights group Squash (Squatters' Action for Secure Homes), which campaigned against criminalisation, condemned the sentencing as \"deeply disproportionate and unjust\". It said the building the men were occupying had been empty for more than a year.\n\nHaigh's father, Hugh, told the Evening Standard newspaper that his son, an apprentice bricklayer, had come to London in July seeking work. \"They have made an example of him. To put him in that prison environment, I don't understand it. If he broke the law, he should be dealt with, but it is like putting someone who has not paid their taxes into Dartmoor prison.\"\n\nRueben Taylor, from Squash, said: \"This marks a dark day for our country, as a young vulnerable person is being sent to prison simply for trying to keep a roof over his head.\n\n\"The real crime is the 930,000 properties sitting empty across the UK, not the people who are bringing these back into use. This crazy law is aggressively punishing the victims of our housing crisis, at massive cost to the taxpayer.\"\n\nUnder section 144, squatting in England and Wales is punishable by up to six months' jail and fines of up to £5,000. The change in the law does not affect commercial premises.\n\nIn a circular sent to judges, courts and the police, the Ministry of Justice confirmed that what were previously known as \"squatters' rights\" – preventing forcible entry to an occupied building – would become redundant in relation to residential premises.\n\nSquash claims the cost of criminalising squatting will be as high as £790m over the next five years.",

      "The idea of legalizing a drug by arguing for its medicinal qualities is hardly new. The movement for medical marijuana, which Illinois legislators may consider for legalization this year, is more than 15 years old. Historically, the therapeutic benefits of various narcotics have been debated for centuries.\n\nEven during Prohibition, when the \"drys\" ruled the country, there was an allowance for medicinal wine and whiskey. Doctors could — and did — prescribe lots of hooch. It was a huge loophole in the Volstead Act. In March 1920, just over two months after Prohibition went into effect, an enforcement officer speaking to the Chicago Retail Druggists' Association said, \"There is an extremely large percentage of unscrupulous doctors in Chicago who are prescribing liquor at wholesale without examining their patients. Too large a percentage of druggists are in cahoots with these doctors.\"\n\nSo it should probably come as no surprise that the beer brewers — backed by the \"wets\" — thought it would be a great way to get their suds flowing again, and possibly eviscerate Prohibition before it really took hold.\n\nThe medical beer movement got a big boost in March 1921 when U.S. Attorney General A. Mitchell Palmer, shortly before he would leave his post, issued an opinion that the Volstead Act didn't in fact prohibit medicinal beer. Later that month, word came from Ralph Stone, federal Prohibition director for Illinois, that new regulations being drafted would allow doctors to prescribe to a patient up to 96 bottles of beer per month: \"3 times a day,\" as the Tribune's headline put it. This led Stone two days later to call the Volstead Act a dead letter, arguing, \"There is no denying that the country won't be very dry when a man can obtain a case of beer on one prescription and drug stores can retail it by the pint over a soda fountain.\"\n\nBut students of American history know that wasn't the last word. No, as millions of ailing Americans looking for the comfort of a good pint thought they were safe, Congress slammed shut the loophole before the year was out.\n\nA Tribune editorial a few days later questioned how \"Dr. Congress\" — eager to save the American public from the evils of alcohol — could allow whiskey but ban beer for the same purpose when most physicians said neither had any medicinal value. The editorial's prophetic conclusion: \"All it indicates is an intent to confine the drinking in the United States to hard liquor, illegally obtained.\"\n\nsbenzkofer@tribune.com",
      "There has been no justice for thousands of Afghan civilians killed and countless injured by U.S. and other international forces in the five-year period from 2009 to 2013, according to a report released late Friday by the human rights group Amnesty International.\n\nThe report, Left in the Dark: Failures of Accountability for Civilian Casualties Caused by International Military Operations in Afghanistan (pdf), focuses on operations carried out by U.S. Special Forces and troops under the command of the NATO-led International Security Assistance Force (ISAF), the large majority of which are from the U.S. The study found that even apparent war crimes carried out by occupying forces have gone without investigation or punishment.\n\nThe report documents detailed witness accounts of Afghan civilian deaths, including women and children, at the hands of U.S. forces, serving as a damning indictment of the invasion as the U.S. prepares to draw down the number of troops from 32,000 to 9,800 by 2015.\n\nIn one such instance, researchers spoke with Ghulam Noor, a farmer whose 16-year-old daughter, Bibi Halimi, was killed when a U.S. plane dropped at least two bombs on a group of women collecting firewood in a mountainous area in Laghman province.\n\n\"No one ever contacted Noor or other family members to investigate the circumstances and legality of the attack,\" the report notes. \"None of the family members were informed why the attack took place or what justification it might have had.\"\n\nAccording to Amnesty International, none of the cases they investigated—which involved more than 140 civilian deaths, including pregnant women and at least 50 children—were prosecuted by the U.S. military. Further, evidence of possible war crimes, such as torture, and unlawful killings has also \"seemingly been ignored.\"\n\n\"Thousands of Afghans have been killed or injured by U.S. forces since the invasion, but the victims and their families have little chance of redress. The U.S. military justice system almost always fails to hold its soldiers accountable for unlawful killings and other abuses,\" said Richard Bennett, Amnesty International's Asia Pacific Director.\n\nUnder international humanitarian \"laws of war,\" if civilians appear to have been killed deliberately or indiscriminately, or as part of a disproportionate attack, the incident requires a prompt, thorough and impartial inquiry. If that inquiry shows that the laws of war were violated, a prosecution should be initiated.\n\nAs international forces in Afghanistan are effectively immune from Afghan legal processes, the U.S. military justice system is the only recourse for the families of those killed. However, the report notes that the \"deeply flawed\" U.S. military justice system is \"essentially a form of self-policing.\"\n\nAccording to the report:\n\nThe military justice system is \"commander-driven\" and, to a large extent, relies on soldiers' own accounts of their actions in assessing the legality of a given operation. Lacking independent prosecutorial authorities, it expects soldiers and commanders to report potential human rights violations themselves. The conflict of interest is clear. In the rare instances when a case actually reaches the prosecution stage, there are serious concerns about the lack of independence of US military courts. It is extremely rare that Afghans themselves are invited to testify in these cases.\n\nFurther, the report documents the \"lack of transparency on investigations and prosecutions of unlawful killings,\" saying that the U.S. military continues to withhold overall data on accountability for civilian casualties and \"rarely\" provides any information on individual cases.\n\nAmong the recommendations, Amnesty International encourages the Afghan government to ensure that accountability for unlawful civilian killings is guaranteed in the pending bilateral security agreement between Afghanistan and NATO—a stipulation that the U.S. government under President Barack Obama continues to push against.",
      "Jeff Lipsky\n\nSo let's talk about your new show on NBC: It's about a guy who leaves his job because he has Parkinson's. After five years, he tells his family he's going back to work, and they essentially say, \"Don't let the door hit you on the way out.\" How much of it is true to your life?\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nMichael J. Fox It's pretty true; the names were changed to protect the innocent. In the show, my character realizes that he's not doing what he loves and he has no good reason for it. I kind of felt that way, too; beyond The Good Wife and other things, I thought there was a place for me on television.\n\nGH Just for argument's sake, maybe a reason not to do it would be that carrying a TV show is a hugely physically and mentally demanding thing.\n\nMJF A life well lived is demanding and exhausting and tiring; it was already that way without the element of work, so you could say that this job could be the straw that breaks the camel's back — but it could also be the needle in a haystack; it just gets lost in the mass of everything else. And there's the enjoyment that it gives me. It's structured differently than, say, Spin City, where I was much more hands-on. There, I was involved in hiring the wardrobe people and in negotiating with the crew and with the network to get budgets approved. Now I'm much more passive on those things, so I'm not dealing with the frustrating, energy-sapping stuff…being nibbled to death by ducks. I'm duck-repellent now.\n\nGH Did you sense that Tracy and the kids wanted you to go back to work?\n\nMJF The kids were growing up. My two middle daughters just graduated from high school, and my son is out of college and he's working. My little one is 11, but she's very independent — I get a lot from the time I spend with her, and she gets a lot from the time she spends by herself. So it was a good time in that sense.\n\nGH Was there anything your family told you was off-limits in terms of material for the show?\n\nMJF No, because it's all the essence of things. For instance, on the show, my TV family talks about how I always say, \"A lady had a baby in a tree,\" which is based on a story about a woman in Mozambique whose village flooded. She was pregnant and she was going into labor, so to save her baby, she climbed into a tree and gave birth. That stuck with me, and that image has become a kind of shorthand for our family. If my kids come to me with some complaint, I'll say [to put it in perspective], \"A lady had a baby in a tree — whaddya got?\" And that's in the show.\n\nAdvertisement - Continue Reading Below\n\nGH Did anybody tell you not to do the show? What did your doctors say?\n\nMJF It's very subjective, your experience with this condition. I've had it for 20 years now. The rate at which I'm finding ways to cope with it, to medicate it, and to apply exercise and positive thinking to it has surpassed its own march toward awfulness. I'm ahead of it. It's a presence, and it's there, and it takes a toll. Like I've said, it's the gift that keeps on taking.\n\nBut it's not enough to stop me from living my life, and I've managed to outperform it to this day. Someone asked me why I was doing the show, and I said, \"Why can't I?\" My message is this: You know your situation. Don't let others project onto you what they think you should be feeling. By judging my experience, I just thought, I'm ready to do this.\n\nGH You've already gotten a little criticism about the show — people who think you were insensitive. It's surprising, actually.\n\nMJF That's hilarious. I can characterize my situation in whatever way I want to. And it is funny. Certainly there are things that are very hard about it, and this disease takes a terrible toll on people. But on the other hand, it's funny: the idea that my character is passing a spoonful of scrambled eggs — he's trying to prove a point to himself about what he can do — and his family is hungry and they just want to eat. I mean, that's funny. I look at life with humor and say, \"What's the good in this? What's the best I can take from this?\" And usually the best I can take out of a situation is what makes me laugh. The show is as much about anyone who deals with any hardship or challenge as it is about a guy who has Parkinson's",

Messi remembers the match well and openly admits Barcelona were reeling as Walcott took centre stage.\n\n\"I can only speak from experience but he was one of the most dangerous players I have ever played against,\" he told the Daily Telegraph. \"Barcelona players are not scared easily but I can tell you that when we played Arsenal last season he truly worried us.\n\n\"When we were playing Arsenal at the Emirates we were so in control of the game at 2-0, with all respect Arsenal were not even in the game. Then Theo came on and changed the game. He pretty much single-handedly salvaged a draw that night.\"\n\nWhile Walcott was very much on the periphery last season, he has shown rapid improvement this term and is now flourishing as a key member of Arsene Wenger's starting XI.\n\nAnd the 21-year-old, who has scored 10 goals this campaign, is adamant Arsenal pose a far greater threat to Barcelona in Wednesday's last-16 first-leg encounter.\n\n\"We are better without any doubt,\" he said. \"They taught us a lesson but the lesson has been learnt. We have bags of experience now. We have just got to take the way we have been playing in the Premier League into the Champions league.\n\n\"I believe that we can do much better than last season; we can't do any worse to be honest. There is so much confidence in the team. We know what to do.\"\n\n© ESPN Sports Media Ltd.",
      "Doh! \nCantilevers, Paul Racers, and most U-brakes have this same feature. So with patience and a hacksaw I got to work. Why these aren't designed this way in the first place, I'll never know. The cable eyelet is still plenty strong, doesn't flex and the straddle wire is secure.\nOpen the SM-CB90 cable release, and this is possible. Yay, fully-opened caliper! I can now easily and quickly release these calipers for wheel removal with inflated 33mm tires. No additional release via barrell adjuster is necessary.  I'm aware making this modification may be painfully obvious to some, but I'd never seen it done before. Did I mention that this setup stops my bike remarkably well? These calipers may be old, but that in no way means they're obsolete or not up to the task. Here's a quick recap of what is necessary to optimize the performance and functionality of these brakes Good brake pads. Kool Stop MTB, Supra 2, or Thinline pads (I recommend the Salmon compound) will all work. You may have to experiment with pad thicknesses to find out which ones are ideal for your situation, they all do a great job. I should mention that all of these types of Kool Stop pads have spherical washers of varying (and interchangeable) thickness that allow you to fine-tune rim/tire/fork clearance to the millimeter. This is a feature that is under-hyped in my opinion. A wide, modern cantilever yoke that is split though the top to allow the straddle cable to slide into place. Why is this important? I find that without it, the lever feel is too mushy. A wider cable yoke pulls more of the straddle wire at once, quickening the actuation and firming the feel of the brake. Thankfully, this particular model I'm using (shown above, sold by Tektro and Wheels Mfg brands) is incredibly common and available in different colors. A cable release mechanism of some sort. If you're riding a vintage bike and/or a frame with a threaded steer tube, the old, original headset/seat clamp mounted cable hangers with integral QR's are plentiful on eBay for next-to-nothing prices. Tektro/TRP and Cane Creek all make single-speed specific levers with this feature built-in. If you're using other levers like SRAM S500's or older aero road levers, the Shimano SM-CB90 inline cable release will do the trick.  If you'll be running tires wider than ~30mm and want to make wheel removal less of a chore, I recommend modifying one of the straddle wire eyelets as pictured above.  Here's how:\nThe first cut. I recommend modifying the rear arm.\nMake this cut first. Cut just below the end of the wire slot. This leaves as much of the eyelet intact as possible and any leftover material is easily ground/sanded off.\nThe second cut. \nI tried to make this second cut tangent to the arc of the brake arm so that it looks as \"natural\" as possible.\nNot too bad, eh?\nThe straddle wire intersects near the middle of the remaining arc of the eyelet. Looks good, works good. Excellent stopping power, tire/fender clearance, classic looks, and the potential for easy wheel removal with wide rubber....all from old brake technology. As I said when I started this endeavor, Dia-Compe still makes these under their 'Gran Compe' label and they sell for around $80/wheel. The original, old ones I'm using can be had on eBay for ~$30 a pair or less and work great.",
      "Jeep Wrangler (TJ) Starter Replacement\n\n\nDiscuss this article in the Jeep Horizons Forums\n\nBefore you do anything UNHOOK THE NEGATIVE TERMINAL FROM THE BATTERY!Replacing a starter in a vehicle is easier than most people think. The hardest thing was getting the darn bolts out. The heads of the bolts were a star Torx type head. This made it very difficult to remove the starter. I ended up using a Damaged Nut and Bolt extractor set.Here's what I used.A couple of things about handling starters. Don't bang them around! Permanent magnet starters are highly sensitive to hammering, shocks, and external pressure. The permanent magnets may be damaged and the starter rendered unserviceable, if subjected to any of these conditions. Do not connect the starter motor incorrectly when testing. Reverse polarity may damage the permanent magnets and render the starter unserviceable.I chose to use 2 new bolts because the old ones were so damaged. They are 3/8\"x4\" and you'll need a 9/16\" socket, with a 5/16\" socket for the terminals.Start by disconnecting and isolating the negative battery cable. Disconnect the battery cable and solenoid feedwire from the starter solenoid. Remove the two starter mounting bolts, the starter motor, and any starter motor shims, if equipped.Reverse the removal procedures to install. Tighten the starter hardware as follows :Mounting bolts:2.5L engine - 45 N-m (33 ft. lbs .)4.OL engine (rear bolt) - 55 N-m (40 ft. lbs .)4.OL engine (front bolt) - 41 N-m (30 ft. lbs .)Solenoid battery cable nut - 10 N-m (90 in. lbs .)Solenoid terminal nut - 6 N-m (55 in. lbs .)Can you find the new starter here?? LOLHere's what it looked like after it was all finished.Its easy once you get past the exhaust and oil pan being in the way.Good luck - CoreyXJ",
      "Beijing Capital Interational Airport terminal three, without a trace of the bomb set off by Ji Zhongxing. Photo via Flickr user thewamphyri.\n\nThe day before Ji Zhongxing detonated a homemade explosive in terminal three of Beijing Capital International Airport, I left on a trip to Hong Kong. That morning, the gleaming airport thrummed with efficiency, and it was difficult to imagine that the country which had built this—at the time the largest terminal in the world—had also neglected thousands of its own citizens.\n\nJi Zhongxing was one of those neglected.\n\nA Shandong native, Ji was operating a motorcycle taxi in the factory city of Dongguan, Guangdong Province when he was beaten by local police and left paralyzed from the waist down. This was 2005.\n\nIn 2007, Ji sued the Dongguan government for 338,267 yuan ($55,168) in compensation for medical expenses and unemployment, but lost due to lack of evidence. Dongguan's public security bureau claimed that Ji collided with a policeman and paralyzed himself while falling, which, you know, happens. Ji appealed the next year to no avail.\n\nIn 2009, Ji went to Beijing to petition the central government, a common process known as shangfang. There, the Commission of Politics and Law of the CPC Central Committee overturned the previous verdicts and required Dongguan's local police to pay Ji 100,000 yuan ($16, 309), provided he stopped petitioning.\n\nThe fact that Ji received money at all makes him luckier than many. Local governments, for fear of being punished, have been known to intercept, detain, or harass people from their districts who try to petition the central government.\n\nCut to July 20, 2013.\n\nWitnesses outside the international arrivals area of terminal three spot a man in a wheelchair handing out leaflets regarding his grievances. Airport security officers approach and ask him to stop. The man, now shouting, holds up a bag of powder and cautions people to move away before detonating it in his hand.\n\nTHE REACTION\n\nSadly, Ji is not alone, neither in his experiences nor his decision to make a public spectacle. Desperate men who turn to violence after failing to find redress are a growing phenomenon.\n\nLast month, a disgruntled street vendor in Xiamen set a bus on fire and killed 47 people, including himself. On his blog he wrote that he had been bullied by chengguan, China's reviled urban management officers.\n\n(Chengguan have been in the news recently for beating a watermelon vendor to death in Hunan.)\n\nLast year in Fuzhou, Jiangxi Province, another disgruntled local who claimed his house had been forcibly demolished and spent a decade seeking compensation set off three car bombs outside three government buildings, killing himself and two others.\n\nBut what's surprising about Ji's case is not that it ended in extremism, but that the public's response has been largely sympathetic. Short of being appalled or terrified, many see Ji as the victim of a corrupt and unjust society.\n\nOn Weibo, users focused on the fact that Ji had only hurt himself and had warned others before detonating the bomb. A professor at the University of Science and Technology in Beijing went so far as to call Ji a \"righteous\" and \"kindhearted man\" on his account.\n\nA reporter at Caixin Magazine covering the story confessed her sympathy for Ji and others whom society had left behind. \"How strange, after an explosion, to feel sympathy for the bomber,\" she wrote. \"I think what he did was terrifying. My first reaction was that he did not mean to hurt anyone; he meant to take revenge.\"\n\nBut beneath people's sympathy for Ji is something more cynical—the belief that in this society a man can look eight years for justice and not find it; that his despair can push him to commit an act of violence; and that it is understandable, if not acceptable, for him to do so. Deep down, those sympathetic toward Ji have a profound lack of faith in the system to dispense justice.\n\nPerhaps sensing this cynicism, the state media has been quick to remind the public that Ji is a criminal, not a martyr.\n\n\"It's important to remember that Ji should be condemned and dealt with by law,\" said an editorial in Global Times. \"His grievances can't provide moral support for his extreme actions, nor can they shield him from legal punishment.\"\n\nWhich begs the question, where is the law to condemn those that commit brutality? And where is the legal punishment for those that oversee a system which marginalizes those who have had everything taken from them?\n\nTHE AFTERMATH\n\nJi was taken to a hospital where he had his left hand amputated. That evening, Beijing police received two bomb threats, one threatening to blow up an airport out of anger over a",

      "Mother suing top private school 'ranted at meetings and became fixated on children's grades even challenging daughter's near-perfect spelling test score'\n\nMother allegedly complained about trivial issues and acted aggressively\n\nClaims school promised to give her children good references but failed to uphold deal\n\nParents are seeking £50,000 damages from the West London school\n\n\nA mother who is suing a prestigious London private school has been accused of 'ranting' at meetings and criticising teachers in an aggressive attempt to push up her children's grades.\n\n\nThe woman sent teachers a flood of letters and emails about her children's education, a court heard - including a complaint when her six-year-old daughter received only 19 out of 20 on her spelling test.\n\n\nShe is also alleged to have filed complaints about trivial issues such as a fight over a glue stick and water bottles being placed too near pupils' shoes.\n\n\nClaim: A judge at the High Court in London, pictured, has rejected a damages claim brought by an 'overbearing' couple against a school, after it asked their children to be taken out\n\nThe mother and her husband, a businessman, are seeking £50,000 in damages from the school in West London, claiming teachers backtracked on a deal to give their children good references after they were withdrawn from the institution.\n\n\nAt a High Court hearing, the school's barrister Jonathan Auburn said that the woman had acted in a 'rude and inappropriate manner - including insisting on interrupting staff when in the middle of meetings, speaking over people, haranguing them, and on occasion screaming at them'.\n\nHe added: 'She placed oppressive expectations on her children of constant outstanding achievement, and would admonish both child and school if her full expectations were not always met.'\n\n\nThe woman, who cannot be identified, allegedly pursued 'trenchant complaints' over unimportant matters, such as bottles of water being positioned too closely to muddy pairs of shoes.\n\n\nMr Auburn asked her, 'Do you think - with hindsight - that that was quite a trivial matter?', but she replied: 'It was a matter of hygiene.'\n\n\nThe school, not pictured, was accused of back-tracking on a deal it made when three children were withdrawn (file photo), but this was rejected by the High Court\n\nOn one occasion, the court heard, the mother complained that her nine-year-old son had been given an A rather than an A+ for a geography project.\n\n\n'It was good but not good enough,' she said, adding that some children who achieved an A+ had failed to include a contents page in their essay\n\n\nMr Auburn asked: 'So your child got an A and you wrote in to raise that with the school, to say he should have got an A+, and you don't see anything odd about that?' - she replied, 'No.'\n\n\nHe told the hearing that the school had no problems with the children themselves, but felt forced to ask the parents to remove them thanks to the adults' 'particularly poor behaviour'.\n\n\nThe parents withdrew their children from the school, which cannot be named for legal reasons, and are now seeking damages for alleged breach of contract as well as an injunction barring the school from discussing them with any other school.\n\n\nThey claim they struck a deal with the school after a 'stormy' meeting in which the headmaster promised to provide a good reference to any school the children applied to.\n\n\nBut instead he told another head that the parents had 'harassed' him, the court heard.\n\n\nBoth parents deny behaving unreasonably towards staff, insisting they were doing their utmost to ensure their children's needs were met by teachers.\n\n\nThe mother said the school failed to communicate adequately with her and she only pursued issues where she felt teachers were not responding to her children's needs.\n\n\nShe had become particularly concerned by the school's failure to provide her with her offspring's test results, she told the court.\n\n\nFriction between the parents and the school came to a head at a parents' meeting which left staff 'visibly shaken' and finished with the couple 'storming out', Mr Auburn alleged.\n\n\nHowever, the father denied claims that he and his wife were 'aggressive and intimidating' at the meeting, insisting the atmosphere was 'always polite and courteous even if we disagreed'.",

      "The province has told Canada's federal Infrastructure Minister that British Columbia absolutely will not contribute more than a third of the money needed for major transit projects, even though Ottawa has hinted that it may increase its traditional one-third share.\n\nAnd, says B.C. Community Minister Peter Fassbender, the province expects Lower Mainland cities to come up with whatever is needed to cover the remaining cost for big rapid-transit projects proposed in Surrey and Vancouver.\n\n\"I was asked if the province is willing to increase its share and I said, 'No,'\" said Mr. Fassbender, who met Infrastructure Minister Amarjeet Sohi in December in Ottawa and then in January in British Columbia. \"We've had our money on the table for a while and we remain committed to that.\"\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nThe share from cities could come from a new one-time development cost levy on projects around transit lines, a permanent additional property tax on those projects or just a general increase in property taxes for everyone, he said.\n\n\"I think a property lift around transit corridors is a good way to contribute,\" he said.\n\n\"But a one-time contribution on property lift will only help you with building.\"\n\nHe said a long-term property-tax increase on corridors might be necessary.\n\nThe province and cities are anxiously awaiting the federal budget on March 22, which will reveal what the Trudeau government's exact spending plans are and what share of infrastructure projects it will cover.\n\nIf the federal government came up with 50 per cent of transit-project costs, a number that has been circulated, and the province won't increase its share, that would means local cities would have to provide the remaining 17 per cent.\n\nVancouver Mayor Gregor Robertson and other mayors have been pushing to have city contributions limited to 10 per cent.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nCity hall staff said the mayor was too busy with this week's Globe 2016 conference to comment on the issue, adding that they didn't want to get into a debate via the media.\n\nThe two big regional projects – light rapid transit in Surrey and a tunnel along Broadway in Vancouver – have been pegged at about $2-billion each, which would require $680-million in local taxes for the 17-per-cent share over the presumed 30-year financing period. That would be on top of the almost $350-million collected a year in taxes by TransLink now.\n\nMr. Fassbender said he reminded Mr. Sohi that taxpayers in the Lower Mainland got exempted 15 years ago from another tax that everyone else in the province pays – the hospital tax – in order to make room for the region's transit agency to charge higher transit taxes than other cities pay.\n\n\"He was actually quite surprised by that,\" Mr. Fassbender said.\n\nHe said the Lower Mainland is getting the benefit of some large, expensive hospital projects, including the planned new St. Paul's in Vancouver, a Lions Gate renovation in North Vancouver and recent construction of two major projects in Surrey.\n\nBut taxpayers aren't having to contribute to that, because of the old agreement, he said. Lower Mainland residents were paying about $50-million a year in hospital taxes in 1999. The estimate is that they would now have to pay at least double that if there hadn't been an agreement.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nMr. Fassbender said it wouldn't be fair to taxpayers elsewhere in the province to ask them to pay both hospital and transit taxes while Vancouverites are exempted from one.\n\nAnd, while he acknowledged that ultimately taxes all come from the same people, the province doesn't want to increase its share of transit projects because \"we become the bad guys because we're hammering the taxpayer.\"\n\nBut, in spite of the province's refusal to budge on the share issue, one thing the minister said he won't ask cities to do is make a commitment to increase density along transit lines in order to get money.\n\nHe said there's already enough ridership along the Broadway line to warrant construction of a subway, without Vancouver needing to promise to add more density.\n\nAnd he believes that other cities that have received new transit lines or are asking for them have done a good job of planning for new density around them.\n\nMr. Fassbender said the province is also asking the federal government to contribute to the construction of a new Pattullo Bridge and the new Massey Bridge.\n\nWhile many environmentalists have criticized the plans for a new 10-lane Massey Bridge between Richmond and Delta, the minister said he has been making the case to federal politicians and bureaucrats that the new bridge will help the environment.\n\n\"It is as much about the environment as moving people and cars. We believe clearly that it will reduce greenhouse gases.\"",

      "Donald Trump didn't just outlast a long list of Republican challengers to be the last man standing for the presidential nomination. He won by remaking the Republican Primary electorate itself.\n\nAbout 25.7 million people have voted in the 2016 Republican primaries and caucuses so far. That's about seven million more votes than were cast in the entire 2012 GOP presidential primary - and there are likely still well over two million votes yet to be cast in nine states this year, including in the nation's most populous state, California.\n\nAnd a close look at the numbers provides a lot of evidence that Trump didn't win the party over so much as his supporters overran the primary process. In essence, Trump democratized (small \"d\") the GOP process and took it away from the establishment.\n\nConsider Florida's March 15 Primary, where Sen. Marco Rubio was supposed to have chance to make a statement with a big win, or at least a strong showing, in his home state. Rubio lost by some 400,000 votes and won only his home county, Miami-Dade. It was a massive 19-point victory for Trump.\n\nBut the reason the victory looked so impressive was the sheer number of voters that turned out. Trump captured more than 1.07 million votes on March 15. That was far-and-away the most votes received by a candidate in a Florida Republican Presidential Primary.\n\nview photo essay Political Theatre: The presidential campaign of Donald Trump \"Make America Great Again.\"\n\nHow big was Trump's vote? If you add the total votes from 2016's two establishment Republican candidates in Florida - Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich - you get a final tally of 797,000. That's a big number. It's greater than the number of votes cast for Romney in 2012, 776,000.\n\nBut Rubio and Kasich's total added together still would have lost to Trump by more than 200,000 votes. That's remarkable. About 1.67 million people cast votes in the Florida Republican Primary in 2012. More than 2.36 million cast votes in 2016 - and it appears Trump captured most of that increase.\n\nBeyond Florida there is more evidence of the size of the Trump vote overrunning the traditional GOP vote in establishment strongholds around the country, particularly later as the establishment candidates banded together to \"stop Trump.\"\n\nOn April 26, Trump swept five states and all but captured the nomination. In those states the numbers in key counties suggest that the establishment vote was remarkably consistent with where it has been four years ago.\n\nIn Chester County, Pennsylvania, Trump easily handled Kasich - 35,500 votes to 23,800 votes respectively. But in 2012, Romney won the same county in a landslide with only 24,400 votes.\n\nClose video How women voters view Trump's attacks Washington Post National Political Reporter Anne Gearan and National Journal Political Editor Josh Kraushaar discuss Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump's attacks on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and Senator Elizabeth… share tweet email save Embed\n\nIn Fairfield County, Connecticut, Trump dominated Kasich - 33,000 to 20,000 votes. But in 2012, Romney won Fairfield with only 13,000 votes.\n\nIn Montgomery County, Maryland, Trump edged Kasich - 18,900 votes to 17,100 votes. But in 2012, Romney won the county handily with only 17,400 votes.\n\nThose counties hold the hallmarks of the GOP establishment. They all have median household incomes of more than $80,000 and more than 45% of the 25-or-older population has a bachelor's degree. Romney won at least 60 percent of the vote in all of them in primaries in 2012.\n\nYet they all went to Trump, as did every county in the east coast states that voted on April 26 - Connecticut, Delaware, Maryland, Pennsylvania and Rhode Island. Turnout was up by at least 80% in all those states from four years before. Some of that is undoubtedly due to the fact that the Republican race went longer in 2016 and the vote in those states mattered more. But the numbers suggest that much of the establishment vote did turn out, there just wasn't enough of it.\n\nRELATED: Trump gives away one of his strongest arguments\n\nTo be clear, Trump's wins likely aren't only about increased turnout. He almost certainly has captured some of what is considered the establishment vote in those counties and around the country.\n\nBut the presumptive nominee's wins, combined with the increase in turnout and the numbers for Rubio and Kasich - and later for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz - indicate the driving force behind Trump has been a big bump in the number of votes cast.\n\nIn other words, voter turnout, the very thing that candidates and parties cite as evidence of their strength, may be the biggest force behind the weakness of the Republican establishment in 2016.\n\nThis story first appeared on NBCNews.com.",

      "Free Speech on Campus. By Sigal Ben-Porath. University of Pennsylvania Press. 128 pages; $19.96 and £15.99.\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nINCITEMENT to violence is one of few exceptions the Supreme Court has carved out from America's most celebrated constitutional right: the right to free speech. But on today's college campuses, struggles over speech extend well beyond expression that encourages physical harm. In 2015 a lecturer at Yale was excoriated—and felt compelled to resign—after she raised questions about the college's plea that students avoid culturally insensitive Halloween costumes. The next year the dean of students at the University of Chicago caused a stir by coming out against \"intellectual 'safe spaces'\" where students \"retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own\". Students have repeatedly succeeded in having invitations to controversial speakers cancelled, and even made tenured faculty fear provocative comments.\n\nThese students think they are sticking up for the vulnerable, practising a kind of self-defence. Others wonder what happened to the spirit of inquiry that is meant to be the point of a university. Nearly half of students advocate some curbs on expression, and nearly a fifth think it acceptable to shut down unacceptable speech with violence. On October 9th, the president of Texas Southern University got in on the act, cancelling a speech by a Republican legislator in mid-stream after student protesters tried to disrupt it. The talk hadn't been scheduled through proper \"university procedures\", he said.\n\nThese developments are alarming, but it is a mistake, argues Sigal Ben-Porath of the University of Pennsylvania, to conclude that today's student activists have no serious concerns. In \"Free Speech on Campus\", a reflection on her time as chairman of her university's committee on open expression, Ms Ben-Porath urges a re-thinking of the battles over campus speech. Her book begins with a broad defence of free inquiry: \"Speech, including controversial speech, is central to teaching and learning\" and to campus life. She rejects speech codes, mandatory sensitivity training and systems whereby students report episodes of professor bias to administrators. She criticises the president of Williams College for stepping in last year to cancel a talk by a lecturer with racist views who had been invited by a student group. It is wrong, Ms Ben-Porath argues, \"to forgo free speech for the sake of administrative order\".\n\nStill, she says, the activists have a point. As colleges become more diverse, the students they teach often find campus life stifling or unwelcoming. Any university effort to protect freedom of speech, Ms Ben-Porath suggests, is incomplete without genuine attempts to include all students in the speaking. She calls this combination of robust speech protection and harnessing all voices \"inclusive freedom\".\n\nThough she disdains speaker disinvitations and other limits on speech, Ms Ben-Porath has no trouble with trigger warnings to alert students to a potentially troubling reading. These are \"good pedagogy\", not a \"surrender to weakness and laziness of thought\". She also speaks up for much-maligned safe spaces where students can find comfort in the company of others who share an aspect of their identity. But the university itself should not be one big intellectual safe space; protecting students' dignity is not the same as protecting them from challenges to their ideas.\n\nThat is a sound analytical distinction, but it is not clear how it should work out in practice. Consider the mêlée in March at Middlebury College, where Charles Murray, best known for his 1994 book arguing that IQ variation between racial groups is a cause of inequality, was invited to speak about his book from 2012 on divisions between American whites. Hundreds of alumni signed a letter calling Mr Murray's invitation \"unacceptable and unethical\", and the students were never going to listen to him. After jeers made holding the public lecture impossible, he gave his talk in an improvised video studio. Afterwards, chaos erupted and Mr Murray's host, a Middlebury professor, suffered a concussion.\n\nViolently disrupting a speech is antithetical to intellectual openness. But the protesters felt that Mr Murray's presence itself was an assault—in Ms Ben-Porath's words, a \"dignitary harm\" on minority students. Administrators often plead for civility at times like these, but Ms Ben-Porath argues that civility can mean privileging peace and quiet over vigorous challenges.\n\nHow can colleges manage a sea of strident voices while neither suppressing inquiry nor sanctioning hecklers like those who shut down a \"white supremacist\" humanities class at Reed College? (The class in question featured, for the objecting students, too many white men on the reading list.) Ms Ben-Porath thinks that volunteer monitors at public events, to step in when anyone's right to speak is disrupted, might help, and that students should",
      "Jürgen Klopp discussed his eight changes to the team, Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's position and the fitness of Philippe Coutinho before Liverpool's Carabao Cup clash with Leicester City.\n\nThe Reds face the Foxes in a third-round tie at King Power Stadium and the manager has shuffled his pack, with only Coutinho, Ragnar Klavan and Andy Robertson remaining from the weekend draw with Burnley.\n\n\"Squads are wide and deep, so you can and have to do things like this. It will be exciting to watch,\" Klopp said pre-match.\n\nAsked where Oxlade-Chamberlain will be deployed in the system, the German continued: \"If he starts in a front three, I don't want to always see him on one wing or something like this.\n\n\"If he plays in the No.8, I don't want to see him fixed in this position. It's football; you have to defend in one position and you have to be very flexible in all the other situations. That's what I expect from him in the long-term.\n\n\"Today he will start for the first time and that's another thing I'm excited about.\"\n\nKlopp also revealed that Coutinho was eager to feature again against Leicester after making his maiden start of the campaign last Saturday.\n\nThe boss said of the No.10: \"We thought a lot about it but I think it really makes sense. I spoke to him and he really wanted to have more minutes, so it makes sense to bring him again.\n\n\"He felt good [at the weekend], it was really only a little cramp in the last game, not even a cramp. Of course, he needs match time and now he can get it.\"",
      "We just ran benchmarks on Apple's new iPhone 5S, revealing that, yup, this is the dopest smartphone silicon ever made. This thing freaking churns, crushing every other smartphone out there on both computational power and graphics. But if you look at common specs like core-count and clock speed for the hardware, you'd never know it.\n\nBy now, it's no mystery that specs aren't the whole story. Intuitively, we know that the quality of a smartphone is just as reliant on its industrial design and the quality of the software it runs. But it goes deeper than that: the traditional \"specs\" distract us from what a gadget's guts actually do, and from a technological point of view, they distract us from the advancements that are actually making a product better.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nApple's iPhone design is a masterpiece, and iOS 7 shows that Apple's got a mastery of operating systems as well, more or less. What's not as well-known is that Apple's a leader on guts as well. Here's a look at what the guts can do and how Apple beat the pack.\n\nThe fastest chip ever\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe benchmarks for Apple's new iPhone 5S are absurd. After running Geekbench 3.0 on the hardware, we got scores that match up with the numbers reported by others, like those in AnandTech's unbelievably thorough survey of key performance tests. Geekbench's score is a nice measurement because it's built from a combination of measurements of computational speed across a variety of real-world processes like JPG compression and decompression. The combined score for the iPhone 5S beats everything else you'd consider buying and even Samsung's insane international version of the Galaxy S4.\n\nThe impressive results confirm many of the improvements Apple claimed in its early September keynote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe ran the iPhone 5S's GPU through the commonly used GFXBench software, using its most-intense on-screen gaming test and compared it to the publicly available leaderboards for existing flagships out there. The chart above the average frame rates the graphics processor of each phone. A faster rates in this test would translate to smoother graphics on the most system-taxing games out there.\n\nAnd the iPhone's graphics performance is spectacular: 37-frames per second, more than twice the iPhone 5's 14 fps. It'a also significantly than the next-best US smartphone, the Motorola Moto X, which clocks in at 25 fps. In short, the iPhone 5S's graphics powers are ready for the craziest games that'll be coming out in the years to come.\n\nThese aren't the only benchmarks out there, but they're reflective of what nearly all tests are finding: The iPhone 5S has the best measured performance of any phone.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe truth about cores, clock speeds, and battery life\n\nNow, if you compare this performance to the specs—unofficially, but dug up by Geekbench —you'll be surprised. The A7's dual-core ARM processor is clocked at 1.3 GHz. Only 1 GB of RAM. Consider that most of Apple's competitors are running quad-core Snapdragon 600 processors, many of them, like the HTC One, clocked at up to 1.7 GHz. All of them pack 2 GB of RAM. What gives?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere, we check back in with AnandTech, where Anand Shimpi drops knowledge. Turns out the specs we're getting fed by manufacturers are a bunch of bull—or at least only tell a small fragment of the story. \"I always thought the transition from 2 to 4 cores happened quicker in mobile than I had expected,\" he begins, continuing later:\n\nIn such a thermally constrained environment, going quad-core only makes sense if you can properly power gate/turbo up when some cores are idle. I have yet to see any mobile SoC vendor (with the exception of Intel with Bay Trail) do this properly, so until we hit that point the optimal target is likely two cores.\n\nIn other words, the technology to efficiently power quad-core architecture in a smartphone while also taking advantage of extra cores doesn't exist yet. So all that theoretical power is coming at waaaaaay too high a battery cost, or it would it anyone was crazy enough to try for it. And the muscle that is being used now is not as efficient as it should be.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWorse there's a clock-speed war going on:\n\nThen there's the frequency discussion. Brian and I have long been hinting at the sort of ridiculous frequency/voltage combinations mobile SoC vendors have been shipping at for nothing more than marketing purposes. I remember ARM telling me the ideal target for a Cortex A15 core in a smartphone was 1.2GHz. Samsung's Exynos 5410 stuck four Cortex A15s in a phone with a max clock of 1.",

      "A lesbian couple was ordered to leave a Kentucky park while taking maternity photos on the park's grounds, and the women believe they were ousted because they are gay.\n\nCheri Chenault and Destiny Keith decided to go to E.C. Million Memorial Park in Richmond, Ky., last weekend to take photos ahead of the birth of their baby boy, whom they're expecting on Sept. 29, the Lexington Herald-Leader reports.\n\nThe park served as the backdrop for the photos, which were being taken by local photographer Jessica Miller-Poole, who owns 13 Wishes Photography. The photos were taken in a privately-owned section of the park that is open to the public.\n\nAfter the couple kissed for a photo, a park gatekeeper went over to the group, which consisted of Chenault, Keith, Miller-Poole and her husband, and told them they had to leave the park grounds because they were being inappropriate.\n\nThe photographer's husband approached the gatekeeper to ask why he wanted them out.\n\n\"He talked to the man and said that if it was because they were two women, that he wanted to know,\" Miller-Poole told the Richmond Register. \"The man said, 'Those type of people were not welcomed there,'\" she said. \"My husband ended up getting very angry and had to walk away.\"\n\nMiller-Poole went on to say she was shocked and upset by the gatekeeper's actions.\n\n\"I never understood why people make such a big deal about being treated differently until I was actually in the middle of it and witnessed it firsthand,\" Miller-Poole told the Register. \"It really bothered me and upset me to witness someone be so cruel.\"\n\nAlthough gays are protected under the Kentucky Hate-Crime Law, they are not protected under the Kentucky Non-Discrimination Law.\n\nDiscrimination against gays in Kentucky has garnered national attention as of late.\n\nOn April 4, 2011, Kevin Pennington was kidnapped and assaulted in the remote hills of southeastern Kentucky by two cousins who allegedly targeted him because he is gay. The two were charged this April with committing a hate crime in violation of the Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act.\n\nAnd in June of last year, a gay couple with developmental and intellectual disabilities, was ejected from the Pavilion pool in Hazard, Ky.

      "Oh no! After recently patching things up with each other, a new report is now claiming that Rosie O'Donnell's estranged 19-year-old daughter, Chelsea, has been hospitalized due to a drug overdose! SO scary! She allegedly was rushed to the ER on Sept. 5 — get all the details here.\n\nRosie O'Donnell's, 54, troubled daughter Chelsea, 19, has reportedly been hospitalized in Long Island after suffering from a drug overdose, according to RadarOnline.com. The publication's insider allegedly told the site that the teen was in the ER on the night of Sept. 5, however, Rosie had yet to show up to be by her daughter's side.\n\nIn fact, when HollywoodLife.com reached out to the comedian's reps, we were told that the star is \"not commenting\" on the story. But from the looks of Rosie's Twitter account, the TV host at least SEEMS to be playing things cool, even posting a pic of two of her children heading off to their first day of school. \"Here we go ….school,\" she captioned the Insta pic. She also posted a photo of her kids holding a fluffy puppy.\n\nWe sure hope these rumors about Chelsea are not true, but if they are, this sadly is not the first time Rosie and Chelsea's tumultuous relationship has made headlines. Their family drama was first thrust into the spotlight in August 2015, when Chelsea disappeared from Rosie's Nyack, NY, home for two whole weeks! She was later found with a man — and drug dealer — she met on Tinder, Steven M. Sheerer.\n\nSteven was later charged with endangering the welfare of a child because Chelsea was only 17 at the time of the incident. Shortly after that occurred, Rosie released a statement revealing that Chelsea ran away, despite the adopted teen claiming her mom actually threw her out.\n\nAnd during a shocking interview that took place in October, Chelsea held NOTHING back when detailing her troubled relationship with her famous parent. \"I find her not genuine a lot of the time. When we'd go out, she was a completely different person in public than at home and I had a hard time with that,\" Chelsea said, alleging that she's closer to her former nannies than she is to her own mother.\n\nRosie later called Chelsea's hard-hitting interview \"heartbreaking on every level.\" However, on a happier note, just earlier this summer in June, the two seemed to begin the process of rebuilding their broken relationship. Rosie even posted a pic of herself with Chelsea — both of them smiling! \"Chelsea and me — what a difference a year makes #hopelives,\" the comedian said of the photo at the time.\n\nOur thoughts go out to Rosie and her family. HollywoodLifers, do you think Chelsea was actually hospitalized due to a drug overdose?",
      "The list is disconcertingly clinical, a catalogue of suffering.\n\n\"One or more incidents of fondling or kissing.\" Five to 10 points.\n\nFor physical assaults, including \"severe beating, whipping and second-degree burning\" — 11 to 25 points.\n\nAnd at the top of the list: \"Repeated, persistent incidents of anal or vaginal intercourse \" — 45 to 60 points.\n\nThrough tens of thousands of private hearings, this is how Canada has assigned dollar figures for the abuse of former students at residential schools. The assessments are part of the largest class-action settlement in Canadian history, indeed, one of largest in the world.\n\nBut if justice takes time, a decade and 38,000 claimants later, the assessment process for the Indian Residential School Settlement Agreement has yet to wrap up, and may take until 2023. That's left some claimants in painful, years-long limbo. And the cost, originally estimated at $960 million, is so far more than triple that amount, with an added $700 million in administration fees alone – including payments to lawyers who have been allowed to charge both the government and the victims they represent.\n\nHow did such a dramatic miscalculation happen?\n\n\"It's absolutely ridiculous. This became an industry for everyone involved, including for government,\" said Steven Cooper, a lawyer who helped negotiate the settlement and represented survivors.\n\nEven many claimants who have received money – 89 per cent of those who've been heard – have criticisms of the Independent Assessment Process (IAP).\n\nAngela White, program supervisor at the Indian Residential School Survivors Society, said only a small percentage of the people she works with had a positive experience of the IAP. Many survivors, she said, found it \"emotionally draining\" to have to relive their abuse in such detail.\n\nSome claimants dropped out of contact entirely. According to the Indian Residential Schools Adjudication Secretariat, which oversees the IAP, 743 survivors became so-called \"lost claimants.\"\n\n\"Some survivors went into the Independent Assessment Process thinking that it was going to be easier, that they were going to be listened to and heard and be compensated. And many were, which was a good thing,\" said Garnet Angeconeb, who attended Pelican Lake Indian Residential School near Sioux Lookout, Ont., from 1963 to 1969. \"However, many also fell through the cracks.\"\n\nThe secretariat has tried to tackle the problem. In 2014, it developed a protocol for staff, who now search online, use government databases at Health Canada and Indigenous and Northern Affairs Canada, and even approach band offices, RCMP detachments and other local organizations to try to find claimants. To date, they've located 478 survivors who fell out of touch.\n\n\"I'm not aware of any tribunal anywhere that goes to that kind of effort,\" said chief adjudicator Dan Shapiro.\n\nThis became an industry for everyone involved, including for government\n\nNobody seems to have predicted how vast this process would become.\n\nThe original settlement, negotiated back in 2005, projected 2,500 hearings a year over five years – roughly 12,500 in total. Instead, triple the number of survivors have come forward, with claims totaling $3.137 billion.\n\n\"(They) turned out to be abysmally off the mark,\" said Warren Winkler, former chief justice of Ontario, who oversaw the negotiations. \"They couldn't have been more wrong.\"\n\nIt's hard to get a straight answer, in fact, as to how anybody came up with those original estimates.\n\n\"It's tough to get good data about Indigenous people,\" said Wayne Spear, former communications director of the Aboriginal Healing Foundation. Spear's grandfather attended residential school, and Spear has co-authored two books on the residential school system. \"People don't want to tell the government too much … 'Why do you want to know these things? What are you going to do with it?'\"\n\nCertainly, there were no exact numbers to be had back in 2005, during the negotiations that took place under Paul Martin's Liberal government. Records from residential schools are spotty, and many who were abused didn't speak openly about it. There are also cases where children or grandchildren of deceased survivors are pursuing claims on their behalf.\n\nThe government came up with that number. We disagreed with that\n\nIndigenous and Northern Affairs Canada says a consultant was hired to come up with a number based partly on similar settlements from around the world.\n\nIt's also possible the number was derived from the estimated 18,000 lawsuits filed by former residential school students as of 2005, minus those already settled. That's the explanation offered by the website of the secretariat.\n\nBut if that's the case, it's unclear why the government didn't think more survivors would come forward once a settlement was reached. Roughly 150,000 Indigenous children attended residential schools between 1883 and 1996.\n\nRonald N",

      "Since their disastrous defeat in the 2014 Lok Sabha election, the Congress party has been investigating all angles to fathom the reason why the whole country rejected one of its oldest national parties and chose the Bhartiya Janata Party (BJP).\n\nAnd, in one of the most bizarre explanations given by Congress for its defeat in the general elections, the blame has been pinned on Israel's secret service Mossad.\n\nThe Congress Working Committee held a day-long meeting on Monday, to discuss the reasons that led to the Congress' defeat in the elections. And after that, Congress general secretary Mohan Prakash reportedly told the media that it was Mossad, which led to the downfall of Congress in the elections.\n\nDNA reported that Prakash presented his argument in the CWC meeting, stating that the Mossad has been working towards bringing down the UPA government since 2009.\n\nAnd according to Prakash, the reason why the Mossad wanted the fall of Congress was mainly due to the limited political interaction between UPA and Israel. Hence, Mossad wanted to oust the Congress and bring in the BJP government, with whom it had earlier enjoyed a much cordial relation.\n\nWhile it is true that Israel had increased its closeness to India during the time of the previous NDA government, the relationship between the two countries has always remained cordial.\n\nAs of July 2013, the India-Israel trade has crossed $6 billion a year, far surpassing the $200 million level it was at in 1992, which is a clear sign that the relation between the two countries have only matured, and not turned sour as the Congress leader noted.\n\nBut then the introspection continues, and many in Congress feel 'the dignified silence' Prime Minister Manmohan Singh led to the eventual downfall of Congress in the election.\n\nOutgoing union minister Kamal Nath took a dig at Singh and stated that the Prime Minister should have been more vocal when the government came under attack for various scams.\n\nSimilarly Ravi Naik, a North Goa Congress candidate who lost his seat in the election had also stressed that his party would have won had Singh been more expressive of the achievements of the UPA government in the last 10 years.\n\nIn short, several Congress leaders are of the opinion that the outgoing PM should have been able to assert his authority, while his government was facing charges of corruption.\n\nSeveral leaders also went out after Dentsu, a Japanese communication agency, which was paid at least ₹600 crore, to handle the PR and imaging building for the INC and Rahul Gandhi.\n\nThere is a feeling that the failure of the agency to effectively build the image of Congress and its PM nominee Gandhi resulted in the poll debacle. The general view among Congress leaders is that the campaigns were quite 'spineless'.",

Het Nieuwsblad reports that primary sponsor the Belgian Lottery will not up their investment in the squad. However, it states that Ridley could be willing to step in and provide some extra cash so that they can have the multiple Monument winner riding their bikes next year.

      "Cape Town - The retail prices of both grades of petrol will drop by 93c a litre next Wednesday, the department of energy announced on Friday.\n\n\nThe most significant drop in fuel prices, however, is the massive R1.50/kg decrease in the maximum retail price for LPGas.\n\n\nFactors contributing to the fuel price changes include the continual drop in the crude oil prices. On Friday Brent for March eased 16c to $48.97, reports AFP.\n\n\nThe latest drop follows a record decrease of 123c and 127c respectively for 95 and 93 grades of petrol in January.\n\n\nThis means that Coastal petrol users will pay R9.85 per litre for 93 petrol and R9.90 per litre for 95 petrol, while Reef users will pay R10.09 per litre for 93 petrol and R10.31 per litre for 95 petrol.\n\n\nThe department said economic factors influencing the petrol price move are:\n\n• the average international product prices of petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin decreased during the period under review; and\n\n• the average rand/US dollar exchange rate weakened when compared to the previous period from R11.4749/$ to R11.5777/$ in the period under review.\n\n\nThe weakening exchange rate increased the contribution to the basic fuels price on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 4.08 c/l, 4.409 c/l and 4.50 c/l respectively, the department said.\n\n\nThe fuel price changes to be effected on February 4 are as follows:\n\n\n• Petrol (both grades): 93c/l decrease\n\n• Diesel (0.05% and 0.005% sulphur): 102c/l decrease\n\n• IP wholesale: 102c/l decrease\n\n• SMNRP for IP: 136c/l decrease\n\n• Maximum LPGas retail price: 150c/kg decrease\n\n\nPetrol price decrease won't trickle down to consumer - expert:\n\n\nMerkurius Capital Solutions' Daryl Ducasse spoke to News24 Live about the predicted petrol price drop.

      "A Group Effort\n\nMenstrual extraction can be done in a woman's home or a self-help group's meeting place and the woman having her flow extracted controls all aspects of the procedure. Women generally learn the technique by participating in groups with more experienced women, first observing and then having their own menstrual extractions. Although the rudimentary aspects of the procedure can be learned in a few weeks, the knowledge and skill necessary to the reasonable safety of the procedure usually develop over a period of several months or even a year. Without this body of knowledge, the isolated woman, who generally has little or no familiarity with her own body, is risking the dangers commonly associated with self-abortion.\n\nOne frequent objection to menstrual extraction is a fear that the introduction of a cannula into the uterus will cause infections or other complications. Over the past decade, hundreds of women doing menstrual extraction in the United States and in other countries have reported that they do not have more or fewer infections than other women and have noted that the passage of a very small cannula into the uterus does not appear to have any effect on a woman's ability to carry a future pregnancy. It would seem, however, that the primary reason for this excellent safety record is the rigorous selection process any group doing menstrual extraction follows and the care with which the procedure is carried out. Women who have a tendency toward infection probably should not elect to have menstrual extraction. If they do, they take extra precautions. Sometimes a woman who is highly motivated but has a very sensitive cervix chooses to tolerate the additional discomfort in order to have an extraction.\n\nThe Effect Of Menstrual Extraction\n\nThe discovery that almost any woman could learn the technique of menstrual extraction was accompanied by the discovery of several obvious and very practical uses for it. Women could free themselves of heavy, crampy periods, or avoid having a period if it would interfere with travel, vacation or perhaps an athletic event, and could extract the contents of the uterus if there was the possibility of unwanted pregnancy.",
      "Please turn on JavaScript. Media requires JavaScript to play. Advertisement Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi has vowed to pursue his vision of a United States of Africa, in his inaugural address as the new chairman of the African Union. Col Gaddafi was elected by the heads of state of the 53-member union behind closed doors at a summit in Ethiopia. A BBC correspondent at the summit says Col Gaddafi was seen to be the obvious choice, but some delegates are uneasy about his nomination. Col Gaddafi replaces the Tanzanian President, Jakaya Kikwete. Wearing a golden brocade robe and cap, Col Gaddafi sat with the traditional African leaders who accompanied him at the front of the room, rather than in the seat for the Libyan delegate. New rules Col Gaddafi attended the summit with an entourage of seven local monarchs \"I shall continue to insist that our sovereign countries work to achieve the United States of Africa,\" he said in his inaugural speech. But he admitted that African leaders were \"not near to a settlement\" on the issue. He told fellow summit leaders that his unity project would be approved at the next meeting in July unless there was a majority against it, reports the BBC's Elizabeth Blunt from Addis Ababa. The AU normally relies on consensus in reaching decisions, but Col Gaddafi introduced what he described as the Islamic concept that \"silence is approval,\" she said. Under this principle, at least two-thirds of AU leaders would have to actively oppose Col Gaddafi's proposals, rather than simply ignoring his ideas, she added. 'Fantasy' But an expert on the African Union called the vision of the United States of Africa a \"ludicrous fantasy on the part of [Col] Gaddafi.\" Kathryn Sturman at the South African Institute of International Affairs said many African leaders would not be prepared to give up their national sovereignty to join the proposed single-state federation proposed by the Libyan leader. Ms Sturman said the chair of the group does not have any singular decision-making power, and cannot push through any changes without the consensus of the other leaders.\n\nMuammar Gaddafi: Life in pictures Profile: Muammar Gaddafi Compromise During closed-door talks on Sunday, African leaders again postponed Col Gaddafi's dream of closer union. In a compromise, the summit agreed to transform the African Union Commission - which oversees the AU - into an AU authority with a broader mandate, outgoing chair Mr Kikwete said. \"In principle, we said the ultimate is the United States of Africa. How we proceed to that ultimate - there are building blocks,\" Mr Kikwete said. Malawi's President Bingu wa Mutharika said governments wanting greater unity could go ahead on their own, without worrying about splitting Africa. Erratic The chairmanship of the African Union is a rotating position held by heads of state for one year. It was the turn of a North African leader to chair the bloc, and Col Gaddafi was the only one present. However, some African leaders believe the Libyan leader is too erratic to be AU chairman. Before he arrived at the summit, he circulated a letter saying he was coming as the king of the traditional kings of Africa, our correspondent says. Last August, he had a group of 200 traditional leaders name him the \"king of kings\" of Africa. The summit's main agenda - to boost Africa's energy and transport networks - was pushed largely to the fringes, weighed down by the grim realities of the global economic downturn.\n\n\nBookmark with: Delicious\n\nDigg\n\nreddit\n\nFacebook\n\nStumbleUpon What are these?

      "Hemera/Thinkstock\n\nThe Book of Genesis puts Adam and Eve together in the Garden of Eden, but geneticists' version of the duo — the ancestors to whom the Y chromosomes and mitochondrial DNA of today's humans can be traced — were thought to have lived tens of thousands of years apart. Now, two major studies of modern humans' Y chromosomes suggest that 'Y-chromosome Adam' and 'mitochondrial Eve' may have lived around the same time after all1, 2.\n\nWhen the overall population size does not change (as is likely to have happened for long periods of human history), men have, on average, just one son. In this case, evolutionary theory predicts that for any given man there is a high probability that his paternal line will eventually come to an end. All of his male descendants will then have inherited Y chromosomes from other men. In fact, it is highly probable that at some point in the past, all men except one possessed Y chromosomes that by now are extinct. All men living now, then, would have a Y chromosome descended from that one man — identified as Y-chromosome Adam. (The biblical reference is a bit of a misnomer because this Adam was by no means the only man alive at his time.)\n\nSimilarly, the theory predicts that all mitochondrial genomes today should be traceable to a single woman, a 'mitochondrial Eve'. Whereas the Y chromosome is passed from father to son, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is passed from mother to daughter and son.\n\nIn 1987 population geneticists first demonstrated the existence of such a 'mitochondrial Eve'3. After analysing mtDNA from 147 people from around the world to chart their genetic relationships, they used a 'molecular clock', based on the number of DNA mutations that arise with each generation, to estimate Eve's age. This woman, the researchers concluded, probably lived in Africa around 200,000 years ago. The finding provided evidence for the theory that modern humans evolved in Africa before migrating to other continents.\n\nYet comparable studies later found that Adam, the common ancestor of the portion of the Y chromosome that passes from father to son, lived roughly 100,000 years ago. It's possible that Adam and Eve lived aeons apart, and geneticists have come up with a number of explanations as to why.\n\nCarlos Bustamante, a population geneticist at the Stanford University School of Medicine in California who led one of the latest studies, says that chance could explain the discrepancy between the ages of Adam and Eve. Polygamy could also help to explain the gap, he says. The calculation of when Adam or Eve lived depends on the number of breeding adults in a population, and polygamy reduces the number of males that pass on their Y chromosomes, thereby skewing the estimate.\n\nBustamante and his team sequenced the Y chromosomes of 69 males from around the world and uncovered about 9,000 previously unknown DNA sequence variations. They used these variations to create a more reliable molecular clock and found that Adam lived between 120,000 and 156,000 years ago. A comparable analysis of the same men's mtDNA sequences suggested that Eve lived between 99,000 and 148,000 years ago1. \"This idea of a very recent common ancestor of all men is not that true,\" Bustamante says.\n\nMeanwhile, a team led by Paolo Francalacci, a population geneticist at the University of Sassari, Italy, came to a similar conclusion by studying the Y chromosomes of 1,200 men from the island of Sardinia. The team identified nearly 7,000 previously unknown Y-chromosome variations and used that detail to create their own molecular clock. The clock helped to pinpoint key events in Sardinian history, such as the rise of Neolithic populations there and the arrival of Africans as part of the Roman slave trade. It also suggested that Adam lived 180,000–200,000 years ago, similar to initial estimates of Eve's age2.\n\nFrancalacci says that the difference between the two studies' estimates of Adam's age could be due to the different populations they studied and how the molecular clocks were calculated. Bustamante says that, all in all, the two papers match up well. \"It's not so much we're shifting the mitochondria down — which we are, a bit — but we're pushing the Y farther back,\" he says.\n\nIn recent years, many population geneticists have focused on interpreting the rest of the genome — the autosomes — because it provides a richer, more complicated, picture. But the latest studies suggest that the Y chromosome is still useful for studying human history, Bustamante says. His team calculated that the chromosome gains a new mutation roughly every 125 years, enabling geneticists to tell when two closely related populations split or how distant cousins are related.\n\n\"When we first started this project I thought, 'Oh hum-hum we're going to sequence some",
      "Leading economics expert reveals it could cost billions and take 10 years to negotiate Scotland's split from the UK.\n\nThe clearest picture yet of how much it will cost to separate Scotland from the UK can today be unveiled by The Sunday Post.\n\nWith just 87 days to go until the referendum, SNP ministers have come under fire for refusing to say how much cash will be needed to set up vital state infrastructure until after September 18.\n\nBut this newspaper has commissioned the London School of Economics academic recognised by both sides as the leading expert on the subject to do the work now to give voters a better idea of what any transition would look like before they go to the polls.\n\nProfessor Patrick Dunleavy's detailed report on the transition to independence lays bare the true costs, savings and challenges that would face an independent Scotland in its first years.\n\nHe concludes:\n\nInitial set-up costs to duplicate core Westminster functions will be just £200m, but hundreds of millions of pounds more will be needed to build the government IT systems needed to go it alone.\n\nScots could face up to a decade of transition from a Yes vote, paying to continue to share some agencies such as the DVLA up until 2022.\n\nThe long-run viability of a Scottish state \"looks strong\" and the \"main uncertainty\" over start-up costs comes from Westminster's refusal to do any planning on the possibility of independence.\n\nFull control to vary taxes and welfare could take years to transfer from Westminster.\n\nA definitive answer on costs will come down to the \"poker game\" of any post-Yes vote talks with any \"hostile approach\" from Westminster sending costs soaring, while EU and NATO membership will come down to \"complex negotiations\".\n\nA beefed-up Scottish Government would require 27,000 civil servants, though fewer than 60 new departments or agencies would be needed.\n\nBig savings can be made from this streamlining and policy decisions such as dumping Trident.\n\nBetter Together last night welcomed the report saying it shows hundreds of millions of pounds would be \"wasted\" recreating things that exist as part of the UK.\n\nAlex Salmond said the assessment showed The Treasury had been caught \"red-faced and red-handed\" after it initially suggested start-up costs could reach £2.7 billion.\n\nThe Scottish Government's White Paper states March 24, 2016, would be \"independence day\" but the Dunleavy report says there are grounds for arguing such a swift transition is \"unrealistic\".\n\nPressed on this issue Dunleavy told The Sunday Post the timetable was \"demanding but just achievable\". He added: \"I suspect Salmond might be prepared to trade on dates but this one [2016] is tricky because of election timing.\n\n\"Later phasing on other things I think are easier to concede. He seems very realistic on defence systems taking a good while to be in Scotland's real control.\"\n\nThe report shows disentangling costs will exist for both parties if there is a Yes vote as there will be a need to de-merge all of the Government databases and back-office processes that have existed for decades at UK-level.\n\n\"Negotiation is crucial to Scotland's eventual number here,\" says the report as London will be looking to get a 50/50 split but Edinburgh is likely to push for a population share split, so 90/10.\n\nDunleavy makes clear transition costs \"depend very heavily\" on how both Governments approach any negotiations. A tough stance by the rest of the UK during talks, which would have to break for the 2015 General Election, could increase costs for both countries, warns the report.\n\nOn the other negotiations needed, the London School of Economics report warns: \"There would be complex negotiations to secure Scotland's place in the EU and NATO, and the Scottish Government could not assume these would be easily or routinely assured\".\n\nThe report makes clear the biggest initial spending challenges will be in defence and security services. It states: \"Scotland's defence needs are heavily concentrated in capital intensive areas of spending, a navy to patrol its long coastline and extensive sea areas and oil fields, and an air force to cover the country's huge land mass and big northern air sector\".\n\nNo price tag has been put on these start-up costs because so much hinges on negotiations, but any Westminster refusal to hand over fighter planes and navy vessels could leave Scotland with a multi-billion pound headache.\n\nAccording to the research, the central Scottish Government would increase from around 5,000 civil servants in six departments to 27,000 staff across nine.\n\nDunleavy said he expected most of the UK Government civil servants to move across to the Scottish Government and any job losses could be made without the need for redundancy given the length of the transition period.\n\nThe report points out that initially the Foreign Embassy network of an independent Scotland might have to share offices with other EU countries",
      "Over 400 California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) died and many others displayed signs of neurological dysfunction along the central California coast during May and June 1998. A bloom of Pseudo-nitzschia australis (diatom) was observed in the Monterey Bay region during the same period. This bloom was associated with production of domoic acid (DA), a neurotoxin1 that was also detected in planktivorous fish, including the northern anchovy (Engraulis mordax), and in sea lion body fluids. These and other concurrent observations demonstrate the trophic transfer of DA resulting in marine mammal mortality. In contrast to fish, blue mussels (Mytilus edulus) collected during the DA outbreak contained no DA or only trace amounts. Such findings reveal that monitoring of mussel toxicity alone does not necessarily provide adequate warning of DA entering the food web at levels sufficient to harm marine wildlife and perhaps humans.",

You must waste not a moment!\" [ sic ]\n\nIntermediate dialogue [ edit ]\n\nMhenlo\n\nHello, <character name>, it is good to see you. I have much to tell you about the situation in the distant kingdom of Ascalon, far to the north in Tyria...my home. It was once a thriving kingdom, but one day the armies of the Charr came and attacked our people. On that horrible day, they invoked a fearsome magic that destroyed our kingdom and left almost all of it in ruins...an event we call the Searing. While some of our people remained in Ascalon with King Adelbern to defend the kingdom against the Charr, many more joined with his son, Prince Rurik. Rurik left our homeland and crossed the treacherous Shiverpeak Mountains, home of the Dwarves, to reach the lands of Kryta. Though Rurik did not survive the journey, his courage and sacrifice enabled our people to find a new home near Lion's Arch. I have received word that a new threat has arisen and threatens all of Kryta, including the Ascalon refugees. Soon I must return home to answer the call and deal with that threat.\n\nOnce you have completed all of your tasks here in Cantha and you are ready to help me and the people of Tyria, let Armian at the docks know. I have booked us passage on a ship...the Sea Swift...that should suit our needs.\n\nArmian\n\nEven now, the threat of the undead looms in my homeland of Kryta. If your goal is to travel there and help my people, I will help you find passage on our ship. I've no doubt the captain will agree once he learns of your noble intentions...I can only hope that battle is one we Krytans can win! Make sure all your affairs in Cantha are in order. Once you're ready to go to Tyria, talk to me again, and we'll set sail.\n\nI'd like to travel to Tyria. When you're ready, I'll get the ship ready for us to sail to Lion's Arch. I am ready. Your entire party is about to be moved to the next area. Make sure all party members are ready first. Do you wish to continue?' Yes. (sent to Lion's Gate where the Lion's Arch (cinematic) is shown) No. Not right now.\n\nLionguard Neiro\n\nGreetings, <character name>, Mhenlo told me of your arrival. I am happy to see you have made it safely to Kryta. Our lands are in dire need of heroes willing to face these undead hordes. If you're half as good as Mhenlo and his friends claim you are, your efforts will be most welcome, indeed.\n\nYou surely know of the undead that threaten all of Tyria, but I should also apprise you of another situation we face at this time. For as long as Lion's Arch has existed, it has been the duty of the Lionguard to defend the city and the people of Kryta. As of late, a new group...a religious cult known as the White Mantle...have gained power in our lands, some say too much power. Worse, the royal family has gone missing, and in their place the White Mantle have assumed the leadership of Kryta. As of now, the Lionguard still control this city, but the countryside beyond Lion's Arch is now held and protected by the White Mantle. So far they seem to be doing the job, but I've learned over the years to be wary of those who seek to change old ways, and these White Mantle claim to have discovered a whole new pantheon of unseen gods...what could be a bigger change than new gods? I suggest you work with them to try and stop this undead threat, but keep one eye on them at the same",

      "Left Front candidates and film actors KB Ganesh Kumar (left) and Mukesh Left Front candidates and film actors KB Ganesh Kumar (left) and Mukesh\n\nIn what was a fierce triangular fight among three well-known film actors in Pathanapuram constituency, LDF candidate KB Ganesh Kumar has emerged as the winner. In the constituency situated in a corner of Kollam district, Kumar, a former actor and a minister in the Oommen Chandy government, was pitted against popular actors Jagadish of the Congress and Bhiman Raghu of the BJP. While Jagadeesh has mainly essayed comedy roles in Malayalam films, Raghu was known for his cinematic performances as a villain.\n\nThroughout the election campaign, Pathanapuram was always in the spotlight for its presence of the three actors who did not waste opportunities to take potshots at each other. Although all three of them exuded confidence of a win, it was Kumar who pulled through eventually with a comfortable margin of nearly 25,000 votes. While Kumar polled 74,429 votes, Jagadish could only capture 49,867 votes with Bhiman Raghu coming in the third position.\n\nWATCH VIDEO | Election Results 2016: Editors Analyse How The Parties Fared\n\n\nThe highlight of the election campaign in Pathanapuram was when mega star Mohanlal came to attend an election rally of Kumar. A day later, Jagadish appeared emotional in front of reporters complaining that Mohanlal should not have attended Kumar's rally as Pathanapuram was a special constituency where all three actors were contesting. Both Jagadish and Mohanlal have acted together in several films. Many believe that the presence of Mohanlal, who enjoys massive influence in the state, could have tilted scales in the favour of Kumar.\n\nWith the victory, Kumar retained Pathanapuram, a seat that he has come to represent since 2001. Ahead of the state elections, Kumar was nominated by the Left front in Pathanapuram after his party broke ranks with the UDF. Kumar was the Minister for Forests, Sports and Cinema till April, 2013.\n\nAlso, joining Kumar in the state assembly is another popular actor Mukesh, who achieved victory as an LDF candidate in the Kollam constituency. Mukesh's victory margin of 18,000 votes has come against Sooraj Ravi of the Congress.\n\n© IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd",
      "It's interesting that the anti-borders crowd seems to have conceded the point I made in August that most past executive grants of status to illegal aliens were the consequence of foreign crises in the illegals' home countries and thus not relevant to the current discussion. These were, as Ross Douthat's trenchant column pointed out Sunday, \"modest, clearly defined populations facing some obvious impediment (war, persecution, natural disaster) to returning home.\"\n\nSo the fallback position of those claiming precedent is to grasp at two actions taken by Reagan and the elder Bush that came in the wake of the 1986 Immigration Reform and Control Act (IRCA) amnesty.\n\nNice try.\n\nThe Reagan administration action that amnesty advocates point to is simply irrelevant to the current case and trumpeted only because Reagan's name is attached to it. In what was a legitimate exercise of prosecutorial discretion shortly after passage of the 1986 law, INS announced that as a practical matter it would look the other way under certain circumstances with regard to minor children both of whose parents received amnesty but who did not themselves qualify for the amnesty. It granted no work permits, Social Security numbers, or driver's licenses. In the context of trying to implement the convoluted IRCA amnesty, I might well have done the same thing.\n\nGeorge H. W. Bush's 1990 \"family fairness\" policy is at least somewhat germane, in that it provided for renewable \"voluntary departure\" (i.e., amnesty) for certain spouses and children of amnesty beneficiaries, including work authorization. But it is no precedent either, for three main reasons:\n\nFirst, its size and scope. Despite claims at the time that \"as many as 1.5 million\" illegal aliens might benefit from the policy, the actual number was much, much smaller. In 1990, Congress passed legislation granting green cards to \"legalization dependents\" — in effect codifying the executive action Bush had taken a just few months earlier. That (lawful) measure actually cast the net wider than Bush's action, and yet only about 140,000 people took advantage of it — less than one-tenth the number advocates claim. Scale matters here; Bush's action cannot meaningfully be described as a precedent for Obama's scheme that would be 30 or 40 times larger.",

      "Projective Synthetic Geometry in Lady Frieda Harris' Tarot Paintings and in Aleister Crowley's Book of the Law\n\n\nClaas Hoffmann\n\n\nIt was in 1904 when the english magician Aleister Crowley wrote the the Book of the Law. It was dictated by a praeter-human intelligence calling itself Aiwass. The book consists of three chapters written down in Cairo on 8th, 9th and 10th April at noon.\n\n\n33 years later, Crowley met the artist painter Lady Frieda Harris. He had decided to create a new Tarot deck and asked Harris to paint the cards according his ideas, that is according his instructions. Harris agreed, became a member of the O.T.O. and they becan their work. A lot of the cards had to be painted several times. The drafts still are in private possession while the final originals can be found at the Warburg Institute London, a part of the University Library.\n\n\nThe Library Warburg was founded in 1903 by the jewish son of a banker, Aby Warburg in Hamburg. At the beginning of the Nazi regime in 1933, the complete collection (80,000 books) was sent to London where the Warburg Institute now was founded. There, I was able to study the original Tarot paintings. I also saw the unpublished drafts of earlier versions, in private ownership. Lady Frieda Harris painted far more versions than the published ones. All in all, she worked five years on them.\n\n\nAt the end of his life, Crowley wrote a book about this new Tarot, called The Book Thoth. About the card The Aeon Crowley wrote in the Book Thoth:\n\n>This new Tarot may therefore be regarded as a series of illustrations to the Book of the Law; the doctrine of that Book is everywhere implicit.< (Book of Thoth, page 115)\n\n\nIf you cut out these cards and remove their frames, especially the trumps can be put together in a very harmonic fashion. Why so?\n\n\nCrowley noted in the Book of Thoth that the harmony of the cards was proof of the correct application of symbols and colours of the holy cabballa, upon which this tarot was created. By making collages of these cards, I learned that the link between the peculiar cards was not only made through their colours or symbols but through their geometry. Which kind of geometry was used by Harris, which made these links possible?\n\n\nThe Geometry she used was an evolution of the strict Euclidian geometry. Its roots had been developed by the mathematician Descartes in the 17th Century. It's called \"Projective Synthetic Geometry\" and was developed by many mathematicians and scientists throughout Europe. Many of Descartes' ideas were based on both mathematical and mystic assumptions, e.g. his axiom of parallels meeting at infinity. The ends of parallel lines lie in two opposite directions, but the idea of the point in infinity is that the point, infinitely distant in a direction, is the same as those infinitely distant in the opposite direction.\n\n\nThis step in the development of Projective Geometry, based on the idea of elements in infinity, brought movement and perspective to the Euclidian concept of rigid, fixed forms. In the following centuries the next step based on the idea of polarity (center and periphery) was taken; in other words, the concept of a polarity between a central point and an infinitely distant surface.\n\n\nThese thoughts then had the consequence that each point in each conceivable space is the same distance from a surface in infinity.\n\n\nThe next step, taken in the 20th century, comes from the concept of space, polar or opposite to our three-dimensional space. Can one move one's concept of a surface in infinity into an infinite center? ...\n\n\nHow did Frieda Harris come into contact with the concepts of Projective Geometry and their practical, graphical conversion?\n\n\nThree people, whose spiritual paths were different from Crowley's, were responsible for this: Rudolf Steiner, George Adams and Olive Whicher.\n\n\nRudolf Steiner was the founder of Anthroposophy, from which, among other things, come Waldorf (Rudolf Steiner) schools, Eurhythmy and biodynamic agriculture.\n\n\nGeorge Adams was one of the people who helped to bring Anthroposophy to England. He met Rudolf Steiner personally during a trip to Dornach and at the same time beloned to a group of scientists who worked on the advancement of Projective Geometry. They worked on the concept of a space whose center is infinity.\n\n\nRudolf Steiner recognized that people required in their concepts the idea of infinity in the center as well as infinity in the periphery. Mankind needed the concept of infinity in the center in order to find their mental and emotional equilibrium, and in order to further develop spiritually. Steiner assumed infinity in a center in the sun. That is, infinity can",
      "How is Unemployment Measured\n\nIntroduction\n\nCommentators look to both the International Labour Organisation (ILO) measurement of unemployment in the Quarterly National Household Survey (QNHS), and the Live Register to assess current levels of unemployment.\n\nThe Live Register is not designed as a measurement of unemployment as it includes people who are legitimately working part time and signing on part time.\n\nThe ILO is the internationally recognised measurement of unemployment. The definition of 'unemployed' used by the ILO does not include some people who are entitled to unemployment payments, and therefore included on the Live Register.\n\nThe two sets of figures measure different things, but both give us useful insights into current labour market trends. The Live Register Statement is published monthly, and a county by county breakdown is available. The ILO- QNHS is published 4 times a year and provides a national average unemployment figure, plus a regional breakdown dividing the country into eight regions.\n\nNeither set of figures provide a 'community' based breakdown of unemployment, and neither set of statistics can tell us the proportion of people who are repeatedly unemployed - moving from unemployment into work, and back to unemployment again.\n\nBelow we examine how the Live Register and the ILO-QNHS are compiled, who is included, and what other labour market figures are available within both sets of statistics.\n\nLive Register\n\nCompiled: From returns made directly to the Central Statistics Office (CSO) by each of the local offices of the Department of Social and Family Affairs.\n\nIncluded on the Live Register are:\n\n\nAll those on Jobseekers Benefit (JB) - excluding systematic short-time workers\n\nAll those on Jobseekers Allowance (JA) - excluding smallholders/farm assists and self-employed persons\n\nPart-time workers (those who work up to 3 days a week), seasonal and casual workers entitled to Jobseekers Allowance or Benefit.\n\nThose signing on for 'PRSI credits' but receiving no payment.\n\nPublished: By the CSO, on the first Friday of every month at 11am by the CSO. The figures are updated on this web-site as soon as they are available. Along with these figures is a LR area analysis which gives LR totals for each county and a flow analysis – the numbers joining the LR monthly and the derived outflow.\n\nAdditional Figures: The CSO produces an age by duration analysis which is released biannually.\n\nStandardised Unemployment Rate: Published with each monthly Live Register analysis. The figure is based on a comparison between the annual unemployment figure taken in April of the year in question from the corresponding ILO -QNHS figure, and the seasonally adjusted live register figure for the month.\n\n\nILO - QNHS\n\nCompiled: From household surveys conducted continuously throughout the year. The results are published in four quarters Q1 December - February, Q2 March - May, Q3 June - August, Q4 September - November.\n\nThe ILO definitions of 'unemployed' and 'in employment' are\n\n\n'Unemployed': persons who in the week before the survey, were without work and available for work and had taken specific steps, in the previous four weeks to find work.\n\n'In Employment': persons who worked in the week before the survey for one hour or more for payment or profit, including work on the family farm or business and all persons who had a job but were not at work because of illness, holidays etc. in the week.\n\nThe 'Labour Force' is the combination of these two totals.\n\nPublished: By the CSO, four times per year, usually within 3 months of the end of the quarter which is being published.\n\nAdditional Figures:",
      "A doctoral student who is wanted by police has been expelled from the University of Sussex almost a year after he skipped bail.\n\nErich Kofmel, a DPhil student, was arrested in May 2008 on suspicion of fraud related to holiday lets, and was bailed until September that year.\n\nHe failed to turn up, fled the country and is currently wanted by the British and Swiss police. He is understood to be living in Switzerland.\n\nAnnouncing the expulsion after a disciplinary hearing, which Mr Kofmel did not attend, a spokeswoman for Sussex said: \"The panel judged that reports of Mr Kofmel's repeated evasion of legal authorities…, his persistent misrepresentation of the nature of the so-called Sussex Centre for the Individual and Society [SCIS] and its misleading claims of connections with the university, were significantly damaging to the interests of Sussex.\"\n\nMr Kofmel founded the SCIS in 2006 as a centre focusing on \"risky\" research. It was independent of the university but run from campus premises. He continued to use a Sussex campus address for the SCIS while on the run.\n\nResponding to criticism that the university should have acted sooner, the spokeswoman said it was following Universities UK advice that internal disciplinary processes should not be carried out in parallel with police or court proceedings.\n\nHowever, she said: \"The university judged that the prospects of legal action against Mr Kofmel being completed in the foreseeable future had diminished and it was now right to consider the disciplinary case.\"\n\nIn an email to a representative of the University and College Union, Mr Kofmel said: \"I shall wear it as a badge of honour to have been pro forma 'expelled' from that cesspool of mediocrity and the society of non-entities such as yourselves.\"\n\nMr Kofmel has continued to write books, organise conferences and run an academic email discussion list and website, www.political-theology.com, while on the run.\n\nA documentary by the BBC's Panorama programme on his exploits is due to be broadcast in October.\n\nMr Kofmel, who denies all charges, has suggested that the criminal allegations were made by people opposed to his theories.\n\n\"I have a problem defending myself against fraud charges because I do not believe in the 'sanctity' of private property, which is, after all, the basis of liberalism and capitalism, which I oppose,\" he said.\n\n\"A fraud charge is the best way of attacking me ad personam, rather than engaging my arguments.\"\n\nIn June, he said on his website that he had \"come into possession of court documents made out by the proper judicial authorities in Switzerland seeking to interrogate one Eric KOFMEHL – that's E-r-i-c-K-o-f-m-e-h-l – in connection with fraud accusations.\"\n\nPointing out that his name was spelt differently, he said: \"I hope that the authorities not just in Switzerland, but in other jurisdictions, too, will now stop pursuing me and focus their energies on finding Eric Kofmehl. The mix-up of identities must stop here.\"\n\nmelanie.newman@tsleducation.com",

      "Once a month, the mathematicians at GMO publish a single-page report, forecasting future returns. It's simplicity is powerful.\n\nAre your prepared? If Jeremy Grantham's forecasts become a reality, what'll happen to your portfolio?\n\nSo, as Howard Marks of Oaktree Capital says:\n\nThough GMO's forecasts shouldn't be used to \"time the market\", they are a way to spot euphoria and highlight excess pessimism.\n\nNo one has data on the future. There is no crystal ball. But a look at GMO's forecasts from the last 15 years, highlights how good their analysis is.\n\nGrantham, Mayo, van Otterloo & Co ( GMO ), who manage over $100 billion of funds, are forecasting negative returns for both US stocks and bonds.\n\nIf the future is like the past, investors are in for a miserable time.\n\nOn 30th October 2015, the forecasts included:\n\n-2.0% per annum for large US stocks\n\n-0.9% per annum for US bonds\n\nSo, a $100 invested today in US stocks or bonds is forecast to be worth $87 or $94 respectively in 7 years. A miserable outlook for our saving, eh?\n\nThese forecasts are well below what GMO regard as normal:\n\n+6.5% per annum for large US stocks\n\n+4.0% per annum for US bonds\n\nBut of course, few professionals would regard today as a normal market, given the Bernanke Put.\n\n#2: the theory\n\nGMO don't publish the math behind each forecast, but they do explain their logic. Above all, they are driven by a belief in mean-reversion.\n\nWhereas, daily movements in stock and bond prices may look like they are random. Over the long-term, prices usually revert to trend. For example, take the S&P 500 over the last 140 years:\n\nLink to the underlying data\n\n#3 (and optional): the math\n\nSo how does GMO come up with a 7-year forecast?\n\nFor the stock market, they forecast:\n\nsales growth (in real terms, i.e. before inflation)\n\nchange in profit margins\n\nchange in valuation\n\ndividend yield\n\nHere's the analysis from a GMO white paper in 2012. At the time, they forecast US stocks would only grow at 0.4% per annum.\n\nAs you can see, at any moment in time, the different variables can boost (sales growth) or hurt (P/E valuation, margins, dividends) the overall forecast.\n\nAnd the math for bonds?\n\nAgain, in a newsletter from 2013, GMO explained the 2 basic drivers for their bond forecasts:\n\nFirstly, they assume that the real-cash return will revert to the long-term average\n\nSecondly, that inflation will move to the long-term consensus view\n\nSo today, if we are in a period of low interest rates and low inflation, both drivers will hurt investors, as we move back to trend.\n\nIn the 2013 newsletter, they calculated nominal rates would have to rise from 2.5% to 4.9% to get back to trend.\n\nBut how did this mean-reversion dynamic lead GMO to suggest a real-return on US bonds of 0.2% per annum?\n\nWe need to acknowledge the various components: the shift in the yield curve; the real yield; and the roll down (from having a 10-year bond that after 1 year becomes a 9-year bond, and thus to ensure constant maturity, you sell and reinvest in a new 10-year bond).\n\nFor a bond-market novice, the data is hard to consume. But to put it in stock market language, the yield-curve shift is like the P/E valuation going down, and the roll-down+yield gain is because each year you sell the entire portfolio, and re-invest, getting a higher and higher dividend yield each year.\n\n#4: What's \"normal\"\n\nGMO used to publish what they regard as the expected long-term real return. These forecasts are driven off what they've observed over the last 100 years.\n\nIt's hardly surprising that:\n\nSmall US stocks are forecast to grow faster than large US stocks\n\nLarge US stocks are forecast to growth faster than other developed markets\n\nUS & international stocks are forecast to grow faster than US & International bonds\n\nEmerging markets are forecast to grow the strongest both in stocks and bonds\n\nAll stocks are forecast to grow 2.0%+ faster each year than bonds.\n\n(Aside: please remember these are pre-inflation figures).\n\n#5: GMO's track-record\n\nTo look at GMO's track record, let's",
      "Posted on 14 January 2017\n\nThe only time I forgot to bring my Knock On Wood sunglasses, this happens. The accident happened on Friday the 13th by a drunk driver. No matter how good of a driver you are, there is always a drunk driver who would ruin your day. Luckily, everyone involved is not injured. A car is just a car and can be replaced easily.\n\nWhat To Do In A Car Accident:\n\nPrepare: Make sure you have good insurance coverage, I recommend more than state minimums and uninsured/underinsured coverage plus medical. This will be important later, especially if you are not at fault. Ensure that your documentation is up-to-date; that means putting your registration and insurance information in your car and getting the old paperwork out. You don't want to be digging through your car on the side of the road trying to find what you need. Get a small organizer or folder for your documents (some insurance companies give these away to their customers).\n\nGet your emotions in check. You may be angry, especially if the other driver caused the crash. What is done is done, being angry will only cloud your judgement and make things harder for you. If the police come out to make a report it will help your case if you are the calm and rational one on the scene.\n\nYou just had a crash: First, ensure that no one in injured. You may need to call 911 to get EMS out. Often people will get out of the car holding their neck and looking for a payday; do not confront them on this! Note the behavior and ask if they are ok.\n\nSo now what? Before people have a chance to leave, try to get their information - name, phone number, address, type of car they are driving, and their plate number. Witnesses don't usually hang around very long so try to get this information right away. Let them know they may be contacted by your insurance company.\n\nPhotograph the accident: Get images of both cars, closeups of the damage and plate numbers, skid marks, impacts with any highway structures, signage, speed limit signs, traffic signals, weather conditions, and the relative position of the vehicles involved. Often people only snap photos of the damage, this does nothing to document the circumstances. Note the time the crash took place.\n\nExchange information: Share with the other driver your insurance details. Many companies provide you with a special form for this. Do not share the limits of your policy, just your policy number and company! Be sure to get their information.\n\nIf police respond: Be sure to ask if they are issuing any citations. The police will often let a driver leave once information is exchanged and then deal with writing tickets. Your insurance company will ask if tickets were issued and it helps things along to know the answer.\n\nSo I was not at fault, I'm going to file with their insurance: Wrong. Their insurance company will not treat you well, you are not their customer. Instead, bite the bullet and file with your insurance company. This will cost you your deductible initially, but if you are not at fault it will be refunded to you - all the times I have done this my insurance covered my deductible before my car was out of the shop so I was never out any money. There are a couple reasons file your claim this way, the first of which is that your insurance company knows the law and the industry, if their money is on the line they will fight the other company to get it back - that means they are fighting for you. You have paid for this massive resource, use it! The second is that many insurance companies offer a lifetime guarantee on collision repairs done at their preferred shops, you won't get this from the other guy's insurance company. I have had a couple shops do shitty work and try to pass it off, after enough arguing with the shop I just called my insurance and got them involved. The insurance company pushes lots of business to these collision shops and the shops don't want to mess up that relationship. Your insurance company has a louder voice than you, let them back you up.\n\nMaking the report: You will probably have to make a recorded statement to the insurance company about what happened. Be prepared for this and write down what occurred as soon as possible. Write out your entire narrative and read it to the insurance company over the phone. This will be very formal and you will be told that your statement is being recorded. This is important: You are only required to make one recorded statement. Both companies will call you and ask for one, I recommend you make a statement to your company only and authorize them to share the recording with the other company. This way you cannot accidentally contradict yourself.\n\nIf you are injured: Get a lawyer as soon as possible. Just trust me on this. There will be a lot going on that you won't be able to manage very well. Get someone working on your side to manage medical payment def",
      "Level 188. Hero.\n\nThat is the current Otonashi Hibiki's record. The world should know, is what the king thought. The hero that descended on Limia participated in the mid-scaled wars against the demon race that occurred in the kingdom and the countries in its vicinity.\n\nIn reality, moving from one country to the other takes a big amount of time.\n\nUsing the magic tool for teleportation that has been provided by the kingdom and the teleporting formation that has been permitted to use indefinitely by both the merchant and adventurer guild, they have been able to provide a VIP class transportation method in order to create an impossible schedule.\n\nThe girl who thought the demon race were monsters was surprised at first when she saw they had blue skin and an outward appearance extremely close to that of a human. At first she hesitated in fighting against them, but after a number of fights and seeing the deaths of her comrade soldiers as well as the enemy soldiers, she began accepting the constant fight to take one another's life.\n\nDemonic beasts that could understand human speech, demon race, and also hyumans.\n\nIn her current sense of value they are all on the same level and that principle has still not changed. That she was able to cope with this brutality that would normally conflict with her ideologies and faith is because she came to a conclusion of her own.\n\nThat she went to the various countries and reached that conclusion was also the aim of the kingdom. Because there is no room to indulge yourself sightseeing in a country that is in the frontlines of war.\n\nAbove all, the companions that fight at her side are important. Inside all the noise, the importance of their life is clearly heavier than that of a stranger. If these were companions that followed you in your journey, more the case.\n\nIf you participate in war and repeat battles over and over…\n\nThe thing that gets etched the most in a soldier when they participate in war is not determination, but the thirst of surviving the battle along with your companions that you leave your back to.\n\nAnd so, now…\n\nHibiki is in the royal castle. She had just fought through a harsh battle.\n\nIt was not against the demon race, but she was unexpectedly injured. She returned to the castle to treat her wound and was now in the middle of recovering.\n\nHer party companions were also thoroughly injured and were receiving treatment in a separate room. It's what you would call, an annihilated state.\n\nFor now they managed to teleport back, but this would not just stop at a normal commotion. The hero and her party have returned in a worn-out state and looked like they would fall over at any moment, so there is no surprise.\n\n\"Kyun~\"\n\nA worried voice came out from the silver belt sacred treasure that is wrapped around her waist.\n\nIt's the guardian beast that resides in the silver belt, Silver Wolf. Just like the girl, he was also injured in this fight and had returned inside the belt to recover.\n\n\"I am okay. You should also rest at ease and heal your body. Even if you can heal your wounds with magic, it doesn't mean that your stamina will return as well after all\"\n\nIs what Hibiki said. It's a rest for the sake of restoring stamina, magic power and also heal the fatigue. Luckily, this time's annihilation didn't have any member who received a fatal injury.\n\nCounting her companion wolf.\n\nHowever, the girl was thinking about the base.\n\n(In our plans I would be able to fight one of the demon race's shogun in three months' time. I thought that would be my first…)\n\nHer first refers to a defeat, or a narrow victory that is close to a defeat. Hibiki, who is respected as a hero and has ability to coupled with it, has soon received a hard fight.\n\nIn more specific terms, she was frustrated. This kind of feeling, she hasn't told even her party members.\n\n(Even Naval's speed couldn't oppose it)\n\nNaval, as type, is similar to Hibiki's. She is a swordswoman that uses her speed as main weapon. Pushed by her hate for the demon race, she only stood at the battlefield because of revenge. But while falling in conflicts with Hibiki, she has now become a party companion that stands at the frontlines with her.\n\nIn terms of speed she surpasses Hibiki. She uses attack-and-retreat as well as combo attacks to overwhelm her opponents, a person brimming with wisdom. Her age and stature are close to Hibiki's. Having a, close to white, ash blonde hair coupled with Hibiki's combination makes her stand out a lot in the battlefield.\n\n(Bredda-kun's protection was also destroyed)\n\nBredda",
      "Danielle Smith says she had no other choice than to quickly lead eight fellow MLAs to the Progressive Conservative government and avoid a vote by the Wildrose membership on a proposed reunification of the two right-wing parties.\n\nA day after Smith and Premier Jim Prentice announced they are joining forces in an expanded conservative government, the former Wildrose leader said under party rules, members would have had to wait four months to vote on the reunification.\n\n\"There just really wasn't, I don't think, another option,\" she said. \"The government needed to get moving on budget deliberations. And we're in a position now where we hopefully will be able to have some impact in some of the decisions being made.\"\n\nSmith, who is facing criticism she crossed the floor for personal gain, said she was met with resistance when she tried to lead the Wildrose toward becoming a fiscally conservative, \"socially mainstream\" party capable of forming government.\n\nShe said the Wildrose has been losing donors, supporters, executive members and candidates after the party voted down a wide-ranging anti-discrimination policy at its annual general meeting last month.\n\nA group had arrived at the Red Deer gathering with the expressed intent to \"teach me a lesson for walking in the Gay Pride parade,\" Smith said.\n\n\"Unfortunately, as I've been trying to press the Wildrose to become more mainstream, the more I pressed on that it seems the more reaction I got in the opposite direction.\"\n\nSmith said the Wildrose was borne out of anger with a PC government that was leading the province in the \"wrong direction.\" Prentice, however, has \"almost an identical set of values and principles and policies,\" which she'd rather support in the government benches.\n\nThe secret negotiations to unite the Wildrose with the Tories were already underway when Smith denounced two of her colleagues who had crossed the floor.\n\nPrentice said an emissary from the Wildrose caucus approached his team a month ago with a pitch to bring together Alberta conservatives.\n\n\"Someone from the Wildrose approached someone in my office about the prospect of more than a single Wildrose member wanting to cross the floor,\" Prentice said Thursday. \"I initially didn't take it very seriously. I said, 'Have a coffee and see what happens.\"'\n\nWhen it became clear the Wildrose was serious, Prentice had whip George VanderBurg handle the talks, which culminated in the premier and Smith meeting face-to-face a week ago.\n\n\"(The meeting) was to just ensure that I understood where she was coming from and that I could look her in the eye and vice versa,\" he said.\n\nOn Wednesday, Smith and eight more members of her caucus crossed the floor to join Prentice, saying they were ideologically simpatico and were personally impressed by Prentice's leadership.\n\nThe defectors, particularly Smith, were condemned Thursday in editorials and on social media as power-hungry political opportunists, who betrayed their supporters and the 442,325 Albertans who voted Wildrose in the 2012 election.\n\nPrentice also caught flak, particularly from NDP Leader Rachel Notley, for accepting the deal that tacks the PCs further toward the political right despite their winning power in 2012 on a platform of progressivism.\n\nPrentice rejected that.\n\n\"I'm just a guy doing my job, right. (I'm) trying to deal with the finances of the province. Nine people approach representatives of my party and say, 'We want to join your party.' I should say no?\" he asked.\n\n\"No one should equate democracy to conservatives fighting each other for the entertainment of the NDP.\"\n\nThe defections leave the Wildrose with a tenuous grasp on official Opposition status. The party has five members and no leader. The Liberals also have five and are asking the Speaker to let them have the role.\n\nPrentice's statement on the month-long negotiations means the talks coincided with the fall session of the legislature.\n\nThat session was marked by cross-aisle civility during debate and question period, with Speaker Gene Zwozdesky suggesting the tone was unprecedented.\n\nPrentice says he will consider the \"talents and abilities\" of Smith and eight other new members of his caucus as he mulls his next cabinet shuffle over the holidays. He said new blood puts the province in a strong position as it heads into financial uncertainty.\n\nThe premier acknowledged some believe he should call an election given he has adopted policies closely aligned with Wildrose platforms, but said he is focused on Alberta's finances as the price of oil tumbles.\n\n\"I don't think this is the appropriate time to get into making decisions on elections,\" he said. He hasn't, however, dismissed the possibility of a 2015 race.\n\nSmith said before she and eight other Wildrose MLAs decided to cross the floor, she was aware that",
      "Johnny Marr is an iconic and influential guitarist best known for his work in the Smiths, which broke up in 1987. His guitar phrases and his genius for crafting textured and tonally rich rhythmic leads has influenced countless rock guitarists of the last quarter-century. Since leaving the Smiths, Marr hasn't exactly been idle or resting on his laurels.\n\nSee also: - Sunday: Johnny Marr at the Gothic Theatre, 4/21/13 - The Smiths '80s radio-station takeover: What really happened according police reports - More than a fascinating piece of Smithsology, the '80s radio takeover is a story of redemption\n\nMarr, once a member of Electronic with Bernard Sumner of New Order and Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys, has played on a number of records and contributed to numerous other high-profile projects, including his recent stint in Modest Mouse. This weekend, Marr returns to Denver in support of his debut solo album, The Messenger, and in advance of the show, we spoke with the charming and intelligent guitarist about how he got the sound for \"How Soon Is Now?\" and his signature model of the Fender Jaguar.\n\nWestword: You got started playing music early in life. How did you become friends with Andy Rourke and Kevin Williams?\n\nJohnny Marr: I'd already played a couple of shows before that with a couple of bands. I'd been in a couple of bands before I met Andy, even though I was fourteen or fifteen at the time. We met in school, Andy and I. I'd been playing in these little kid's kinds of bands at twelve and thirteen. When I got to fourteen and fifteen, I got invited to play in a couple of bands with much older guys.\n\nThere was a band in Manchester called Sister Ray, who were just this scary bunch of men/reprobates. I guess word had got around that I had a knack and was a useful little guy to have around, and you only have to buy me some Coca-Cola and I was good to go. So I played with them. I started playing my first sort of shows in front of real [crowds] when I was fourteen.\n\nWhat got you excited to play music of your own that early on?\n\nThe truth is that I've never known what it's like to not want to play music of my own because I come from an Irish family that all played instruments. Luckily for me, my parents were very young when I was born -- they were like sixteen, seventeen -- and they were from a tradition of people playing instruments, accordions, pennywhistles, guitars, harmonicas and things like that -- cheap little instruments. But because they were young and moved over to Manchester, they liked rock and roll and pop music of the day.\n\nThe culture of staying up late and having some drinks any and every night of the week was what I grew up around. But it was also twinned with a kind of mountain vibe because they were young and happy to have gotten away from the farmlands. So they were really into pop music. So the two things kind of came together, this assumption that you played or sang.\n\nI started playing harmonica when I was a little boy. I used to get pushed out to entertain adults at two o'clock in the morning. I also had a kind of obsession about the guitar. The first actual toy that I had that I loved was a little wooden guitar that my folks brought me from a shop that sold brooms and buckets and stuff like that. I used to carry that guitar around like my friends would carry a football. I took this thing with me everywhere.\n\nIn all honesty, it's never been in my mind to not play an instrument in front of people. A bunch of things sped me along in my life to doing it for a living. I moved from the inner city to the suburbs, where there coincidentally happened to be a bunch of kids my own age or a little older who took themselves very seriously as guitar players.\n\nAnd very quickly after that, the punk explosion happened to these older friends of mine. So I was watching all of this very closely. I guess there was some part in the personality as well that was artistic, and also a desperation to get out of my own economic and social situation -- so a whole load of things went into getting me where I am now.\n\nYou started playing guitar before there were a lot pedals around to process sounds. Do you feel that helped you in some ways develop your own style rather than having to rely on those options for a signature sound?\n\nAbsolutely. Whatever bit of advice and guidance I could get from anywhere -- whether that was rare books of interviews with Chet Atkins, or I remember John Lennon talking about being a rhythm guitar player and how important that was -- all of these little snippets of wisdom and information I just took on board.\n\nI remember some",
      "Ever since Jon Stewart announced that he would be leaving The Daily Show after 16 long years behind the desk, the question has been who, on earth, could take his place? Fans thought they had an answer earlier today when longtime Daily Show correspondent Samantha Bee tweeted this intriguing statement:\n\nThe day is exciting, but maybe not in the way The Daily Show fans had hoped. According to a statement from TBS, Bee will be hosting a brand-new show on their network \"to apply her smart and satirical point of view to current and relevant issues.\" The statement continues:\n\nLike her fans around the country, we absolutely adore everything about Sam, from her straight-faced sarcasm and ruthless wit to her uncanny ability to mine comedy gold from just about any awkward situation. After watching Sam's work for years, we knew that her distinctive humor and talent belong at the front of her own show.\n\nSo Bee, following in the footsteps of other correspondents like Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, and Larry Wilmore, will strike out on her own with yet another Daily Show–esque spin-off. Bee will also get to keep it all in the family. She and her husband—fellow Daily Show correspondent Jason Jones—will also be working on a new untitled family sitcom for TBS. She'll be writing, he'll be starring.\n\nWhile that's great news for Jones and Bee, the big question remains unanswered. What will become of The Daily Show? After Stewart himself, Jones and Bee are the two most veteran members of The Daily Show cast and the show's brightest young star, Jessica Williams, has made it very clear she has no desire to step into a leadership role at the moment. Though there are more fantastic members of The Daily Show team, many of them, like Aasif Mandvi and Al Madrigal, split their time between the show and other projects like Mandvi's HBO series The Brink and Madrigal's NBC series About a Boy. And others, like talented newcomers Jordan Klepper and Hasan Minhaj, simply haven't made enough of an impression yet.\n\nIt was never definite or even highly likely that the next anchor of The Daily Show would come from the existing cast. After all, back in 1999, Jon Stewart was hired over correspondent Stephen Colbert when Craig Kilborn left as host. But what the departure of Bee and Jones has made clear is that no matter who takes over after Stewart leaves, The Daily Show will look radically different in its next phase. And, though it's too early to hang crêpe, it is entirely possible that there might not be a Daily Show at all. Comedy Central is unlikely to let go of the name, but it also may have trouble finding someone eager to take over the intimidating institution Stewart built.\n\nDoes that mean the end of an era? Well, sort of. But also, in keeping with the current TV trend of more is more, we also have those many spun-off versions of The Daily Show to choose from. Late Night with John Oliver, The Nightly Show with Larry Wilmore, Bee's new project, and even Colbert's new home on CBS all carry the fingerprints of Stewart's legacy. The Daily Show as we know it may soon be gone, but it won't be forgotten.",

      "A policeman stands in front of ivory items shown to the media before being destroyed in Beijing on May 29, 2015 China said Tuesday it has widened a ban on ivory imports as it comes under pressure to restrict a trade which sees thousands of African elephants slaughtered every year.\n\nImports of all ivory and ivory products acquired before 1975 will be banned until the end of the decade, the State Forestry Administration said on its website. The measure came into force on Sunday.\n\nIt also extended until the same date existing bans on imports of African ivory carvings acquired after 1975, and all ivory hunting trophies.\n\nChina is seen as the major source of demand for African ivory, with prices for a kilogram (2.2 pounds) reaching as much as $1,100.\n\nConservationists estimate that more than 20,000 elephants were killed for their ivory last year, with similar tolls in previous years. The WWF campaign group says 470,000 of the animals remain.\n\nThe Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) took effect in 1975. It banned the ivory trade in 1989.\n\nLike other countries, China permits the resale of ivory bought before the 1989 ban—and also has a stockpile purchased with CITES approval in 2008, which it releases for sale with certification.\n\nActivists say the trade in legal ivory acts as a cover for illegal imports and call for a complete ban on sales.\n\nThe issue came up during President Xi Jinping's state visit to the US last year, when the White House said in a statement that the two countries \"commit to enact nearly complete bans on ivory import and export\".\n\nThe measures would include \"significant and timely\" restrictions on hunting trophy imports and steps to halt domestic commercial ivory trade, the statement added.\n\nBeijing imposed a temporary ban on imports of ivory carvings last year, but campaigners described the move as more symbolic than effective.\n\nThe Chinese territory of Hong Kong - a key hub for the trade—said in January it would tighten restrictions on ivory imports and exports including a ban on trade in hunting trophies, but did not give a clear timescale.\n\nChina's newly extended import bans do not outlaw its existing domestic trade, and appear to potentially allow imports of some raw ivory dating from after 1975.\n\nThe State Forestry Administration said imports of ivory artefacts for \"teaching and scientific research, cultural exchange, public display and law enforcement\" purposes were not covered by the extended ban.\n\nExperts say most illegal ivory is headed for China, where it is seen as a status symbol. By some estimates the country accounts for as much as 70 percent of global demand.\n\nUnderlining the scale of the trade, state media reported Monday that police in south China's Guangdong province seized about 450 kilograms of smuggled ivory in a raid earlier this month.\n\nExplore further: Conservationists welcome Hong Kong move to ban ivory trade",
      "Mike Blake/Reuters\n\nIt's 2017, and people are still debating whether or not women are intellectually inferior to men, and whether we are entitled to a workplace that isn't toxic to people simply based on their gender and sex. The Google employee memo about the apparent harms of diversity policies in Silicon Valley is both a shocking news story for the general public and for many women and gender minorities—especially of color—working in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and medicine, a banal sign of normalcy.\n\nAt least science is helping us make progress, right? Science is sold to us as an almost holy, objective pursuit: a pure endeavor, a way of pursuing truth and only truth. As a high school senior planning to study physics and astronomy in college, I was thoroughly convinced that solving quantum gravity would trickle down to improved human relations. Of course, I was adorably naïve about both the difficulty that quantum gravity presented us (we've made little progress in the 18 years since I started university) and about the relationship between science and humanity's various imperfections.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMy education as a scientist did little to disabuse me of this simple view of science as a great unifier, as an objective means of distilling information. When skeptical members of my family argued that physics was dangerous because of nuclear weapons, I pointed out that it wasn't science that was the problem but rather how people used it. But nowhere is it more evident that this perspective is flawed than when we consider the uses and abuses of evolutionary biology and its sibling, evolutionary psychology.\n\nIt is impossible to consider this field of science without grappling with the flaws of the institution—and of the deification—of science itself. For example: It was argued to me this week that the Google memo failed to constitute hostile behavior because it cited peer-reviewed articles that suggest women have different brains. The well-known scientist who made this comment to me is both a woman and someone who knows quite well that \"peer-reviewed\" and \"correct\" are not interchangeable terms. This brings us to the question that many have grappled with this week. It's 2017, and to some extent scientific literature still supports a patriarchal view that ranks a man's intellect above a woman's.\n\nGet Slate in your inbox.\n\nIt's easy to end up in an endless loop of using our prodigious scientific skills to carefully debunk the shoddy science that props up this argument. This is important and valuable work, but it's also worth considering why this loop exists at all. Science's greatest myth is that it doesn't encode bias and is always self-correcting. In fact, science has often made its living from encoding and justifying bias, and refusing to do anything about the fact that the data says something's wrong.\n\nMost saliently in the context of the Google memo, our scientific educations almost never talk about the invention of whiteness and the invention of race in tandem with the early scientific method which placed a high value on taxonomies—which unsurprisingly and almost certainly not coincidentally supported prevailing social views. The standard history of science that is taught to budding scientists is that during the Enlightenment, Europe went from the dark ages to, well, being enlightened by a more progressive mindset characterized by objective \"science.\" It is the rare scientific education that includes a simultaneous conversation about the rise of violent, imperialist globalization during the same time period. Very few curricula acknowledge that some European scientific \"discoveries\" were in fact collations of borrowed indigenous knowledge. And far too many universally call technology progress while failing to acknowledge that it has left us in a dangerously warmed climate.\n\nScience's greatest myth is that it doesn't encode bias and is always self-correcting.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\nMuch of the science that resulted from this system, conducted primarily by white men, is what helped teach us that women were the inferior sex. Racial taxonomies conveniently confirmed that enslaving African people was a perfectly reasonable behavior since, as Thomas Jefferson put it, black people were \"inferior to the whites in the endowments of body and mind.\" Of course, this apparent inferiority never stopped Jefferson from repeatedly raping his wife's half-sister, Sally Hemings, herself a product of rape. Jefferson is remembered as a great thinker, but when one reads his writing about race, it becomes immediately evident that rather than being much of a scientist, he was a biased white supremacist who hid behind science as a shield.\n\nThe problem is that science was just the shield he needed in the 18th century, and unfortunately, it seems that it continues to function that way today. In other words, pseudoscience has always been a core feature of post-Enlightenment scientific knowledge and it remains that way because scientists refuse to integrate contemporary science, technology, and society studies research into university curricula. And so too many of us get out of school and end up in a world where we are suddenly forced to grapple with the reality of how science,",
      "In the study released on Tuesday, researchers found that eight aquifers—particularly those in arid climates—were dangerously overstressed. Eleven major aquifers were \"negatively recharging,\" meaning people were pumping water out of them much faster than they were putting it in. \"The water table is dropping all over the world,\" Jay Famiglietti, a water researcher at NASA and one of the authors of the study, told The Washington Post. \"There's not an infinite supply of water.\"\n\nThis study notably only allowed scientists to measure how aquifers were changing, not how big they are. But its methods seem to offer significant improvements on previous techniques.\n\nEarlier groundwater research occurred by a sort of census. Government or independent researchers collect data about how people are accessing an aquifier—how deep they're drilling, how much water they're pumping, and how quickly they're extracting it. They then combine this figure with other calculations about the size and depth of the aquifier to arrive at an estimate of its health.\n\nThe satellites in the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment—nicknamed GRACE—works by a different method: It observes the mass of water beneath the ground. The two satellites in GRACE chase each other across orbit, measuring their distance from each other. When they pass over something with more gravity—like a continent—the front satellite accelerates away from its partner. By measuring these accelerations, scientists can measure and estimate the planet's gravity and heaviest regions. They can then estimate the presence of large, massy agglomerations—such as the underwater seas that are aquifers—that can't otherwise be observed.\n\nThe two GRACE satellites launched in 2002, and their own methods have improved over time. Last year, NASA researchers found they could better measure groundwater by comparing GRACE's findings to irrigation records, rather than by estimating the amount of water in the soil from climate records.\n\nGRACE's findings sometimes differed wildly from those on the ground. The study's authors say that the aquifer beneath California's Central Valley is in better shape than statistics would indicate. The aquifer beneath Democratic Republic of Congo, meanwhile, appears to be in considerably worse shape, losing water at least three times as quickly as statistics would estimate, the study says.\n\nThe sum of all these findings is that we'll soon have to start treating and monitoring global groundwater with the same precision we track aboveground reservoirs. And last week, California took its first serious steps in that regard, issuing major regulations limiting how farmers could use water from the Central Valley aquifer. The mandate remains to treat groundwater—hard as it is to imagine—as the finite resource that it is.\n\nWe want to hear what you think about this article.

      "Last updated: October 16, 2017.\n\nThe American Economic Association has a disclosure policy for potential conflicts of interest, as does the National Bureau of Economic Research. To fulfil my obligations under those policies, I have posted my disclosure here, which is up-to-date as of January 2017.\n\nThe subject of the disclosure statement above is mainly financial, but it also included items related to political and policy activity. In this blog post I expand briefly on the political and policy activity.\n\nFrom time to time, I take calls from government officials for advice on policy matters. I answer the calls when I'm able.\n\nIn the past, MPs from all three main parties have cited me as a credible reference in the House of Commons. (CPC, LPC, NDP)\n\nIn 2014-15, I was a member of the Economic Advisory Council for the Liberal Party of Canada. I also assisted in developing some parts of their policy platform and gave some advice during the campaign. These roles were unpaid, and ended with the October 19, 2015 election.\n\nSince the 2015 election, I have continued to have occasional policy conversations with, among others, officials from the Prime Minister's Office, and the Office of the Leader of the Opposition. Starting in June 2016, I advised the Department of Finance on its Review of Federal Tax Expenditures. From September to December 2016, I spent 80% of my time providing research and advice to the Department of Finance. Details of this arrangement are here.

      "TREASURY INSPECTOR GENERAL FOR TAX ADMINISTRATION\n\nInappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax-Exempt Applications for Review\n\nMay 14, 2013\n\nReference Number: 2013-10-053\n\nThis report has cleared the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration disclosure review process and information determined to be restricted from public release has been redacted from this document.\n\nRedaction Legend :\n\n1 = Tax Return/Return Information\n\nPhone Number / 202-622-6500\n\nE-mail Address / TIGTACommunications@tigta.treas.gov\n\nWebsite / http://www.treasury.gov/tigta\n\nHIGHLIGHTS\n\nINAPPROPRIATE CRITERIA Were used to IDENTIFY TAX-EXEMPT APPLICATIONS for review\n\nHighlights\n\nFinal Report issued on May 14, 2013\n\nHighlights of Reference Number: 2013-10-053 to the Internal Revenue Service Acting Commissioner, Tax Exempt and Government Entities Division.\n\nIMPACT ON TAXPAYERS\n\nEarly in Calendar Year 2010, the IRS began using inappropriate criteria to identify organizations applying for tax‑exempt status to review for indications of significant political campaign intervention. Although the IRS has taken some action, it will need to do more so that the public has reasonable assurance that applications are processed without unreasonable delay in a fair and impartial manner in the future.\n\nWHY TIGTA DID THE AUDIT\n\nTIGTA initiated this audit based on concerns expressed by members of Congress. The overall objective of this audit was to determine whether allegations were founded that the IRS: 1) targeted specific groups applying for tax‑exempt status, 2) delayed processing of targeted groups' applications, and 3) requested unnecessary information from targeted groups.\n\nWHAT TIGTA FOUND\n\nThe IRS used inappropriate criteria that identified for review Tea Party and other organizations applying for tax‑exempt status based upon their names or policy positions instead of indications of potential political campaign intervention. Ineffective management: 1) allowed inappropriate criteria to be developed and stay in place for more than 18 months, 2) resulted in substantial delays in processing certain applications, and 3) allowed unnecessary information requests to be issued.\n\nAlthough the processing of some applications with potential significant political campaign intervention was started soon after receipt, no work was completed on the majority of these applications for 13 months. This was due to delays in receiving assistance from the Exempt Organizations function Headquarters office. For the 296 total political campaign intervention applications TIGTA reviewed as of December 17, 2012, 108 had been approved, 28 were withdrawn by the applicant, none had been denied, and 160 were open from 206 to 1,138 calendar days (some for more than three years and crossing two election cycles).\n\nMore than 20 months after the initial case was identified, processing the cases began in earnest. Many organizations received requests for additional information from the IRS that included unnecessary, burdensome questions (e.g., lists of past and future donors). The IRS later informed some organizations that they did not need to provide previously requested information. IRS officials stated that any donor information received in response to a request from its Determinations Unit was later destroyed.\n\nWHAT TIGTA RECOMMENDED\n\nTIGTA recommended that the IRS finalize the interim actions taken, better document the reasons why applications potentially involving political campaign intervention are chosen for review, develop a process to track requests for assistance, finalize and publish guidance, develop and provide training to employees before each election cycle, expeditiously resolve remaining political campaign intervention cases (some of which have been in process for three years), and request that social welfare activity guidance be developed by the Department of the Treasury.\n\nIn their response to the report, IRS officials agreed with seven of our nine recommendations and proposed alternative corrective actions for two of our recommendations. TIGTA does not agree that the alternative corrective actions will accomplish the intent of the recommendations and continues to believe that the IRS should better document the reasons why applications potentially involving political campaign intervention are chosen for review and finalize and publish guidance.\n\nMay 14, 2013\n\nMEMORANDUM FOR ACTING COMMISSIONER, TAX EXEMPT AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES DIVISION\n\nFROM: Michael E. McKenney /s/ Michael E. McKenney\n\nActing Deputy Inspector General for Audit\n\nSUBJECT: Final Audit Report – Inappropriate Criteria Were Used to Identify Tax‑Exempt Applications for Review (Audit # 201210022)\n\nThis report presents the results of our review to determine whether allegations were founded that the Internal Revenue Service (IRS): 1) targeted specific groups applying for tax‑exempt status, 2) delayed processing of targeted groups' applications for tax‑exempt status, and 3) requested unnecessary information from targeted groups.

      "- After a history of alcoholism, former Red Wing great Darren McCarty found a way to battle his addiction.\n\n\"I've used medical marijuana and it saved my life,\" he said.\n\n\nMcCarty said addiction has been a part of his life for years - alcoholism always seemed to win, until now.\n\n\"I haven't had a drink in over four months and it's because I properly got medicated,\" he said.\n\nThe former hockey player said he knows others might see this method as counterintuitive but said it's just a matter of education and perception.\n\n\"It doesn't mean you are getting well, it just means you are switching around deck chairs on the Titanic,\" said Jeff Jay, an addiction specialist and author who also speaks from experience. \"I went from being a national merit scholar to living under bushes in the city parks out in California. The only way I got better was because people helped me.\"\n\nAddiction specialists refer to this as cross addiction - a person switches out one substance, such as alcohol, for another, such as marijuana.\n\n\"You need to go into a good inpatient setting where they can monitor you around the clock when you are coming off the substances,\" Jay said.\n\nMcCarty said he tried that, but found a better combination.\n\n\n\"Through my journey, a lot of stuff that I've taken from that I apply to my life today,\" he said. \"Everybody's different - you gotta find out what your program is. ... My program involves medical marijuana because that's what keeps me off alcohol.\"\n\nAlthough others argue it's always best to go with a proven method such as total sobriety, McCarty said he views if one views medical marijuana like medicine rather than a recreational drug, it can work.\n\n\"You should be able to decide which medication you want to take that will help you,\" he said. \"Now, there are people out there to educate, and that's what I encourage.\"",
      "Florida's invasive species problem can be daunting, with real implications for the state's ecology and economy. The breadth of the issue is spurring some lawmakers to ask if state funding makes a difference.\n\nThe state is taking some non-traditional steps to slow the spread of invasive species, and officials say they're making progress. Conservationists recently hired a group of python hunters from South India to wade into the Everglades. Through fishing competitions and private contracts, the state has removed 110,00 invasive lionfish since last year. But Thomas Eason with the state Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission says that barely scratches the surface.\n\n\"They're a prolific breeder. One individual lionfish can release up to two million eggs per year,\" Eason said.\n\nTwo million eggs per year. Not every hatchling will survive into adulthood, but stats like that have some lawmakers raising concerns about Florida's plans for combating non-native species. Thomas Eason says the challenge is daunting.\n\n\"I said it before, but we need help from everyone, particularly on lionfish, because it's just such a broad, large-scale issue with problems that go way beyond our ability to solve by ourselves,\" Eason said.\n\nEason says the eradication programs are important, even if they feel ineffective. But with a problem this large, some lawmakers are asking if the state should even bother. Bartow Republican Representative Ben Albritton chairs the Agriculture and Natural Resources Appropriations Committee, and he's singling out invasive species programs for special scrutiny. If the state isn't getting an adequate return on investment, Albritton says cutting back the programs could help save money.",
      "Beretta U.S.A., the American arm of the iconic Italian firearm maker, said Tuesday that it would move all of its U.S. manufacturing activities from Prince George's County to Tennessee in response to the gun control law the Maryland General Assembly passed last year.\n\nBeretta, which has been making firearms in Maryland since 1977, employs about 160 workers at its Accokeek plant, according to board member Jeff Reh.\n\nHe said the company expects to begin moving its production lines from the facility in May, and to wind up its manufacturing in Maryland by the end of 2015.\n\nBeretta's parent company has continued in the same Italian town for more than 500 years.\n\n\"We tend to be a company that has deep roots,\" he said. \"We didn't want to leave Maryland or even consider it but we decided it was the most prudent course of action. We could have been happy staying in Maryland for hundreds of years.\"\n\nReh said Beretta U.S.A. employs about 95 people in its administrative offices in Accokeek — jobs he said would remain in Maryland.\n\nThe company's announcement immediately became a flash point in the governor's race between Democratic Lt. Gov. Anthony G. Brown and Republican nominee Larry Hogan.\n\nHogan put the blame on Brown and the gun control law pushed by Gov. Martin O'Malley.\n\n\"I am saddened to learn that the hard-working women and men I met at Beretta's factory in Accokeek in May will now lose their jobs as a direct result of the O'Malley-Brown administration's high taxes and punitive regulations,\" he said. \"The loss of these several hundred jobs will tear through the local community.'\"\n\nThe Brown campaign said it was clear Beretta never planned to keep its production in the state.\n\n\"At the end of the day, we understand why a gun manufacturer would oppose common sense gun safety measures, but Larry Hogan's opposition is more troubling,\" Brown campaign manager Justin Schall said. \"Hogan opposes a law that prevents the mentally ill from getting guns, bans the sale of automatic assault rifles and 30-round clips to protect our children, families and police officers.\"\n\nThe company had already announced plans to do all of its new manufacturing at the plant it plans to open in Gallatin, Tenn., next year. Reh said that Beretta's latest decision means that all of its gun-making activities will be consolidated there.\n\nReh pointed to provisions of O'Malley's Firearm Safety Act of 2013 as it passed the Senate, saying they could have interfered with the company's manufacturing, storage and shipment of Beretta products in Maryland.\n\nWhile those provisions were removed by the House, he said the company remained concerned they could be revived in the future.\n\n\"The chance we would go through that next legislative session or the one after that was just too great a risk for us to accept,\" Reh said.\n\nProminent lawmakers, however, said the chances of those proposals coming back were nil.\n\n\"There's been no sentiment in the House to revisit those provisions,\" said Del. Curt Anderson, a Baltimore Democrat who served on the Judiciary Committee when it considered the gun bill.\n\nA spokeswoman for O'Malley expressed disappointment in Beretta's decision but defended the law, which among other things banned sales in Maryland of some of the assault weapons the company manufactures.\n\n\"We remain energized about all the jobs we're creating here in Maryland,\" spokeswoman Nina Smith said. \"Since June 2013, Maryland has created more than 24,100 total jobs, and we're one of only 19 states in the nation that has recovered all of the jobs lost in the national recession.\"\n\nDel. Michael J. Hough, a Western Maryland Republican who serves on the Judiciary Committee, said Beretta gave lawmakers fair warning about its intentions.\n\n\"I'm not surprised. If you combine our anti-gun laws with our high taxes, Beretta is just one of many businesses that have fled the state,\" said Hough, who is running for the state Senate. \"There's a lot of people who are going to be leaving the state and having to pick up and move because of the blatantly political bill the governor passed.\"\n\nBut Vincent DeMarco, a longtime activist who was one of the 2013 bill's chief backers, rejected Beretta's logic.\n\n\"Their headquarters is in Italy, which has a lot stricter gun laws than Maryland does,\" DeMarco said. \"I don't believe that's what's going on here. If they were serious about not wanting to be in a place with strict gun laws, they would move out of Italy.\"\n\nBeretta has long been an anomaly in Maryland — a storied firearms manufacturer operating in a deeply Democratic state where polls show voters favor gun control measures by hefty margins. The company's interests have long received critical support from powerful Democrats representing southern Prince George",
      "8 Reasons Wall Street Greed Is the Cause, and the Solution, To Phony Fiscal Cliff Crisis\n\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock.com\n\nWall Street, which caused the economic crash that drove up the debt and gave politicians an excuse for this fiscal cliff debacle, is once again getting a free pass. Given Wall Street's greed, this should be a national disgrace. There is no debt crisis. Rather there is a crisis in courage -- no one has the guts to make Wall Street pay for the damage it has done.\n\n1. The Wall Street Crash Lies at the Heart of the Problem\n\nOnce again our politicians and pundits are showing signs of financial Alzheimer's. They just can't remember that Wall Street's insatiable greed caused the Great Crash of 2008 -- not poor people buying homes, not the government's interference, not the auto-industry, not the debt. In a matter of months, 8 million American lost their jobs. Business and personal tax revenues plummeted, as expenditures rose to assist the unemployed. That's why deficits rose.\n\nSPONSORED\n\n2. Wall Street Never Paid For the Bailouts\n\nFinance is the bloodstream of capitalist production. The crash was like a heart attack, crippling the vital organs of the economy (and the saturated fats in the bloodstream were all those glutinous financial innovations). The bailouts and stimulus programs were designed to prevent the patient -- the economy -- from dying. Giving Wall Street all that money and debt guarantees should have been accompanied with immediate reforms, including removal and punishment of top management. Instead it was treated as part of the bonus pool for those who pushed the economy over the cliff. All that free money pushed up government deficits.\n\n3. Wall Street Is Still Collecting Obscene Bonuses\n\nWhile the rest of America suffers, Wall Street bonuses continue like nothing happened at all. Just look at this revolting chart below on Wall Street bonuses in New York. And total compensation is heading even higher according to recent reports:\n\nNew York State Comptroller Thomas DiNapoli reports that total compensation at Wall Street firms rose 4% last year to more than $60 billion, near pre-crash levels—and the third highest level ever.\n\nSource: NY State Comptroller\n\nThink about that for a moment: The folks who took down the economy and then got bailed out, are getting bonuses like they had nothing at all to do with the crash. And they are the first to call for \"fiscal responsibility\" and the cutting of \"entitlements.\n\n4: Wall Street Was Never Held Accountable\n\nNot one Wall Street executive was indicted for crashing the economy. Sure, about 50 hedge fund honchos have been nailed for insider trading, but none of those trades had anything to do with the crash. Those who deliberately puffed up the housing bubble and who pedaled junk securities were not personally punished. Few even lost their jobs. Had they been running small banks instead of too-big-to-fail behemoths, the FDIC at least would have taken away their toys. Even the finance-friendly Reagan administration jailed over 1,000 savings-and-loan crooks.\n\n5. Wall Street Hedge and Equity Funds Pay Only 15 Percent in Taxes on Their Incomes\n\nAll this talk about raising the top tax bracket from 35 percent to 39 percent is a joke for Wall Street, and a cruel one for the rest of us. That's because much of the trillion-dollar hedge fund and private equity syndicates pay themselves with something called \"carried interest.\" Instead of getting an income, they get this special version of capital gains so that their income is capped at 15 percent. If this loophole isn't eliminated during these fiscal negotiations, you'll know that Wall Street owns both parties.\n\n6. Wall Street Is the Only Industry Without a Sales Tax\n\nWall Street buys and sells trillions of dollars of stocks, bonds and derivatives each year. And none of those sales are taxed...unless they take place in London which has a financial transaction tax on stock sales (and it's been in place for the past 300 years or so).\n\nI asked Tim Geithner, the Treasury Secretary, why we don't have one. Here's how a \"Treasury Department official\" responded on his behalf:\n\nA financial transaction tax (FTT) is not an idea we are planning to support in the U.S. FTTs are hard to implement globally, are generally borne by retail investors, are prone to regulatory arbitrage, depress asset prices and trading volumes, and increase capital costs. The Obama Administration's Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee applies at the institutional level, levied as a tax on certain liabilities of large financial firms in order to discourage excessive leverage. This is fully consistent with the principles agreed to by the G-20 Leaders. In our view, a tax on liabilities is a better way to generate funding while addressing excessive leverage.\n\nNot only would Geithner's proposed fee be minuscule",

Despite opposition from the local residents, the parks and recreation department continues to move forward with their agenda.\n\nThe primary beneficiary of this \"renovation\" would be Archbishop Mitty High School, a private high school located one block from John Mise park, which plans to be the major user of the sports facilities and parking while contributing less than 10% of the approximately $4-5 million cost of renovation. The City of San Jose in essence plans to subsidize Archbishop Mitty High School's athletic program and parking expansion at the expense of local residents.\n\nFor the 2011-2012 fiscal year, the City of San Jose faces a $115 million budget deficit. Due to ongoing 11 years of consecutive budget deficits, the City of San Jose has had to reduce public safety workforce such as police officers and firefightera, cut branch library hours down from 6-7 days/week to only 4 days/week and make additional cuts to essential city services. Under such difficult economic situation, it is a criminal waste of public money to destroy a green public park in order to subsidize a private high school's athletic program.\n\nThis renovation, besides depriving the residents of an open natural, peaceful park, will also lower property values, which in turn will lead to an increased budget deficit due to the resulting negative impact on property taxes.\n\nPlease sign the petition to protect John Mise Park and preserve it's open, grassy space.\n\nThe San Jose Parks and Recreation Commission will meet to vote on the proposed \"renovation\" of John Mise Park on March 7, 2012 at City Hall, Room W-119, 200 E.

      "What the developers have to say:\n\nWhy Early Access? \"Early Access has been a tremendous boon to our design process. From the start, our goal with CodeSpells has been to give players as much freedom as possible, even as we were pioneering untried systems and tools.\n\n\nWe purposefully made our current plan as malleable and open to players as possible in order to find and polish what people want out of the game. This feedback has guided our every step, and we know it will continue to shape us.\n\n\nCodeSpells is currently an enjoyable experience, but we are confident that we can push ourselves harder through Early Access.\" Approximately how long will this game be in Early Access? \"Originally, we had planned to release the full game in Summer of 2016. However, while we were working and listening to our beta testers, we realized that our in-game systems for explaining coding and motivating people to create spells were lacking. Tutorials were a feature we had subconsciously relegated to the unreached NPC Stretch Goal of our Kickstarter campaign, but we have realized since then that in order to create a truly accessible and enjoyable experience, we should have a more interactive coding window, and perhaps even a small guided campaign where players could test their skills. However, the campaign mode is a dream goal, and last on our list. Our primary concern is to make the best procedurally-generated spell-crafting sandbox game the world has ever known.\n\n\nWe are so grateful for everyone's help in making CodeSpells as magical as we all want it to be. We hope you will continue to give us feedback as we bear down on the final product.\" How is the full version planned to differ from the Early Access version? \"Air magic and Multiplayer are now fully implemented!\n\n\nGoing forward, we will make our Life ecosystems more robust, implement a coding tutorial, design tools that allow the game to be internally moddable, and possibly create a basic campaign mode.\" What is the current state of the Early Access version? \"The current version of the game features Earth, Water, Fire, and Air magic. These elements are not at their final state, but are at a close enough state that will allow us to move on to incrementally adding new aspects to interact with.\n\n\nThe game has not been fully optimized or tested, so although we believe it is at a fairly stable state, bugs and hitches are very possible.\n\n\nWe will be doing major updates about once or twice a month, if not more often, up until the completion of the project.\" Will the game be priced differently during and after Early Access? \"We currently don't expect the price to change while in Early Access.\n\n\nAfter the Early Access is completed, it is possible that the price of the game will change, but if it does, it will not be substantial.\" How are you planning on involving the Community in your development process? \"Our team is active on the CodeSpells forum (https://the-codespells-forum.herokuapp.com/). We love to hear about how things are going and any features that are missing from the game.\n\n\nEvery month for the duration of the development of CodeSpells, we have and will continue to do Developer Updates on progress.\"",
      "This is only Frank De Boer's second official Inter game. Palermo's simple yet effective defensive tactics highlights Inter's struggle to interpret their new coach's ideas. Inter struggles for majority of the game to break down Palermo's defense until the later part of the game. While Inter has problems with its defensive transition, we will focus on the tactical problem of Inter's offensive game.\n\nInter's build-up\n\nPalermo is a standard 3-5-2 formation while Inter plays a 4-3-3. Like many teams playing a four-men back line these days, Inter often switches to a 3-4-3 in offensive phase, with Benega dropping back, positioned slightly in front of the 2 center backs and two full backs pushing to the midfield. A key movement for this type of formation in the build-up is the relative position of the central midfields and the full backs. It is important for them to occupy different vertical layers in order to provide better passing options. You can see how Kondogbia and D'Ambrosio have almost simultaneous opposite movements. This turn their formation from a 2-1-4-3 formation into a 2-1-2-2-3. Sometimes the roles of the central midfielder and the full backs also swap, with the full-back positions more centrally while the central midfielder moving further up. But the idea is the same, to create more passing layers for Benega. You should also notice the position of Medel and Kondogbia swaps. This is a tactic that Frank De Boer often uses in Ajax. From below you can see Perisic and Eder also swap their positions in certain periods of the game. You can see from below: The goal is to create confusion for defenders who might have been familiar with the technical ability of the wingers.\n\nThe key goal of Frank De Boer's tactic is to control possession, efficient distribution of the ball the deep-lying playmaker (Benega), and through the positional play by the full-backs, advanced midfielders and wingers to create chances for Icardi.\n\nPalermo's strategy\n\nPalermo's defensive strategy is simple: to force Inter to play through the flanks and press them there. They do it by two ways: Quaison is often tasked with preventing Benega advancing across half-line upon receiving the ball. See Quaison nor any Palermo players press Benega for almost 5 seconds. The goal is simple, force him to pass to the flanks. Two more examples: Notice how Quaison giving Benega space as long as he does not penetrate across half-line. Also note that Gazzi is in the center to form a horizontal line with the other two midfielders to prevent any Inter's penetration. You can see how successful this strategy works: Benega mostly passes to the flanks in the first half around the half-line.\n\nOnce on the flanks around the half-line, Palermo's players attack Inter's ball-handlers, whether it is D'Ambrosio, Medel, Santon, Kondogbia or even Eder and Perisic when they drop there. Notice how Vitiello shift right to follow Perisic. The important element of Palermo's press on the flank is to always have at least one more player than Inter's player. This is often provided by Gazzi. Similar press also happens on the flank. Gazzi is often the player who provides the extra man and guarding the space behind the pressers. Inter struggles heavily in the first half to breakdown Palermo's above defensive strategy. Lets look at Inter's passing data from the 1st half: The passing data of Inter summarize their struggle in the first half. Being forced to play out from deep to the side, Inter's can only deliver to the flanks around the half-line, not advanced enough to cause Palermo's problem. There is also lack of penetrative pass in the middle, highlighted by lots of failed passes.\n\nInter's passing data from the second half: You can see in the second half, Inter manages to pass to a lot more advanced position on the flanks. You should also see there are a lot more penetrative passes through the middle. The question is, what changes?\n\nInter's adjustment\n\nBenega's positioning\n\nPosition where Benega receives passes in the first half Position where Benega receives passes in the second half Benega is more advanced to receive the pass. In the first half he mostly collects the ball in the defensive third in the middle, where he is often faced with Palermo's forwards. In the second half he is often seen in more advanced and wider positions to collect passes. This helps alleviating the block by Palermo's forwards in the half-line.\n\nBetter switching passes to the opposite sides\n\nPalermo's numerical advantage on one",

I modernized our democracy with territorial reform. 'The commitment I made was to bring down unemployment. I made sure to help the people seeking jobs. The results are coming.

The company takes into account apps installed on Android, iPhone and Windows Phone platforms.\n\nThe company said that it is now focussing on a mobile first approach. MakeMyTrip said that 74% of domestic hotels orders are on mobile and 48% of domestic flight orders are from mobile.\n\nMeanwhile, MakeMyTrip reported revenues of $120 million for the quarter ended March 2017 (Q4 FY17), an increase of 36.4% from $88 million in the same quarter last year. It reported a net loss of $73.1 million as compared to a loss of $49.9 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. Losses stemmed from marketing expenses and costs related to employees following the ibibo merger.\n\nHotels and packages segment: Revenues from its hotels and packages segment increased by 22.6% to $78.9 million compared to $64.4 million in the lame quarter last year. Transactions for MakeMyTrip India hotels booked online increased by 95.4% YoY in the quarter. MakeMyTrip India online hotels business represented over 97.4% of all hotels and packages transactions in the quarter.\n\nAir-ticketing revenues: Revenue from the air ticketing business increased by 48.1% to $32.9 million in the quarter from $22.2 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2016. This increase was due to an increase in gross bookings of 43.0% driven by 42.4% increase in the number of transactions year over year along with the consolidation of the ibibo Group, the company said.\n\nOther revenue: Other revenue increased to $8.3 million from $1.4 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2016, primarily due to the contribution of bus ticketing revenue from the ibibo Group. Note with the merger with the ibibo Group, MakeMyTrip also acquired redBus, Ryde and Rightstay brands.\n\nMarketing and sales promotion expenses: MakeMyTrip's marketing and sales promotion expenses increased by 48.9% to $78.8 million in the quarter compared to $53.0 million in the same quarter last year.

The company also incurred costs in ad campaigns and download and referral expenses.\n\nPersonnel and employee expenses: Employee expenses increased by 178.0% to $32.7 million from $11.8 million in the same quarter last year mainly due to higher share-based compensation costs related to the ibibo acquisition.

      "FLORHAM PARK, N.J. -- Those old AFC East rivals, the New England Patriots and New York Jets, are at it again.\n\nJets owner Woody Johnson, who might have violated the league's anti-tampering rules Monday by saying he'd welcome back star cornerback Darrelle Revis, issued a statement later in the day saying he \"misspoke.\" He said he called Patriots owner Robert Kraft to clarify his remarks.\n\nNevertheless, Patriots coach Bill Belichick evidently believes Johnson might have crossed the line.\n\n\"I would think that the league would look into those comments,\" Patriots coach Bill Belichick said of Woody Johnson's remarks on Darrelle Revis. Jim Davis/The Boston Globe/Getty Images\n\n\"I would think that the league would look into those comments,\" Belichick said during his weekly interview on Boston's WEEI radio station.\n\nA league spokesman declined to comment on whether Johnson might have violated league rules. A team can be fined or docked a draft choice if tampering allegations stick.\n\nThe latest Jets-Patriots soap opera started Monday morning, when Johnson held a news conference to discuss the firings of coach Rex Ryan and general manager John Idzik.\n\nThe Jets traded Revis after the 2012 season and, despite interest from the Revis camp, declined to pursue him upon his release from the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2013. Revis signed a two-year, $32 million contract with the Patriots, but it's essentially a one-year deal for $12 million.\n\n\"Darrelle is a great player,\" Johnson said. \"If I thought I could've gotten Darrelle for that, I probably would've taken him. It was our best judgment to do what we did. Darrelle is a great player. I'd love Darrelle to come back.\"\n\nNot only did the cornerback-needy Jets pass on Revis, but they watched him sign with their archrival. The second year of Revis' Patriots contract has a prohibitive cap charge of $25 million, meaning he could be free to test the market again after this season.\n\nJohnson alluded to past acrimony with the Revis camp when asked why the Jets didn't pursue him last offseason.\n\n\"I guess my experience with his agents, and that's all,\" Johnson said. \"It would have been very hard.\"\n\nIt didn't take long for Johnson's eyebrow-raising comments to hit the Internet. Several hours later, he issued a mea culpa.\n\n\"I misspoke today when I commented on Darrelle Revis,\" Johnson said. \"I would never interfere in the contractual relationship of a player with another team and should not have used those words.\"\n\nJohnson said he called Kraft to \"emphasize those points.\"",
      "Some Indian startups are letting their imagination run amok with job titles.\n\nThe finance head at online wallet company, MobiKwik, for instance, is called \"chief number cruncher,\" while the company's product manager is called \"chief idea man.\" The human resources head is the \"chief happiness officer,\" and the information technology head is designated \"Dr. Fixit.\"\n\nThese creative—yet somewhat obscure—designations help companies make regular jobs sound interesting and club multiple roles into one position.\n\n\"Startups are all about chaos and people do multiple roles in these companies. So, a chief technology officer does not only work on the company's technology vision, but also writes codes and does testing. A traditional designation, hence, may not convey these multiple jobs clubbed into one,\" B.S. Murthy, CEO of executive search firm Leadership Capital Consulting, told Quartz.\n\nMaking job titles sound \"cool\" also helps companies attract talent. \"There is a growing trend in startups to let a new recruit select a title of his or her liking that he or she can use,\" Murthy said.\n\n\"Although we give everyone a formal designation when they join, we've seen employees pick quirky new-age titles,\" Bipin Preet Singh, founder and CEO of MobiKwik, told Quartz.\n\nOn June 11, India's e-commerce major Flipkart said it has created a new role, \"entrepreneur-in-residence,\" and hired information technology industry veteran, Ravi Garikipati, for the job.\n\nTypically, \"entrepreneur-in-residence\" is a temporary and informal position at venture capital firms, law firms or business schools. The designation is given to an entrepreneur who is in the process of starting a new company.\n\nGarikipati will work closely with Flipkart's co-founders—Sachin Bansal and Binny Bansal—on new and high-impact business projects, the company said in a statement. His first assignment at Flipkart would be to scale the company's new advertising initiative.\n\nRats and evangelists\n\nThe business card of Rajat Dhariwal, co-founder of MadRat, a startup that makes board games and puzzles, states his designation as \"founder & head rat.\" His co-founder, Madhumita Halder, is \"founder & dreamer rat.\" The company also has some \"nerd rats\" and \"geek rats\" in its technology teams.\n\nBusiness card of Rajat Dhariwal, 'Founder and Head Rat' of MadRat Games\n\nAlthough these designations have landed the Bengaluru-based company to trouble at times—while making regulatory filings, for example—it's not exactly an exercise for the sake of amusement. \"The practice breaks the typical monotony and hierarchy,\" Dhariwal told Quartz. \"For us, this has more to do with creating a culture of equality.\"\n\nBut while Dhariwal and company have been particularly creative, there are certain creative job titles that have become popular among several startups—even though most people have no clue what they mean. And, these titles might mean different things in different companies.\n\nFor example, Raju Vegesna has served as an evangelist for Zoho, makers of online suites of office software, for more than a decade. But basically, he heads the company's mobile app division.\n\nOn the other hand, Shagufta Anurag, is the chief design evangelist at Livspace, an e-commerce startup in the home design and décor space. And her job is to create the looks for the interiors and décor of houses for the company.\n\nRecruiters who hire for startups list out several other designations—brand warrior, chief curator, chief cheerleader, director of awesome, chief inspiration officer, corporate ninja and chief belief officer. In traditional parlance, brand warrior refers to a marketing executive, and chief curator is usually a content writer.\n\n\"These titles have a lot to do with sugar coating,\" Murthy admitted, \"and making a role that has been around since forever sound interesting.\"",
      "Consider the following beliefs, which are common even among conservative Christians:\n\nThe government should recognize civil unions which treat gay and straight couples equally. The government may (or even should) punish discrimination on the basis of innate differences. Sexual orientation is at least partially innate, beyond an individual's control.\n\nI will argue that if one accepts all three premises, then the following is implied:\n\nWedding photographers and bakers should punished for only offering their services to straight weddings.\n\nPremise 3 is a matter of scientific debate, but is commonly held and has some merit. Premise 2 is popular except among the most strident libertarians, and has been legally established since the 1960s. In contrast, Premise 1 is not a scientific hypothesis, but instead a philosophical/theological claim, and one that was until recently opposed by essentially all orthodox Christians.\n\nThe sudden recent acceptance of Premise 1 is reason alone to give us pause. But the argument I will make in this post should make us even more wary. Indeed, the sudden acceptance of same-sex civil unions is often an attempt for a truce between LGBT activists and Christians who oppose gay marriage and want to preserve their religious liberty. However, if my argument is valid, then accepting gay civil unions actually undermines the basis of religious liberty with respect to \"anti-discrimination\" laws.\n\nWhy is it illegal for McDonald's to refuse service to black people? Why is it legal for McDonald's to refuse to serve pizza to customers? In the former case, the same product is being served, and the business is discriminating among different customers. In the latter case, however, we consider pizza and hamburgers to be two different products. McDonald's cannot be legally required to offer a product. However, if it offers a certain product, legally it must offer that product to everyone without exception.\n\nThis distinction requires a civil judgment on whether something is a \"different product\" or the \"same product offered to only some people.\" For example, the government would regard a restaurant selling a \"whites-only eating experience\" as merely cover for offering an eating experience only to white people.\n\nHow does this all relate to same-sex civil unions? Those who accept same-sex civil unions are admitting that in a public, civil sense, there is no difference between a man-woman union and a same-sex union. They may still maintain that the Bible treats the two differently and that Christians are only allowed one but not the other. Yet to accept same-sex civil unions is to confess that there is no publicly-recognizable ontological difference between a man-woman union and a same-sex union. The two types of partnerships should be treated by the government as really the same thing.\n\nNow let us consider a wedding photographer in our world where there is (to the eyes of the government) only one type of civil union, encompassing both straight and gay partnerships. She (to the government) offers a single type of product: photographs of celebrations of unions. If she refuses to take pictures for a same-sex nuptial, she is really just refusing to offer her product to gay customers. Assuming Premise 3, she is discriminating against a class of people whose identity is at least partially beyond their control. Thus, according to Premise 2, her actions ought to be illegal.\n\nHow do we respond to this? We must maintain that there is an ontological difference between a straight lifelong monogamous marriage and all other types of sexual partnerships, and that in fact the latter are not \"unions\" at all. We must argue that this distinction is not just spiritual, not just a moral requirement for Christian individuals or churches, but a real intrinsic difference that must be recognized by the government. We must hold that this difference is visible, and that our society can and should see it, if only we would open our eyes to the truth. A viable defense for religious liberty can be found only by reclaiming this lost ground.",
      "Ladakhi girls hold their voter card as they wait to cast their vote during the 8th Phase of Lok Sabha elections,at Leh in Ladakh on 7 May 2014. PTI\n\nAs Prime Minister Narendra Modi prepares to visit Beijing to build bilateral relations and explore additional economic opportunities, it is the right time to analyse China's ambitions and intentions. The unceasing intrusions by Chinese troops especially in the Ladakh sector are one area that merit attention.\n\nPertinent are the intrusions by Chinese troops especially in the Depsang plains just days prior to the visit of Premier Li Keqiang in April 2013, and in the Chumar area of Ladakh last September. The latter, very unusually, broke with pattern and continued throughout Chinese President Xi Jinping's stay in India and for many days thereafter. Some observers at the time sought to suggest that either these were solitary actions by a local commander, or that Xi Jinping's control over the People's Liberation Army (PLA) is lax. While credible reports clearly indicated that the actions were planned and deliberate in both cases, additional confirmation is available from the latest round of promotions in the PLA.\n\nThe recently announced promotions in the PLA not only further consolidate Xi Jinping's grip over the PLA as Chairman of the Central Military Commission, but are also of relevance to India. Nine officers in the Lanzhou Military Region, which along with the Chengdu Military Region has operational responsibility for the Sino-Indian border, made the significant jump from senior colonel to the rank of major general on 12 January 2015.\n\nAmong them, the promotions of particular significance for India are the appointments of Hālǐmùlātí Ābùdōurèhémàn as Deputy Commander of the Southern Xinjiang Military District; Liu Lin, as Chief of Staff of the Southern Xinjiang Military District; and Zhang Limin, as Director of the Political Department of the Southern Xinjiang Military District. All are from the Southern Xinjiang Military District, which exercises front-line responsibility and jurisdiction over the Hetian and Ali Military Sub-Districts.\n\nThe Hetian Military Sub-District (MSD) has front-line responsibility and jurisdiction over the areas of Daulet Beg Oldi and the Depsang Plains. The PLA's Ali Military Sub-District (MSD) includes the three Chinese counties of Ritu (Rutok), Gar (Gartok) and Zhada (Tsamda). Chusul and the Indian portion of Pangong Lake are opposite Ritu (Rutok) County, Indian Demchok is opposite Gar (Gartok) County and Chumar and the Shipkila Pass are opposite Zhada (Tsamda) County. The commanders of the Hetian and Ali MSDs both hold the rank of senior colonel in the PLA. The commander of the Hetian MSD is Senior Colonel Kuang Dewang and the commander of the Ali MSD is Senior Colonel Liu Geping. The two have been in position since at least late 2013 and, as senior colonels are on the verge of the big promotion to the rank of major general.\n\nBoth the Hetian MSD and Ali MSD report to the South Xinjiang Military District based in Kashgar, which, in turn, reports directly to the Lanzhou Military Region Headquarters. Their action orders come from Lanzhou, via Kashgar, where the generals are based. At least as far as the border with India is concerned, the South Xinjiang Military District does not channel its reporting through the Xinjiang Military District headquartered in Urumqi.\n\nThe commander of the South Xinjiang Military District, presently, is 55-year-old Lt Gen Li Haiyang. He assumed command between late December 2013 and early January 2014. Li Haiyang spent six months in 2003-2004 studying in a Russian military institute and later, in mid-2010 after only six months as chief of staff in the South Xinjiang Military District, Li Haiyang was suddenly transferred to the PLA's General Staff Department (GSD) in Beijing as director of its Combat Rapid Response Office. After two years in this post, he returned to his previous job as chief of staff in the South Xinjiang Military District. This experience makes him an officer who is known, and probably trusted, in Beijing and Lanzhou. He additionally has the requisite experience and knowledge about rapid troop deployments.Image 2nd\n\nMaj Gen Zhang Jiansheng, Li Haiyang's predecessor, was promoted and posted as a deputy commander of the Lanzhou Military Region. He was the first officer from the South Xinjiang Military District in the last 22 years to be promoted directly to Lanzhou. He was also commander of the Ali MSD a decade ago. He can be expected to oversee all matters concerning the South Xinjiang Military District (including the Hetian and Ali MSDs) on behalf of Lanzhou Headquarters.\n\nIt is interesting too that the South Xin",

      "PleaseHold's Big Silly PVE Dark Templar Guide\n\nPleaseHold's Big Silly PVE Dark Templar Guide\n\nTable of Contents:\n\nTo be filled in?\n\nWho?\n\nI am NachtSieger, an enormous dorkus who mains Dark Templar. I am not the smartest or most knowledgeable, but I do quite like the class, and have read a lot of words about it. I also like helping, and I have wanted to do this for a long, long time. Main credit to Impresaria who mentioned me as one of the guild's (Restraint's) best/better holders which got me to thinking about the class' holds and such, which drifted to me giving this guide a much, much more serious consideration from my past considerations. Also as far as I've seen there isn't one big central repository of Dark Templar information. Which isn't to say that this is one, but this will just be a collection of things that I know.\n\nWhat?\n\nThe Dark Templar is a subclass of the Female Slayer character, railroaded completely into magical damage and the Shadow element. This is not a bad thing, except when it crops up as annoying. The class' main schtick is being almost solidly 40% super holds by volume, and is able to deal pretty solid amounts of damage.\n\nWhy?\n\nPlay Dark Templar if you relish the idea of putting enemies into the super hold corner and shooting soul lasers at people.\n\nGeneral/Female Slayer Skills\n\nIf I leave out a skill in this section then it means you should ignore its existence because it is either irrelevant or garbage.\n\nQuick Rebound: Max this, no questions.\n\nLeap: Rarely useful, take one level if at all. Leveling beyond 1 is pointless, as it just boosts the duration and cooldown.\n\nFocus: Magical Critical: Max. Every 1% of critical rate adds .5% overall damage, making this a solid damage increase.\n\nAscending Sword: Your basic upper, there is no point in leveling it (in PVE).\n\nSword Barrier: A Guard by any other name is just as valid. Get a single point in this for its utility. For instance, did you know this will let you not get bowled over by a boss shockwave? Sword Barrier alleviates this and so much more! Additional points boost the amount of damage it blocks, but you don't really need to level it further.\n\nShadow Snake Attack: Get one level of it for utility then move on.\n\nSpinning Blade: Counter with Z on getting hit to super armor frontflip over an enemy and hit them. One point for utility and move on.\n\nCastigation: Never level this, or use it actually. I know I sort of contradicted myself, but this I want to mention that badness aside, it has its extremely niche uses.\n\nSliding Slash: A skill that lets you move quickly by letting you forward dash based on attack speed, and you get more slides as you level this/put TP into it. Just get one level of this for the utility.\n\nDark Templar/Dark Empress/Nemesis Skills\n\nIf I leave out a skill in this section then it means you should ignore its existence because it is either irrelevant or garbage.\n\nAs a note, in this section I am writing this assuming that you are done with Scenario quests. If you are reading this and are not done with them, then pretty much just disregard this section because Scenario quests dungeons can be bowled over by complete accident???\n\nFirst up, SP/skill allocation. I'm sorry to say that Dark Templar has only one real build. If you deviate from this, know that your efficiency takes a hit.\n\nShadow Lancer: Only keep one level in this to… I use it as time wasting filler damage for garbage enemies.\n\nShadow Binding: Get ten levels so you can get one level in its TP, then leave it alone.\n\nShadow Harvest: Max this skill, along with its TP. Low cooldown, decent damage, pulls enemies to its center (with an option to disable this), and shreds defense. This is a skill that's hard to not love.\n\nShadow Hiding: Max it. If you don't, then delete your character. This skill is horseshit useful in all ways.\n\nEvolve: Max it. Literally no reason not to.\n\nScaffold: One level is all you need. Intensely useful skill.\n\nSoul Drain: One level is all you need as a filler skill. Or, just ditch it.\n\nLiberate - Buckshot: Max it and get the TP. The TP does in fact reduce its damage, but in exchange maintaining your Evolve stacks is infinitely easier and actually possible. As a note for those of you who dream of being a one",

These had received, in addition to the common rules, farther instructions peculiar to the higher degrees. \"These (as Weishaupt writes) may sometimes be the most imbecile, and at other times the most ingenious of the Brotherhood.\" From the former he can depend on a blind obedience to the rules he lays down, which are never to be deviated from; and with respect to the latter, provided they be zealous and punctual, should they even transgress any of the laws, it would not be in such a manner as to commit either their own safety or that of the Order; and they would soon make amends for their indiscretion by some new artifice. But, whatever may be the sense of the Illuminee, he is obliged once or twice in his life to act the part of Brother Insinuator, and that with a certain success, by the acquisition of two or three proselytes, under pain of perpetually remaining in the lower degrees. Some Brethren of high rank may have been dispensed from this formality; but as to the generality of them there exists a positive law on that point. 1 To stimulate the zeal of the Brethren, the Insinuator is by the laws of the code established superior over every novice that he has gained to the Order: It is expressed as follows: \"Every Illuminee may form to himself a petty empire; and from his littleness, emerge to greatness and power.\" 2\n\nSuch then is the first duty imposed upon every Illuminee for the propagation of the Sect; and this is the part which first claims our attention, in order that we may be able to form an idea of the immensurable powers of Weishaupt for seduction.\n\nThis part may be said to be subdivided into three. The rules laid down are, first, those which are to guide the Brother Insinuator in the choice of persons to be admitted or excluded; then follow those which are to teach him how to entice into the order those persons whom he has judged proper for it;\n\np. 416\n\nand lastly come those rules and arts by which novices are to be formed, and even involved in Illuminism before they are officially admitted.\n\nIn order to judge of the qualifications of the persons whom he may enlist, every Illuminee is to begin by procuring tablets, which he is to keep in the form of a Journal; and this is his Diary. Assiduously prying into every thing that surrounds him, he must vigilantly observe all persons with whom he becomes acquainted, or whom he meets in company, without exception of relations, friends, enemies, or entire strangers; he must endeavour to discover their strong and their weak side; their passions and prejudices; their intimacies, and above all, their actions, interests, and fortune; in a word, every thing relating to them: and the remarks of every day he must enter in his Diary.\n\nA twofold advantage is to be reaped from these particulars of information; first, by the Order in general and its superiors; secondly, by the adept himself. Twice every month he will make a general statement of his observations, and he will transmit it to his superiors. By these means the Order will be informed what men, in every town or village, are friendly or inimical to it. The means of gaining over the one or destroying the other will naturally occur. With respect to the Insinuator, he will learn how to judge of those who are proper persons to be received or rejected, and he will carefully insert his reasons for the admission or rejection of those persons in his monthly statements. 3\n\nThe Recruiting Brother will carefully guard against giving the most distant hint that he is an Illuminee. This law is peremptory for the Brethren, but more particularly for all the Insinuators, whose success may often essentially depend on it. It is to them that the legislator so strongly recommends all that exterior of virtue and of perfection, that care of shunning all public scandals which might deprive them of their ascendancy over the",

      "Scotland and Northern Ireland have been protected from hundreds of millions of pounds in spending cuts at the expense of England and Wales according to a report from the IFS. It highlighted a 'flaw' in how the Barnett formula deals with business rates.\n\nHow does Barnett work?\n\nSpending in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland is mostly funded by block grant payments from Westminster. Increases—and cuts—to these payments are worked out by the Barnett formula to reflect how many people live in each place, as well as which administration is responsible for what.\n\nThe formula is designed to ensure that spending per head will go up or down equally in all four nations. That's why Scotland, which started with higher spending, still spends around 20% more per person than England, at £10,152 per person last year compared to £8,529 for England.\n\nThis is well known. But the IFS have found another disparity as a result of the way that the formula decides which parts of UK government spending are on devolved functions.\n\nIn areas like education, which is completely devolved, a £1 rise in spending in England leads to a 10p rise in the Scottish block grant, because England has roughly ten times the population of Scotland.\n\nThings get a bit more tricky for departments that aren't completely devolved, like the Home Office. About 24% of Home Office spending is on the UK as a whole and 76% on functions in England that are devolved in Scotland. So for a £1 increase in the Home Office budget, Scotland sees a block grant increase of 7.6p.\n\nThe problem here is that when Westminster departments have their budgets cut (or increased) the impact is not always spread proportionally across devolved and non-devolved functions. But the Barnett formula's block payments are calculated before we know where these cuts are going to fall. This knocks the per-person spending across the four nations out of sync.\n\nBarnett and business rates\n\nNormally, these changes would even out over time and across departments. However, the IFS show that this doesn't work out when it comes to local government spending.\n\nCuts in local government spending since 2010 have totaled £110 per person in England and Wales, but the Scottish and Northern Irish block grants only fell by £19 per person—17% of these cuts.\n\nA £1 cut in the Department for Communities and Local Government's budget in England only leads to a 17p cut in spending per person in Scotland and Northern Ireland. The other 83p is treated as coming from business rates, which are (broadly) kept in the nation they were raised from.\n\nSo taking £1 from the local government budget (treated as partially devolved) and moving it to education (wholly devolved), will result in a cut in the Scottish block grant of 1.7p. But the increase in Education spending increases the Scottish block grant by 10p. Moving spending from one area to another increases spending per person in Scotland when spending per person in England has not changed.\n\nThe IFS says this is \"not in the spirit of the Barnett formula\" and argues that if the business rates had been categorized in a fairer way, Scotland and Northern Ireland would have faced £600m and £200m more in cuts than has been the case.",

We try to brace ourselves for impact,\" Aubrey Atkinson of Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, wrote on our TODAY Parenting Team. \"Every year it serves as a reminder of what we don't yet have.\" (Atkinson chronicled her struggles with infertility, and now is a mom of three.)\n\nAn estimated one in four known pregnancies ends in miscarriage. About 12 percent of couples experience infertility, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And while infant mortality rates have been steadily declining in the U.S., the CDC reports that every year approximately 24,000 babies die before their first birthday in the United States.\n\nParents grieving child loss have to battle a familiar enemy on Mother's Day: Silence. Many people, unsure what to say to someone who has lost a child, don't acknowledge the loss at all.\n\n\"People are extremely uncomfortable and you find people avoiding you in grocery stores,\" Gordon Livingston told TODAY Parents for a story about what to say, and what not to say, to bereaved parents. Livingston's 23-year old son Andrew died from suicide, and a year later his 6-year-old son Lucas died from leukemia.\n\nLexi Behrndt is a contributor to the TODAY Parenting Team and the mother of 4-year-old Lincoln and son Charlie, who was seven months old when he died in 2014.\n\n\"The world tells you to 'heal' and to 'move on,'\" Behrndt wrote for the TODAY Parenting Team in 2016, an essay she also produced as a video. \"Healing from child loss doesn't look like healing from an injury. Our children were not a broken bone, they are a piece of our hearts, and now a piece of our hearts is gone.\"\n\nWATCH: To the mother with an aching heart, on Mother's Day\n\nBehrndt teamed up with other mothers who've experienced child loss and pregnancy loss to make a video with TODAY that reflects the experience of Mother's Day for bereaved parents. In vignettes from daily life that show women both grieving their losses and coming together to comfort one another, they aimed to show the power of acknowledging child loss — and to spread the message that Mother's Day is for everyone.\n\n\"Maybe you only knew their heartbeat. Maybe you held them in your arms,\" Behrndt says in the video. \"Maybe it happened yesterday, or 30 years ago. We know you don't forget. We want you to know that neither do we. We see your pain, and we see your tremendous, unbreakable, never-ending love.\"",
      "FOUL FIGURES\n\nBhubaneswar, Jan. 25: The number of murders and rape cases has gone up and the city police chief says the figures may rise further with the present generation hooked to communication technology.\n\n\"The society is transforming rapidly with communication technology and social media bringing members of opposite sexes close. Most of the registered rape cases in the city followed elopement and illegitimate relationships,\" R.P. Sharma said while addressing his last news conference as the police commissioner here today.\n\nSharma's reasoning for the rise in the number of rapes in Bhubaneswar has left many surprised.\n\nHowever, in the course of his interaction, he had some words of assurance for the residents.\n\n\"We are here to help the citizens, not to frighten them. I, along with my officials, have taken several people-friendly measures and hope the trend will continue. I urge the citizens to co-operate with us in tackling crime,\" said Sharma.\n\nDespite putting the blame on increasing use of technology to communicate, Sharma said his team was taking all possible measures to curb crimes in the twin cities.\n\nWhile Sharma saw increased use of tech behind the spurt in rape cases, women in Bhubaneswar reaped the benefit of an android application launched by the police.\n\nNearly 2,100 women used the android application Mo Sathi to lodge complaints with the police.\n\nThe figures reveal that other innovative measures introduced by the police for women's safety have failed to yield the desired results.\n\nThe police in Bhubaneswar have received 358 complaints of domestic violence through Madhyam, which is a women's support cell of the police.\n\nThe review by Sharma, however, showed that Cuttack was placed a shade better than Bhubaneswar when it came to incidents of crime.\n\nThe figures released today revealed that Bhubaneswar recorded 44 murder and 87 rape cases in 2015 as compared to 42 and 72, respectively, the previous year.\n\nCuttack, on the other hand, fared better in 2015 with the city recording 22 murders and 42 rape cases against 36 and 66, respectively, in 2014.\n\nTwo cases of gang-rape were recorded in Bhubaneswar in 2015, but Cuttack had a clean slate. The police also busted 21 sex rackets in the state capital last year and rescued 34 women and arrested 75 people.\n\nThe twin cities have also recorded a rise in cases of theft, swindling and riots last year. The police have recorded 1,788 cases of theft in 2015 as compared to 1,432 in 2014. Similarly, 622 cases of swindling and 107 cases of riots were reported last year while the corresponding figures for 2014 were 394 and 90, respectively.\n\nSharma, however, had more assuring words for senior citizens. He said the senior citizen's cell was activated and it had 4,084 registered members.\n\nSharma said his tenure had been challenging and the arrest of a terrorist from Jagatpur and tackling organised crimes in Cuttack and Bhubaneswar were its high points.\n\nSharma will be taking charge as special director-general of state vigilance.",

      "Featured image: The Barro Blanco Dam will have a disastrous effect on Ngäbe communities inside the Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle and campesino communities also living on the banks of the river. Photo Oscar Sogandares\n\nBy Jennifer Kennedy/ Intercontinental Cry\n\nNgäbe communities in western Panama are calling for support from the international community after officials from the Honduran-owned energy company, GENISA, warn that they will soon be evicted from their homes to make way for the flooding of the Barro Blanco hydro dam reservoir.\n\nRicardo Miranda, a spokesperson from the Movimiento 10 De Abril (M10) resistance movement, told IC, \"The situation for the Ngäbe people is critical and tense with the imminent closure of the Barro Blanco gates. The government has announced that the gates will be closed in April and before that people will be evicted.\"\n\nThe 28.84 megawatt dam is being constructed by GENISA on the Tabasará River in the western province of Chiriquí. Although located in Chiriquí, the dam will have a disastrous impact on Ngäbe communities inside the Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle and campesino communities also living on the banks of the river.\n\nOnce the gates are closed and the reservoir is filled, the subsistence fishing practices of all nearby communities will take a severe hit; cultivable land will be irrecoverably lost and the Ngäbe themselves will lose their school, their cultural centre and two sets of ancient petroglyphs that are of considerable cultural and archaeological importance.\n\nBefore this happens, Ngäbe-Bugle and campesino communities in the impact area will be forced from their homes.\n\nGENISA officials have reportedly claimed that the dam's reservoir will be filled on April 15.\n\nM10 has been fighting relentlessly to halt the project since the movement was founded in 1999, when a group of Ngäbe protesters were arrested for opposing the dam. Working along side them is Movimiento De Septiembre 22 (M22), an independent Ngäbe movement whose members follow Mama Tata, a religion that's centered on cultural revival. M22 made international headlines in 2015 when they blocked the entrance to the dam for 38 consecutive days, until riot police, claiming to act in self-defense, unleashed pepper spray and batons on the Ngäbe activists, women and children among them.\n\nSilvia Carrera, chief of the Comarca Ngäbe-Bugle, who is currently in negotiations with the government, was initially supportive of M10 and M22's resounding calls to cancel the project. However, Carrera changed her position after the July crackdown, signing a document with the government in favour of the project.\n\nUnder that document, the dam is forbidden to proceed until an agreement is reached with the region's indigenous and campesino stakeholders. Unfortunately, this provision appears to have slipped off the table. Flood tests are now taking place and according to the international NGO Carbon Market Watch (CMW), there remains a worrying lack of requisite dialogue between the government and the communities affected by the hydro dam.\n\nGENISA itself has never sought the free, informed, and prior consent (FPIC) of the indigenous communities living on the banks of the Tabasará river.\n\nMiranda says affected communities are as adamant as ever that the project be stopped. Together, they are urgently calling on the international community for support.\n\n\"We are asking for international solidarity in the struggle for water and the Tabasará River. We are asking people to demand the definitive cancellation of Barro Blanco and to demand an end to the violence against the Ngäbe which is being inflicted by the project,\" he said.\n\nGENISA isn't the only one that's failing to live up to stakeholder expectations.\n\nThe US$78M project, registered under the United Nation's CDM carbon offsetting mechanism, has received significant financing from The Netherlands Development Finance Company (FMO), The German Investment & Development Company (DEG) and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CBIE).\n\nThe FMO and DEG previously admitted to failing their own due diligence tests during the course of financing. A report published in May 2015 by FMO's internal Independent Complaints Mechanism (ICM) states, \"Lenders should have sought greater clarity on whether there was consent to the project from the appropriate indigenous authorities prior to project approval.\"\n\nIn June 2015, however, the lenders took things one step further by threatening the Panamanian government when it temporarily suspended Barro Blanco's construction.\n\nDenouncing the developments banks, Miranda told IC that \"the FMO and DEG are complicit in the serious violations of human rights on the Tabasará River.\"",

      "Welcome to another mobyaffiliates app marketing guide. Today we're going to take a thorough look at cross app promotion networks, covering cost per install (CPI), incentivised networks and cross exchanges. Over the last few months, cross promotion networks such as Chartboost, AppFlood and TapJoy have been making some big waves. Earlier in the year Chartboost secured $19 million in new funding and announced it now reaches 300 million monthly active devices. We've also seen TapJoy moving into non-gaming genres and bolster its consulting efforts with developers, while Papaya's AppFlood platform, which is already driving around 4,000 to 7,000 installs per app per day, is tapping into the potentially lucrative Chinese market.\n\nA picture is starting to emerge of the app promotion space and it looks highly likely to be dominated by cross exchanges and CPI. Developers are gagging for more affordable and less risky avenues to gain users. The more traditional networks operating on CPC and CPM may find themselves playing a serious game of catch-up. But we're getting ahead of ourselves. What exactly are cross promotion networks? How do they work? What are the drawbacks? In this guide we'll attempt to answer these questions and more. We've also got interviews with all the major platforms, as well as a handy directory of cross promo networks for you to check out.\n\nFor more on mobile app promotion check out our Mobile App Marketing Directory\n\n———————————————————————————–\n\nContents:\n\n1. What are cross promotion networks?\n\n2. Key stats\n\n3. The benefits of using cross promotion networks\n\n4. What's the catch?\n\n5. Cross promotion networks: Ask the experts Q&A\n\n6. Directory of cross promotion networks\n\n———————————————————————————–\n\nWhat are cross promotion networks?\n\nYou're probably wondering what exactly we mean by a 'cross promotion network.' There are a few different types and they can differ quite significantly in terms of what they offer developers.\n\nDirect cross promotion exchanges\n\nDirect cross promotion is used by a number of networks. The idea is pretty simple, the network allows two apps to exclusively show each others' ads to their users. Everytime you generate an install for your partners app, you're allowed to receive an install in return. In the case of Chartboost, which is probably the most popular direct cross promotion network up and running, they leave the specifics entirely-up to the developer. So the devs can figure out how many users they will provide for each other and at what cost (if any). Usually direct cross promotion is free for developers, with the network making money by selling a portion of the traffic.\n\nDirect promotion networks are great if you're looking for complete transparency and control when it comes to your campaign. However, negotiating with other developers and ensuring that your both getting a fair trade of users can be time consuming. Also these types of networks typically throttle the number of times your ad can be show in a given day. If you want to get more frequency then you usually have to pay.\n\nApp network exchanges\n\nA number of networks, such as Tap for Tap and Taptica, use a credit system to power install exchanges. Whenever your app generates an install for someone else, you earn a credit. This credit is then spent on the network, allowing one of your ads to generate a download for your app. The big difference between this system and direct cross promotion above, is that you don't have as much control over where your ad is appearing, but you don't have to spend time negotiating with developers, and you get a much more varied selection of ads.\n\nTap for Tap told us it matches up ads based on a number for factors, such as category, app rating and reviews. Tap for Tap also says there's no hard cap on the number of times your ad is shown. Some platforms integrate their exchange solution with a monetisation solution, which serves revenue-based CPC, CPM, ads. Developers can then mix and choose the percentage of ads shown that will generate them exchange credits, and the ads shown that will generate them revenue.\n\nAppFlood network exchange\n\nSlightly different to credit exchanges is AppFlood's network, which pays much more attention to the value of users and installs. Developers don't need to strike-up direct deals with each other, but are matched automatically and there's no throttling of installs per day. The biggest difference is how AppFlood assigns values to installs, for instance an install coming from India or China might be worth $0.20, while an install from the US is worth $1. So if a developer provides 5 Indian installs, they'll get 1 North American install back. Other than this, AppFlood is pretty much the same as the credit exchanges.\n\nInternal cross promotion\n\n\nMany cross promotion networks also allow you to cross promote within your own apps and most won't charge for this service.

      "More than a year after Portland Police Chief Mike Reese fired Officer Ronald Frashour for his fatal shooting of an unarmed black man and found the officer violated bureau policy, at least 11 bureau training instructors argue the chief was wrong.\n\nIn fact, Portland Officer Tracy Chamberlain, a lead patrol tactics instructor, was ready to testify this month in a federal case brought by Aaron Campbell's family that any Portland officer would have acted as Frashour did, court documents show.\n\nCampbell's family agreed to settle their federal wrongful death suit against the city last week for $1.2 million, so the training instructors never took the stand. But Tom Steenson, attorney for the family, urged Mayor Sam Adams and the chief to address the disconnect between what they say is police bureau policy and what is being taught to the rank and file.\"I think that the command structure and the commissioner in charge and the mayor have never seriously looked at the training on the use of force,\" Steenson said, \"and when they finally decide to discipline somebody for use of force, they got the training thrown back in their face. It's not new training, but the training they've been given forever.\"The police union has challenged Frashour's firing before a state arbitrator. The challenge largely rests on the testimony of the same bureau instructors who say Frashour followed his training and they were never consulted before his termination. An arbitrator has not issued a ruling. As of Feb. 4, the city has spent $434,514 for outside counsel to defend the firing.\n\nReese and Adams declined comment Tuesday, citing the ongoing arbitration. Reese, though, has previously defended his decision and the training division's review.\n\nIn late November 2010, Reese said then-training Lt. Robert King and Lt. Dave Virtue had thoroughly reviewed police reports and consulted outside experts. \"Is everyone on board? No. But I believe it was the right decision; otherwise I wouldn't have made it,\" Reese said.\n\nOn Jan. 29, 2010, Campbell, 25, distraught and suicidal over his brother's death that day, emerged from a Northeast Portland apartment, with his back toward officers and his hands behind his head. Officer Ryan Lewton, who said he was trying to get Campbell to put his hands in the air, fired six bean bag rounds at him. Frashour fired a single shot from his AR-15 rifle at Campbell, striking the unarmed man in the back.\n\nThe chief found it was unreasonable for Frashour to believe that Campbell posed an \"immediate threat\" of death or serious injury. He found Frashour seemed to only focus on his AR-15 rifle without noticing what was going on around him, and refused to acknowledge that the six beanbag rounds that struck Campbell before the fatal shot could have caused a pain reaction, such as running away. The chief found Frashour never considered the possibility that Campbell was unarmed.\n\nAccording to court documents, 11 Portland police training instructors, and retired Portland Officer Mike Stradley, who was Frashour's field training officer, were ready to testify otherwise. All are, or have been, members of the same union fighting Frashour's firing, the Portland Police Association.\n\nOfficer Nathan Voeller, a lead defensive tactics instructor, was ready to testify that Portland officers are trained that they're not required to see a gun before using lethal force if the officer believes the suspect poses an immediate risk of death or serious injury. \"They are trained they need to be preemptive,\" Voeller was to testify, according to a trial memorandum filed by Frashour's lawyer.\n\nAccording to the document, Portland police are taught that if they wait to see a person pull or point a firearm, they won't be able to react fast enough before the suspect fires.\n\nChamberlain planned to testify that Campbell did not react to Lewton's beanbag shots in a \"typical fashion,\" and \"that moving his hands towards or into his waistband while running towards hard cover (a car) was indicative of the intent to pull a handgun.\"\n\nOfficer Ryan Coffey, the bureau's lead defensive tactics instructor, was to testify Portland police are taught not to allow potentially armed suspects to \"secure hard cover,\" the document said. Further, police are taught that suicidal people are \"frequently homicidal,\" the instructors were to testify. Former defensive tactics instructor Todd Engstrom was to point out that Frashour's sole focus as the officer with an AR-15 rifle was to provide \"lethal cover.\"\n\nCoffey had objected to the bureau's findings in a meeting with then-training Lt. Robert King, before the chief fired Frashour.\n\n\"He (Coffey) will describe the comments of multiple defensive tactics instructors expressing disagreement at that meeting and Lt. King's response, which included that his final evaluation had to take into account the political ramifications of a Portland police officer shooting an African American in the back who turned out",
      "advertisement Liliane asked: How do I clean a very dirty white roller blind? The blind is made of stiffened white cotton and has been up for a long time. Stains include general dust, dirt and squashed insects. Ewww!\n\nRoller blinds offer simple, elegant window coverings that fit in with nearly every décor. Cleaning methods depend largely on the material that the roller blinds are made of. If the material can be submerged in water, then follow the simple cleaning procedures below. If they are made from a material that cannot become saturated with water, then spot cleaning will be the only safe cleaning option.\n\nWashing the Blinds\n\nYou Will Need:\n\nMild laundry detergent\n\nBleach (optional)\n\nSponge or soft cloths\n\nOld toothbrush\n\nVacuum with brush attachment\n\nDrying rack or outside clothesline\n\nBath tub\n\nWarm water\n\nFriend to help (optional)\n\nSteps to Clean the Blinds:\n\nRemove the blinds from the roller if possible and carefully lay them flat on the floor. If you cannot remove them from the roller, it would be best to spot clean them as washing could loosen the glue that is holding the blind onto the roller; use the section below for spot cleaning instead. If the blinds are especially dirty, it will be best to begin with a thorough vacuuming to remove the surface dirt. Use the brush attachment on the vacuum to gently brush over the surface and vacuum away any loose dirt, dead bugs, etc. Next, fill the bathtub about half full of warm water. (If your blinds are too large for the bathtub, see the additional tips section.) Add some laundry detergent to the water and mix together until a few suds begin to form on the surface. If the blinds are white, a small amount of bleach can be added to the water as well. Next, carefully lay the blinds in the tub. If the blinds are long, it is okay to loosely layer them in an accordion fashion. Allow them to soak in the soapy water for a couple of hours. Next, start at one end of the blinds and gently wipe them back and forth with a soft cloth or sponge. This will help remove any remaining dirt and/or stains. For tough stains, scrub them gently with an old toothbrush. Drain the sudsy water from the tub. Fill with clean water and rinse the blinds. Repeat until all of the soap is removed. If soap residue remains on the blinds, it will act as a magnet quickly collecting dirt and dust. If a partner is available to assist, the blinds can be held up and rinsed with a shower sprayer for quicker soap removal. Lay the blinds over a drying rack, shower rod, or outside on a clothesline until they are completely dried. It can help to point a fan on the blinds if indoors to speed drying time and prevent water stains. Attach them back onto the roller and reinstall them over the window.\n\nSpot Cleaning the Blinds\n\nYou Will Need:\n\nA vacuum\n\nPost-It notes\n\nWhite foam shaving cream or upholstery foam\n\nA scrub brush\n\nTwo cloths\n\nWater\n\nA fan or hair dryer\n\nSteps to Clean the Blinds:\n\nIf the material is glued onto the roller then the blinds must be cleaned while hanging. Use these tips to keep them looking great. Inspect the blinds for any stains or dirt spots. You can mark the spots with a Post-It note as you inspect. If the blinds are dusty or generally dirty, begin by vacuuming them with the upholstery brush attachment. Always brush with the grain of the blinds if they have one (usually side-to-side). Clean the stains or dirt spots with some white foam shaving cream or with an upholstery foam cleaner by applying the foam on the dirty spot and scrubbing it gently with a soft scrub brush like an old toothbrush or nail brush. Wipe off any excess foam, then blot with a damp cloth to rinse. The blotting is not strictly necessary, however, when there is a residue from a cleaner that remains on a surface it will often attract dirt, quickly leading to stains once again. If the blinds are dirty all over, you can use the foam all over them. Use a larger brush to save time, such as an old soft-bristled dish brush. Work in small sections, scrubbing the foam in, wiping off the foam with a cloth, then blotting the area with a damp cloth to rinse. Again, the blotting is not strictly necessary, but will help to keep the blinds clean for longer. Open the windows and/or point a fan on the area to speed drying time, which will help to prevent water stains. Drying the blinds",

      "Education Science Biology The Human Digestion Process (or, What Happens after You Eat Food)\n\nThe Human Digestion Process (or, What Happens after You Eat Food) Related Book Heartburn and Reflux For Dummies\n\nBy Carol Ann Rinzler, Ken DeVault\n\nDigestion is the process of changing food into a form that the body can absorb and use as energy or as the raw materials to repair and build new tissue. Digesting food is a two-part process that's half mechanical, half chemical.\n\nMechanical digestion begins in your mouth as your teeth tear and grind food into small bits and pieces you can swallow without choking. The muscular walls of your esophagus, stomach, and intestines continue mechanical digestion, pushing the food along, churning and breaking it into smaller particles.\n\nChemical digestion occurs at every point in the digestive system, beginning when you see or smell food. These sensory events set off nerve impulses from your eyes and nose that trigger the release of enzymes and other substances that will eventually break down food to release the nutrients inside. The body then burns these nutrients for energy or uses them to build new tissues and body parts.\n\nHow sight and smell relate to digestion\n\nAt first glance — or sniff — the digestive link between your eyes, nose, and stomach sounds a tad weird. But think about it: How many times has the sight or scent of something yummy like a simmering stew or baking bread set your tummy rumbling?\n\nThe sight of an appetizing dish or the aroma (actually scent molecules bouncing against the nasal tissues) sends signals to your brain: \"Good stuff on the way.\" As a result, your brain — the quintessential message center — shoots out impulses that\n\nMake your mouth water.\n\nMake your stomach contract (hunger pangs).\n\nMake intestinal glands start leaking digestive chemicals.\n\nAll that from a little look and sniff. Imagine what happens when you actually take a bite!\n\nTasting and chewing in the digestion process\n\nYou know that small bag of potato chips you have stashed way at the back of your desk drawer? Well, dig it out and take a chip.\n\nAs the chip hits your tongue, your mouth acts as though someone had thrown the \"on\" switch in a fun house.\n\nYour teeth chew, breaking the chip into small manageable pieces.\n\nYour salivary glands release a watery liquid (saliva) to compact the chip into a mushy bundle (a bolus in digestive-geek speak) that can slide easily down your throat on a stream of saliva.\n\nEnzymes (which you can think of as digestive catalysts in this case) in the saliva begin to digest carbohydrates in the chip.\n\nYour tongue lifts to push the whole ball of wax . . . no, bolus, back toward the pharynx, the opening from your mouth to your esophagus, and then through a muscular valve called the upper esophageal sphincter, which opens to allow the food through. In other words, you're about to swallow.\n\nSwallowing food: The slide from esophagus to stomach\n\nIf you think about it, the human digestive system is a wonder. As food enters the esophagus, your salivary glands release a rush of saliva to help food slide more easily down the tube. Then your esophageal muscles swing into action.\n\nLike the rest of your digestive tract, your esophagus is ringed with muscles that contract to produce wavelike motions — which you can refer to as peristalsis or (no surprise here) peristaltic contractions, if you're so inclined — pushing food down toward your stomach.\n\nAt the bottom of the esophagus — an area known as the gastroesophageal junction — a muscular valve called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) opens to allow food through. Then the LES closes to prevent reflux, the flow of stomach contents back into the esophagus. A malfunctioning LES is public enemy No. 1 in the reflux world.\n\nDigesting food in the stomach\n\nPoint to your stomach. Go ahead. Don't be shy. Odds are your finger is aimed somewhere around your belly button, an interesting site to be sure, but definitely not your stomach. Your stomach, a wide, pouchy part of the digestive tube, is located on the left side of your body above your waist and behind your ribs.\n\nLike the walls of your esophagus, the walls of your stomach are strong and muscular. They contract with enough force to break food into ever smaller pieces as glands in the stomach walls release stomach juices — a highly technical term for a highly acidic blend of enzymes, hydrochloric acid (HCl), and mucus. The stomach juices begin the digestion of proteins and",

      "This is a rush transcript. Copy may not be in its final form.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Egypt has declared three days of national mourning after at least 300 people were killed in an attack on a crowded Sufi mosque in Egypt's Sinai Peninsula Friday. Egyptian officials are calling it the deadliest terror attack in Egypt's modern history. More than two dozen attackers wearing military combat uniforms detonated a bomb inside the mosque, opened fire with machine guns on fleeing worshipers, set cars ablaze to stop people from being able to escape. Among the victims were at least 27 children. Officials are blaming the attack on a militant group linked to ISIS. This is Mohamed Abdel Fattah, the imam of the al-Rawdah Sufi mosque, describing Friday's attack.\n\nMOHAMED ABDEL FATTAH: [translated] About two minutes after I climbed onto the platform, I heard what sounded like an explosion outside the mosque, and then some people came inside firing at all the worshipers. Of course, as soon as people heard the firing, they all started to run. Some people climbed onto the platform. I saw them piled on top of each other. And they, the assailants, were hitting anybody and everybody, anybody who was breathing. I didn't see their numbers. I didn't see what they looked like. I could only feel their presence inside the mosque.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: Over the last year, ISIS-linked militants in Egypt have also repeatedly targeted Coptic Christians, bombing two Coptic churches and opening fire on a bus headed to a monastery. Within hours after Friday's attack, the Egyptian president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, appeared on television, vowing revenge for the attack. Only minutes later, Egyptian warplanes carried out multiple airstrikes in the desert of the Sinai Peninsula. The military says they were targeting militants fleeing the attack.\n\nPRESIDENT ABDEL FATTAH EL-SISI: [translated] The military and police will return security and stability with absolute power in the coming short period of time. This is our retaliation. We will respond to this attack with brutal strength to encounter these terrorist extremists, the takfiris.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: For more, we go to Cairo, where we're joined by Democracy Now! correspondent Sharif Abdel Kouddous.\n\nSharif, welcome back to Democracy Now! Can you lay out for us what you understand happened on Friday and what has been the response since?\n\nSHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Well, it's as you described it. About 25 to 30 militants arrived as the sermon, the Friday prayer, was taking place. They arrived in five four-wheel-drive vehicles, positioned themselves outside the main door and the 12 windows of the mosque, and set off explosives in the mosque and then began opening fire on the worshipers who were trying to flee. They torched several cars outside to prevent people from escaping. They fired on ambulances that had arrived on the scene. And we have this horrific death toll of 305 people killed.\n\nSo this is a very, very highly coordinated attack. All indications point to the Islamic State affiliate in Sinai as being responsible for this, although there hasn't been an official claim of responsibility. And it looks like there are largely two reasons why this mosque was targeted. One is, in the past year, as the Islamic State has targeted Sufis in the area, most notably killing a leading Sufi religious scholar, beheading him and posting pictures of it online. There was an ISIS commander also who singled out that area of Sinai as being one of the places where Sufis live, that the group wanted to or intended to eradicate.\n\nAnd there have been reports—several reports have come out now that militants have stormed the village several times, as recently as last week, warning the residents not to allow Sufi rituals to take place there, but also not to coordinate with the police and the army. The tribe from that area, the Sawarka, are in conflict with the Islamic State. So that also looks like it was a main motivating factor for them to attack this area.\n\nAnd with all these threats that have been made against this village, the residents themselves had reportedly set up their own civilian checkpoints to try and protect themselves. And even so, this attack seems to have taken place with relative ease by the militants, and we have this very bloody death toll. And this is a village of only 2,500 people, so you're talking about nearly one in 10 people from this village, from this community, being killed. And there are reports now they're being buried in mass graves.\n\nAMY GOODMAN: The media often refers to Sufism, Sharif, as a sect, a minority group. Can you talk to us about this religious group?\n\nSHARIF ABDEL KOUDDOUS: Right. I mean, you shouldn't even really say a Sufi mosque. I mean",

The move benefitted providers of debit/credit cards and electronic payment services, and fixers and operators, while frittering the time and the savings of an incomparably greater number of people and businesses.

We had not expected the company to need fresh capital, at least for a while; despite some inventory buildup, operating cashflows are strong, and capital discipline had been promised. There may be a case for deleveraging, but it has not yet been set out with appropriate clarity. If an equity issue is required at all, we believe that it should be by way of transferable rights. The placement is now apparently envisaged at a 10-15% discount to the local price, representing a much greater discount to the foreign price (there is a 49% foreign ownership limit, and 2016 transactions between foreign investors occurred at a significant premium). Investors have been invited to express their views directly to the company, to vote in a ballot to approve the placement, and to propose new directors following the departure of the two board members from the financial industry. Communications have been extraordinarily confused¹. We urge all investors to write to the company directly, as well as ensuring that they vote in the ballot.

Vard's recent orders include fishing boats, ferries, cruise liners, and the design part of the largest ever ship order for the US Coast Guard - which suggests new possibilities in the defence sector, not just keeping the yards occupied. On the share offer, however, our interests diverge. Fincantieri has averaged down successfully, increasing its stake to 73%.

      "The other night, the American Cancer Society put out yet another note on their Facebook page trying to defend their actions in rejecting an atheist National Team.\n\nIt's full of lies.\n\nFirst, their message:\n\nWe want to apologize to all those who come to our Facebook community to either support the American Cancer Society or be supported by it. Because we respect and value the voice of our community, we have tried various methods of dealing with the current situation involving the Foundation Beyond Belief, responding in a measured way and only removing hateful and egregious posts. In addition, we want to make sure we are absolutely clear with respect to the facts. We have seen profane hyperbole and personal attacks on members of this community that only serve to disrupt the American Cancer Society's ability to serve cancer patients and their families. At this point, our ability to deliver on our life saving mission has clearly been impacted. We need to get back to work. These are the facts: In recent weeks, supporters of the Foundation Beyond Belief have used the American Cancer Society community on Facebook to post misinformation, saying the Society turned down half a million dollars and is discriminating against atheists. These statements are false. Todd Stiefel, a humanist philanthropist and supporter of Foundation Beyond Belief, approached Relay For Life representatives and offered a matching gift of $250,000 if Foundation Beyond Belief teams raised $250,000 in 2012. The matching gift offer from Mr. Stiefel was contingent on his and the Foundation Beyond Belief's request to become a Relay For Life National Team Partner. However, beginning with this fiscal year, ACS discontinued Relay's National Team Partner program for clubs and organizations while National Teams focused around commercial organizations remain. Mr. Stiefel and the Foundation Beyond Belief have not told us if they are willing to consider working with the Society in any manner other than as a National Team Partner. We think this is terribly unfortunate and wish the Foundation Beyond Belief would reconsider making its recognition as National Team Partner a condition for its support. We do not take lightly an offered donation of a half million dollars, and we remain committed to discussing with the Foundation Beyond Belief ways in which we can work together, encouraging the group's participation in Relay For Life and in the Society's mission to save more lives from cancer. After reviewing the situation, it is clear that we have made mistakes. We did not communicate effectively about the rationale behind our decision not to allow the Foundation Beyond Belief to participate as a National Team Partner. And we used our own organizational terminology in public communications to differentiate between commercial teams and teams formed by clubs and organizations, calling them \"corporate\" and \"non-corporate\" teams. Unfortunately, that lack of clarity created misunderstanding and confusion. To be clear: we ended the National Team Partner program for clubs and organizations, many of which were incorporated, earlier this year; the National Team Program for commercial entities –primarily businesses and corporations with large employee bases– remains. Going forward, we intend to make the distinction much clearer in our communications. The National Team Partner program will now be implemented in a way that more clearly outlines the requirements for participation. Perhaps just as importantly, those requirements will be more clearly communicated on our Relay For Life website and elsewhere. You can find information about our National Team Partner program here: http://www.relayforlife.org/learn/nationalteamprogram/index We acknowledge our mistakes, and we appreciate your patience and understanding as we have worked to resolve them. We appreciate our many loyal volunteers who believe that the Society and its Relay For Life program would never discriminate against any group committed to participating in our mission to save lives from cancer. It is our deepest desire to get back to business as normal so that we can focus on serving cancer patients and their loved ones, and the millions of individuals who want cancer information and who are passionate about engaging in our mission.

      "It's been a few years since the original development and management team behind Sibelius found themselves unemployed at the company they started, following a restructuring by owner Avid. Since then, Sibelius has continued to progress, but in a way that's best described as incremental. It's now a subscription product with an emphasis on the cloud, like other Avid tools, and updates have focused on features like pen support and small notation details. If you're happy with Sibelius, that's not a bad thing: it's the recipient of a steady stream of updates.\n\nBut what if there were to be something new in music notation software?\n\nMuch of the team behind Sibelius migrated to a new home – and a new patron. Steinberg, makers of Cubase and Nuendo, set up an R&D center in London, aiming in their words \"to develop next-generation professional scoring software for composers, arrangers, engravers, copyists and educators.\" Dan Spreadbury, who many of us knew from his Sibelius days, took on a Steinberg title and started blogging the new effort.\n\n\"Next-generation\" suggests something more than just incremental. But while Dan's blog has been very particular about details (more on that below), it's been pretty vague on the big picture – until now.\n\nToday, Steinberg is at last announcing what the team has been working on. It's called \"Dorico.\" And it's coming in the fourth quarter of this year.\n\nSo, what's \"next-generation\" about Dorico? We get some clues in the initial announcement.\n\nIt's important to remember that the original version of Sibelius was revolutionary – even if today there are several equivalent products with very similar feature sets. First available for the little-known Acorn workstation platform, Sibelius was ground-breaking in that it could instantly reflow enormous scores when changed. Entry was for the first time as quick as touch-typing, thanks to a clever set of keyboard shortcuts organized around the numeric keypad (something you can now ape in Finale). And its scores, while not quite up to the level of some dedicated engraving tools, also looked really good.\n\nBut that was a long time ago.\n\nThe new Dorico would seem to carry some of the philosophy of the original Sibelius, but re-conceived.\n\nSo, Steinberg promises high performance, smooth workflow, and an easy one-window interface.\n\nBut there's something different, too. You can now work, at last, in open meters or freely rebar existing music. That's something die-hard engravers have had in tools like the (non-GUI) SCORE, but not in mainstream tools.\n\nWhat the heck am I saying? Well, think about the ability to work with notes as easily as you can with characters in a word processor. Insert music within an existing passage – without having to move everything around by bar and make space first. Change the durations of existing notes.\n\nSteinberg also promises the ability to make different score layouts with independent page and staff size.\n\nThese are the things that muck up most notation tools. Changing layout, changing duration, or changing musical ideas often involves manual labor. (Sorry, uh – for the London R&D team, without manual labour.)\n\nSibelius also was the first major tool to push playback as a central feature and a leader in bundling instruments. True to that idea, and pairing with their new friends at Steinberg, Dorico ships out of the box with a bunch of VSTs, including HALion Sonic SE and the HALion Symphonic Orchestra library.\n\nThat's a big deal, too – these days, you're often expected to demo playback before you get to rent an orchestra to play, especially if you're working in film and TV.\n\nWe'll of course need to see the full notation product to make a good evaluation. But some of the specs are at least suggestive; I'll just quote directly here. New engraving output alone is something we'll have to see, but interesting. (Generally, that involves both typeface design and an underlying engine to treat that, which is one of the many reasons notation software is hard to do well.)\n\n• Next-generation 64-bit scoring software for OS X and Windows, designed by musicians for musicians\n\n• Beautiful engraved output with unrivaled attention to detail\n\n• Flexible note input and powerful editing, including ability to insert and change duration of existing notes\n\nThis is promising too:\n\n• Superior note spacing with optical kerning of adjacent elements, with tighter default spacing and no rhythmic distortion\n\nApart from the ability to freely treat rhythm, Dorico finally promises to solve the clumsy ways different sections and parts and so on are handled:\n\n• Powerful score management features",

      "The topic of Bitcoin taxation has always been a topic of substantial debate. After all, many people feel they don't owe the IRS any taxes as far as cryptocurrency is concerned. Although the opinions may differ in this regard, the government agency isn't backing down. In fact, tax experts claim the institution may make Bitcoin Cash taxable as well in the future. The tax rates have yet to be determined, but can be as high as nearly 40%. That would set a very dangerous and annoying precedent, to say the least.\n\nWith the Bitcoin \"fork\" taking place a while ago, most BTC holders received free Bitcoin Cash tokens. Considering how these BCH tokens now have a value, they can be labeled as income. More specifically, it is an income stemming forth from cryptocurrency and is thus a capital gain. Right now, capital gains are taxable under IRS guidelines, even for currencies such as Bitcoin. This creates a very uneasy situation, to say the least. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as getting \"free money\" in the United States and not paying any taxes on it whatsoever. So far, there is no official regulation regarding Bitcoin Cash, but that situation may change soon.\n\nThe IRS is Aware of the Bitcoin Cash Airdrop\n\nMore specifically, the Wall Street Journal claims big changes are coming. The IRS may effectively make BCH income taxable. Additionally, all US-based Bitcoin holders should effectively report the receipt of BCH on their 2017 income tax returns. It would make a lot of sense for the institution to make this income taxable outright, though. Albeit this is a one-off \"freebie\", it effectively gives all Bitcoin owners more value out of thin air. In a way, making this income subject to taxation would somewhat legalize Bitcoin Cash in the US as well. It is doubtful many people will see it that way, though.\n\nThe bigger question is how users would have to pay to the IRS. Right now, there are no guidelines or calculation one can take into account. Deloitte's Jim Calvin thinks the outcome wouldn't be all that fun by any means. Some recipients may pay a tax rate of 39.6% on their free coins, which can add up to substantial amounts. Especially larger BCH holders won't be too pleased with that outcome, assuming things will get that far. There's also the net investment income tax to keep in mind. Bitcoin Cash certainly keeps stirring the pot, although not necessarily for the right reasons.\n\nIt is important to keep in mind the IRS has no official BCH plans right now. However, the government agency is well aware of what is going on in the Bitcoin world. Any \"airdrop\" of currencies given to Bitcoin holders will be on their radar. This may also affect income tax for Stellar Lumens or Byteball, by the look of things. Neither of these currencies is on the agency's radar right now, though. The coming months will get pretty interesting for US-based Bitcoin Cash holders. An official taxation guideline would certainly shake things up quite a bit.\n\nHeader image courtesy of Shutterstock",

      "WASHINGTON, D.C. – It's Saturday night at Verizon Center and Shea Weber is bummed. Between untimely injuries and unfortunate matchups, the season was lost. No regrets to reconcile, really. Only bad breaks. \"You know who killed me?\" Weber laments. \"I played against Le'Veon Bell in the first round and he had, like, 50 points. Julio Jones got hurt for me too. I had a good team. Finished third. Just tough.\"\n\nTo be clear, little about the defenseman's daytime gig has brought disappointment. Fantasy football was a drag in the end—three playoff appearances, three first-round exits—but real hockey has been fun. Of course there had been initial anxiety after Montreal dealt P.K. Subban for him June 29, though less about his new team specifically than the cold reality of joining one altogether. He was Nashville's bedrock over 11 seasons, the last six while wearing the captain's C, the last four while signed to a whopping deal that extends until 2026 and expires a month before Weber turns 41. \"I'd been there so long with some guys, they become almost like family,\" he says now, wearing a flat-brimmed Canadiens hat after their 2-1 win over Washington, which kept them atop the Atlantic Division. \"I wasn't sure what to expect here, but it's been really good so far.\"\n\nSome three months ago, SI met Weber in Ottawa at Team Canada's training camp for the 2016 World Cup of Hockey. Understandably, he wasn't eager to reflect on the trade, wounds still fresh and surprise still apparent. But then he looked across the locker room, at the doublewide stalls in the corner. Habs goalie Carey Price, over there, had phoned Weber the day it happened. So did forwards Brendan Gallagher, Max Pacioretty and Andrew Shaw. Their collective excitement put Weber at ease, soothing any feeling that Nashville had ditched him for a younger, sleeker model. Plus, he said unprompted, \"obviously playing fantasy with them is going to be a lot of fun. Going to give it to each other in the locker room throughout the year.\"\n\nSuch are the small pleasures Weber has found with the Canadiens, Le'Veon-induced playoff exit and current nine-game personal pointless streak notwithstanding. The Halloween party at a Montreal restaurant was fun, even if Weber didn't wear the mask of himself that the Canadiens were selling, and he's looking forward to the Christmas one coming up soon.\n\nOn a Sunday in early October, the night before Thanksgiving Day in Canada, Weber hosted team dinner. At his new house near the practice facility in Brossard, players and families watched football and gorged on desserts. (Did Weber bake? \"No chance. I can't cook.\") After his son and daughter—ages 2 and 1, respectively—began attending a bilingual daycare, he downloaded an app called Duolingo and now studies French daily, learning the language of the local Québécoises. \"They're going to speak French, so I better know what they're saying,\" he says.\n\nFor Weber, this all counts as an unusually dramatic life pivot. He grew up in blue-collar Sicamous, B.C., the son of a hairdresser and a sawmill worker. Back there, says Sabres defenseman and childhood friend Cody Franson, \"people appreciate that we don't change.\"\n\nThis ethos describes Weber well. He still prefers to avoid the spotlight; after Canada won the World Cup and his parents went to meet him at Air Canada Centre, he insisted on finding a private room to chat, so they could have some quiet. He also still leads by quiet example, speaking firmly but only when necessary. Avalanche forward Blake Comeau, an ex-teammate with the WHL's Kelowna Rockets, remembers a player once skipping school, which resulted in a team-wide power skate at practice. \"I remember Webs giving him the gears,\" Comeau says. \"Looking back on it now, I'm pretty sure the player who skipped school would never dream of doing that again.\"\n\nHe's also still freakishly strong for his age. \"My mom has this picture from when we were real young,\" Franson says. \"We were playing road hockey and the ball is just about to go down in the ditch, and you can tell Shea is sprinting to stop the ball before it stopped in the ditch. His front leg was planted to stop, and at 6 years old, the calf in this picture is in full flex and just huge.\" Tough, too. He retreated into the locker room after taking a second-period slap shot from Washington's Dmitry Orlov off his left leg, only to returned for the third.\n\n\"Unless that leg was broken, unless it was dangling there, he was going to play,\" says Capitals coach Barry Trotz, who had Weber for nine seasons in Nashville.",

      "Are Frequent Batch Auctions a Solution to HFT Latency Arbitrage?\n\nAs the frequency of my blog posts on these issues attest, I've been closely monitoring HFTs, dark pools, and market fragmentation. So when I attended the European Capital Markets Institute's Annual Conference in Brussels on 29 October, of particular interest to me was a presentation on frequent batch auctions. Eric Budish, associate professor of economics at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, presented this potential solution to HFT latency arbitrage. Previously in this blog, I have highlighted two other possible solutions — the IEX speed bump and information transmission zoning.\n\nThe main thrust of Budish's argument is that continuous time auctions will, by design, always afford the opportunity for latency arbitrage since someone must always be first to the top of the order book under continuous price-time priority. The phenomenon of HFT in this context is therefore not in any sense new or special or concerning; rather it is simply a rational response to existing market design.\n\nThe solution proposed is to eliminate this race entirely and have batch auctions with some high frequency, say once every 100 milliseconds. In this auction, the market would establish an equilibrium price that matches supply and demand, minimising the proportion of unfilled buy-and-sell orders. It would now no longer matter if an order reached the auction first or last, as long as it reached it during the 100-millisecond window — an eternity for computer networks.\n\nIt certainly sounded like a silver bullet to the problem of latency arbitrage, but Mark Hemsley, CEO of BATS Chi-X Europe, then took the opportunity to highlight some problems with implementing these frequent batch auctions. First, it is unclear how a discrete batch auction exchange would function alongside continuous time exchanges that would continue to co-exist, at least for some time. A second issue he raised is that it is not clear how a frequent batch auction equity exchange would interact with a derivatives exchange. In both cases, the problem for the batch auction model is that pre-trade transparent continuous-auction exchanges would be constantly updating prices in real time, providing true price discovery, which could complicate the discrete-time batch auction process.\n\nTo get around the asynchronicity of price discovery between exchanges, all exchanges would have to become frequent batch auctions and have the auctions perfectly synchronised for the discrete-time auction model to work, in its strictest interpretation. This would clearly be a regulatory headache, if technically relatively straightforward.\n\nBudish's rebuttal was that any frequent batch auction exchange would eliminate latency arbitrage on its exchange, while agreeing that latency arbitrage could continue on parallel continuous market exchanges. In this case, the proposal is similar to IEX's speed bump, which is designed to protect traders only on the IEX platform.\n\nInterestingly, there is a dark pool that operates as a frequent batch auction. The London Stock Exchange's Turquoise Midpoint Dark Pool has a service known as Uncross, which matches orders at the midpoint of the bid and offer with auctions held randomly every 5 to 10 seconds. This frequency is far lower than that suggested as being most likely by Budish during his keynote and is therefore designed mostly for long-term investors trading in large sizes.\n\nClearly, there is a lot going on in capital markets design and regulation, driven by these issues of fragmentation, HFT, and dark pools. However, a key point made by panelist Rhodri Preece, CFA, head of capital markets policy for the Europe, Middle East, and Africa (EMEA) region at CFA Institute, is that the profitability of HFTs has declined rapidly in recent years, most likely as a result of the physical limits of reducing latency being reached. The question was then raised — if these rents from latency arbitrage have been competed away by HFTs then why bother intervening just as the party is finishing?\n\nCFA Institute was an institutional sponsor of the conference.\n\nIf you liked this post, consider subscribing to Market Integrity Insights.\n\nPhoto credit: iStockphoto.com/eternalcreative\n\nShare On\n\nAbout the Author(s)",

      "Here, we report additional support for the extant distant planet hypothesis and narrow the range of its parameters and current location. We point out hitherto unnoticed peculiarities of the orbits of the eKBOs; we find that the orbital period ratios of these objects are close to integer ratios. Such ratios are not dynamically significant unless the eKBOs are in mean motion resonances (MMRs) with a massive planet. We identify an orbital period of the hypothetical planet (HP, henceforth) which is in simple integer ratios with the four most distant eKBOs. We show that the resonant dynamics provide constraints on the planet's orbital parameters and its mass and can also narrow the possible range of its current location in its orbital path.\n\nA natural hypothesis is that these objects' orbital dynamics were or are dominated by the gravitational perturbations of a planet in the heliocentric distance range of a few hundred au. Gladman & Chan ( 2006 ) hypothesized a \"rogue\" planet, a short-lived planet with a mass larger than an Earth-mass, to explain the eKBOs. Trujillo & Sheppard ( 2014 ) proposed an extant hypothetical distant planet to explain an apparent clustering of the arguments of perihelion of the eKBOs. Batygin & Brown ( 2016 ) have also argued for this hypothesis by calling attention to the clustering of the eccentricity vectors and orbit poles of some distant KBOs. These authors suggest a planet mass of ~10 M ⊕ and an orbit with semimajor axis a 700 au and eccentricity e 0.6. Fienga et al. ( 2016 ) provide an analysis of Cassini tracking data, arguing that for the favored planet parameters of Batygin & Brown ( 2016 ), the residuals in the orbital motion of Saturn are reduced with the existence of such a planet at current true longitude near 120°; however, their analysis cannot exclude a large range of true longitudes (−132°, 106°) where the planet would be too distant to sufficiently perturb Saturn.\n\nIn the outer solar system beyond the orbit of Neptune is the Kuiper Belt, a large belt of minor planets whose dynamics have been understood over the past two decades to be significantly controlled by the gravity of the giant planets Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, either through secular or resonant perturbations or by gravitational scattering. However, there are a few known Kuiper Belt objects (KBOs) that are unlikely to be significantly perturbed by the known giant planets in their current orbits. In the dynamical classification scheme for the small bodies of the outer solar system, such objects (semimajor axis, a, and perihelion distance, q, exceeding 150 au and 40 au, respectively) would likely belong in a class known as \"detached objects,\" which are distinct from the classical KBOs, the resonant KBOs, and the scattered/scattering KBOs (Gladman et al. 2008 ). Trujillo & Sheppard ( 2014 ) call them \"extreme\" KBOs (eKBOs, henceforth). Upon querying the Minor Planet Center's catalog, we identify six KBOs having a > 150 au and q > 40 au; two of these are numbered and four are unnumbered: Sedna (90377), 2010 GB174, 2004 VN112, 2012 VP113, (148209), and 2013 GP136. Their orbital inclinations are in the range 11 9–33 5 (to the ecliptic), not especially remarkable for KBOs. However, all of these objects have extremely large orbital eccentricities, e 0.7, suggesting large orbital perturbations in their past histories. This is rather at odds with their current large separations from the known giant planets.\n\nThe wide range of the perihelion-to-aphelion distances of each eKBO may overlap with those of the HP. In this circumstance, the extreme eccentricities of the eKBOs may be a natural consequence of gravitational scattering encounters with the planet. The dynamical survival of scattered objects over solar system age could be simply due to the long timescales of close encounters at these distances or it could be due to enhanced dynamical stability offered by phase-protection in MMRs with HP. In their analysis, Batygin & Brown (2016) emphasized the secular effects of the planets in aligning the orbits of the eKBOs, but also noted that transient resonant interactions would be important. Here we investigate the possibility of extant MMRs of the known eKBOs with the unseen planet.\n\nExamining the orbital periods of the six eKBOs as listed in the Minor Planet Center's catalog and ordering them in order of decreasing orbital period (so Sedna is eKBO#1 with the longest period orbit), we find for the ratios P 1 /P j :\n\nThese values are close to",
      "Branding is an essential design feature for any professional firm. Consistency across all mediums is a branding strategy that should not be overlooked. Developing an understanding of a user's mental model, that is, what a user will need to use during certain situations, be it mobile or desktop, will ensure a positive user experience through consistency.\n\n1. Define the Differences Between Desktop and Mobile\n\nIdentifying user tendencies, dislikes, backgrounds, and interests can be a great initiative for the design of a desktop or mobile solution because it helps in decision-making. Going one step further would be to develop an accurate understanding of the user's mental model for each platform. Our goal here is to keep this understanding positive and engaging.\n\nSome notable differences in mental models center around defining the essentials for our two environments: desktop and mobile. Outside of those elements that are specific to the platform being used, everything else should be consistent in design.\n\nLet's take a dating application that has both a desktop and mobile platform. As far as design consistency is concerned, everything ought to be in the same colors and logical flow. Some key, global features of such an application should be available on both desktop and mobile:\n\nBrowse\n\nFiltered Search\n\nView Profile\n\nMessaging\n\nOther secondary features should be available only on the desktop. The user will theoretically be willing to go through the dating website at length. A full feature list of options should be made available in this regard. A leisurely mental model motivates a willingness to have more usable features.\n\nAs for the mobile user we must assume there are situational restraints on how much functionality it can have as compared to its desktop counterpart (such as restraints due to a smaller screen and less processing power). However, this should not mean the mobile application ought to look and act completely different than its desktop version. It is just a question of availability. The mental model of the mobile user would create a need for location-based functions and viewing a profile. However, a larger effort needs to be made for images on mobile. This is a dating application after all and the image of a user profile is central to its purpose. Optimizing that for an easy user experience needs to be considered just from a design perspective.\n\n2. Don't Make Users Relearn the App.\n\nThe goal of any desktop or mobile application is to keep users engaged. In their initial onboarding experience users may go through some sort of tutorial or learn just by perusing. This is what motivates intuitive usability among similar platforms.\n\nOf course gesture and navigation controls may function differently, but the information architecture of a desktop and mobile app's structure or flow need to be similar. Introducing a foreign set of features is one thing that reduces consistency and may severely impact the user experience.\n\n3. Don't Confuse Your User – Brand by Cross-Channel\n\nLet's take the biking application Strava. This application has both a desktop and mobile version. The primary version is the mobile version which records the time the user was biking, his or her year­to­date miles rode, time, trips, a map based log of where the user traveled, and sharing functions for like minded bike enthusiasts.\n\nFor all intents and purposes the application tracks user data very well. In this aspect the mental model developed for the mobile user actually does have more features because it is designed as a mobile experience first. After all, users can't really ride a bike with their desktop in their pockets! It goes as far as offering more in-depth data on their website, which is where an inconsistent design is apparent.\n\nTheir mobile design:\n\nStrava's mobile app is branded with a black and orange design frame. It remains consistent throughout the mobile app and provides a very modern UI at the same time.\n\nOn the other hand, their desktop site, which offers all the recorded data associated with a boarded account does not look like its mobile counterpart:\n\nIn terms of functionality, the desktop version looks somewhat similar to the application, but it is obviously a departure as far as the color scheme is concerned. In the long run this may confuse users and may turn them away from using the desktop as a resource. In this particular case it would involve a simple fix to change the color. The logos are the same across the platforms but it still leaves room for improvement in terms of consistency.\n\nConsidering theming throughout the design process commands a certain sense of uniformity. Elements of this need to be shared even on the desktop version. The sense of movement and\n\npersonal records, however that may be conveyed, needs to be shared among both platforms.\n\nImagery is also a key function in the design process. The maps with the sharing option in the above example are somewhat different. This leads to more work on the user's behalf trying to delineate the functions he or she knows are there, but can't identify the because the imagery or",
      "For most of my life, I'd navigated game dinners without loading up on bear. I'd just preferred steaks and roasts from herbivores, and that definitely excluded bear, be it black, brown, white, big or small. This time, though, I was cornered. Across the festive table from me, our host was deep into recounting his bowhunt stalk of a big black bear. On my right sat the hostess, who had roasted the haunch of that very bruin using a recipe she'd fine-tuned over the years. More than once, she glanced askance at my plate and the untouched slices of her lovingly prepared roast.\n\nRealizing there was no way out, I speared a small piece and mustered what courage I could. What was the big deal, anyway, I thought. Others have eaten bear and survived. Besides, the aroma was mouth-watering. So I tried a piece, then another and another, expecting my hosts to burst out laughing and admit that it wasn't bear after all. But it was bear, and it was good. Really good. In an instant, I was a convert.\n\nIf you are squeamish about eating black bear, as I once was, trust me when I say the meat is delicious—if you handle and prepare it properly. Here's what you should know.\n\nSpring vs. Fall: So, what does black bear taste like? It's similar to venison, only sweeter. And like venison, it's a deeper red than beef, with a texture rather like pork, though coarse-grained. A younger bear is more tender and mild-tasting than a battle-scarred boar, but big or small, a bear fresh out of hibernation is more tender than a fall bear that's been on the move throughout the summer.\n\nThe flavour of spring bear meat also tends to be rather mild since, with some exceptions, it has almost no fat. Plus, spring bears feed primarily on tender young vegetation for the first six weeks after hibernating, and the small amount of carrion and prey they do consume—less than 15 per cent of their total diet—isn't enough to taint the meat.\n\nCome fall, however, a black bear has a layer of lard several inches thick on its back, along with balls of fat deposits in the body cavity, adding 60 per cent to its weight. Trim off as much ofthis fat as possible; there will still be plenty marbled throughout the tissue to flavour a roast or steak. The bear's fall diet also has a huge effect on the taste of the meat. If it's been gorging on blueberries, sweet corn in farm country or mast in the hardwoods, it will have a strong but pleasant flavour. On the other hand, a bear that's been scarfing down fish—alive or dead—reeks worse than low tide on a hot August afternoon.\n\nMeat Management: Even what could be the most tender, savoury bear meat will be rank and tough unless it's handled properly after the kill. Step one is to quickly cool it down by field dressing the animal, removing the pelt and getting it into a walk-in cooler or on ice pronto. Bear fat spoils quickly, giving the meat an unpleasant rancid flavour. For this reason, bear quarters should not be hung to age as with venison. Instead, freeze them as soon as possible, and use the meat within three months.\n\nButchering a bear is no easy feat, partly because you'll likely have to do it yourself. A skinned black bear has an uncanny resemblance to a human being, which can be disturbing to the unaccustomed. And then there's the slime. A jelly-like layer surrounding the muscle groups, this slime remains semi-liquid even when cooled. It makes butchering a bruin an unpleasant task, during which you, your tools and your entire workspace become coated with the slippery goo. If you can find a butcher who'll process your bear, pay the price—it's well worth it.\n\nHealth Issues: Part of my past aversion to bear meat stemmed from the thought that I might be swallowing a horde of parasitic worms with every bite. The parasites in question include Trichinella spiralis, the roundworm that gave rise to the belief that pork needed to be cooked to shoe leather, and T. murrelli, which is most often detected in wild animals, particularly bears.\n\nAt one time, pork had been the primary agent for the high incidence of trichinosis among humans, because swine were fed untreated swill containing, among other things, road kill and refuse from slaughterhouses and butcher shops. Thanks to better feeding practices, including the elimination of untreated swill, trichinosis is virtually non-existent in Canadian pork.\n\nIn the wild, however, animals eat other animals",
      "Winston is a highly mobile diver and flanker who excels at creating pressure and establishing area control. Armed with his custom arsenal of high-tech equipment, he's a distinctive hero who can create a huge impact when played strategically and thoughtfully.\n\nCompared to other heroes, Winston is mechanically simple. At a fundamental level, his abilities aren't very complex and his Tesla Cannon is easy to aim. However to make a meaningful impact in a match, you need to understand what Winston's purpose is, and how these abilities should be used to maximize their effectiveness.\n\nEssentially, Winston is all about creating pressure, whether it be by initiating a fight, diving on the enemy backlines or forcing foes away from an objective with Primal Rage. Performing well as Winston comes down to reading the situation correctly, identifying the correct moments to strike and knowing your limits. This guide will cover each of his abilities in detail, explain how he should be played and where he fits within a team composition.\n\n\nPros:\n\nHigh mobility\n\nHard to kill\n\nBackline pressure\n\nArea denial\n\nCons:\n\nLow DPS\n\nLimited range\n\nCoordination-dependent\n\n- Ability Breakdown -\n\nTesla Cannon\n\n\nFires arcs of electricity in a cone\n\n60 DPS (3 damage, 20 ammo/second)\n\nCan strike up to 3 targets simultaneously\n\n100 ammo\n\n1.5 second reload\n\nCannot headshot\n\nTesla Cannon is Winston's means of creating pressure and whittling down offense and support heroes. While its damage is weak compared to other primary weapons, its strengths come from the fact that it's relatively easy to apply and maintain on a target, and can chip away at grouped enemies.\n\nDespite the fact that the Tesla lightning effects fork out a lot, its actual range is shaped like a narrow cone, growing outwards. Therefore, you'll have the most success by maintaining a small gap between yourself and your targets. This will give you an easier time tracking an enemy, and greater coverage when projecting arcs across multiple targets.\n\nDue to Tesla Cannon's relatively low DPS, you'll often find yourself running out of ammo while your enemies are left on low health. Learn to anticipate these circumstances by pushing right up close to enemies when they are close to death and your ammo is depleting, so that you can be in range to finish off your enemy with a melee strike or two. A burst of 30 melee damage is equivalent to half a second of your Tesla Cannon, and in time-sensitive situations, it can be the deciding factor of whether an enemy escapes or dies.\n\nJump Pack\n\nLong-range leap (20 metres)\n\n6 second cooldown\n\nUp to 50 damage on impact\n\nKnocks enemies back\n\nJump Pack is primarily used to either engage, disengage or cover large distances. It gives you an edge against many heroes by offering extreme vertical mobility, enabling you to reach most locations with ease. As an engage tool, Jump Pack should be used to either dive to initiate a teamfight or leap near the enemy backline to try for a kill, forcing your opponents to respond.\n\nBefore jumping into a fight, it's important to consider which heroes are present and who is backing you up, so that you can evaluate whether or not you'll survive the 6 seconds until Jump Pack is available again. It's a good idea to communicate with your teammates when you're engaging so that they can push ahead with you, otherwise you may be collapsed upon by the enemy team too quickly.\n\nWhen diving into a couple of enemies, you should aim your leap over them so that you'll land slightly behind or even beside them. This way, you'll be able to fire at them with Tesla Cannon mid-flight, while forcing them to turn around and split their aim from your teammates or the objective, disorienting them. Furthermore, this will give you a better chance of landing Jump Pack's impact damage as opposed to just landing in front of them. While the impact damage you deal may seem low, it's meaningful against offense and support heroes, and deals nearly as much damage as 1 second of Tesla Cannon.\n\nDuring prolonged fights such as skirmishes for a capture point, it's a good idea to use Jump Pack directly upwards to give yourself an opportunity to reevaluate and reposition. By launching yourself high up, your enemies will briefly drop their focus from you, and you'll get a clear perspective overlooking the area. This is an ideal time to reload your Tesla Cannon. From here, you can direct your free fall downwards, land on a target and continue fighting.\n\nWhen stalling by using your Jump Pack to achieve verticality, make use of angled rooftops and slopes to glide down them, which will help you stay airborne for a longer time while holding your impact damage for when you finally land. By the time you've touched the ground, Jump Pack's cooldown will be up sooner. Sliding against",
      "Consanguineous marriage is widely favoured in a large majority of the world's Islamic populations. According to recent estimates, the resident Muslim population of India is over 100 million. However, apart from a few numerically small or geographically defined surveys, little is known about their patterns of marriage preferences since partition of the Indian Subcontinent in 1947. This study seeks to determine the prevalence and patterns of consanguineous marriages contracted among Indian Muslims at regional and state levels during the last two generations. Data from the 1992/93 Indian National Family Health Survey (NFHS) were used in the analysis. The NFHS was a nationally-representative survey of ever-married women aged 13-49 years, conducted across 25 states of India. Of the initial 9845 respondents, 8436 were included in the final weighted analysis sample. Overall, 22.0% of marriages were found to be contracted between spouses related as second cousins or closer, ranging from 15.9% in the eastern states to 32.9% in the western states of India. In all parts of the country first cousin marriages were the preferred form of consanguineous union, and in four of the five regions paternal first cousin marriages predominated. Despite predictions to the contrary, there was no evidence of a significant change in the prevalence of consanguineous unions over the course of the study period, which extended from the late 1950s to the early 1990s.",
      "The End\n\nWe started our Burning Wheel campaign using the Kingmaker Adventure Path more than 2 years ago.The game started with Zora and Hajek traveling south to the bandit fort. Then we saw it all again through Ivo's eyes as he traveled south and saw the effect Zora and Hajek had been having. Then we saw it all again when Cyril came into the game and we get to experience the Riverlands through fresh eyes, with knights on the map. We've been re-contextualizing the journey from Restov to Olegton, southward to Spider Hill and finally to Fort Hajek for two years and it has been fresh and new and exciting every time.\n\nZora was a idealistic knight, ill-suited to bringing people together peacefully after a life of war and battle. Hajek was a jaded soldier who wanted to see the best in people and gave up his life serving a Swordlord who he believed would be a truly noble leader. Ivo came to the Riverlands having seen the worst of the rulers of Rostland.\n\nHe had little faith in the system Zora was trying to salvage and so he helped her build something new.\n\nIn the History of the Charterlands it is Swordlord Zora's ability to find solutions that obviated bloodshed and her deftness at picking up the sword and leading her soldiers when necessary that shaped these provinces as much as Ivo's love of the common folk and willingness to take harrowing chances on epic level sorcery and summoning.\n\nIn the last game, Ivo realized that his apprentices would learn Sorcery within the next month and smiled; he used his powers to help his friend have a child, also an heir that would bring stability to the region for another generation at least.\n\nIn the last game, Zora won a Duel of Wits with an angry Swordlord whose bitterness threatened to tear apart what she had built and through her curt, effective words – ended the argument the way she ended her battles.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the real world…\n\nI knew Rachel and I knew Drew before the game started but we weren't as close as we are now. In the two years during which our game took place I got married and shifted over to a different library. My consistency has been negligible in all areas of my life – physical culture practice, jujitsu and writing. The main consistency in my life has been this game.\n\nTraditions of the Swordlords has had a huge effect on the way I think about world building and basing games on established material.It deepened my understanding and love of Burning Wheel.\n\nMore important than any of that, 2 good friends became dear friends. Rachel would start some games by saying, \"I missed your faces!\" Aw.\n\nMeanwhile, back in the Riverlands\n\nWe're hitting the fast forward button and coming back to the Riverlands as elves. They will see their favorite characters and their work through new eyes, re-contextualizing everything all over again with fresh eyes, coming back to this place we've made decades later…\n\nAdvertisements",

      "What To Expect From The GOP Tax Plan\n\nMARY LOUISE KELLY, HOST:\n\nConsider today the starting bell in a race to pass a tax overhaul by the end of the year. After months of closed-door meetings, the Trump White House and congressional Republicans today unveil the outline of their massive tax overhaul. Yesterday the president gave a hint of who might be getting what.\n\n(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)\n\nPRESIDENT DONALD TRUMP: We will cut taxes tremendously for the middle class. Not just a little bit but tremendously. That includes nearly doubling the standard deduction that most families take on their taxes and increasing the child tax credit.\n\nKELLY: Also businesses are expected to get a big tax break. How big? We'll find out some details later today. We already know big questions remain, like how will the U.S. pay for the cuts? Well, we've got two views this morning on that. Former chief economist for Vice President Biden, Jared Bernstein, is here. Good morning.\n\nJARED BERNSTEIN: Good morning.\n\nKELLY: And conservative economist Peter Morici of the University of Maryland is also here. Good morning to you.\n\nPETER MORICI: Good morning.\n\nKELLY: Jared Bernstein, I'm going to let you get the first word in here, and I want you to start with what we just heard the president say - this plan will help the middle class, he says, tremendously. Will it?\n\nBERNSTEIN: No. In fact, I suspect this plan will hurt the middle class. And, you know, you really can't trust the things that President Trump has said about this tax plan because they've been completely inconsistent with the plans that he himself has actually proposed.\n\nKELLY: How is this going to hurt the middle class?\n\nBERNSTEIN: In two ways. First of all, by really sharply cutting taxes at the high end of the scale, particularly for corporations, multinational corporations, and for high-end, pass-through businesses - so small businesses that make a lot of money, hedge funds, law firms - most of the benefits, about 70 percent of the benefits of this cut, end up at the top 1 percent. That means there's very little for anybody else, and that means that unless you're going to load this all on the deficit, you're going to have to cut the heck out of spending, spending that supports moderate and low-income families.\n\nKELLY: Well, Peter Morici, jump in here. Is this going to add up to a whopper of a tax cut for the richest Americans?\n\nMORICI: No, I don't think so. They're going to increase the standard deduction. They're going to simplify the tax system. They basically have earmarked $150 billion a year which is going to increase the deficit. Now, when Mr. Obama was in office, Mr. Bernstein was very happy to do that. Now that Mr. Trump is in office, he's not. The difference is they're going to give the money back to people. Will it benefit wealthy people? Yes, they're going to get some money back. Will middle-class people be benefited? Well, by doubling the standard deduction, not only will they pay less taxes but they will have a much simpler income-tax return. There's two dimensions here. A hundred-and-fifty billion is not a huge amount of money, but they're going to spread it around. And the other dimension is people don't like the system. So this simplifies it for ordinary people. If you want to make points with people, make it easier to file taxes.\n\nKELLY: And that's one of the - that's - one of the key points here, if they are going to narrow the number of tax brackets, take it down from seven.\n\nBERNSTEIN: Quick fact-check. The deficit under Obama went from 10 percent down to 3 percent. That's just factually incorrect. So on the - look, on the middle class, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has run the numbers. And they found that as far as what's been proposed so far, initially, the middle-class income would go up about 1 percent under this plan. The top income would go about 12 - go up about 12 or 13 percent. Now, that's before. So the middle class gets bupkis, as my grandma used to say. That's Yiddish for almost nothing.\n\nKELLY: OK.\n\nBERNSTEIN: After the spending cuts that kick-in down the road to offset the deficit - and its 1.5 trillion over - over 10 years. So that's - that's real money even here - then you see middle-class incomes actually go",
      "J.P.Floru is a Westminster City councillor and author of The Sun Tyrant: A Nightmare called North Korea.\n\nMany parents despair when they see their children vote for a system which would not only destroy their savings, but also their children's future. We see 20 year olds with £700 IPhones march for Marxism. Children, who grew up in the house their parents worked hard to buy, tweet against private property. Oil-rich Venezuela is in the poor house and in flames thanks to Marxism, yet our young think Jeremy Corbyn is cool.\n\nWhat can parents do? Avoid reading Robin Hood as a bedtime story? I asked around, and came up with a few answers.\n\nI must add a disclaimer. We should be careful not to see 'the young' as a collective body of Labour voters. The general election gives a skewed impression, since Corbyn's tuition fee con misled many. Large herds of left-wing activists occupy social media – but how many in the world out there are actually swayed by it? Not every millennial is a 'snowflake', gagging for a safe space where their tender feelings will not be offended – but this makes for good social media stories. There is ample evidence that the young are in fact not socialists, but quite right-wing libertarian.\n\nTeachers are often blamed. Several polls found that they are far more left-wing than the average voter: one YouGov survey found that 57 per cent of teachers vote Labour, and only 16 per cent Conservative. But is this new? I remember walking out of my class as a 13 year old a few decades ago, when my mathematics teacher was explaining why everybody should earn the same salary. He was an avowed communist. This at a Catholic public school. Socialist teachers have been around for decades.\n\nYet all the left-wing teachers in the world, for many decades, have not been able to wipe out right-wing beliefs among at least some of the young. Why are there still some right-wing pupils left?\n\nI asked around, and came up with four explanations.\n\n1 Rebellion\n\nJacob Rees-Mogg believes that teenagers are naturally rebellious. Pupils would be likely to oppose figures of authority, such as teachers.\n\nThe strange thing is that pupils generally do not object to non-teaching figures of authority, such as left-wing pop stars or actors. In fact, pop stars and actors seem to be more successful in dragging young people into socialism than teachers or professors.\n\n2 Inoculation\n\nMichael Clark, a barrister, believes that children are effectively 'innoculated' by their parents. Long before they attend school, children from normal households will have heard the views of their parents. The children may reject those views, but at least they will be cognisant of them. When your child comes home from school with the teacher's communist beliefs, you can offer an alternative view.\n\nThis is not about counter-brainwashing your children into right-wing thinking, but rather making them aware that there is an intelligent argument for it, and that they have a choice. Parents should take the time to do this.\n\n3 Objective truth\n\nMadsen Pirie of the Adam Smith Institute says that young people are generally intelligent enough to realise that the right-wing view of the world is the correct view. Free market economics work; socialism doesn't. Marxism, that invented ideology which never worked anywhere, has a tough sell. One only has to look at Venezuela: a prosperous society which was turned into a beggar state after a few decades of socialism. Teachers are but one source of information for the young.\n\n4 Understanding personal economics\n\nAnother explanation is something I learned myself. Parents can teach their children the values of work, saving, and financial prudence. Later, the children will realise that the state's budget is but a macro version of their own. When the great Margaret Thatcher explained the nation's economy through the imagery of her father's corner shop, she was onto something.\n\nHow to instil financial responsibility and a work ethic into your children? It's pretty easy. Never give your children anything for free. Reward them when they work. Encourage them to seek summer jobs. Give them a very small weekly allowance, but never pay for any toys, etc upon demand. The small weekly sum will teach them to save, and to postpone gratification.\n\nAnd what about sharing? Make sure that your child realises that he or she is free to share or not. By all means tell them it would be a good idea, and morally recommendable, but never force them. Never make them share as a matter of course. And never ever take your child's private property away – except in the most extreme circumstances.\n\nNever allow micro-communism to creep into your household. It will seem tough to the young person, as it was for me when my parents did precisely that. I thought it was",
      "Reviewed by Christina Dixon\n\nChristina Dixon\n\nContributor\n\nChoosing the right business formation has long-reaching repercussions. How you pay taxes, your personal liability, and the amount and type or regulations encountered are dependent on the way you form your business . One of the most common choices is a Limited Liability Company ( LLC ). LLCs share many of the same qualities as an S-Corp or C-Corp while enjoying more flexibility and requiring less paperwork. But that's just an overview. Let's look at some advantages and disadvantages of LLCs to help you choose the correct business structure for you.\n\nGet started Start Your LLC Answer some questions. We'll take care of the rest.\n\nAdvantages\n\nSingle member LLC: This structure is taxed like a sole proprietorship. Profits or losses from the business are not taxed directly but instead are taxed through the single member's personal federal tax return.\n\nPartners in an LLC: Members elect to be treated like a traditional partnership for tax purposes.\n\nLLC filing as a Corporation: The members of the organization may also choose to file as if they were corporation.\n\nThe IRS does not consider an LLC to be a distinct separate entity for tax purposes. This means that, at least initially, the IRS will not tax the LLC directly. Instead, members of the LLC get to determine how they want to be taxed. There are several options:\n\n\nGenerally, members of an LLC will create an Operating Agreement that outlines how the LLC will be treated for tax purposes. Some LLCs are automatically classified as corporations by the IRS, so be aware. Further information on how the IRS classifies some LLCs can be found at IRS.gov.\n\n\nLess Paperwork:\n\n\nCompared with C-Corps or S-Corps, LLCs are very flexible. Once again, you'll want to have an LLC Operating Agreement so you can create rules that govern your business. Otherwise, your company will be governed by the default rules in your state.\n\n\nWith less stringent requirements for compliance and less necessary paperwork, LLCs are easier to form and easier to keep in good legal standing.\n\n\nLimited Liability:\n\n\nLike corporations, LLCs provide their members protection from liability. This means that members are not personally liable for debts and often court judgments incurred by the LLC. Creditors are foreclosed from seeking the personal assets of the LLCs members. It is a meaningful shield not provided in a sole proprietorship or traditional partnership.\n\nDisadvantages\n\n\nSelf-Employment Taxes:\n\n\nUnless you choose to be taxed like a corporation, LLCs are usually subject to self-employment taxes. This means that the profits of the LLC won't be taxed at the corporate level, but will pass through to its members who will account for those profits on their personal federal tax returns. Oftentimes, these taxes are higher than they would be at the corporate level. Individual members will pay for federal items like Medicare and Social Security. For this reason, if you do choose to start an LLC, it's a great idea to speak to a knowledgeable lawyer or accountant.\n\n\nConfusion About Roles:\n\n\nWhereas corporations have specific roles (like directors, managers, and employees), LLCs generally do not. This can make it difficult for the company and especially investors to know who's in charge, who can sign certain contracts, etc. Some of this confusion can be avoided by creating an LLC Operating Agreement.\n\n\nLimited Life:\n\n\nIn many jurisdictions, if a member departs the LLC, the LLC ceases to exist. This is unlike a corporation whose identity is unaffected by the comings and goings of shareholders. Members of LLCs can combat this weakness in the Operating Agreement.\n\nConclusion\n\n\nLLCs give you a great combination of flexibility and protection. They shield members from personal liability while affording them an array of tax options.\n\n\nOf course, an LLC might not be right for your business. If you're having reservations, check our article of the tax considerations of each business type.

But in three short years, Canadian born Sahm Adrangi has done that. He's also grown his hedge fund, Kerrisdale Capital , from a $US1 million start-up to a $US200 million investment house that is taking hedge fund activism into the social media age. Seeking to profit from uncovering corporate fraud is also a strategy that has delivered returns for Australian hedge fund Bronte Capital , an Australian hedge fund led by John Hempton , whom Adrangi admires. Adrangi began life as a hedge fund investor under the alias www.ChineseCompanyAnalyst.com in June 2010. His focus was the murky world of ­Chinese reverse mergers – companies that found their way, un-vetted, onto the North American bourses by rolling into already listed entities.\n\n\"I figured out all these companies were scams, and the only way to make money out of them was to expose them,\" Adrangi says. As he exposed how these Chinese companies were cooking their books, he decided to keep his profile anonymous. Advertisement\n\n\"When I realised all the backlash I would receive from bursting that bubble, doing it under an anonymous website seemed to be a better way to expose these frauds initially,\" he said. But Adrangi was outed by ­BusinessWeek, and as more activist investors – including Carson Block of Hong ­Kong-based Muddy Waters and ­Hempton – became publicly active in disclosing Chinese frauds, he dropped the pseudonym and begin publishing under ­Kerrisdale Capital. \"It was safety in numbers, and now we are known as just one of the early guys who began publishing on these companies. People in the industry know that we were among the very first, but generally speaking the public views us as part of a large cottage industry of firms that exposed the Chinese reverse mergers,\" Adrangi says. CEU raid puts little hedge fund on the map\n\nThe fund began life with less than $US1 million raised from friends, family and supporters ready to exploit the folly of investors – many professional – lured to buy Chinese companies by the nation's phenomenal growth story. The trade that marked Kerrisdale's arrival was its spectacular raid on ­Chinese Education Alliance (CEU), an online education business headquartered in the north-eastern Chinese town of Harbin. China Education Alliance was one of many firms that had found its way onto US and Canadian stock exchanges through a back-door listing. It was reporting strong revenues of $US22 million from its business of providing ­education tutorials to Chinese students of all ages. Adrangi, a Yale graduate who took classes from famed professor Robert Shiller , knew about how similar online education companies like Kaplan had helped kids like him ace their US college entrance exams through online ­tutorials. But CEU's numbers seemed fanciful in this context, particularly since its ­website was semi-functional at best.\n\nAdrangi had used investigators in China on a couple of occasions and placed an online web advertisement requesting the services of someone in Harbin to visit the site and make some inquiries – to sight this ­budding Chinese enterprise making its ­$US22 million of revenues. After several weeks, in November 2010, the eye in Harbin reported back. Adrangi recalls: \"It was totally crazy, the building was empty. We were halfway through the report when we got these photos of these empty buildings. And our reaction was, 'Oh my gosh, this is far worse than what we thought'.\" Kerrisdale now had graphics, photos and videos to back up their assertion that the company's earnings were not the creation of Chinese entrepreneurship but accounting fiction. Kerrisdale had also found that ­Chinese companies are forced to submit accounts to local authorities, and not surprisingly found a large discrepancy in the numbers, compared with the earnings shown to US investors. Kerrisdale went for the kill and put more than 20 per cent of the fund's capital on a bet that CEU would collapse. On November 29 2010, Kerrisdale's report was uploaded to its website with links to the videos posted on YouTube of the tumbleweeds rolling through deserted campus.\n\nThe stock duly plunged 40 per cent, resulting in huge gains for Kerrisdale. \"During those times we had some massive moves – there was one day where we were up 25 per cent on our capital,\" he says. The CEU raid put this little hedge fund on the map, and cemented Kerrisdale as a highly active exposer of Chinese fraud. Adventures in the land of Chinese reverse mergers\n\nBut not everyone on the street was impressed with Kerrisdale's ­investigative work on CEU. Shortly after its publication, an analyst and salesman and angry client of New York brokerage firm Rodman & Renshaw showed",
      "AFP/Getty Images\n\nSentiment toward gold is at such a bearish extreme, it seems as if every market seer is saying it's time to buy because nearly everyone else has been selling.\n\nVarious sources, such as a blog for the financial advice firm HighTower and the investment newsletter Elliott Wave Financial Forecast, have highlighted data from Daily Sentiment Index showing the lack of love for gold. Just 3% of traders were bullish on Nov. 5, said Jake Bernstein, who runs the sentiment-tracking service.\n\nAs any contrarian will tell you, when sentiment is so lopsided, price tends to move the opposite way. That's what happened in 2011 after the Daily Sentiment Index recorded 98% bullishness on Aug. 22, just as gold US:GCG5 was about to embark on a journey from more than $1,900 an ounce down into the $1,100s. Bernstein calls the 2011 figure, and the one from Nov. 5, \"the most extreme we have seen.\"\n\nBut with many observers drawing attention to the widespread bearishness on gold and using it to advise buying, can it be said that sentiment is really bearish?\n\nGiven the tendency of investments to move in a way that confounds and impoverishes the most people, what could the yellow metal do to make fools of the largest number of investors? How about a sudden leap followed by an equally sudden plunge?\n\nThere's a convenient catalyst for such a scenario. Japan is taking steps — seen with some justification to be desperate and reckless — to hammer down the yen and force-feed inflation into the economy. That could prompt its main regional rival, China, to debase its own currency. In fact, China's central bank on Nov. 21 undertook its first rate cut since 2012, suggesting that the idea has occurred to authorities there.\n\nSuch an inflationary race to the bottom, or even the fear of it, could cause gold, a traditional tonic when inflation concerns bubble up, to rally. But the price could come back down as investors realize that an effort to foster inflation in Asia is likely to result in deflation everywhere else. As prices of Asian goods and services plummet, it would drive down prices of their Western equivalents and, eventually, wages, profits and economic growth.\n\nA deflation scare, following close on the heels of an inflation scare, could cause havoc with gold, ultimately keeping the bear market going. If you think gold is due for a more persistent bounce, or if you think you're nimble enough to catch a spike and get out in time, there are plenty of vehicles to back your conviction.\n\nA closed-end fund whose portfolio consists of gold and silver bullion, Central Fund of Canada CEF, -0.51% , traded at a 9.8% discount to the value of its holdings on Nov. 20, well above the 1.1% average discount that investment researcher Morningstar has recorded over the last three years.\n\nIf you want pure gold in a liquid (easily tradable, not molten) form, there's SPDR Gold Shares GLD, -0.17% , an exchange-traded fund that owns bullion. But it trades almost exactly at net asset value, so you won't benefit from a discount, as with the closed-end fund.\n\nA better choice for longer-term optimists is Market Vectors Gold Miners ETF GDX, +0.16% , a fund that holds shares of mining companies, not gold itself. As bad as gold has done, miners have fared far worse. Gold is about 40% below its peak in the summer of 2011, while the Philadelphia Gold/Silver Sector Index of mining stocks XAU, -0.06% is almost 70% lower.\n\nMining stocks are highly leveraged plays on the price of gold; a small move in the metal translates into a big move in a mining company's earnings. So their underperformance in the last three years isn't unexpected or unjustified. But the extent and persistence of the weakness is hard to figure.\n\nThe price of gold is slightly higher than five years ago, as of Nov. 20, but the mining ETF is off more than 60%. Mining stocks are cheap not just compared to gold but to yardsticks like book value, the intrinsic worth of their net assets.\n\nBy those standards, these stocks have appeared cheap for more than a year — and there's no reason that they can't get even cheaper. But their bargain prices should provide a cushion for investors willing to hold on for the long haul if gold continues to drop. Moreover, the miners seem likely to beat gold significantly if the old uptrend resumes.\n\nIf you just want to flirt with gold, a proxy for the metal like GLD or CEF might be the way to go. If you're ready to fall in love, GDX seems like a better choice.\n\nWant news about Asia delivered",
      "Mr. Putin also veered close to an admission that Russian soldiers had fought in the war in eastern Ukraine, saying, \"We never said there were no people there solving certain questions, including in the military sphere,\" but he denied that they were on active duty with the regular army.\n\n\"Get a sense of that distinction,\" he said.\n\nHe even gave a few hints of his closely guarded family life, talking proudly of his two adult daughters, who he said were living in Russia and \"taking the first steps of their careers.\"\n\nMr. Putin likes to throw in a few surprises on these occasions, as he did two years ago by announcing the release of an imprisoned oil tycoon, Mikhail B. Khodorkovsky. This year, he rose to the defense of Sepp Blatter, the embattled president of soccer's world governing body, FIFA, who is under criminal investigation for corruption, saying Mr. Blatter should be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.\n\nAnd he even inserted himself into the Republican presidential primary contest in the United States, speaking highly of Mr. Trump in remarks after the news conference ended.\n\n\"There is no doubt that he is a very bright and talented man,\" the Russian leader said. \"It is not our business to assess his merits; that is up to the U.S. voters. But he is an absolute leader of the presidential race.\" In Russian, the word for \"bright\" has several meanings, including outstanding, brilliant and even gaudy.",
      "In a rare non-computing related patent filing discovered on Thursday, Apple proposes a wind turbine that generates electricity from converting heat energy rather than rotational energy created by the rotation of the unit's blades.\n\n\nSource: USPTO\n\n\nHeat from the low-heat-capacity fluid (110) stored in the thermally insulating vessel (202)\n\nis transfered to the working fluid (114) through a thermally conductive component (204).\n\nWhile Apple is best known for inventing, and patenting, technology for computers and mobile electronics, the company also dabbles in seemingly radical ideas for an OEM. Such is the case with a an application published by the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office for the \"On-demand generation of electricity from stored wind energy,\" an invention wholly dedicated to solving problems of variability associated with the alternative energy production method.The application, filed for in June 2011, notes that most contemporary wind turbines convert kinetic energy from wind into mechanical energy, or in some cases electricity. Basic windmill technology is well known: wind energy is asserted on a mill's sails or blades and is converted into rotational energy through a drive shaft, which then powers machinery or, more recently, electric generators. It is apparent that the process is dependent on a steady supply of wind which, as Apple's filing notes, is highly variable.To mitigate these inconsistencies, the filing proposes a system that converts rotational energy from the turbine into heat, which is then stored in a \"low-heat-capacity\" fluid. From storage, heat can be selectively transferred to a \"working fluid\" that is used to generate electricity during lulls in wind activity.In some embodiments, heat is generated from the friction created between blades connected to the rotor shaft and the low-heat-capacity fluid, such as mercury, ethanol or an inert gas, in which they are immersed. Thermal energy is stored in an insulated vessel. A thermally insulating component like a radiator or conductive rod can be used to selectively transfer heat from the low-heat-capacity fluid to the working based on electrical demand. Finally, the working fluid boils and creates steam which rotates a turbine connected to an electric generator.According to the patent application, the \"on-demand\" electric generation system can reduce costs associated with natural variations in wind supply. Further, the method can be used as a replacement for current conventional energy storage methods such as batteries.Whether Apple plans to deploy such a wind turbine system is unclear, but Cupertino is investing heavily in alternative energy sources like solar and natural gas \" energy servers ,\" as seen at the company's Maiden, N.C. data center.",

      "Chapter Text\n\nThe sound of water lapping against the hull of the boat is soft and soothing. The nights, these days, are quiet. The city is at peace. The seas are as well, at least at the moment. It's very late at night and the lights of Dunwall are a glittering blur of shoreline, and the stars glitter on the slick mirrored surface of the sea, and Samuel is perfectly content to just sit and take it in.\n\nHe is not stupid enough to try and sleep out here, alone in a small boat on the wide ocean - but he would like to. Everything is simpler at sea. Words like conspiracy and loyalist and lost love do not make much sense when the only voices around you are those of salt and wind and sky.\n\nThough it's not that he doesn't get lonely, sometimes. Quietly so.\n\nHe's taken Corvo out here a few times, now that there are no missions circumscribing their trips and no murder at the end - just the two of them, sometimes with a bottle of whiskey, Samuel talking of nothings and Corvo sometimes appreciating the gaps and the silence and sometimes filling in with little nothing-observations of his own. It is a very comfortable sort of friendship. The Lord Protector is a good listener. He seems to like the way Samuel can spin harmless little stories that settle around them both like a blanket.\n\nThey do not talk much of politics, certainly not anymore, not when Corvo lives and breathes it every day and already has far too much tension in his shoulders. They do not talk, much, of the past. They have raised a toast to the men the Loyalists used to be, and that was enough. Samuel went to sea to forget, after all, and he supposes that he can lend Corvo the same favor.\n\nAnd besides – he decided long ago that there were things he was simply not meant to know.\n\nNo. If Samuel does not ask about the mark on his hand, or the particulars of the hellish trek back from death and the Flooded District and meeting the Empress's killer, or the nightmares he knows the man has of falling though an endless void of the words YOU CANNOT SAVE HER - just as Corvo does not ask about the name of his boat - it is not because he does not expect answers to come. It is not because either of them would mind telling. It is simply trust. It is because they are both men who know to sit and appreciate the silence and the turn of the waves and the wide peaceful expanse of the sea.\n\nAnd the sea is so calm, now. Barely a sound against the boat's grey hull. Barely a ripple on the surface. The water is silk-smooth, mirrorlike. Samuel peers down and watches shapes move underneath his reflection, so many fathoms down below, dark and vast and slow. A great bulk of something silver passes by below him. It is so many hundred times larger than his little boat. In the moonlight it seems to shine, and Samuel draws his coat around himself.\n\nThere are things in the deep that have no name, and he is only an old sailor who is without friends (but not friendless) alone on the water. If something wished to swallow him whole, it would. There is nothing he can do, and so he does not worry.\n\nAnd besides. The night is very beautiful.\n\nIt is late, but sleep and shore are a long ways off. Samuel fusses underneath his seat for a mug and a thermos of still-warm tea. The boat tips, just a bit, as he does so; and the mug rolls out of his grasp and rolls down the length of the boat, stopping at the bow with a soft clink.\n\nBent down, Samuel watches a hand reach down and pick it up.\n\n\"Do you mind?\" asks the young man from his teetering perch on the bow of the boat. He is sopping wet, dark hair sleek and plastered to his skull, dripping water all over the boat; he should be shivering but he isn't, not at all. His eyes are fathomless and dark. He holds the mug forward to be filled. \"You've got a second one. I've never had tea.\"\n\nSamuel stares at him for a long, long moment. And then he straightens, very slowly.\n\n\"No,\" he says, carefully, \"if you're who I think you are, I suppose you haven't.\" He clears his throat. \"There's, uh, a bottle of whiskey too if you'd rather –\"\n\n\"No, no, tea is fine. Water flavored with the ghosts of faraway leaves. You humans come up with such odd things.\" His lips twitch. \"Don't be so afraid of me, Samuel Beechworth. I",
      "When his 27-year old daughter Lisa died suddenly of liver failure five years ago, Steve Mason was as devastated as any father would be.\n\nHe and his wife Darnelle immediately took in Lisa's three children -- ages 4, 7 and 9 at the time -- even though they knew it would be a huge struggle to support them. Steve earns less than $75,000 per year as a pastor, while Darnelle earns even less as a director at the same church.\n\nThen the student loan bills started coming.\n\nMason had co-signed on the $100,000 in private student loans that his daughter took out for nursing school, and the lenders wanted their money.\n\nUnable to keep up with the monthly payments on top of all of the other mounting expenses, the $100,000 balance ballooned into $200,000 as a result of late penalties and interest rates of as high as 12%.\n\n\"It's just impossible on a pastor's salary raising three kids to pay $2,000 a month on loans,\" said Mason, who has been searching for a second job.\n\nRelated: Drowning in student loan debt\n\nIf these had been federal student loans, Mason could have had the loans discharged or at least received some sort of financial assistance. But since they are private loans, he has little to no recourse.\n\nHe called each lender to explain his situation and beg for help, and while they sympathized with him, they told him they weren't required to do anything.\n\nAnd they're right: private lenders aren't bound by any federal requirements to help borrowers -- or co-signers -- facing financial hardship, even when it's a parent whose child has passed away, says Deanne Loonin, an attorney at the National Consumer Law Center. Any loan forgiveness is up to the discretion of an individual lender.\n\nNavient Corp., which manages several of Mason's loans, said it has reduced the balance and lowered interest rates and payments for Mason in the past, and provides relief to customers on a case-by-case basis.\n\n\"We extend our deepest sympathies to the Mason family on the loss of their daughter,\" the company said in a statement to CNNMoney. \"We're reaching out to Mr. Mason to offer further assistance as appropriate.\"\n\nAfter being contacted by CNNMoney, Mason said Navient lowered his interest rate to 0% on three of four loans and reduced the total amount owed to $27,000 from nearly $35,000.\n\nAmerican Education Services, which handles the bulk of Mason's other loans, said as a loan servicer it's in charge of collecting payments and doesn't make the rules about forgiveness. Mason would therefore need to contact the original lender, National Collegiate Trust, directly. He did this, and says the lender refused to provide him with any relief. NCT could not be reached for comment.\n\nMason has considered declaring bankruptcy, but student loans are the only type of debt that generally can't be discharged through bankruptcy.\n\n\"People with other debt from splurging -- they can discharge that,\" he said. \"Student loans should really be the one type of debt they do discharge because it's done to further an education and career. But somehow getting [my daughter] an education has encumbered me for the rest of my life.\"\n\nRelated: Colleges with the best bang for your buck\n\nSimilar financial nightmares are haunting other grieving families.\n\nAngela Smith, a mother from Chesapeake, Va., filed a petition on Change.org several years ago asking private loan provider First Marblehead Corp. to forgive the $40,000 in student loans that her husband had co-signed for their son Donte, who was shot to death in 2008.\n\n\"Shortly after Donte died, that's when the collection calls started. It was like a punch in the gut -- we didn't know what hit us,\" Smith wrote in the petition. \"All of a sudden we not only had to deal with the police and attorneys investigating his murder, but we also had to deal with collectors constantly calling and reminding us of our son's death in the worst way.\"\n\nThe petition received more than 150,000 signatures from sympathizers but no action from the lenders. First Marblehead didn't respond to a request for comment, and Smith says the loan was recently sold to another company.\n\nRelated: Hungry, tired and stressed out\n\nAt least four other petitions from families in this situation have been started on Change.org. There's been one success story so far, where the brother of a deceased borrower petitioned a bank to stop going after his grieving father for payments, and the loan was forgiven.\n\nLegislation aiming to help people in these situations, including recent bills that would allow student loan debt to be discharged in bankruptcy, have been introduced over the years but have yet to pass in Congress.\n\nFor now, the only option parents",
      "The Arizona state championship cross country race, complete with an unwanted intruder — Twitter More\n\nTop runners often need special motivation to reach their goals. Some of Arizona's best prep cross country athletes got that and more during the Arizona Interscholastic Association Cross Country State Championships.\n\nAs reported by the Arizona Republic and Runners World, among other outlets, a coyote jumped into the middle of the race course between the two front runners during the AIA championship race at Cave Creek Golf Course in Phoenix. According to Runners World, at one point the coyote nearly pulled even with the race leader, Catalina Foothills High (Tucson) senior Harvey Nelson.\n\nLuckily, that's about as much as the coyote got up to. Despite large crowds on both sides of the course, the wild animal quietly slipped off the course after running approximately 50 meters, disappearing into the brush never to be seen again.\n\n\"I think he was looking for The Road Runner, but he was no where to be found,\" AIA chief operating officer Chuck Schmidt joked to the Republic. \"Unfortunately, the coyote didn't finish, so he didn't place.\"\n\nWhile the surprising appearance of a coyote might be hard to believe, the incident was caught on camera by Marilyn Aune, Nelson's aunt, who took the photo you see above of the coyote bearing down on Nelson in the race lead.\n\nIn the end the animal was just a footnote to a fabulous finish for Nelson. The senior won the race with a time of 15:25, but not before his thunder was stolen by the coyote.\n\n\"Everyone was thankful that nothing happened to anyone,\" Flagstaff High (Flagstaff) cross country coach Trina Painter told Runners World. \"It was just so surreal.\"\n\n- - - - - - -\n\nCameron Smith is the editor of Prep Rally on Yahoo Sports.

      "AP Photo\n\nThe roots of al Qaeda were famously planted in Afghanistan in the 1980s, fighting the Soviet Union. Many current al Qaeda fighters, including Osama bin Laden, were then mujaheddin rebels that benefited greatly from American arms and covert military training against a better-equipped fighting force.\n\nToday, in Libya, a ragtag group of rebels fight a seesaw battle against Muammar Qaddafi's better-equipped forces, and a debate rages over whether to provide them arms and training.\n\nHowever, whispers are growing that al Qaeda may already be among them, complicating the current debate over arming the rebels.\n\nQaddafi's troops push rebels further from Tripoli\n\nTop Libyan minister defects to the U.K.\n\nComplete coverage: Anger in the Arab World\n\nAdmiral James Stavridis, NATO supreme commander for Europe, said of Libya's rebel force: \"We have seen flickers in the intelligence of potential al Qaeda, Hezbollah.\"\n\nFormer CIA officer Bruce Riedel took things a step further, telling the Hindustan Times: \"There is no question that al Qaeda's Libyan franchise, Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, is a part of the opposition. It has always been Qaddafi's biggest enemy and its stronghold is Benghazi. What is unclear is how much of the opposition is al Qaeda/Libyan Islamic Fighting Group - 2 percent or 80 percent.\"\n\nFor al Qaeda, Libya may represent a rare opportunity and a blank slate, as uprisings in Egypt and Tunisia seem almost certain to result in democratic governments. An Afghan Taliban operative told The Daily Beast earlier this month that, for al Qaeda, the Libya rebellion \"is the fresh breeze they've been waiting years for. They realize that if they don't use this opportunity, it could be the end of their chances to turn Libya toward a real Islamic state, as Afghanistan once was.\"\n\nArming Libya's rebels would be a tricky gamble\n\nAt the outset of tensions, Qaddafi blamed al Qaeda for the uprising, a charge which rebel leaders have repeatedly denied.\n\n\nRegardless of Qaddafi's well-documented penchant for exaggeration and distortion, his message was heard and vetted by his Western opponents. In an interview with \"Early Show\" co-anchor Erica Hill in New York Tuesday, President Barack Obama conceded that, \"Among all the people who (are) opposed (to) Qaddafi, there might not be elements that are unfriendly to the United States and our interests. ... And that's why I think it's important for us not to -- jump in with both feet\" with all of them.\n\nFollowing that interview, reports surfaced that Obama signed an executive order allowing the CIA to open contacts with rebels, so the extent of al Qaeda's role in the Libyan rebellion may be clarified soon.\n\nAs Mr. Obama has already authorized covert support for the rebels, that answer may still not come soon enough.",

      "On Monday, when the Supreme Court decided to turn down seven appeals submitted by prisoners held at Guantánamo, without providing any explanation, a particularly low point was reached in the prison's history.\n\nThe decision came just one day before the fourth anniversary of Boumediene v. Bush, the hugely significant 2008 ruling granting the prisoners constitutionally guaranteed habeas corpus rights.\n\nThat ruling reaffirmed a previous Supreme Court ruling, Rasul v. Bush, in June 2004, granting the prisoners habeas rights, and involved the Court establishing that Congressional attempts to strip habeas rights from the prisoners — in the Detainee Treatment Act of 2005 and the Military Commissions Act of 2006 — had been unconstitutional.\n\nBoumediene led to a flurry of activity, as long-frozen cases were revived. District Court judges in Washington D.C. then decided the evidentiary standards required, assessing that the government needed only to establish its case by a preponderance of the evidence, and not beyond a reasonable doubt, as is required in criminal cases.\n\nEven so, the weaknesses in the government's cases were such that, between October 2008 and July 2010, 38 of the prisoners had their habeas corpus petitions granted, and just 14 had their petitions denied. For reasons that have never been explained, prosecutors in the Justice Department continued to work on the Guantánamo cases as aggressively under Barack Obama as they had under George W. Bush, without either President Obama or Attorney General Eric Holder calling for a rethink in the way they were operating, even though the District Court judges repeatedly poured scorn on the government's lawyers.\n\nVindicating the work of investigative journalists like myself and researchers at the Seton Hall Law School, who had produced a series of reports debunking exaggerated claims about the prisoners' significance, the judges ascertained that many of the witnesses relied upon by the government had mental health issues, actually identified in reports by government officials, which made their statements untrustworthy, and they also took apart flimsy claims made by intelligence analysts, military officials and Justice Department prosecutors. Even so, they were careful to follow the rules, denying petitions when evidence of involvement with the Taliban was produced, even though, in most cases, that demonstrated only that they had been involved in the Taliban's long-standing military campaign against the Northern Alliance, which pre-dated — and had nothing to do with — the 9/11 attacks.\n\n28 of these prisoners were released — the only ones, out of 602 prisoners released in total, who were freed through legal means — but in 2010 the D.C. Circuit Court began dealing with appeals submitted by the government, and decided to rewrite the rules in the government's favor. In successive rulings, the Circuit Court judges have insisted that the barest association with either al-Qaeda or the Taliban is sufficient to justify detention (whereas the lower court judges had determined that prisoners had to be demonstrably part of the command structure of either organization), and, most recently, have demanded that intelligence reports submitted by the government should be regarded as accurate, even though, objectively, there are perfectly sound reasons for believing that field reports, produced under pressure, should be subjected to rigorous scrutiny. As a result, the last eleven habeas petitions, over the last two years, have all been denied, and other previously successful petitions have been reversed or vacated.\n\nThe most vociferous of the dissenting judges, Senior Judge A. Raymond Randolph, who is notorious for having endorsed every piece of Guantánamo-related legislation under President Bush that was subsequently overturned by the Supreme Court, went so far as to show open contempt for the Court and its Boumediene ruling in a speech at the Heritage Foundation, in October 2010, which was entitled, \"The Guantánamo Mess.\" In that speech, he compared the justices to characters in The Great Gatsby by F. Scott Fitzgerald. \"They were careless people,\" he read. \"They smashed things up … and let other people clean up the mess they had made.\"\n\nAnother judge, Senior Judge Laurence Silberman, indulged in a disturbing outburst while turning down an appeal by Yasein Esmail, a Yemeni, in April 2011. Noting that, in a \"typical criminal case,\" judges will \"overturn a conviction if the prosecutor lacked sufficient evidence, even when the judge is virtually certain that the defendant committed the crime,\" he added, \"That can mean that a thoroughly bad person is released onto our streets, but I need not explain why our criminal justice system treats that risk as one we all believe, or should believe, is justified.\" However, he claimed that, in the case of the Guantánamo prisoners, \"candour obliges me to admit that one cannot help but be conscious of the infinitely greater downside risk to our country, and its people, of an order releasing a detainee who is likely to return to terrorism.\"\n\nAs was noted in a report in January by the Center",

There are bright, greenish arcs, which loll about the northern horizon, parallel rays midway up in the northern sky and towering rays and diffuse aurora that can surge past the zenith. Often the aurora hovers low and remains covered by trees or buildings, so find a road or field with good exposure.\n\nSecond, a tripod. You can do so much with this three-legged beast. No better astro tool in the universe. Even the brightest auroras will require a time exposure of at least 5 seconds. Since no human can be expected to hold a camera steady that long, a tripod is a necessity. After that, it comes down to a camera. Most \"point-and-shoot\" models have limited time exposure ability, often just 15 seconds. That may be long enough for brighter auroras, but to compensate, you'll have to increase your camera's sensitivity to light by increasing the \"speed\" or ISO. The higher you push the ISO, the grainier the images appear especially with smaller cameras. But you'll be able to get an image, and that may be satisfaction enough.\n\nI use a Canon EOS-1 Mark III camera to shoot day and night. While not the latest model, it does a nice job on auroras. The 16-35mm zoom wide-angle lens is my workhorse as the aurora often covers a substantial amount of sky. My usual routine is to monitor the sky. If I see aurora padding across the sky, I toss the my equipment in the car and drive out to one of several sites with a clear exposure to the north. Once the camera meets tripod, here's what to do:\n\n* Focus: Put the camera in manual mode and make sure my focus is set to infinity. Focusing is critical or the stars will look like blobs and the aurora green mush. There are a couple options. Use autofocus on a cloud or clouds in the daytime or the moon at night. Both are at \"infinity\" in the camera's eye. Once focused at infinity, set the camera to manual and leave it there the rest of the evening to shoot the aurora. OR … note where the little infinity symbol (sideways 8) is on your lens barrel and mark it with a thin sharpie so you can return to it anytime. You can also use your camera in Live View mode, the default viewing option for most point-and-shoot cameras where you compose and frame live. Higher-end cameras use a viewfinder but have a Live View option in their menus. Once in Live View, manually focus on a bright star using the back of the camera. On higher-end cameras you can magnify the view by pressing on the \"plus\" sign. This allows for more precision focus.\n\n* Aperture: Set the lens to its widest open setting, which for my camera is f/2.8. The lower the f-stop number, the more light allowed in and the shorter the exposure. Like having really big pupils! You want to expose the aurora in as short a time as possible because it moves. Longer exposures soften its appearance and blur exciting details like the crispness of the rays.\n\n* ISO speed: Set the ISO to 800 for brighter auroras or 1600 for fainter ones and set the time to 30-seconds. If the aurora is bright and moving quickly, I'll decrease exposure times to 10-15 seconds. The current crop of high end cameras now have the capacity to shoot at ISOs of 25,000. While those speeds may not give the smoothest images, dialing back to ISO 3200 and 6400 will make for photos that look like they were shot at ISO 400 on older generation cameras. A bright aurora at ISO 3200 can be captured in 5 seconds or less.\n\n* Framing: Compose the scene in the viewfinder or monitor. If you're lucky or plan well, you can include something interesting in the foreground like a building, a picturesque tree or lake reflection.\n\n* Press!: OK, ready? Now press the button. When the image pops up on the viewing screen, does the image seem faint, too bright or just right. Make exposure adjustments as needed. If you need to expose beyond the typical maximum of 30 seconds, you can hold the shutter button down manually or purchase a cable release to hold it down for you.\n\nIt's easy, right? Well then, why did it take me 400",

      "This photographer took a portrait of one Torontonian from every country in the world\n\nThis photographer took a portrait of one Torontonian from every country in the world\n\nPhotographer Colin Boyd Shafer has always been drawn to ambitious projects: he's shot the Turkish uprising, Myanmar's political exiles and interfaith couples from around the world. His newest project, Cosmopolis, is his most formidable yet. Through 2013 and 2014, Shafer tried to photograph a Torontonian from every country in the world. To date, he's covered 195 nations—though he's still missing 10 small countries like East Timor, San Marino and some South Pacific Islands. He shot each subject in a setting of their choice, with an object that linked them to their past. \"When you're a white Canadian, it's very easy to disconnect yourself from migration,\" says Shafer, whose own roots stretch back to the U.K., Spain and the U.S. \"I hope this encourages everyone to take a step back and think about their own migration history.\" Here, the stories of eight new Canadians from Shafer's expansive project, on now until January 8 at 18 Toronto Public Library locations.\n\nAndrea\n\nFrom Pointe Noire, Congo\n\nPhotographed at his office, an engineering consulting firm\n\nAndrea's family moved to the Ivory Coast after he finished high school for his father's job; in 2002, they moved to Tunisia during the First Ivorian Civil War. After high school, Andrea completed his studies at Concordia University, and has finally settled in Toronto with a job at an engineering consulting firm. Andrea likes to teach his colleagues about the Congo. \"I am sure that it reduces the misconceptions people usually have about Africa.\"\n\nThis picture shows Andrea with his grandma, father and sister. \"There is an African saying: l'eau chaude n'oubli pas qu'elle etait froide avant. It means 'knowing where you come from will benefit you and guide you perfectly for future choices.'\"\n\nEileen (Shafer's grandmother)\n\nFrom Stoke on Trent, United Kingdom\n\nPhotographed in her home\n\nEileen and her husband wanted to work in a Spanish-speaking country, but in a surreal twist of fate, her husband accepted a job in British Columbia in 1957, thinking it was Colombia. They left Canada within a year arriving, but returned in 1961, and Eileen's been here for more than 50 years since. \"This is my special spot,\" she says of the chair her late husband, John (he died in 2011), made after she hurt her hip.\n\nThis album contains childhood photos of her three kids. \"Whenever the children were bored or sick, it was always, 'Can I look at the albums?' They all knew that 'if the house sets on fire…grab the photograph albums!'\"\n\nJina\n\nFrom Pyongyang, North Korea\n\nPhotographed at a park in North York\n\nJina's family was forced out of the North Korean capital when her father criticized the government. She escaped the country soon after, swimming through the freezing December waters of the river that separates North Korea from China. She met her husband there through a Korean church, and they decided to move to Canada together. Despite having no money or ID (she'd left it with her family in North Korea so that they could tell people she died in a car crash), she was able to get a Chinese passport and a flight.\n\nJina lost an heirloom necklace during her escape, but whenever she wears something she thinks her mother wouldn't allow—like this purse—she thinks of her.\n\nAtif\n\nFrom Khartoum, Sudan\n\nPhotographed at Old City Hall\n\nAtif was blacklisted in Sudan for joining a political opposition party. A friend who lived in Toronto told him about life in the city, and Atif set his sights on Canada. When he obtained official permission to fly over, he remembers feeling like the world was his. Once here, he participated in protests outside Old City Hall to bring attention to the plight of the Sudanese. \"Toronto police officers were on site,\" he recalls, \"and rather than reprimand us, they allowed us to continue.\" At the time this picture was taken, he was working in security.\n\nDrinking coffee with friends is a big part of Sudanese culture, but Atif didn't like Tim Hortons at first. Now he drinks it regularly—after seeing Torontonians with their cups every day, he figured, \"If I want to be Canadian, I should do it too.\"\n\nOyu\n\nFrom Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia\n\nPhotographed at her office, a real estate investment trust corporation\n\nOyu had an uncle in Canada, but her family still waited six years to be approved by the Canadian Embassy.

      "ProTeam Backpack Vacuum Maintenance\n\nIt's important to be aware of what repairs and maintenance fall under the product warranty and which repairs or maintenance is part of the product's normal wear and tear. Let's review the product's routine maintenance recommendations. Remember that the environment will determine how frequently filter maintenance is required. So, check filters before and after each use to determine if filters need to be emptied, cleaned, or replaced. ProTeam recommends that you keep a filter maintenance log which will enable you to keep track of your filter replacements. First, let's review ProTeam's filter maintenance. Prior to every use, check the Intercept Micro filter and Micro cloth filters. A clogged and dirty filter will restrict air flow and results in reduced suction and overheating. Prevent possible damage to the motor by simply changing or cleaning the filters frequently. Again, remember that the environment will determine how frequently filter maintenance is required. To maintain these filters, first take off the top cap and pull out the Intercept Micro filter and Micro cloth filter at the same time to avoid tearing the Intercept Micro filter, especially if the filters are very full. When emptying the Intercept Micro filter, carefully remove the filter from the vacuum body. Turn the Intercept Micro filter upside down into a garbage receptacle that has a plastic liner. Take the garbage receptacle liner and close around the filter opening so dirt and debris do not float into the air. Gently shake the filter into the garbage receptacle liner until empty. Make sure the pores of the Intercept Micro filter aren't clogged as fine dust can clog the filter even when it has been shaken out. If the filter is clogged, discard and use a clean Intercept Micro filter. Non-reusable filters need to be discarded when full and must be replaced with a clean, genuine ProTeam replacement filter. Check both filters for rips or tears and remember to replace filters as often as necessary. Once a month, or as necessary, hand or machine wash the Micro cloth filter and let it air dry. Do not put it in the dryer. Once a week, or as necessary, clean the dome filter. To access the dome filter, first remove the Intercept Micro filter and cloth filter, reach into the vacuum body, and pull the top piece of the dome filter off and remove the foam media. Shake it out, rinse, and air dry. Once dry, replace and firmly snap the top piece of the dome filter back into place. Next, reinstall the Micro- cloth filter. Make sure that the lip of the filter completely covers the rim of the vacuum. Never use the Intercept Micro filter without the Micro cloth filter, as the rubber gasket of the Micro cloth filter provides the vacuum seal. Next, install the Intercept Micro filter inside the Micro cloth filter. Replace the top cap and ensure that it is closed snugly. Once every two weeks, or as necessary, inspect the HEPA filters. When the filter becomes discolored, replace it with a new one. For best results, this filter should be replaced at least every six months. To inspect or replace the HEPA filter, depress the raised portion of the tab on the filter door and pivot the door away from the vacuum body. Grasp the plastic housing on the HEPA filter and remove it from the vacuum. To replace the filter door, align the two tabs to the housing, press in place, and rotate upward. Be sure to snap the locking tabs of the spring finger behind the tab of the housing. You should hear an audible click if it is installed correctly. The body can be wiped down with a wet sponge or cloth, but you must be careful not to get water on the motor. While vacuuming, stop every two hours or as needed to check, empty, or replace the Micro filters. Remember to only use genuine ProTeam replacement filters to ensure optimal performance. Please refer to the limited warranty section of your product's owner's manual for detailed warranty information.\n\nCourtesy of Courtesy of WebstaurantStore Restaurant Supplies\n\nCopy and paste the embed code above.",

He then shot members of the family, authorities said.\n\nHaskell is charged with capital murder.\n\nCassidy Stay wiped away tears but smiled as she spoke of her parents, Stephen Stay, 39, and Katie, 33, and her two brothers and two sisters, aged 4 to 14.\n\n\"I know that my mom, dad, Bryan, Emily, Becca and Zach are in a much better place and that I'll be able to see them again one day,\" Cassidy said in remarks televised by local media. \"Thank you all for coming and for showing support for me and my family. Stay strong,\"\n\nCassidy said she drew strength from the \"Harry Potter\" series of books and films.\n\n\"In 'The Prisoner of Azkaban,' Dumbledore says: 'Happiness can be found even in the darkest of times if one only remembers to turn on the light,'\" she said.\n\n\"I'm feeling a lot better,\" she added, \"and I'm on a straightforward path to a full recovery.\"\n\nCassidy, released from a hospital on Friday after treatment for a head wound, was credited by authorities with saving lives by calling the 911 emergency line and warning police the gunman was on his way to another house where relatives lived.\n\nPolice captured Haskell on Wednesday night after a four-hour standoff.\n\nDoug Durham, Haskell's public defender, said his client had been in and out of hospitals in Utah and California with a history of mental illness and was not taking prescribed medication at the time of the killings.\n\nHaskell collapsed in a Houston courtroom on Friday as details of the killings were read aloud. Harris County prosecutor Tammy Thomas told the judge that Haskell methodically executed the family, tying them up and then firing two bullets into each of them, starting with the mother.

      "(CNN) Lawyers for one of the women who have accused Donald Trump of sexual assault subpoenaed his campaign for all documents relating to her, all communications with or about her and \"all documents concerning any woman who asserted that Donald J. Trump touched her inappropriately.\"\n\nThis comes in the case of Summer Zervos, a former contestant on \"The Apprentice\" who accused Trump of sexually assaulting her in 2007. The accusations were made in October of last year at a news conference.\n\nZervos claims Trump kissed her twice on the lips during a lunch meeting in his New York City office and on a separate occasion in Beverly Hills, she alleges he kissed her aggressively and touched her breast.\n\nIn a statement at the time, Trump denied these claims.\n\n\"To be clear, I never met her at a hotel or greeted her inappropriately a decade ago. That is not who I am as a person, and it is not how I've conducted my life. In fact, Ms. Zervos continued to contact me for help, emailing my office on April 14 of this year asking that I visit her restaurant in California,\" Trump said.\n\nTrump also dismissed Zervos' and another woman's accusations at a rally, calling them \"total fiction,\" \"all false stuff\" and said that there is a \"concerted effort\" to take down his campaign.\n\nAsked about the subpoena at a White House news conference on Monday, Trump said, \"All I can say is it's totally fake news, just fake. It's fake. It's made-up stuff, and it's disgraceful what happens, but that happens in the world of politics.\"\n\nThe subpoena, issued in March, is just coming to light now and is part of a defamation lawsuit filed by Zervos in January in the New York State Supreme Court against Trump following his denials.\n\nBuzzfeed News first reported the existence of the subpoena.\n\nThe subpoena was served to the campaign, but Zervos' lawyers and the campaign agreed to suspend the response date until after a motion to dismiss the lawsuit is decided, Mariann Wang, one of her attorneys, told CNN. She said campaign officials gave assurances that the documents be preserved which they did.\n\nInformation about the subpoena was entered into the court record as part of a filing in which Zervos' attorneys argued against dismissal of the suit.\n\nAttorneys for Trump said the suit \"... has no legal merit,\" that these were \"fame-seeking accusations\" and argued the lawsuit should be dismissed. In a motion, his lawyers said because this is a state lawsuit it cannot proceed against a sitting president.\n\n\"Ms. Zervos does not and cannot state a cause of action for defamation under California law, which applies here because Ms. Zervos is domiciled and was purportedly injured there. The allegedly defamatory statements were made during a national political campaign that involved heated political debate in political forums. Statements made in that context are properly viewed by courts a part of the expected fiery rhetoric, hyperbole and opinion that is squarely protected by the First Amendment,\" his lawyers argued in a court motion.\n\nHis lawyers also said if the case isn't dropped at least it should be stayed until he leaves office.\n\nIn response to an inquiry about the subpoena, the President's lawyers Monday pointed to additional arguments they made in their brief about why they believe Zervos' claims \"are not just legally but also factually meritless.\"\n\nThey referenced a statement made on the same day as her October 2016 news conference from her cousin, John Barry, who said he was \"completely shocked and bewildered by my cousin,\" because Zervos had previously only spoken \"glowing\" about Trump.\n\nAnd they pointed to an email previously released she sent in April 2016 to Trump's secretary inviting Trump to her restaurant saying she wanted to \"reconnect\" with him. Zervos has previously said she was trying to confront Trump about her allegations at such a meeting and give him the opportunity to clear the air.\n\nAlso representing Zervos is Gloria Allred, who has represented many women in sexual harassment cases, and appeared with Zervos at her original news conference in October.\n\nTrump's attorneys, who referenced her as part of the filing, have said the subpoena is overly broad. \"Ms. Allred has served a far-reaching subpoena on the Trump campaign that seeks wholly irrelevant information intended solely to harass the President. Indeed, Ms. Allred herself has questioned how the President could run the country if faced with broad discovery.\"\n\nWhile Trump's attorneys have said Zervos' allegations are politically motivated, her lawyers disagreed.\n\n\"Contrary to Defendants' spin, this case is not about robust political debate. Ms. Zervos was not a political opponent, nor was she a political commentator routinely engaged in criticizing candidates,\" Zervos' attorneys countered in a court filing last month. \"She came forward to",

      "Shelter Reacts To City Funding Cut In Half Copyright by KELO - All rights reserved bishop-dudley [ + - ] Video\n\nsioux falls, sd - Proposed budget cuts to the Sioux Falls city budget could hit a homeless shelter hard. Under the current plan, the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House would see its contribution from the city cut in half.Tracy Turbak, finance director for the City of Sioux Falls, says the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House is getting $60,000 in the proposed 2018 budget. He says in 2017, the city council decided to give the shelter $120,000.Surprisingly, Executive Director Chad Campbell says he isn't frustrated with the proposed city budget.\"We work with partners who have funding changes and things like that all the time, so I'm very used to change, and you have to be very adaptable and very nimble to be in this kind of business,\" Campbell said.The shelter's annual operating budget is about $1 million, and Campbell is confident the shelter will continue to meet the need.\"We'll just continue to press forward, and we'll continue to work our fundraising strategies and grand proposals and things like that to continue to meet our need of our budget,\" Campbell said.Campbell says that in 2016, 1,433 different people used the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House, and 1,034 people have already been helped this year.\"The rationale for the sixty thousand in the proposed 2018 budget is that that should be sufficient to cover all of the utility expenses for the Bishop Dudley House for a full year,\" Turbak said.Turbak is careful to praise the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House's work.\"It's certainly not any sort of a value judgement on the services these groups provide,\" Turbak said. \"I think everyone agrees that the BDH provides an incredibly valuable service to the community.\"At issue, he says, is where taxpayer money should go.\"It's really a question of whether city tax dollars ought to be used to support that to the degree that they are currently,\" Turbak said.As for the Bishop Dudley Hospitality House, Campbell is confident the budget shortfall will be filled.\"We'll continue to work on various grants that we have available, and we'll continue to do the best we can with the resources that we have without compromising any type of services offered to the guests,\" Campbell said.The city council has final say over the budget. Turbak says he \"won't speculate on what the council will do.\"",

The Zone DPMX provides cyclists with a solution for focussed training and detailed riding analytics. Brim Brothers claim that measuring power surpasses measuring other metrics such as heart-rate. The Zone DPMX can be used either on the left foot or on both feet for increased accuracy, with the Kickstarter campaign's Super Early Bird coming in at €390.\n\nThe Zone DPMX is for cyclists looking to take their game to the next level and while it may not be for everyone, we love nothing more than seeing an Irish Kickstarter campaign roar to success within hours of being released to the world.",
      "During his address to NATO, Donald Trump repeated his completely false line that the other member countries need to start paying America for protection. The reactions from the audience said it all.\n\nDonald Trump has always had a problem understanding the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the military alliance between North American and European states.\n\nAnd despite backing off his absurd claim the agreement is \"obsolete,\" he still seems unable to grasp the basics of how it works.\n\nWhich is likely why fellow NATO leaders approached his coming address at the summit in Brussels with apprehension.\n\nWhen Trump took the stand to address the group, he lived up to those low expectations with a speech that proved he still doesn't understand anything about the alliance:\n\nThese grave security concerns are the same reason that I have been very, very direct with Secretary Stoltenberg and members of the alliance in saying that NATO members must finally contribute their fair share and meet their financial obligations. But 23 of the 28 member nations are still not paying what they should be paying, and what they are supposed to be paying, for their defense. This is not fair to the people and taxpayers of the United States. And many of these nations owe massive amounts of money from past years, and not paying in those past years. Over the last eight years, the United States spent more on defense than all other NATO countries combined. If all NATO members had spent just 2 percent of their GDP on defense last year, we would have had another $119 billion for our collective defense and for the financing of additional NATO reserves. We should recognize that with these chronic underpayments and growing threats, even 2 percent of GDP is insufficient to close the gaps in modernizing readiness and the size of forces. We have to make up for the many years lost. 2 percent is the bare minimum for confronting today's very real and very vicious threats. If NATO countries made their full and complete contributions, then NATO would be even stronger than it is today, especially from the threat of terrorism.\n\nTrump's claim that our allies are \"underpaying\" or owe NATO money has been repeatedly debunked. NATO is not some big pool of money into which countries pay dues. Rather, member states agree to fund their own militaries by 2 percent of their GDP by 2024. Trump is right that only five members of NATO currently do this, but there is nearly a decade left for the other states to comply.\n\nRegardless of whether this target is met, NATO requires that if one member state is attacked and Article V is invoked, all NATO states jump to that nation's defense. Incidentally, the only time this has ever happened was when America was attacked on 9/11. So, NATO has in fact benefitted America more than any other country.\n\nPerhaps the most telling demonstration of the depths of Trump's ignorance was the reactions of other world leaders as he spoke.\n\nSeveral presidents and prime ministers were visible on camera, muttering, staring at each other, stupefied by what Trump was saying:\n\nMSNBC\n\nMSNBC\n\nMSNBC\n\nThese leaders certainly had plenty of reason to express bemusement, as Trump offered up classic Trumpian lines alongside his typical lies and ignorance:\n\nPresident Trump: \"I never asked once what the new NATO headquarters cost. I refuse to do that, but it is beautiful\" https://t.co/kiPnjyrBaa — NBC News (@NBCNews) May 25, 2017\n\nIt is truly fitting that these two artifacts now reside here, so close together, at the new NATO headquarters. And I never asked what the new NATO headquarters cost. I refuse to do that. But it is beautiful.\n\nTrump has ushered in an era of American politics in which facts have no meaning. Unfortunately for him, they still matter to the rest of the world, and to our allies.",

      "North Korea has found its way into the news again recently, thanks in large part to basketball player Dennis Rodman's controversial trip to the closed-off state. There have also been more traditional attention-grabbers related to the North Korean nuclear program. In mid-December, South Korean media reported the possibility of another North Korean nuclear or missile test. In his New Year message, leader Kim Jong-Un repeated the traditional threats against the United States and warned of a \"massive nuclear disaster\" should war break out on the peninsula.\n\nWhenever North Korea appears in the media, China usually gets dragged into the stories as well. China is often blamed for enabling or propping up the North Korean regime, despite its belligerence and nuclear threats. A recent New York Times editorial by Brookings Institution expert Jonathan Pollack asked, \"Why does China coddle North Korea?\" Pollack noted, ironically, that \"China's policy record on Pyongyang over three decades remains unblemished by success.\" He argued that it is time for a change.\n\nChina's policy towards North Korea is predicated almost entirely on one simple goal: keeping the state functioning as a viable \"buffer zone.\" The mainstream line of thinking is that China must support North Korea enough to prop up the Kim regime. Should the regime fall, the resulting instability in North Korea might lead to unification on South Korea's terms — which would in effect mean a U.S. military ally now borders China. This would be anathema for China.\n\nHowever, this traditional line of thinking might actually be short-sighted. Below, I argue that in the (extremely hypothetical) case of Korean unification, China could actually be the long-term winner.\n\nFor starters, South Korea and China have a remarkably smooth relationship. Of course, there are occasional flare-ups (South Korea's reaction to China's new ADIZ being one example), as there are in any state-to-state relationship. However, China has a far better relationship with South Korea than with many of its other neighbors. For one thing, China and South Korea have an extremely important trade relationship. As Jonathan Pollack noted in his New York Times editorial, China's joint trade with South Korea is currently worth over $250 billion — more than South Korea's trade with Japan and the United States combined. Further, China and South Korea have recently banded together in their opposition to Shinzo Abe and the Japanese government. Both countries have been vocal about rejecting what they see as Japan's return to militarism.\n\nChina-South Korea ties were highlighted during South Korean President Park Geun-Hye's June visit to Beijing. Park, who speaks Chinese, met with Chinese President Xi Jinping and reiterated her commitment to improving China-South Korean relations. Also at her New Year's press conference, Park reportedly said that the relationship with China is closer than ever before. In response, the Chinese Foreign Ministry \"highly commend[ed]\" Park for her comment, and promised that China will \"push for sustained, sound and steady advancement of China-ROK [Republic of Korea, the official name of South Korea] strategic cooperative partnership.\"\n\nDespite these positive signs, China-South Korea relations are undermined by one glaring difference: their hopes for North Korea. South Korea's goal has always been unification. In her New Year's press conference, Park identified laying \"the foundation for unification on the Korean Peninsula\" as a \"key task\" for her administration. Such a task, she said, is \"a prerequisite for an era of happiness for the people.\" Yet China, while it shares global concerns over North Korea's nuclear program, has a very different picture of the ideal outcome. Chinese foreign policy leaders' greatest hope is that North Korea will open up to the world and become a normalized state — in essence, following China's own transformation. The Chinese government shies away from supporting unification, and maintains a relationship with North Korea despite repeated provocations. This damages China's relationship with South Korea more than any other single factor.\n\nThe United States is the other obvious wedge between China and South Korea. Ever since the Korean War, the South Korean government has depended on its alliance with the U.S. to provide a guarantee of security against North Korean belligerence. This creates something of a vicious cycle in China's Korea policy: China is wary of a unified Korea and so continues to support the Kim regime. Yet as a result, the North Korean government continues to issues its threats and provocations, driving South Korea closer to the United States. As Pollack pointed out, this strategy is not really benefiting China.\n\nNow let's imagine that China's worst fears come true – the Kim regime collapses and South Korea takes control of its unstable northern neighbor. Korea is now unified, and it's actually a good thing for China.\n\nFor one thing, while China is understandably anxious of a U.S.-allied Korea on its border, once unification is achieved, there's little strategic value to continuing the U.S.-South Korean alliance — at",
      "Heriberto Lazcano Lazcano, the former Mexican army commando turned cartel assassin and one of the world's most powerful drug lords, has been identified as one of two men killed in a shootout, according to the Mexican military. But now Lazcano's body has apparently been stolen from a funeral home by a group of armed and masked men.\n\nThe group \"took the bodies, stuck them in a hearse, and made the owner drive it off,\" Coahuila state prosecutor Homero Ramos told reporters on Tuesday. According to a statement from the Mexican navy, \"there is strong evidence\" that one of two men killed in a shootout in the northern Mexican state of Coahuila is \"Heriberto Lazcano, principal leader of Los Zetas Organization.\" The military later matched Lazcano's fingerprints and released (caution: disturbing) photos of the body.\n\nIf true, Lazcano's death would be one of the most serious blows against the cartels in nearly three years. But Lazcano, alias \"Z-3/El Lazca,\" was also enmeshed in a violent turf battle over control of the cartel with a former deputy. And if Lazcano is indeed dead, he wouldn't be the first cartel boss to be gunned down only for more killings to follow as rival gangsters moved in to fill the void.\n\nThe shootout began on Sunday afternoon when Mexican citizen complained about \"armed members of organized crime\" operating around the rural town of Progreso. The complaint summoned government marines who then circled the area before being \"attacked with grenades from a moving vehicle,\" the statement read. But according to El Universal, Ramos said Lazcano was killed while attempting to flee a baseball game after having come under attack by the marines.\n\nA shootout then resulted in wounds to one marine and the deaths of two heavily armed cartel members. According to the statement, a search uncovered \"two rifles, a grenade launcher tube, with 12 useful grenades in addition to a rocket launcher tube with two rockets, magazines and cartridges for various firearms.\" Following a forensic examination, the navy \"reached indications that one of the bodies is Lazcano.\" The body was then reportedly given over to relatives for burial after having been identified. Then it was stolen.\n\nLazcano has been reportedly killed before only to pop up again. But those reports didn't publicly come from the government, raising the likelihood that the Zetas boss really was killed this time around. Drug war analyst firm Grupo Savant told the San Antonio Express-News that \"sources in Mexico\" indicate the cartel leader was killed. The kingpin's death was also noted by outgoing President Felipe Calderon while he was dedicating a new prison in the state of Guanajuato. Lazcano was \"one of the most dangerous [criminals] in the world\" and was \"gunned down resisting authority,\" Calderon said.\n\nOriginally a hit squad made up of former Mexican army commandos, the Zetas worked as enforcers for the Gulf Cartel before splitting with their former parent cartel in 2010. Since then, and under Lazcano's leadership, the Zetas have fought with the Gulf Cartel, the larger Sinaloa Cartel based in Mexico's west, and have expanded to become a major cartel itself.\n\nThe cartel's territory now stretches from the Texas border to Guatemala, and is arguably Mexico's largest. That territory was seized through a wave of violence and kidnappings, and the cartel was shown – partly through operating under a loose franchise model made up of many small cells – to be resilient against efforts by the government to stop them.\n\nBut Lazcano had arguably been eclipsed by his deputy, Miguel \"Z-40\" Trevino Morales. Earlier this year, Trevino seemed to have seized control of the cartel. That led to a new surge of violence in Mexico's northeast, pitting Trevino's faction against Lazcano and Ivan Velazquez Caballero, a powerful but comparatively lower-level boss captured by the government late last month. Mexico City also captured another Zetas boss on Monday wanted for slaughtering hundreds of people in the past year throughout Mexico's rural northeast and killing a U.S. citizen on the Falcon Lake water reservoir.\n\nWith Lazcano gone, that may put an end to the internal conflict within the cartel. But then Trevino might not be able to control a cartel with limited central authority. Reports of mass killings are often blamed on local cartel leaders acting on no one's authority but their own. It'd clearly mean the end of a man who turned a group of ex-soldiers into mafia assassins, and then expanded the group to become arguably one of the world's deadliest criminal organizations – and then only to be replaced by someone widely thought to be even worse.\n\nAnd if Lazcano has already been buried, we might already know where. In February, pictures appeared of a blinged-up and horribly tacky modernist",

The key excerpt:\n\nThe service interruption was triggered by a misconfigured network device that disrupted traffic to one cluster in our West Europe sub-region. Once a set device limit for external connections was reached, it triggered previously unknown issues in another network device within that cluster, which further complicated network management and recovery.\n\nAccording to the company, it is still working to dig up what it calls the 'full root cause.'

      "AutoGuide.com\n\nWandering through the Lamborghini museum can leave you with a lot of thoughts.\n\nIt's hard not imagine blasting to 200 mph with a V12 at your back, or just getting lost in the nostalgia of the truly retro designs that seem to define their respective automotive eras.\n\nBut read each of the plaques pasted next to every car and there's another tale being told, that of the automaker's history, and it goes like this: Chrysler pretty much ruined Lamborghini. . . and Audi saved it.\n\nThe Gallardo that Never Was\n\nAmid the awesome new Sesto Elemento and future-forward concept cars like the Estoque sedan there are forgotten vehicles like the small, white P140 concept. Dating back to 1988 it sports a 4.0-liter V10 engine with around 370 hp. Designed to be a smaller and more affordable Lamborghini model, it's in many ways a precursor to the Gallardo. An idea apparently ahead of its time, the car was axed when Chrysler purchased Lamborghini in 1987.\n\nConsidering the success of modern day Lamborghini is built off the Gallardo, just think where the brand would be now if they had built it.\n\nIronically, a more affordable model is just what Chrysler later realized Lamborghini needed most. After burning through significant capital, it offloaded the Italian automaker in 1993. Much of the reason for that decision was that the Diablo, which was launched under Chrysler stewardship, was perceived as a flop with first year sales of 673 units falling off a cliff in year two with just 166 models moved. After strong early demand, the overly rich asking price of $239,000 was too much for the market to bear.\n\nJust a few steps away from the P140 sits a selection of Lamborghini-powered Formula 1 cars, with a note next to one of how the F1 engine program was axed by Chrysler.\n\nThen there's another ahead-of-its time machine that saw production albeit in limited numbers: the LM002. A luxury SUV two decades before the Porsche Cayenne, it also saw its demise under Chrysler.\n\nDueling Concept Cars\n\nLeft in shambles and sold to holding company MegaTech, the next few years were tumultuous ones as is evidenced by a selection of wild concepts lining the outer glass wall of the museum.\n\nFamiliar to only the very dedicated Lambo enthusiast, for most, they're completely unheard of – making them all the more enticing.\n\nA burnt-copper model in particular stands out, perhaps due to its uniquely un-Lamborghini styling. Called the P147 Zagato Canto it has styling elements that look more Ferrari or McLaren. There's also the P147 Gandini Acosta concept with the plaque humorously (and perhaps unintentionally) recounting the car's story: \"Despite respecting the cost parameters of the project, whilst maintaining the roof, the door profile and the windshield of the Diablo, this model is not at all appreciated (our emphasis). As a result, no prototype of this concept is built.\"\n\nRepresenting an inner struggle within the brand in 1997 both concepts are eventually axed with the purchase of Lamborghini by Audi (its German savior) in 1998. Instead of the bulbous Zagato or bug-eyed Gandini, Audi instead launches the distinctly modern Murcielago.\n\nAudi's Influence\n\nOur visit to Lamborghini came as part of an introduction to the new Hurácan model and throughout the trip the German influence from Audi is prominent.\n\nAudi boss Dr. Ulrich Hackenberg was in attendance and made a point of explaining that three iconic brands: Lamborghini, Ducati and design house Italdesign Giugiaro all fall under the Audi corporate umbrella.\n\nMore than just a corporate suit, Hackenberg is uniquely invested in Lambo, having advised its purchase after a trip to the plant in 1996 which included a test drive of the Diablo that he admits was \"beyond the speed limits.\"\n\nIn Lamborghini he saw the promise of \"Italian creativity and design with German precision engineering,\" he says. The cars themselves were something unique and impressive, the quality, however, was suspect and something, \"which could be extremely improved,\" he said.\n\nBeyond the museum and the presentation, a tour of the manufacturing facility at Sant'Agatha Bolognese drove home the quality improvement theme, from displays of manufacturing processes to high-tech quality control checks.\n\nHow Audi Saved Lamborghini\n\nWith Audi's help, Lamborghini launched the the Gallardo, a car it needed for decades, with a new level of affordability, quality and a vastly superior level of daily driveability to any past mode wearing the Bull badge. And consumers responded making it the brand's all-time best seller.\n\nBut history, they say",
      "Pin 103 190 Shares\n\nYou might be wondering what the hell a legume is. Let us explain.\n\nThis guide explains the definition of a legume, legumes and the paleo diet, provides a list of common type of legumes and covers the benefits.\n\nA legume is a simple, dry fruit contained within a shed or a pod. The most well-known legumes are peas, beans, peanuts, and alfalfa (we have a full list below).\n\nNo, not THAT bean\n\nLegume Index\n\nWhy Aren't Legumes Paleo?\n\nPhytates\n\nPhytates bind up minerals in food, thereby preventing your body from utilizing them. This means these foods are not digested. They can also cause inflammation, bloating, indigestion, and gas. Yuck.\n\nLectins\n\nLectins are carb-binding proteins that are relatively \"sticky.\" They're difficult for our bodies to break down and therefore cause indigestion. Their desire to bind also leads them to bind with your intestinal lining.\n\nLectins can also cause leaky gut syndrome, which is when the intestinal lining is broken down, allowing toxins and anti-nutrients to leak into the bloodstream.\n\nLectins are commonly associated with IBS, Chrohn's disease, arthritis, fibromyalgia, and many other issues.\n\nDo you find yourself asking, \"is it paleo?\" often? Check out our app: Paleo.io – the ultimate \"Is It Paleo?\" app\n\nOkay, But Besides That…\n\nLegumes don't tend to have great nutritional profiles. They're not bad but they're not great.\n\nThey tend to have a high carbohydrate content for what they do provide. They're not as bad as processed foods or grains but if weight loss is your goal, there are definitely much better (and paleo) choices out there for you.\n\n\nWhat's Good about Legumes?\n\nLegumes are most famous for their protein content. They tend to be great sources of protein for non-meat eaters. They're also great sources of minerals and fiber. Because of their fiber content, they don't spike insulin levels and inhibit fat loss as grains and other simple carbohydrates do.\n\nThat said, they're simply \"okay\" choices. They're not the best foods and, while there's variance in the nutrition provided by different legumes, you can certainly get all the nutrients they contain from other, superior choices. We recommend you do that.\n\nList of Legumes\n\nAlfalfa\n\nAsparagus bean\n\nAsparagus pea\n\nBaby lima bean\n\nBlack bean\n\nBlack-eyed pea\n\nBlack turtle bean\n\nBoston bean\n\nBoston navy bean\n\nBroad bean\n\nCannellini bean\n\nChickpeas\n\nChili bean\n\nCranberry bean\n\nDwarf bean\n\nEgyptian bean\n\nEgyptian white broad bean\n\nEnglish bean\n\nFava bean\n\nFava coceira\n\nField pea\n\nFrench green bean\n\nFrijol bola roja\n\nFrijole negro\n\nGreat northern bean\n\nGreen bean\n\nGreen and yellow peas\n\nKidney bean\n\nLentils\n\nLespedeza\n\nLicorice\n\nLima bean\n\nMadagascar bean\n\nMexican black bean\n\nMexican red bean\n\nMolasses face bean\n\nMung bean\n\nMung pea\n\nMungo bean\n\nNavy bean\n\nPea bean\n\nPeanut\n\nPeruvian bean\n\nPinto bean\n\nRed bean\n\nRed clover\n\nRed eye bean\n\nRed kidney bean\n\nRice bean\n\nRunner bean\n\nScarlet runner bean\n\nSmall red bean\n\nSnow pea\n\nSouthern pea\n\nSugar snap pea\n\nSoybean\n\nWax bean\n\nWhite vlover\n\nWhite kidney bean\n\nWhite pea bean\n\nThe Verdict\n\nAre Legumes Paleo?\n\nNo.\n\nWill they kill you?

      "The United States is declaring that it will pull out all the stops and use any means necessary — including nuclear weapons — against Iraq or other hostile countries in response to a chemical or biological attack.\n\nThe threat to use \"overwhelming force\" if the U.S. or its allies are attacked is included in the White House's six-page \"National Strategy to Combat Weapons of Mass Destruction,\" to be delivered to Congress on Wednesday.\n\nThe United States \"reserves the right to respond with overwhelming force — including through resort to all of our options — to the use of WMD [weapons of mass destruction] against the United States, our forces abroad and friends and allies,\" the statement reads.\n\nThe implicit threat of U.S. nuclear retaliation is a deterrent to hostile governments, said senior administration officials who briefed journalists about the document Tuesday.\n\nThis same warning was not included in a similar strategy issued by the Clinton administration in 1993, although at different times it warned that any attack on the United States using weapons of mass destruction would result in the U.S. unleashing its wrath.\n\nThe officials said President Bush has assigned many federal agencies to determine how to enact the strategy. The president is also spending \"considerable sums\" of money and manpower on research into new counterproliferation strategies other than missile defense.\n\nThey emphasized that the strategy, developed jointly by National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Homeland Security Adviser Tom Ridge, is a statement of the Bush administration's overarching principles.\n\nIts timing, however, coincides with other muscle-flexing by Bush designed to show Iraqi President Saddam Hussein that the United States is serious about seeing him disarmed.\n\nThe White House document includes doctrines for prevention, deterrence and defense that Bush has enunciated since taking office, including a commitment to boost programs aimed at containing the damage of any chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear attack.\n\nIn a top-secret appendix, The Washington Post reports, the strategy names Iran, Syria, North Korea and Libya among the countries that are the central focus of the new U.S. approach. Administration officials said that doesn't mean Bush intends to use military force in any of those countries, but that he is determined to stop weapons transfers in or out of their borders.\n\nThe strategy, which represents the first revision of national security strategy since 1993 and turns away from the Cold War doctrine based on deterrence and containment, said some unspecified states that support terrorists already have weapons of mass destruction and seek even more \"as tools of coercion and intimidation.\"\n\n\"For them, these are not weapons of last resort, but militarily useful weapons of choice intended to overcome our nation's advantages in conventional forces and to deter us from responding to aggression against our friends,\" the document said. \"Because each of these regimes is different, we will pursue country-specific strategies that best enable us and our friends and allies to prevent, deter and defend against WMD and missile threat.\"\n\n\"We must accord the highest priority to the protection of the United States, our forces and our friends and allies,\" it continued.\n\nThe strategy relies on three 'pillars' to combat weapons of mass destruction.\n\nOne is protection against those weapons, which includes the policy of preemptive attacks and development of a missile defense, as well as interdiction.\n\nThe second is non-proliferation agreements. Administration officials say there are several non-proliferation treaties they're trying to strengthen.\n\nThe third pillar is consequence management, under which the president has earmarked billions of dollars for research into ways to improve the country's ability to respond to and reduce the effects of weapons of mass destruction.\n\nThe strategy has effectively been in place for several months and has resulted in directives to a number of government agencies.\n\nWhile nonproliferation relies on international treaties and laws to prevent countries from producing mass destruction arms, counterproliferation depends on force or physical disruption to stop them.\n\nBut the classified version is premised on a view that \"traditional nonproliferation has failed, and now we're going into active interdiction,\" one participant who helped draft it told The Washington Post.\n\nActive interdiction, he said, \"is physical -- it's disruption, it's destruction in any form, whether kinetic or cyber.\"\n\nOne official posed the hypothetical scenario of a shipment of special weapons traveling to Libya via the Philippines.\n\n\"We're going to interdict or destroy or disrupt that shipment or, during the transloading process, it is going to mysteriously disappear,\" the official said.\n\nThe somewhat vague public version doesn't address specifically the priorities it asserts, nor does it assign them any budget numbers.

We checked and one was missing,\" one of the rescuers, Weeraphon Sukudom, was quoted as saying.\n\nWhile his other siblings survived the torrent of flowing waters, the tiny pup appeared to have died as he was no longer moving and had already turned blue.\n\n\"His brothers and sisters are all still alive. He just was the weaker one and was separated when the water went in the garage,\" Sukudom narrated.\n\nRefusing to just let the small animal perish, Sukudom decided to lay him down on a table carefully and give his chest some massages by only using thumbs for a few minutes. He also pumped air by breathing into the puppy's mouth.\n\n\"I learned CPR a long time ago but had never done it before on a human or animal.

      "Calorie Restriction Diet\n\nA dietary intervention to increase life span\n\nCalorie Restriction (CR) is a diet in which calorie intake is reduced, compared to diets that do not limit consumption. Calorie Restriction with Optimum Nutrition (CRON), also called the Longevity Diet, has the potential to increase the average and maximum life span. CR is best characterized as undernutrition without malnutrition. Optimum Nutrition consists of eating the right amounts of nutrients on a proper schedule to achieve the best performance and the longest possible lifetime in good health.\n\n\nCR extends lifespan\n\nof many species CR extends lifespanof many species\n\nAvoid the Major Causes of Death\n\nA person born in the United States at the beginning of the 20th century could expect to live to an age of 49 years. At the end of the 20th century, life expectancy had increased to 77 years. This increase of 57 percent was the result of improvements in public health, medicine, and nutrition. Similar improvements have been achieved throughout the world by the eradication and control of infectious diseases and advances in agriculture. However, the maximum life span of humans has not changed substantially. Only 1 in 10,000 people in developed countries can expect to live to 100 years of age.\n\nThe first step in living to a ripe old age is to avoid the major causes of death by understanding their origin. The Center for Disease Control listed the following number of casualties from the top ten leading causes of death for the U.S. in 2005:\n\nHeart Disease: 652,091\n\nCancer: 559,312\n\nStroke (cerebrovascular diseases): 143,579\n\nChronic lower respiratory diseases: 130,933\n\nAccidents (unintentional injuries): 117,809\n\nDiabetes: 75,119\n\nAlzheimer's disease: 71,599\n\nInfluenza/Pneumonia: 63,001\n\nNephritis, nephrotic syndrome, and nephrosis: 43,901\n\nSepticemia: 34,136\n\nThe risk of heart disease, cancer, stroke, and diabetes can be reduced substantially by eating nutritious natural foods, maintaining a normal weight, exercising regularly, and not smoking. The chance of death can also be decreased by avoiding drugs, alcohol abuse, pollution, violence, and wars. At the same time, it is important to practice good hygiene, get competent medical care, get protective vaccinations, and avoid risky behavior that can result in accidents or infection with the viruses that cause AIDS or hepatitis.\n\nCalorie Restriction Extends Life\n\nThe life-extending effect of reduced calorie diets was reported in 1935 along with the observation that CR stunted body size.[1] Since then, CR has been proven to extend the average and maximum life span for many species including yeasts, worms, mice, rats, etc. Animal experiments on calorie restriction after maturity indicate that adult-onset CR also increases longevity.[2] Experimental animals have the advantage that they are kept in sanitary cages, given regular meals, and not subjected to stress, infectious diseases, accidents, and predation that would reduce their life span in the wild. Many mechanisms have been proposed to try to explain why CR increases life span. Studies at the molecular level have shown that several genes in the sirtuin class, including SIRT1, SIRT3, and SIRT4, create enzymes that increase the activity of the mitochondria and slow the cell's aging process.[21] Many years of study and experimentation will be required to elucidate the complex molecular processes that result in longevity and, also perhaps, to develop nutritional supplements that extend lifespan without having to suffer the rigors of hunger. There has not been sufficient research to determine if humans on calorie restricted diets will live longer, but preliminary observations of the physiological changes caused by CR indicate that life-extending effects will probably be observable in humans also.[3] However, a 25-year study in rhesus monkeys by the National Institute on Aging (NIA) [29] suggests that genetics and dietary composition matter more for longevity than the degree of calorie restriction for primates. The NIA study found that the monkeys on the lower calorie diet did not live longer, but had less incidence of cancer.\n\nSurvival of Mice on Various Degrees of Calorie Restriction\n\n(From Walford [3])\n\nThe graph above shows that the longevity of mice increases as the percentage of calorie restriction increases, but this is not a never-ending process. At higher levels of calorie restriction, life is not physiologically possible. The only outcome is death by starvation.\n\nCalorie Restriction Reduces Body Size\n\nOne remarkable feature of CR is that the growth of the experimental animals is stunted significantly by the low-calorie diets. Typically, mice are started on calorically restricted diets after 9 weeks, shortly after weaning. The mice on 40% calorie restricted diets grow",
      "Something about a perfectly bubbly sourdough starter is satisfying. Just two ingredients, water and flour, leads to bubbles, increase of substance, and life. Then when added to a few more ingredients, it aids in the creation of a satisfying loaf of bread. Gluten-free sourdough bread is even more satisfying in that it's not kneaded and only requires one rising. It doesn't have to be looked after much, either. One has only to mix the ingredients and set the dough to rise. During the four or more hours the dough is rising, one has time for work, cleaning, running errands, and even a long run. Baking a nice loaf of gluten-free bread is is actually very easy.\n\nAs easy as baking gluten-free sourdough may be, just one loaf of gluten-free bread requires much more sourdough starter than a gluten-containing sourdough bread. The need for a large amount of starter means that you need to have at least two jars of active sourdough starter in order to begin baking your bread (see my post on starting and maintaining a gluten-free sourdough starter). Once your starter is lively and rearing to go, you are reading to bake a perfectly beautiful and delicious loaf of gluten-free sourdough bread, with a texture and flavor very close to that of gluten-containing sourdough bread.\n\nI omit the use of zanthan and guar gums, as well as psyllium husk, in my recipes. Instead, I use 10% to 15% of either resistant starches (banana flour, plantain flour, tigernut flour, carob flour) or fibrous flour (coconut). As I've noted before, these flours are whole flours; they are simply ground versions of the whole plants from which they come, and they do the same work as the gums or psyllium husk. At times, I use a gel made from chia seeds or ground flax as a gluten replacement; other times I use one of the above varieties of gluten-free flours. What I used to replace gums depends upon what I have in my kitchen at the time I'm baking. Each works as well as the other to hold the bread together and give the bread that pleasing soft, chewy texture.\n\nSome other ingredients are helpful in the successful making of a gluten-free sourdough (and yeast) bread. These ingredients are called dough enhancers, and are used by many people who bake gluten-containing bread to aid in the rising of the yeast, as well as to aid the texture and the preservation of the bread. The site Bread Machine Digest has an extensive list of dough enhancing ingredients. This website page also lists proper quantities of each dough enhancer, as well as explains the property way to use them. Most, but not all, of the ingredients listed are gluten-free. I include the dough enhancers I use in the recipe below, but I've successfully used several of the dough enhancers listed on the Bread Machine Digest website. When I use dough enhancers in my sourdough and yeast breads, my loaves end up with textures very much like those of sourdough and yeast gluten-containing breads. Phillip can tell the difference between breads I bake without dough enhancers (usually because I've simply forgotten to include them) and those that contain dough enhancing ingredients.\n\nPlease weigh your ingredients. Inexpensive digital scales are available everywhere, from your local grocery store to national chain discount stores to Amazon.com. Weighing ingredients, liquid as well as dry, leads to consistently successful results when you are baking gluten-free as well as gluten-containing foods. Too many variables enter into the amount of flour and liquid you end up using when you measure by volume rather than by weight.\n\nI, like many people, use a Dutch oven to bake my sourdough bread; the Dutch oven creates and maintains steam while the bread is baking. This steam helps to create a shiny, nicely browned crust. A Dutch oven, however, is not necessary for baking a successful loaf of gluten-free sourdough bread. People who want to bake crusty, chewy loaves of gluten-free sourdough, but who lack a Dutch oven, have plenty of other bakeware options. Check out this blog page on the website The Kitchn, for ideas. Be sure to read the comments following the blog post for more bread bakeware ideas from The Kitchn readers. No matter which type of casserole or pot in which you decide to bake your bread, line it with parchment paper. Your bread will be certain to fall nicely out of the pan after it's baked, if its baked on parchment paper.\n\nBe sure to use an oven thermometer to check the temperature of your oven, and adjust the temperature as necessary to make sure your oven is neither too hot nor too cold for",

      "by Spyros Bakas , Archaeological Institute of the University of Warsaw\n\nΤhe complete version of this study will be published in the upcoming Volume IV of the Archaeological Journal «Syndesmoi», University of Catania / Italy\n\nthe study is dedicated to my archery – instructor Mr Kostas Papantoniou\n\nIntroduction\n\nArchery had a dominant role in Bronze Age, especially in later period. The technological evolution from the self bows to the composites was a significant factor that affected the Warfare in several ways. Composite's critical advantage was that they can be made smaller because they retain their strength through the correlation of different materials (wood, sinew, horn). They had more strength, far more range and their small size results in more mobility than the self bows [1].\n\nThe first depiction of a probable composite bow lays in the victory stele of Naram-Sin of Akkad (23rd century BC) [2]. It was introduced into Egypt by the Hyksos in the 18th century. The earliest example of a composite bow was found in the tomb of Ahmose Penhant (16th century BC) [3] while thirty-two more have been found in the tomb of Tutankhamen [4]. However we do not have any archaeological examples from the Aegean Bronze Age world. This brief study will try to approach the issue of the use of composite bows in the Minoan and Mycenaean Warfare attempting to include all the possible archaeological iconographical and textual evidence that could support this argument.\n\nArchaeological Evidence\n\nBekroulaki et all. suggests that a bow in a wall painting in the palace of Nestor at Pylos could possibly be a composite one, due to the white layers of paint [5]. A bead-seal from Thisbe shows a goddess as Britomartis or Diktynna hunting a stag. As Evans notes, the appearance of thongs that cross the bow at intervals indicates that it is of the composite or Asiatic kind [6]. Evans also mentions a gold seal belonging to the same treasure, depicting two combatants with small composite bows [7]. An archery thumb ring found in the area of the Mycenaean Citadel and dated to the late Bronze Age [8] indicates that it could be used along with a composite bow –probably by a chariot archer. One of the signs of the Phaistos disc represents an unstrung bow with recurved limbs and straight grip [9] which Evans defines as \"Asiatic Composite\" [10].\n\nThere is a large number of smiths in Pylos tablets. These are aligned with the bureaucratic and centralized structure of the Mycenaean palatial centers. The word \"to-ko-so-wo-ko\" [11] which appears five times in the tablets, refers to the profession of the \"bow-maker\" (τοξοφοργός/ toksoworgos). Furthermore, the word \"ke-ra-e-we\" is been translated as \"worker in horn\" [12]. In the tablets we find evidence for the use of horn in the production of furniture, wheels, bridles and weapons [13]. There is no evidence, however, for the use of horn in the production of bows.\n\nNevertheless the word reminds us the maker of the bow of Pandarus who was \"a worker in horn\" (κεραοξόος τέκτων) [14]. These professions indicate a specialization that could be associated (even indirectly) with the construction of the composite bows. Based on the evidence from the Pylos \"chariot –tablets\" we do know that this Palatial centre could field hundreds of chariots [15] while also there is a record that there are 6010 arrows stored in this particular place [16]. Apparently those large numbers of chariots and arrows support the need for military arming. So, it seems more likely that the Palatial centers would need those \"bow makers\" mostly for military purposes rather than just for hunting. Therefore, the construction of composite bows – as weapons of the Mycenaean aristocrats – seems to be the most possible occupation of those craftsmen.\n\nHomeric Elite Bowmen\n\nIn Homeric epics there are two bows that are described to be of composite structure. The bow of Pandarus was made of the horns of a wild goat [17]. This when it is fully drawn it is noted as \"κυκλοτερές\" [18] (circular). This adjective supports the argument that its structure is composite, as only the well-made composite bows can sustain a very high degree of curvature, while bows of simple structure would break under the strain involved in such extreme bending [19].

      "Today is Hiroshima Day, the anniversary of the first use of a bomb so powerful that it would come to threaten the existence of the human race. Only two such devices have ever been used, but now, a decade after the end of the cold war, the world faces new dangers of nuclear attack - from India, Pakistan, Iraq, al-Qaida, and even the US. Launching a special investigation into nuclear weapons, Paul Tibbets, the man who piloted the Enola Gay on its mission to Japan, tells Studs Terkel why he has no regrets - and why he wouldn't hesitate to use it again\n\nWe're seated here, two old gaffers. Me and Paul Tibbets, 89 years old, brigadier-general retired, in his home town of Columbus, Ohio, where has lived for many years.\n\nPaul Tibbets: Hey, you've got to correct that. I'm only 87. You said 89.\n\nST: I know. See, I'm 90. So I got you beat by three years. Now we've had a nice lunch, you and I and your companion. I noticed as we sat in that restaurant, people passed by. They didn't know who you were. But once upon a time, you flew a plane called the Enola Gay over the city of Hiroshima, in Japan, on a Sunday morning - August 6 1945 - and a bomb fell. It was the atomic bomb, the first ever. And that particular moment changed the whole world around. You were the pilot of that plane.\n\nPT: Yes, I was the pilot.\n\nST: And the Enola Gay was named after...\n\nPT: My mother. She was Enola Gay Haggard before she married my dad, and my dad never supported me with the flying - he hated airplanes and motorcycles. When I told them I was going to leave college and go fly planes in the army air corps, my dad said, \"Well, I've sent you through school, bought you automobiles, given you money to run around with the girls, but from here on, you're on your own. If you want to go kill yourself, go ahead, I don't give a damn.\" Then Mom just quietly said, \"Paul, if you want to go fly airplanes, you're going to be all right.\" And that was that.\n\nST: Where was that?\n\nPT: Well, that was Miami, Florida. My dad had been in the real estate business down there for years, and at that time he was retired. And I was going to school at Gainesville, Florida, but I had to leave after two years and go to Cincinnati because Florida had no medical school.\n\nST: You were thinking of being a doctor?\n\nPT: I didn't think that, my father thought it. He said, \"You're going to be a doctor,\" and I just nodded my head and that was it. And I started out that way; but about a year before, I was able to get into an airplane, fly it - I soloed - and I knew then that I had to go fly airplanes.\n\nST: Now by 1944 you were a pilot - a test pilot on the programme to develop the B-29 bomber. When did you get word that you had a special assignment?\n\nPT: One day [in September 1944] I'm running a test on a B-29, I land, a man meets me. He says he just got a call from General Uzal Ent [commander of the second air force] at Colorado Springs, he wants me in his office the next morning at nine o'clock. He said, \"Bring your clothing - your B4 bag - because you're not coming back.\" Well, I didn't know what it was and didn't pay any attention to it - it was just another assignment.\n\nI got to Colorado Springs the next morning perfectly on time. A man named Lansdale met me, walked me to General Ent's office and closed the door behind me. With him was a man wearing a blue suit, a US Navy captain - that was William Parsons, who flew with me to Hiroshima - and Dr Norman Ramsey, Columbia University professor in nuclear physics. And Norman said: \"OK, we've got what we call the Manhattan Project. What we're doing is trying to develop an atomic bomb. We've gotten to the point now where we can't go much further till we have airplanes to work with.\"\n\nHe gave me an explanation which probably lasted 45, 50 minutes, and they left. General Ent looked at me and said, \"The other day, General Arnold [commander general of the army air corps] offered me three names.\" Both of the others were full colonels; I was lieutenant-colonel. He said that when General Arnold asked which of them could do this atomic weapons deal, he replied without hesitation, \"Paul Tibbets is",

      "Mike Pence's long record of opposition to abortion has energized anti-abortion voters in a way that Trump has not. | AP Photo | Getty Pence plugs enthusiasm gap for anti-abortion voters Anti-abortion leaders were skeptical of Trump, but Pence boosts their faith in GOP ticket.\n\nDonald Trump's selection of Gov. Mike Pence as his running mate could finally make anti-abortion voters excited to vote for the Republican ticket.\n\nPence's long record of opposition to abortion has energized anti-abortion voters in a way that Trump has not. Pence wrote a bill to defund Planned Parenthood and other family planning clinics nearly a decade ago — long before it became a GOP policy staple — and he has signed numerous restrictions into state law. That gives anti-abortion voters confidence that Trump will be a champion of causes that matter most to them.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\n\"Mr. Trump's selection of Gov. Mike Pence is an affirmation of the pro-life commitments he's made and will rally the pro-life grassroots,\" said Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, which at one point during the primaries rallied voters to select anyone but Trump.\n\nThe Supreme Court's recent ruling striking some of Texas' anti-abortion restrictions, which has already started to knock down a few similar laws in other states, raised the profile of the abortion debate this year. And the vacancy on the Supreme Court after Antonin Scalia's death — and other openings possible during the next administration — added even more intensity.\n\nAnti-abortion groups opposed Trump until he solidified his grasp on the Republican nomination and pledged to appoint \"pro-life\" judges, defund Planned Parenthood and support a 20-week abortion ban — a top legislative priority of anti-abortion groups in state legislatures and in Congress.\n\nThose promises gave the anti-abortion advocates enough confidence to support him. But the enthusiasm was missing.\n\nAnti-abortion groups worried that Trump — who in the late 1990s was espousing pro-abortion rights views — didn't display the heartfelt opposition to abortion and concern for the \"unborn\" that drives their backers to the polls. Pence's long record on abortion moved that needle immediately.\n\n\"With a solid pro-life voting record on abortion during his time in Congress, and through his pro-life actions as Indiana governor, Mike Pence has proven himself to be a strong leader for the right to life,\" said Carol Tobias, president of National Right to Life, another key group that mobilizes voters.\n\nAs a member of the House, Pence introduced legislation to defund Planned Parenthood and other clinics that perform abortion beginning in 2007, long before cutting off Planned Parenthood became a GOP rallying cry last year. He also supported bills that would require women to get an ultrasound before an abortion.\n\nAs governor, Pence signed multiple anti-abortion bills into law, including a cut to Planned Parenthood funding. During his tenure, Scott County experienced an outbreak of HIV, which some linked to the closure of a local Planned Parenthood clinic that had done testing.\n\nMost recently, Pence signed a controversial bill that would prohibit abortions at any stage of pregnancy based solely on the race, gender or on the diagnosis of a disability or a fetal abnormality.\n\nThat legislation has since been blocked by a federal judge. Indiana has not yet appealed but signaled that it might.\n\nPence has signed legislation that restricts abortion in all circumstances except for the life of the mother — meaning no exemptions for pregnancies resulting from rape or incest. That's a key difference from the top of the ticket: Trump has said that he wants to restrict abortion, but backs those three exceptions.\n\nThat stance by Pence particularly angers abortion rights supporters.\n\n\"Not only does he believe we should defund Planned Parenthood, which of course provides many well-women services for many American women — pap smears, breast cancer screenings — he also thinks that if a 12-year-old girl who is raped by her stepfather and gets pregnant, he doesn't believe she should have the option of abortion,\" said Rep. Diana Degette (D-Colo.), chairman of the House Pro-Choice Caucus, who served with Pence in the House.\n\nAn enthusiasm gap could be a liability for Republicans. Anti-abortion voters have typically been a reliable part of the GOP grassroots. Not only do they turn out on Election Day, they also volunteer and get other voters to the polls.\n\nTo be sure, Hillary Clinton's ardent support for abortion rights — and the strong opposition to her candidacy by anti-abortion voters — may have made up for Trump's perceived lack of commitment on abortion.\n\nGroups that support abortion rights say having Pence on the ticket has only reinforced how bad a GOP presidency would be for women.\n\n\"Donald Trump just sent a terrifying message to the women of America: Your health and your lives are not important,\" said Dawn Laguens, executive vice president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund. \"Pence",
      "Update July 29: We have updated this article to include the responses universities gave to the stories.\n\nDuring their time at college, the Department of Justice estimates one in five women will be sexually assaulted, and as many as 95 percent of the cases go unreported.\n\nSo how are colleges failing to protect students from sexual assault? We sorted through the reporting to highlight a few cases that show the system's greatest shortcomings.\n\nWhen Football Goes on Trial\n\nLizzy Seeberg committed suicide ten days after reporting to Notre Dame campus police that she had been sexually assaulted by a Fighting Irish linebacker. As news of the allegations spread, Seeberg was threatened by the player's teammates. \"Don't do anything you would regret,\" one texted her. \"Messing with Notre Dame football is a bad idea.\" The campus authorities didn't interview the accused player until 15 days after receiving Seeberg's statement, five days after she committed suicide. The police declined to bring charges and Notre Dame declined to discuss the case when it was first reported.\n\nSince 2010, there have been investigations into rape and sexual assault by football players at the University of Missouri, Baylor College, the US Naval Academy, University of Texas, Vanderbilt, Appalachian State, and numerous others.\n\nAnd officials have frequently faced scrutiny for their response. When a freshman at Florida State University reported that star quarterback Jameis Winston had raped her, the case was kept under wraps until TMZ broke the news. The New York Times later detailed how authorities failed to promptly investigate even though records show that the athletic department knew about it less than a month after the victim came forward. The university declined to speak to the Times about the case, citing privacy laws.\n\nIn another case, a panel at Hobart and William Smith colleges in upstate New York quickly cleared three football players of a complaint brought against them by a freshman named Anna. Records of the case obtained by the New York Times showed that the football players lied to campus police at first, and then gave a story that did not align with evidence collected in Anna's medical examination. Yet because colleges usually keep those proceedings confidential to protect students' privacy, the public is kept mostly in the dark about what happens in a sexual assault hearing. Officials at Hobart and William Smith told the Times they have \"no tolerance for sexual assault.\" They also declined to answer specific questions, citing privacy laws.\n\nOnly a Slap on the Wrist\n\nIn a case that unfolded at Indiana University in 2006, a disciplinary panel concluded that a student named Margaux had been the victim of \"inappropriate sexual contact.\" Their chosen punishment? Banning the assailant from campus for the summer. After Margaux appealed the decision, the university eventually extended the suspension to a full year. By that time, Margaux had already dropped out to avoid being on the same campus as her assailant.\n\nA joint investigation by NPR and the Center for Public Integrity into Margaux's case and other college sexual assault hearings across the country found a common pattern. Sexual assault hearings have resulted in one-month suspensions and even essay assignments. Indiana University defended its suspension of the student who assaulted Margaux. \"We'd like to think we can always educate and hold accountable the student,\" a dean told CPI.\n\nPatrick Henry College: A World without Title IX\n\nPatrick Henry College, a rural evangelical institution in northern Virginia offers a window into what life is like without the protections of Title IX, which outlaws gender discrimination on college campuses. In order to remain exempt from that law, the college turns down federal funding.\n\nIn an investigation published in The New Republic, Kiera Feldman looked into the cases of several young women who dropped out of Patrick Henry after reporting being sexually assaulted by fellow students. Title IX requires colleges to have a procedure for handling harassment and sexual violence complaints and to take immediate action to ensure that victims can continue their education free from harassment or retaliation. Instead, Feldman reports, a student named Sarah and her accused assailant both received \"growth contracts\" which mainly involved weekly counseling sessions during which Sarah read aloud passages from evangelical women's self-help literature. In response to the story, the college released a detailed statement: \"Our foremost concern has always been to protect and nurture all our students.\"\n\nTaking a University to Court\n\nWhen students believe their cases have been mishandled, they can file a Title IX complaint. That's what students have done this year at Occidental, University of California at Berkeley, University of North Carolina, Dartmouth, Swarthmore, University of Southern California, and dozens of other schools.\n\nSo many sexual assault victims have filed complaints that there are now 71 schools under federal investigation for Title IX violations across the country. knowyourix.org, a site set up by advocates, lays out how you can file a complaint.\n\nFive University of Connecticut students who believed the school hadn't properly handled their sexual assault complaints took it a step further and filed a federal lawsuit in October 2013. UConn President Susan Herbst said their allegations",

      "Poor 3D sensor yield rates are expected to impact iPhone X's launch supply as Rosenblatt analyst Jun Zhang pegs current production volume at just 400,000 units per week.\n\nIn an interview with StreetInsider.com, the analyst said that the figure is actually a substantial increase from the previous estimate of 100,00 units per week.\n\nDespite the increase, Jun maintained his production estimates of 20 million and 50 million iPhone X units for the December and March quarters, respectively. In other words, Apple may be unable to meet demand for iPhone X until 2018 at the earliest.\n\nHe does not see further order push outs for the OLED phone in October.\n\nJapanese publication Nikkei said today that the sophisticated 3D sensor in Apple's TrueDepth camera, which enables Face ID and other features, remains the biggest production bottleneck.\n\nCiting a tech executive familiar with iPhone X production, Nikkei says manufacturers are still struggling to perfect 3D sensors and dot projectors in the TrueDepth camera.\n\nThe person could not pinpoint the exact manufacturing problem.\n\nIn September 2017, analyst Jeff Pu also identified the dot projector, supplied by Lumentum, as the troublesome component holding back mass production of iPhone X.

Semiconductor foundry TSMC and contract manufacturer Foxconn, for instance, both reported a drop in revenue in September due to the iPhone X manufacturing delay.\n\nThe anticipated OLED device goes for preorder on October 27 ahead of November 3 launch.",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A leading Republican in the U.S. Congress in June 2016 made a quip during a private meeting of fellow lawmakers that Russian President Vladimir Putin could be making payments to Donald Trump, the Washington Post reported on Wednesday.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy (R-CA) speaks at a news conference at the Republican National Committee Building in Washington, D.C., U.S. May 17, 2017. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein\n\nHouse of Representatives Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy made the assertion, the newspaper reported, saying the conversation was recorded last June, during the primary election season when Trump was seeking to become the Republican Party's presidential nominee.\n\nAccording to the Washington Post report, House Speaker Paul Ryan, a fellow Republican, interrupted McCarthy and urged Republicans present to keep McCarthy's remarks secret.\n\nThe newspaper report quoted McCarthy saying, \"There's two people I think Putin pays: Rohrabacher and Trump.\"\n\nMcCarthy fired back at the report on Twitter on Wednesday, saying, \"This was an attempt at humor gone wrong.\"\n\nA spokesman for Ryan said the remarks were meant as humor and had been taken out of context.\n\n\"This entire year-old exchange was clearly an attempt at humor. No one believed the majority leader was seriously asserting that Donald Trump or any of our members were being paid by the Russians,\" Ryan spokesman Brendan Buck said.\n\nRepublican Representative Dana Rohrabacher on Wednesday told reporters that McCarthy's quip was a joke. \"The trouble is, when you ever try to be funny, it is really taken seriously by a third party, and that's what's happened here,\" he said.\n\nReuters does not have a copy of the tape and could not confirm authenticity or gauge whether McCarthy was joking.",
      "Earlier this year YouTube crossed the billion-user mark, and now it's poised to surpass the five-billion-dollar mark.\n\nThe Google-owned video service is expected to record $5.6 billion in gross revenue this year, according to estimates from eMarketer. That's up 51% from last year and would equate to 11% of Google's total ad revenues.\n\nThat figure does not include money YouTube passes on to advertising partners and content creators. This year Google will keep 35% of that total or $1.96 billion, according to eMarketer's estimate. Google generally takes a 45% cut of advertising sold into its content partners, and Google's take is exected to rise in the coming years as it phases out less-favorable revenue-sharing deals with TV networks.\n\nAfter revenue sharing, YouTube will take $850 million this year from video ads served in the U.S., which is up 50% from last year. Including display ads, YouTube will will net $1.08 billion this year in U.S. ad revenues.\n\nFor context, that's still just 6.3% of all of Google's net U.S. ad revenues for the year, but 20.5% of the $4.15 billion U.S. online video ad market.\n\nGoogle doesn't release YouTube's revenue figures or break them out in public filings, so take eMarketer's numbers for what they are, an estimate based on studies conducted by other research firms, investment banks, its own analysis and interviews with marketers. Having said that, YouTube is the biggest proxy for digital video, and the projections offer a peek at where that market stands.\n\nYouTube has made a point in recent years of improving content quality in order to boost ad rates to TV levels. But for all the investments it has made in raising the volume of premium content to attract a bigger share of advertising budgets, the service seems most reliant on rising audience numbers for its revenue growth.\n\n\"Growth in impressions and viewership, particularly across devices, is probably the major growth driver [behind YouTube's ad revenues],\" said eMarketer VP-communications Clark Fredricksen.\n\nEMarketer isn't breaking out YouTube's mobile ad revenue, but Google's chief business officer Nikesh Arora said in July that the service's mobile-ad sales had grown by 300% between January and June of this year. More than 1 billion people tune in to YouTube each month, and roughly 40% of views occur on phones and tablets.\n\nYouTube's gross ad revenue estimates\n\nConsidering that YouTube's mobile apps and sites -- not to mention its connected TV apps -- are almost devoid of display advertising, it's no surprise that video ads account for the overwhelming majority of YouTube's net U.S. ad revenues.\n\nYouTube's skippable TrueView video ads play a big role in the service's rising video ad revenues, Mr. Fredricksen said. People can choose to skip the ads after 5 seconds, but advertisers only pay if someone watches at least 30 seconds or the whole ad if shorter than 30 seconds. \"Our research suggests advertisers are largely satisfied with TrueView,\" he said.\n\nRevenue-hungry content creators may be less satisfied in seeing eMarketer's revenue projections.\n\nYouTube has drawn criticism this year for keeping a big chunk -- typically 45% -- of creators' advertising revenues. The topic was a focal point at an event YouTube hosted last month for creators at its production facility in Los Angeles.\n\nDuring the Tune In summit on November 12, creators reiterated their frustrations that YouTube's revenue split is inhibiting their ability to reinvest the money generated by their videos into building and supporting a sustainable business. However many online video executives have acknowledged that YouTube unburdens these businesses of significant overhead by assuming content hosting and distribution costs. It remains to be seen whether those costs -- and their presumed increases as more people watch videos on YouTube globally -- explains the expanding divide between the growth of YouTube's net ad revenue and that of creators'.\n\nTwo years ago, YouTube banked $600 million, or 30% of its gross revenue, and paid out the remaining $1.4 billion to advertising partners and content creators.\n\nFrom 2011 to 2012, YouTube's share of ad revenue increased by 96% while creators' share increased by 80%. The growth gap widened this year: a 66% rise in YouTube's take compared to a 44% rise in creators' split.\n\nMr. Fredricksen said ad revenue should continue to grow in YouTube's favor, as renewals are negotiated and plans to keep 45% of all content partners' ad revenues. Tied to that shift, YouTube is freeing up content partners to keep any excess money from ads sold above YouTube's set prices. So while the new deal structure should solidify the upward trajectory of YouTube's net revenue, it could catalyze the service's gross revenue if content partners are able to talk advertisers into paying more.",
      "The Super Bowl wasn't the only major TV event this weekend: Netflix dropped the entire first season of House of Cards on Friday, virtually daring subscribers to consume all thirteen episodes as quickly as possible. I took that dare, and just before Sunday turned into Monday, I'd gobbled up the entire show, turned to my computer to discuss — and immediately the one major drawback of Netflix's all-at-once scheduling was obvious. Unlike with virtually every other \"adult\" drama series, there were no House of Cards recaps, reviews, or message boards. You can't tweet about it, because you risk losing a whole mess of followers. By Saturday, Girls showrunner Jenni Konner was tweeting what I felt: \"I don't know how to talk to people who aren't at least halfway through House of Cards.\" And yet, without finding some sort of safe zone, it was hard to find those people who were at least halfway through the show, let alone all the way through it. Thankfully, since I work for a Major Entertainment News Website, I have the ability to create just such a space. If you've finished season one of House of Cards, read on, as I've dumped my own random thoughts and questions about the whole series (spoilers everywhere, duh). Feel free to chime in with your own take in the comments. (Also, check back later this week when our critic Matt Zoller Seitz weighs in with his professional opinion on the full season.) And if you haven't watched it all? Come back when you have. And congratulations for having a life.\n\n— \"Twitter Twat.\"\n\n— I can't decide if I love or hate the ending. I mean, it wasn't The Killing–level bad — not even close. But after so much drama, so many twists, so many Kevin Spacey monologues ... it all ends on a frickin' BlackBerry? My current working theory is that showrunner Beau Willimon deliberately avoided going for the traditional Big Shocking Moment finale because the show isn't really a TV show, but a very long movie. This was chapter thirteen, not episode thirteen of season one. Many Future People who consume House of Cards will do so only after all episodes of the series have been completed. In such a scenario, a cliffhanger at end of the thirteenth hour is no more important than one at the end of hour six. Whatever the reason, while the finale wasn't as explosive as I wanted, it perfectly set up the next phase of the story: Frank is poised to become VOTUS, if only those meddling bloggers don't get in the way.\n\n— Two episodes in, Matt Zoller Seitz had zero love for Kevin Spacey's direct comments to the audience. But for me, Spacey talking to the camera ultimately became one of my favorite things about the show. Breaking the fourth wall this way works far better than the 5 million TV and film characters who narrate stories with voice-over. And while it's not a new idea (it's borrowed from the original British drama, which I haven't seen), I'd argue it hasn't been used so effectively since the days of Ferris Bueller and Moonlighting. It also makes you forget you're supposed to hate a character so fundamentally, well … evil. Owning up to your sins does not absolve you from them, but it at least makes Frank someone for whom I could actually root.\n\n— Robin Wright threatens to steal the entire series from Spacey several times throughout. She was never less than riveting. (Well, except maybe when she was with Adam Galloway. I do not believe Claire is a woman who has time for long walks in Central Park, taking pictures of strangers.)\n\n— Still, Spacey is what makes the show addictive. Even the clunkiest lines of dialogue (and you notice clunky much more when you gulp down an entire season in two days) are redeemed by his superior acting skills. There's no question he'll be nominated for an Emmy. (Wright, too.)\n\n— Are we supposed to read something deeper into the recurring theme of origami animals?\n\n— David Fincher and Willimon obviously hate journalists more than politicians. In All the President's Men, those of us in the fourth estate are heroes. In House of Cards, the D.C. press will do anything (or anyone) for a scoop.\n\n— I despise Zoe Barnes. People who whine about Hannah being self-involved on Girls need to watch House of Cards. That said, I begrudgingly respect her honesty: \"You're so sweet. But if I was going to f--k you, you'd know.\"\n\n— Also: When Zoe was being courted by every news organization in Washington, shouldn't she have at least asked for enough money to move into a nicer apartment? One without spiders?\n\n— The moment when Frank tells Claire he's sleeping with Zoe",
      "Warning: Storyline and character spoilers ahead for \"The Comic Book Store Regeneration\" episode of The Big Bang Theory.\n\nNever again will we hear the shrill voice of Debbie Wolowitz bellow \"Hooow-ARD!\" at the top of her lungs, for the funny — but never fully seen onscreen — lady who birthed the tight pants-wearing Howard Wolowitz is gone. In an episode that dealt with the real-life death of hilarious character actress Carol Ann Susi, Mrs. Wolowitz also passed away, failing to wake up from a nap while visiting her sister in Florida.\n\nThe Big Bang Theory showrunner Steven Molaro talks to Yahoo TV about dealing with the heartbreaking loss of the cast's beloved co-star and honoring her and her character. He also discusses how Mrs. W's death will affect Howard and his friends, the special guest star who provided some welcome moments of levity in the episode, and what's ahead for Shamy and roomies Sheldon and Leonard.\n\nView photos Carol Ann Susi More\n\nCongratulations, Steve. Tone is so critical when dealing with a storyline like this one on a sitcom, and this felt like a fine tribute to Mrs. Wolowitz.\n\nThank you. Carol Ann Susi was a lovely lady and a member of our family that we cared about very much. So it was important to us to come up with a way of honoring her that reflected how much we care about her.\n\n\nViewers know Susi from her work on Seinfeld, The King of Queens, and most of all The Big Bang Theory, but what was she like on the set?\n\nShe was just a truly funny, very sweet, very interesting lady. She reminded me of your favorite crazy aunt, who you loved getting to visit with.\n\n\nIs it true that she didn't drive, that she took a bus everywhere in Los Angeles, even to auditions?\n\n[Laughs.] Yes, yes. She was very New York. She didn't have a car there, and she just stuck with it here.\n\n\nWas there any consideration of not writing her death into the show? Having the character move away?\n\nWe talked about all the possibilities. It was public information that Carol Ann had passed away, so having Mrs. Wolowitz move away felt, I think, potentially like a cheat. And the thought of having another actress do the voice just didn't seem like an option for us. I don't think we could have brought ourselves to actually do it. That left dealing with the reality of it. We tried to find a way to do that which let the show still remain a comedy, but deal with this very difficult moment in these characters' — especially Wolowitz's — lives.\n\n\nHow did you begin tackling it?\n\nI don't know. I had never been involved in writing an episode like this before. There's a lot of other things going on in this episode that have nothing to do with [her death], and that, I think, helped a lot. When the moment comes, we just tried to handle it as honestly as we could, certainly not try to force jokes in where they didn't feel like they would belong. I think we managed to do it.\n\n\nAnd actually, now that I think about it, the morning that Carol Ann passed away, we were obviously stunned and shaken up. We were in production that week, and everybody gathered on the stage. Chuck [Lorre] had delivered the news to everyone, and it just naturally turned into a memorial to her. Everyone on the stage cried and shared their wonderful memories and stories of Carol Ann. And even in the tension and pain of that moment, people were able to still laugh about how wonderful she was. This was 15 minutes after hearing the news. I think it was in the spirit of that… at the end of the episode, I guess we were subconsciously trying to capture that mood of sad but sweet and celebratory.",

      "Aphex Twin marks his first new record in 11 months with the slow-motion bounce cooked up on the Cheetah EP for Warp.\n\nUsing the impossibly rare digital synth the Cheetah ms800 (which was discontinued in the early 90's and from what synth heads say of it, was for good measure) to create the base( bass) of each track, this relatively unknown digital synth is said to be impossibly hard to programme but those who manage to crack the code, it has the capacity to spill forth 'low-fi digital weirdness', so who better really than RDJ to tackle such a puzzling machine? The first half of the EP rolls out an unexpected squashed acidic (almost) dub techno suite with CHEETAHT2 [Ld spectrum] and CHEETAHT7b. Both revolve around a dazed 4x4 kick that spirals into view with the Cheetah's neon-crystal like synth gloss wrapping itself around the beat with a radioactive sheen that places the tracks way outside any of the recent years Aphex/AFX excursions, whilst sounding like a spun out update of early grime and sublow styles (for which Aphex was a champion on the Rephlex Grime & Grime 2 comps) imagine if early SND had moved in the direction of grime instead of UKG and you are a few inches close to what we have here. These are followed by the quickfire analogue bubbles of CHEETA1b ms800 and CHEETA2 ms800 that disappear as fast as they float out of the speakers.\n\nThe second half of the EP is sure-fire classic Aphex in the making, fan fav (check the video if you haven't seen it!) CIRKLON3 [ Kolkhoznaya mix ] mixes up a techstep funk number with the robotic blues of The Man-Machine-era Kraftwerk with the raw melancholy of the most slippery Analord acid. CIRKLON 1 speeds up the tempo but matches the vibe for crunchy half time jungle noir, here he really unleashes his programming skills to the max by expelling melodies like no other, while the keen-eared out there will note audio flashbacks to certain selected (possibly) related works. Before 2X202-ST5 brings the EP to a close with a taught skeletal shuffle that pivots around a solid snare roll whilst the bass line growls with added squelch underneath adding a slight air of psychedelic madness to the mix whilst ensuring its place as a true DJ weapon for the 6 am head splitters.\n\nTo our ears Cheetah is a continuation of the endless proof that comes with each new record that Aphex is one of the greatest experimental musicians the world has ever seen. Much like Iannis Xenakis's experiments in 1961 pioneering the use of computers to compose music, Aphex Twin in 2016 is a sound scientist whose tools others can't even begin to comprehend the workings of. By using a piece of impossibly rare equipment to compose an extended player, he has done what few others ever will, producing sounds out of the machine that, at the time of its creation, its designers could never have even dreamed of.",

On the May 29 edition of his Fox Business show, Lou Dobbs described a Pew Research study that found a record number of women are now the economic breadwinners of their families as full of \"concerning and troubling statistics.\" Dobbs said the study was suggestive of \"society dissolv[ing] around us,\" and Fox contributors Erick Erickson and Juan Williams agreed:\n\nWILLIAMS: What we're seeing with four out of 10 families, now the woman is the primary breadwinner. You're seeing the disintegration of marriage, you're seeing men who were hard hit by the economic recession in ways that women weren't. But you're seeing, I think, systemically, larger than the political stories that we follow every day, something going terribly wrong in American society, and it's hurting our children, and it's going to have impact for generations to come. [...] ERICKSON: When you look at biology, look at the natural world, the roles of a male and female in society, and the other animals, the male typically is the dominant role. The female, it's not antithesis, or it's not competing, it's a complimentary role. We as people in a smart society have lost the ability to have complimentary relationships in nuclear families, and it's tearing us apart.

      "In the ongoing melodrama between Democrats and Wall Street, few characters are more compelling than Chuck Schumer. New York's senior senator has a well-cultivated reputation as the financial world's top wing man in Washington, at least among Democrats. But since he also hopes to lead his august chamber one day, he's charted a more ecumenical path of late. That, of course, hasn't exactly endeared him to the lords of finance, and so much pathos has ensued.\n\nThe latest example comes from a Politico piece on Schumer's efforts to make nice with his patrons now that all that ugly \"reform\" business is behind us. As one such oligarch summed up Schumer's recent goodwill tour: \"He's always been active in his outreach, but I would say he's on much more of a listening — not talking — tour at the moment as he tries to mend fences.\" Can't wait to see what all that listenin' means for the future of financial regulation!\n\nBut I digress. Because it turns out people have long memories on the Upper East Side, and all is most certainly not forgotten, much less forgiven. The nub of the matter? Well, take it away, Politico:\n\n\"He pushed, bullied people really, into giving him money for so long telling us, 'I'm in the rooms you want me to be in, I can help,'\" said a Wall Street executive and one-time Schumer donor who refuses to give any more cash to the senator. \"We understand that he wants to be [Democratic] leader and as he's moved up the ranks, he can't publicly be too much of a cheerleader for Wall Street. But he wasn't even cheerleading behind closed doors, which is what he promised he would do.\"\n\nWhich made me wonder: What, exactly, was all this non-cheerleading Schumer is supposedly guilty of?",

      "Following false rumors that police had possibly arrested Banksy (see \"Has Banksy Been Arrested Outside London?\"), the British street artist has painted a new piece, the Telegraph reports. The work was created on the side of a building near the docks in the English city of Bristol, but by Tuesday morning the mural had already been defaced with a splatter of black paint.\n\nThe mural, entitled Girl with a Pierced Eardrum (2014), parodies Johannes Vermeer's masterpiece Girl with a Pearl Earring (1665) and features a yellow outdoor alarm box as the girl's earring. The artist published a series of photographs of the new work on his website, without commenting on the fake story about his arrest and outing as a mid-aged British man named Paul Horner.\n\nOn Monday a story published on the satirical American news website National Report claimed that London's Metropolitan Police had arrested the artist on charges of \"vandalism, conspiracy, racketeering and counterfeiting.\" The false arrest reports that his studio had been raided by Police turned out to be recycled story from a previous hoax.\n\nThe Girl with the Pierced Eardrum (2014) follows Banksy's recent pieces Art Buff (2014), in Folkestone, England, which was vandalized only weeks after appearing (see \"Phallic Addition to Folkestone Banksy Mural\"), and Birds of a Feather (2014) which was removed by the local government who deemed it to be racist (see \"Immigration-Themed Banksy Mural Destroyed by Local Council\").\n\nIt is the second time this year the artist has graced his hometown of Bristol with a Banksy original. Shortly after Mobile Lovers was unveiled on Banksy's website, it was controversially snatched by the leader of a local youth club hoping to keep his struggling organization afloat (see \"Youth Club Removes New Banksy with Crowbar\"). The artist later gave the club his blessing, and it was sold to benefit the group (see \"Banksy Gives Controversial Mobile Lovers Artwork to Bristol Youth Club\" and \"Sale of Banksy's Mobile Lovers for $670,000 Saves Youth Club\").\n\nFollow artnet News on Facebook:",

Today it looks as good as when The Saint last stepped out of it.\n\nThe iconic original Volvo P1800 coupe driven by Roger Moore as Simon Templar in the 1960s TV series has been fully restored by car enthusiast Kevin Price.\n\n\nIt went on public display at the weekend for the first time since he finished the labour of love.\n\nMr Price found the car on a farm in North Wales in 1991 and persuaded the owner to sell it to him in 1997. He spent ten years collecting parts and another six on the restoration.\n\nScroll down for video...\n\n\nSorry sight: The original Volvo from TV series The Saint when it was found rotting away on a farm 22 years ago Fully restored: The 1962 car after the 16-year project to bring it back to its former glory\n\nIn The Saint, which featured Moore as a suave modern-day Robin Hood-style adventurer and was screened by ITV between 1962 and 1969, the car bore the number plate ST1.\n\n\nAlthough four more P1800s, one of which was used by Sir Roger personally, were later supplied by Volvo, Mr Price's vehicle – registered as 71 DXC – is the original.\n\nIt was displayed at the Footman James Manchester Classic Car Show.\n\n\nMr Price, 57, who founded the Volvo Enthusiasts Club, drove it there from his home in Bewdley, Worcestershire.\n\nHe said: 'I fell in love with the shape of the car and it became a quest to find one.\n\n'After I'd set up the club I was approached by a guy from North Wales who said he had the original car from the The Saint.\n\n'I went to have a look and it was just sat next to the barn covered in brambles and nettles with the engine on the back seat.\n\n'But when he finally agreed to sell and I got it home it was in surprisingly good shape considering it had been there so long.\n\n'As much of the original car was retained as possible and it drives beautifully.

It's a beautiful car and I still drive a Volvo to this day.'\n\nBut Sir Roger and The Saint producers had initially wanted to feature a Jaguar E-type.\n\nBut Jag were inundated with offers and declined to take part so the P1800, which was first-built at the Jensen Motors factory in the West Midlands before production was switched to Sweden, was used instead.",

Amongst the lavish exchanges of goods which accompanied the negotiations with the Tokugawa, 'the king [Hidetada] sent 2 varnished Armors, a present to his Majesty the King of England, also a Tatch or long sword and a wagadash [wakizashi] a present from him to my self' (British Library; Shogun, the life of lord Tokugawa Ieyasu, Leeds, 2005, no. 48; The voyage of Captain John Saris to Japan, 1613, ed. E. Satow, Hukluyt Society 2.5, London, 1900, 134). Saris returned to Plymouth on 27 September 1614. One of the two armours appeared in the sale inventory of King Charles I, 1649-50, 'one Indian box with an Indian armor in it, a head peece, a vizard, back and brest, two sleeves with gantletts, one placard for ye brest & one for ye back, two pieces for ye thighs & legs & three small brass plates' (see A. MacGregor, The late King's goods, London, 1989, 353-4). This appears to be the blue and red laced domaru on loan from the Royal Collection (no. AL.27 11), also by Iwai Yozaemon, and it was sold to Bass for L10.\n\n\nThe 'View and Survey of the Tower armouries' of 1660 included an 'armour sent to his now Majesty, Charles the second, by the great Mogull, consisting of backe, breast, taces headpiece, vizor and pieces of the greaves'. This appears to be the present red and purple armour. It was placed on display and excited considerable public interest. In July 1662, 'many persons of quality went to the armoury in the Tower of London to see that most noble and strong defence for the body, the suit of armour sent from the emperor Mougul, which suit was presented to His Majesty the King of England' (Thomas Rugge, Mercurius Politicus Redivivus, 1659-72). In 1688 a valuation of L5 was placed upon the armour. By 1972 after 300 years of constant museum display the armour had fallen into a dreadful state of disrepair, so that it had been too poor to take part in the Exhibition of Japanese Armour of 1965, and it was sent to Japan to be restored by the armourer Hiromichi Miura, through the generosity of Mitsukoshi Ltd.\n\n\nThe two armours, both signed by Iwai Yozaemon of Nambu, one of the most acclaimed of the Iwai and the personal armourer of Tokugawa Ieyasu, form part of a series of presentation armours by the same maker, all of domaru type, which may be seen in a number of European collections. Four are in the Musee de l'Armee, Paris (nos G.751-4). Two are in Schloss Ambras near Innsbruck (nos PA.586-7). One of the two royal gift armours in Copenhagen is signed by Iwai Yozaemon (from the Royal Danish Kunstkammer, nos EAb31-2). Two more are in the Real Armeria, Madrid (nos E-133-4). Both of these were damaged in the fire of 1884 in the Real Armeria, but one (E-133 with the kote now shown with E-134) was illustrated in its original state by Gaspard Sensi in Achille Jubinal, La Armeria Real, Paris, 1839 2, no. 13.\n\n\nGift of weapons from Tokugawa Iemochi to Queen Victoria\n\n\nWhen modern American warships arrived in 1853 the Japanese could not refuse the demands to open their ports to foreign ships. Other nations quickly arranged diplomatic relations with Japan, including Britain, which sent an envoy in 1859.\n\n\nThe new relationship included an exchange of gifts in 1860: Japanese arms and armour, some of which can be seen here, were sent to Queen Victoria from Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi.

      "MOUNT VERNON, Wash. -- An Interstate 5 bridge over a river north of Seattle collapsed Thursday evening, dumping vehicles and people into the water, the Washington State Patrol said.\n\nThe four-lane bridge over the Skagit River collapsed about 7 p.m., Trooper Mark Francis said.\n\n\nKari Ranten, a spokeswoman for Skagit Valley Hospital, said two people who were injured in the collapse were en route to the facility. She said another person was being transported to a different area hospital.\n\nIt also was not known what caused the collapse of the bridge about 60 miles north of Seattle in Skagit County, which stretches from the North Cascades National Park to a cluster of islands off the Washington coast.\n\nXavier Grospe, 62, who lives near the river, said he could see three cars with what appeared to be one person per vehicle. The vehicles were sitting still in the water, partially submerged and partly above the waterline, and the apparent drivers were sitting either on top of the vehicles or on the edge of open windows.\n\n\"It doesn't look like anybody's in danger right now,\" Grospe said.\n\nHelicopter footage aired by KOMO-TV in Seattle showed several rescue boats at the bridge collapse scene with several ambulances waiting on the shore. One rescue boat left the scene with one person strapped into a stretcher.\n\nA damaged red car and a damaged pickup truck were visible in the water, which appeared so shallow it barely reached the top of the car's hood.\n\nNo fatalities in collapse, authorities say WSDOT says it was investigating whether an oversize load may have struck the bridge.\n\nCrowds of people lined the river to watch the scene unfold.\n\nGov. Jay Inslee's office said he was on his way to the scene to assess the situation.\n\nThe bridge is not considered structurally deficient but is listed as being \"functionally obsolete\" - a category meaning that their design is outdated, such as having narrow shoulders are low clearance underneath, according to a database compiled by the Federal Highway Administration.\n\nThe bridge was built in 1955 and has a sufficiency rating of 57.4 out of 100, according to federal records. That is well below the statewide average rating of 80, according to an Associated Press analysis of federal data, but 759 bridges in the state have a lower sufficiency score.\n\nDemocratic Rep. Judy Clibborn, who leads the transportation committee in the state House, said the bridge wasn't one that has been a focus for lawmakers.\n\n\"It isn't anything that was on our radar screen as being an issue,\" Clibborn said. \"It is shocking that I-5 would have something happen like this.\"\n\nAccording to a 2012 Skagit County Public Works Department report, 42 of the county's 108 bridges that are 50 years or older. The document says eight of the bridges are more than 70 years old and two are over 80.\n\nWashington state was given a C in the American Society of Civil Engineers' 2013 infrastructure report card and a C- when it came to the state's bridges. The group said more than a quarter of Washington's 7,840 bridges are considered structurally deficient of functionally obsolete.\n\n-- The Associated Press",
      "In an effort to combat falling birth rates in Italy, the country's health ministry announced plans to launch its first ever Fertility Day on September 22. The day will focus on celebrating parenthood , encouraging people to start families , and spreading awareness about health conditions that can hinder fertility. The Italian government is promoting the day with a website , a computer game (yep, really) and a series of ads.\n\nIf the idea of the event itself weren't questionable enough, the ads are what really took the cake—and sparked outrage from Italian citizens on Twitter and throughout the internet. The ads feature cheeky images of couples' feet in bed, women holding up hourglasses (ladies, your baby-making window is dwindling!), and women holding their stomachs. Lest you think men are exempt from the shaming parade, another ad features an image of a rotting banana peel alongside a fear-mongering phrase about male fertility.\n\nOne ad features the saying, \"Beauty has no age. But fertility does.\" Another says, \"Get a move on! Don't wait for the stork,\" while another still urges Italians to \"go forth and multiply.\" One of the most striking reads, \"Young parents. The best way to be creative.\"\n\nIt's not too much of a stretch to imagine why this campaign has infuriated some Italian citizens. Low birth rates are a real issue, but this is not the way to handle the problem. For starters, it's hard to imagine that these guilt-tripping ads will be very effective—if young Italians are anything like most millennials around the world, their parents are probably providing them with all the pressure to have kids that they can take already, thank you very much. If their parents' overbearing pleas to hurry up and give them grandchildren haven't gotten the job done, an awkwardly constructed advertisement isn't going to either. (Also, FYI, women are not single-service baby machines and do not exist solely to reproduce on demand.)\n\nOf course, an even more serious issue raised by this campaign is that the decision to have children is way too personal and life-changing to be taken lightly. A low birth rate may be concerning, but what's potentially even more concerning is pressuring people to have kids before they're ready to emotionally or physically care for them. Kids born to parents who aren't ready for them have higher odds of growing up with economic insecurity, and may suffer psychogically if their parents aren't yet emotionally prepared to raise children. Italy is in the midst of battling staggering youth unemployment rates, which is likely part of the reason citizens are putting off parenthood to begin with. Encouraging these same youth to bring babies into the world before they feel financially prepared to do so misses the root of the problem, and spreads a sexist and reductive message in the process. Perhaps the campaign came from good intentions, but there's got to be a better way.\n\nRelated:\n\nYou May Also Like: A Runner's Guide To Paris\n\nPhoto Credit: Twitter / Paul Antonin / Getty",

      "I wanted to write my experience on how my husband helped me see the TTATT (the truth about the truth). First, let me mention that he wrote his own experience a couple months ago under the name Sanchy. For his story please click here….. http://www.jehovahs-witness.com/topic/5148261828526080/walking-thin-line-resigning-elder My husband first told me about the doubts he was having in late October of 2015. I was also \"weak\" spiritually ever since we had our son the year before. I found it very difficult to go preaching, listen to meetings, find time for personal study etc. We got pregnant again only 6 months after I gave birth to our first so that didn't help the stress we already felt. I explain all this in order to explain why I didn't give it much importance or worry when my husband told me about his doubts the first time. I figured it was a weak moment in our lives spiritually, that we were going through a lot, and this shall pass. And for a while I thought it had because he never mentioned it again, until about the beginning of December. I of course realized it was more serious than I thought. I saw that he was very distraught and confused so I wanted to know what his doubts were so I could help him. It shocked me to say the least to learn about some of his doubts, views on subjects like today's \"last days\" etc. So much so that I was sure Satan had influenced him. But I truly wanted to help him and let him vent on his thoughts, confusion, sadness, etc. To make a long story short we spent pretty much every night discussing many topics that he would bring up, and try to find the answers in the bible. Never did he show me any apostate material. Although he did tell me of some of the things he read in the book Crisis of Conscious. But I have to say I'm pretty proud of the fact that I came to my realization not by any \"apostate\" material but only through comparing the WT publications to the bible. After a while doubts would rise in my mind as well about things such paradise earth, earthly resurrection, the other sheep, great crowd, 1914, etc. At first I didn't want to share with him that he had gotten me to have doubts, not for the sake of winning an argument but because I wanted to help and if I admitted that some things were crazy then it would make it worse. I just figured there was an explanation that I couldn't find the answer to in order to help him. After a while though I did not care to show my doubts, as so many things just didn't add up anymore….still I believed though.I didn't really care about things like wrong doctrine or failed dates from the past. I would just brush it off as the organization making human errors and the \"light getting brighter\". I also figured if Jesus said he would judge the faithful and discreet slave in his return this meant that they could make mistakes and have room for errors and imperfection. Funny how we JW'S will go so far to defend the WT organization. I figured as long as we have it right NOW, it's ok. Until the day I found out we don't. One night my husband showed me a crazy explanation for Ezekiel 4:15-16 from the book Finished Mystery (pg # 697 text version) which \"prophesized\" that God would separate Russell from his wife and that he was not to mourn his wife, but rather remain in his service to God in the temple. This was by far the craziest thing I had ever heard, and it seems this book is full of it. Then he showed me how the WT book Revelation mentions this book as one that denounced false religion….how ironic. This disturbed me so I wanted to look further to see if any new publication spoke well about this book. I found an article from the March 2016 WT magazine which mentions this book \"strengthened god's people\". That was it for me….Let me just say that nobody comes to the conclusion that this is not the truth in the same fashion. Everyone is affected by something different and you gotta find what that something is…..regardless here are some things my husband did that definitely worked! 1. He did not show me any \"apostate\" material -though he would study it before hand and bring new \"doubt\" topics to me every night! My naïve self thought it was all coming from his head. ☺ 2. He never criticized or put down the organization, GB, elders, etc. Very important since one is so sensitive to that subject when you believe they are directed by Jehovah. 3. Even though we would definitely get into some arguments sometimes he never disrespected my beliefs. We always spoke very truthfully and honestly to each other. …even if it hurt…through tears and sorrow. It's good for both of you to let it",
      "Ottawa\n\nThe Conservative government is continuing to play coy over its plans to reform Old Age Security, and Canadians anxious about their retirement will have to cool their heels until the upcoming budget for details.\n\nIn Question Period on Thursday, Seniors Minister Alice Wong let slip the measures would be in the budget – expected sometime in March – a fact later confirmed by the Prime Minister's Office.\n\nEarlier, Finance Minister Jim Flaherty had refused to say whether the pension reforms hinted at by Prime Minister Stephen Harper last week in a speech in Davos, Switzerland, would be revealed in the fiscal plan.\n\n\"I won't go into specific options,\" he told reporters on a conference call from Tel Aviv, where he is wrapping up a tour of the Middle East with Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird.\n\nMeanwhile, the NDP was quick to exploit doubts about the future of OAS and sparked a fourth day of debate in the House with a motion calling for the government to end poverty among seniors.\n\nQuebec Premier Jean Charest also hammered the feds for keeping their lips zipped on their plans and for leaving the provinces out in the cold on discussions.\n\n\"Since when in Canada do you have no dialogue, no debate, no exchange of information,\" he said following a speech in Ottawa, speculating Harper dropped the pension bombshell before laying the groundwork.\n\n\"I can't understand why they're acting this way.\"\n\nAmong the likely reforms will be to boost the age of eligibility for OAS from 65 to 67.\n\nThe government has also repeatedly said any changes wouldn't affect current retirees or those nearing retirement.",
      "The University of Illinois at Chicago College of Nursing has been selected as one of 32 schools nationwide to receive the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Future of Nursing Scholars grant, aimed at increasing the number of nurses earning doctoral degrees in research. It's the third consecutive year UIC has been selected for the grant.\n\nThe program provides financial support, mentoring, and leadership development for nurses, selected by their college, who commit to earning their doctoral degrees in three years. This year, UIC chose Mary Hannan and Stephanie Ezell to receive the scholarship. They join Laren Riesche (2014), Alison Hernandez and Keesha Roach (both 2015), as past UIC winners.\n\n\"The UIC College of Nursing is delighted to be selected as a three-time recipient of this prestigious award,\" said Catherine Vincent, interim associate dean for academic affairs and associate professor of women, children and family health science. \"We are grateful for the commitment to accelerate the development of future nurse leaders and scholars who have the potential to advance nursing science and address critical issues.\"\n\nHannan, after working several years in a variety of clinical and administrative settings, found herself drawn back to academia to \"fulfill my passion to transform healthcare through nurse-driven doctoral research.\" She served as a research and teaching assistant while pursuing a master's of science degree at Marquette University and was an adjunct faculty member there several years later.\n\n\"I am passionate about nursing, and my students have told me that I exude that in the classroom,\" she said.\n\nHannan has been practicing as a gerontology acute-care nurse practitioner at a variety of academic medical centers. She has not only worked as a clinician, but also participated in numerous research projects, mostly with patients suffering from acute or chronic kidney disease.\n\n\"I've been inspired by my patients who require hemodialysis three times per week to sustain their lives,\" she said. \"I want to help them maintain hope and health while dealing with their debilitating illness. Our medical system is adept at treating acute illness but needs to work on increasing the quality of life for patients with chronic illnesses.\"\n\nHannan has participated in several research projects in her career, and she wants to continue to do so as she furthers her education. She is particularly interested in studying how the use of exercise can improve the lives of patients with chronic diseases, especially those with end stage renal disease in underserved areas.\n\n\"While working with my dialysis patients, I was amazed by their inactivity level and wondered why prescribing, recommending, or even educating patients about exercise was not part of my routine practice,\" said Hannan, who has completed eight marathons and four triathlons. \"I believe physical activity plays a critical role in the health of both the well and the chronically ill.\"\n\nEzell, prior to entering nursing, spent 15 years as a high school teacher in Texas, teaching a range of subjects, including math, chemistry, biology and photography. She always had an interest in science, so she \"took a leap and did something different,\" enrolling first in the College of Nursing's Graduate Entry Program, and now its Ph.D. program. The transition, she said, has been smooth.\n\n\"I was attracted to UIC because of its strong research base, and I've had a great deal of support from the faculty,\" she said. Her goal is to perform research and also teach.\n\nDuring the pre-licensure portion of her program, Ezell began volunteer work with hospice patients. She discovered she wants to enter public health and focus on end-of-life research.\n\n\"I have a strong interest in social justice, and I am interested in assisting patients and families who are struggling at the end of their lives,\" said Ezell, who earned her master's degree in nursing and public health in May. \"Everyone gets to this stage with unique experiences. Some have endured trauma or other types of psychological distress. I want to learn how to help them make decisions and gain peace.\"",
      "NBC is touting its coverage of the 2016 Summer Olympics as the \"most successful media event in history.\" And to be sure, the massive effort the company put into live streaming and digital efforts from Rio de Janeiro paid off pretty well.\n\nBut in terms of TV ratings? Not so much. The games end as the lowest-rated and least-watched Summer Olympics since 2000.\n\nWhatever metric NBC is using to uphold its \"most successful\" claim isn't clear. Streaming of the Rio Games was indeed way up vs. 2012 in London: 100 million unique users (a 29 percent bump from 2012) streamed 3.3 billion minutes of the games; 2.7 billion of those minutes were devoted to live streams, the rest to replays and highlights. The live streaming was more than the combined live-streamed minutes of all prior Olympics (1.48 billion).\n\nOf course, there was a lot more to see this time around: NBC live-streamed 4,500 hours of competition compared to 3,500 hours four years ago. Still, that's an impressive feat, and the one thing most Olympics observers seem to agree NBC did well this time around was its digital product.\n\nBut the on-air Olympics, even with simultaneous cable and live-streaming added to NBC's prime-time total, are down. In both viewers and household ratings (which are useful for historical comparisons), Rio 2016 represents the lowest-rated Summer Olympics since 2000 in Sydney and the second-lowest since NBC took over the summer games in 1988. Here's how the NBC-only numbers stack up:\n\nYear Site Viewers (millions) Household rating 1996 Atlanta 33.3 21.8 2012 London 31.1 17.5 2008 Beijing 27.7 16.2 1992 Barcelona 25.9 17.1 1988 Seoul 25.3 17.1 2004 Athens 24.6 15.0 2016 Rio de Janeiro 24.5 14.8 2000 Sydney 21.5 13.8\n\nLondon was NBC's highest-rated Summer Olympics staged outside the United States. This year's games were down 21 percent in viewers and 15 percent in households vs. 2012 for all nights. (NBC has been touting the numbers for the 15 nights of competition as closer to London's average, but those exclude the opening and closing ceremonies, which took big hits vs. four years ago.)\n\nIn adults 18-49, NBC's coverage averaged a 6.9 rating, a 27 percent drop from the 9.5 for London 2012. They're also lower than the 7.5 average for the NBA Finals in June.\n\nIn the realm of dubious statistics, the \"reach\" number — i.e., the number of people who watched at least a minute of Olympics coverage on NBC — is down as well. NBC says 198 million people gave at least a passing glance at the games this year, down from the press release-leading number of 219.4 million in 2012.\n\nThe network is also playing up NBC's margin of victory (249 percent in viewers over the combined average of ABC, CBS and FOX) over the other broadcast networks as second only to London. That may say more about the overall decline in broadcast viewership than anything.\n\nHere is the final comparison of the 2016 and 2012 Olympics:\n\nDay 2016 total audience (millions) 2016 NBC only (millions) 2012 total audience (millions) 2016 total HH rating 2012 total HH rating Opening ceremony (Fri.) 26.5 26.5 40.7 13.9 21.0 1st Sat. 23.5 20.6 28.7 13.0 15.8 1st Sun. 31.8 29.8 36.0 17.3 19.8 1st Mon. 31.5 28.9 31.6 18.1 18.0 1st Tues. 36.1 33.4 38.7 20.5 21.8 1st Weds. 28.6 26.4 30.8 16.5 17.9 1st Thurs. 33.0 31.2 36.8 18.9 21.1 2nd Fri. 26.0 24.0 28.5 15.0 16.2 2nd Sat. 26.8 25.5 28.0 15.0 15.9 2nd Sun. 28.1 26.7 31.3 15.8 17.5 2nd Mon. 25.5 24.2 26.6 14.9 15.8 2nd Tues. 25.6 24.1 30.1 14.3 17.6 2nd Weds. 22.1 20.7 29.1 13.3 16.8 2nd Thurs. 22.9 21.7 22.9 13.6 13.6 3rd Fri. 21.1 20.0 22.5 12.3 13.2 3rd Sat. 16.3 15.4 21.8 9.6 12.6 Closing ceremony 17.0 17.0 31.0 9.",

      "When people find out I teach mindfulness and meditation, many of them jokingly ask me if I'm enlightened. It's fitting, because mindfulness and meditation are often associated with Eastern philosophy. And, even people who have never studied those traditions have heard tales of \"instant enlightenment\" as a result of solving a Zen koan, or hearing a parable.\n\nIn the West, we talk about discovering the \"meaning of life,\" or the secret to happiness. Regardless of what we call it, it all points to the notion that there is something you can learn which will instantly transform you into a magical \"state of being\" where you completely understand existence, and have all the answers.\n\nBefore we go any further, I want to make sure I don't mislead you: I am not enlightened, and I don't know the meaning of life. I'm also a firm believer that if someone tells you they are enlightened, you should run fast in the opposite direction.\n\nI do, however, think I know what enlightenment might be…at least from my perspective. And it doesn't involve some wise old sage sitting on a mountain top, counseling people who have traveled from distant lands.\n\nIn my opinion, enlightenment isn't an \"event\" that happens, it's a path that you walk. That path is paved with the following insights:\n\nI am not my thoughts; I can observe my mind, and I don't have to blindly follow it. The only time I can live life is now. I am responsible for my suffering — it isn't caused by external factors (other people or things). I am connected to everyone and everything else — I'm not alone on an island, suffering the trials and tribulations of life by myself.\n\nIn previous articles here on Medium, I discussed the first two points. To summarize: through a consistent meditation practice, you can learn to understand your mind and how to deal with the challenges it creates in your daily life. Our normal condition is \"lost in thought,\" but it doesn't have to be — we can learn to separate reality from the stories playing in our heads. In doing so, we can improve our lives dramatically.\n\nMeditation and mindfulness also teach you that the present moment is all you have. Your mind tries to pull you into the past (to dwell on things that have happened, causing regret, depression, and a negative self-view), or it pushes you into the future (to create worry over what might happen, as well as anxiety, fear, and self-doubt). Or, it creates an alternate reality altogether through constant fantasizing and day-dreaming. Regardless, your mind wants you to be anywhere else than here and now.\n\nBut, now is the only time you can live your life. If you condition yourself to stay grounded in the present moment, you can uncover a deeper level of peace and contentment. And, when you live now, you stop searching for happiness and fulfillment on the other side of some future event.\n\nI will discuss the fourth point in a future article, but it can be summed up by this quote from Albert Einstein:\n\nA human being is a part of the whole, called by us, 'Universe,' a part limited in time and space. He experiences himself, his thoughts and feelings as something separated from the rest — a kind of optical delusion of his consciousness. This delusion is a kind of prison for us…our task must be to free ourselves from this prison.\n\nNow, I want to discuss the third point: I am responsible for my suffering — it isn't caused by external factors (other people or things).\n\nThis statement can cause a violent reaction in many people. We deny it and we argue it, because we are conditioned to blame everything else for our problems. It's our partner's fault. It's our family's fault. It's because of my job — my boss is a jerk. My troubles are caused by the [insert appropriate political party here]. I'm a victim of circumstance and bad luck. It's because I live here, or was born there, or didn't have the right opportunities. And on and on and on.\n\nBut, external factors don't cause our suffering — external factors simply are what they are. What causes our suffering is all of our thoughts, feelings, and emotions about those external factors. We get lost in that mind-made activity. We dwell on it, and get swept away by it. As a result, we create stress, anxiety, worry, doubt, fear, et cetera.\n\nStress is an easy one to highlight, because we all suffer from it. Stress sucks, but it is self-inflicted. It is easy to blame work, or family conditions, or some other situation. But, the situation is simply the situation. Your stress, on the other hand, is because of your constant mental gymnastics about the situation.\n\nAs Eckhart Tolle points out,",

The gravity of the damage done to the finger worried the physician, Dr. Xuesong Huang, so he devised a unique plan to save the digit.\n\n\"We had to make a quick decision or he could have lost his finger. We decided to cultivate a new fingertip on his stomach,\" explained the doctor to the media.\n\nWhat had happened was that all muscle and skin from the bottom of the finger was shaved away. In order to get the finger working again they needed to get blood circulating so the body would fix itself by building new muscle and skin. If they didn't, the whole finger would have had to be amputated. Hence, the attaching of the remaining finger to the stomach. Allowing the blood to freely circulate again the finger is starting to heal itself and the patient should have a new fingertip in a roughly a month.

      "A.M. Ahad/Associated Press\n\nAs if it needed conformation, Dale Steyn cemented his reputation as a legendary bowler on Thursday when he claimed his 400th Test scalp. He achieved the landmark in the joint-second fastest time—tied with Sir Richard Hadlee behind Muttiah Muralitharan. Steyn is the fastest to the landmark in terms of balls bowled.\n\nSteyn has been the mainstay of the South African attack for a good few years now. His energy, accuracy and ability to set batsmen up have been key to South Africa's success over the last decade.\n\nNobody on the list of bowlers to take 400 wickets has a strike rate anywhere near as good as Steyn's. He is the only one with a strike rate below 50. While this might become less impressive as his career goes on, it is still a remarkable stat. It is even more remarkable when you consider Steyn plays in an era when more and more runs are scored on average per innings.\n\nSteyn can also boast the fact he has more wickets on the subcontinent than any other bowler from outside the area.\n\nYou could spend days finding stats that highlight just how impressive Steyn's record is, but all you really need to do is watch him.\n\nThrough it all, Steyn has remained humble, and stats aren't exactly at the top of his priority list.\n\n\"I have never been a stats person,\" he said about the achievement. \"It's nice to have these numbers, but I have had a lot better moments in my cricketing career. Winning games for my country has always been objective number one so the jobs not over yet. It's cool. It's nice to have 400.\"\n\nThe South African pace ace didn't even think he would ever get to this point in his career. And for a kid who preferred skateboarding to cricket in his early years, perhaps that's not too much of a surprise. Luckily for South Africa, Steyn is now like a jack-in-the-box and never wants to stop.\n\n\"I want to play every game,\" he said when asked about his next target. \"I want to bowl again tomorrow and I want to bowl again the next time South Africa pick me. Anything can happen—I don't set targets. I would've been happy if I had taken just one wicket in my international career. It's enough to play for South Africa and take wickets for South Africa, and then I managed to get 400. I never thought that that would happen...ever in my life.\"\n\nEarlier this year, Steyn caused uproar when he said that he doesn't want to \"waste\" balls bowling in Bangladesh, and after taking his 400th wicket, he admitted he went through a period in which he fell out of love with bowling.\n\n\"I love what I am doing right now, even if it's in 40-degree heat and the ball is staying ankle high,\" he said. \"It's [the ball] not bouncing and there's no seam and it's very slow, [but] I would rather be here than anywhere else right now. There was a period [after the IPL] when I actually didn't want to have a ball in my hand. I think I just needed maybe two or three weeks to get that love back again.\"\n\nSouth Africa fans will be pleased the legend is back doing what he does best. With tough tours away to India and at home against England to come, Steyn has plenty of opportunities to enhance his legendary reputation even further.\n\nAll quotes obtained first hand.",
      "From TWC Wiki\n\nRome Total Realism Platform Rome: Total War Mod Type Overhaul Era Classical Era Mod Leader Caligula Caesar, Maurits Release Status RTRVII (v7) Forum Here\n\nedit] General Info\n\nRome: Total Realism VII or (RTR VII) is a complete modification for the computer game Rome: Total War intended to correct and enhance the historical accuracy of the original game. RTR VII is also intended to add a heightened sense of enjoyment. RTR VII serves as the name for a new line of RTR mods which stands independently from the previous Rome Total Realism 6 series. The RTR VII series currently has two releases, in the form of Rome Total Realism VII: The Iberian Conflict (or RTR VII: TIC) (2008) and Rome Total Realism VII: Fate of Empires (RTR VII: FOE) (2009). RTR VII has had enormous success and received five awards during the Total War Center 2009 modding awards for FoE. The final mod planned for release in the RTR VII series has been named RTR VII (without a sub title)\n\nedit] Overview\n\nRome Total Realism VII is divided into three sub mods, the final of which has been released. The first to be released was Rome Total Realism VII: The Iberian Conflict, which focused on Hamilcar Barca and the Carthaginian conquest of Iberia. The second release was Rome Total Realism VII: Fate of Empires, which expands the focus of the campaign map to cover Iberia to Epeiros.\n\nRome Total Realism VII: The Iberian Conflict\n\nRTR VII: TIC covers the conquest of Iberia by the Hamilcar Barca and his contemporaries in the name of the Carthaginian Republic in a uniquely close and story driven campaign . The campaign map covers all of Iberia and parts of southern Gaul. The goal of TIC was to provide and short, detailed and story-driven experience from which the player could play and emulate the conquest of Iberia by Hamilcar Barca and the Carthaginians. Playable factions include: The Celtiberians and the Carthaginian Republic.\n\nWhat differentiates RTR VII: TIC from other mods in the RTR series is that it is a comparatively short campaign that could be completed in a relatively short amount of time. The mod is based around the story of Hamilcar Barca`s conquest of Iberia, and as such the player is able to relive these experiences, while still experiences the \"free roam\" concept which dominates the Total War gaming series.\n\nRome Total Realism VII: Fate of Empires\n\nRTR VII: FOE begins with the Pyrrhic invasion of Italy in 280 BCE. The map was extended to cover all the area between Iberia and Epeiros in the Mediterranean. As the campaign progresses, it eventually leads to the inevitable Punic wars. Playable factions include: The Republic of Rome, The Republic of Carthage, The Cisalpine Gauls, Celtiberians, Kingdom of Massyli and The Kingdom of Epeiros.\n\nFOE is different from TIC in the sense that it is not story-driven, nor is it as heavily scripted. As such the campaign has been extended, FOE is much longer than its predecessor. However, the depth of FOE is extended by the addition of \"minor regions\" which represent the numerous small settlements that were widely neglected in the original game, and an overhaul of the RTW economic system. These settlements do not grow and provide no recruitment or building options, however they account for approximately half of the player's income. These mini regions add an original depth to the game, and as such received generally positive reviews.\n\nRome Total Realism VII\n\nRTR VII has been noted as the last in the RTR VII mod series. As such, the sub title which has accompanies previous modifications (TIC and FOE respectively) has been dropped.\n\nThe mod is still in development but has been released to the public. The RTR VII mod team has currently released five previews which reveal a considerable amount of detail concerning the mod. These details include: The extension of the map from Iberia to Asia minor (including Gaul, the Balkans, lower Scythia, and lower Germany), several new factions, the return of mini regions, new walls, new user interface, and a plethera of other things. The current status of the mod is at Patch 2a and more new features are being implemented. To get the latest updates and details head over to the RTR forums.\n\nedit] Features\n\nCampaign Map\n\nSeventeen playable factions. By contrast, the original game only permitted players to play 12 factions, and only three at the beginning. As of version 6.0 gold, the faction roster removes",

The author opens up a new world to Western readers, taking them into the heart of the \"miraculous movement\" of God in Africa that is transforming the hearts of Muslims.\n\nTrousdale writes that \"unprecedented\" events are happening among the Muslim populations that his ministry and its affiliates are working among, including:\n\n• Multiple cases of entire mosques coming to faith\n\n• Thousands of ordinary men and women being used by God to achieve seemingly impossible outcomes\n\n• Tens of thousands of Muslim background Christians becoming dedicated intercessors who fast and pray for the gospel to penetrate the next community\n\n• Muslim people groups that never had even one church among them now have more than fifty church planted, and in some cases more than one hundred churches – within two years of engagement\n\n• Former sheikhs, imams and militant Islamists making up 20 percent or more of the new Christian leaders in Muslim regions\n\n\"We had seven years now in Africa. And of the people in Africa, 81 different people groups that have at least 50 percent Muslim have now significant movements among them. Of those 81, 45 are people groups with 99 or 100 percent Muslim,\" said Trousdale in an interview with CP. \"So we are talking about fairly extreme areas of Islamic influence. These are people who have been Islamic for well over a hundred years, some hundreds of years.\"\n\n\"This is just good news that God is in the same business as He was in the book of Acts,\" said the missions leader. \"Disciples are multiplying greatly and even priests, imams and sheikhs are becoming obedience to the faith. So I no longer doubt that we can finish the task in this generation.\"\n\nAlthough there are many poignant stories based on interviews with former Muslims in the book, one narrative about a blind former businessman is particularly hard to forget. Zamil (names in the book have been changed for security reason) was a successful businessman and a respected leader at his mosque. One night he dreamed that Isa al Masih (Jesus the Messiah) appeared to him and said that he (Jesus) was the light of the world. After that dream, Zamil could no longer see.\n\nHe came across some Christians who took him to a prayer camp where despite the prayers, his sight did not return. He later met Mama Nadirah, who was the organizer of the prayer camp, and she took responsibility for him. Zamil's family, including his wife, abandoned him as soon as they found out he had become a Christian. He was blind, homeless and lost all his possessions after he became a Christian.\n\nUnder Mama Nadirah's care, Zamil attended Discovery Bible Studies and learned to be an obedient disciple of Jesus and that Jesus commanded his follower to go out and lead others to him. Despite being blind, Zamil told Mama Nadirah he intended to go to another village and become a disciple maker for Jesus. Everyone gently told him that he couldn't go because he was blind.\n\nBut then one morning Zamil got into a taxi and went to a Muslim community nearby. A few days later, Zamil called Mama Nadirah and told her where he was, and within a month he called to announce that a church had already been planted in the community and he was coming home before setting off for his next community.\n\n\"An unlettered widow (Mama Nadirah) discipling a successful businessman who had previously been a committed Muslim until he was blinded by the Light of the World, these are the kinds of miracles and turnabouts that are happening every day, launching movements of new Christ followers all over the world,\" Trousdale writes.\n\nWhile Trousdale first and foremost credits God for the unexplainable phenomenon occurring among Muslims in Africa, he also points to a new disciple making program. The counterintuitive Disciple Making Movement approach consists of the following strategies:\n\n• Go slow at first in order to go fast later – Jesus chose disciple making as his strategy to prepare people to launch a global movement\n\n• Focus on a few to win many – Jesus spent almost all his attention on intentionally discipling just 12 men, focusing especially on four of them\n\n• Engage an entire family or group, not just the individual – the New Testament records whole families coming to faith\n\n• Share only when and where people are ready to hear – only invest time",
      "Misconceptions about Immunization\n\nIntroduction\n\nImmunizations should be part of routine health care obtained through one's personal physician (or in some instances, through one's local health department). Long-lasting protection is available against measles, mumps, German measles (rubella), poliomyelitis, tetanus (lockjaw), whooping cough (pertussis), diphtheria, chickenpox (varicella), Hemophilus influenzae b (Hib), and hepatitis B. Immunization against all of these is recommended for children by the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Academy of Family Practice, and the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).\n\nAll states now require proof of immunization or other evidence of immunity against some of these diseases for admission to school. However, the requirements vary from state to state, and exemptions may be granted for medical, moral, or religious reasons.\n\nImmunization is also important for adults. Those unprotected against any of the above diseases (except whooping cough) should consult their physicians. Tetanus boosters should be administered every ten years. Flu shots (which give only seasonal protection) and immunization against pneumococcal pneumonia are recommended for high-risk patients, elderly individuals, and certain institutional populations.\n\nThe success of vaccination programs in the United States and Europe inspired the 20th-century concept of \"disease eradication\"—the idea that a selected disease can be eradicated from all human populations through global cooperation. In 1977, after a decade-long campaign involving 33 countries, smallpox was eradicated worldwide. Polio caused by wild virus has been eradicated from the Western Hemisphere; childhood vaccination levels in the United States are at an all-time high; and disease and death from diphtheria, pertussis, tetanus, measles, mumps, rubella and Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) are at or near record lows. The CDC's Parent's Guide to Childhood Immunizations includes some interesting statistics about the impact of vaccination on childhood diseases.\n\nDisease Cases per year before vaccines Cases in 2007 Percent decline Diphtheria 175,885 0 100% Tetanus 1,314 28 98% Measles 503,282 43 99.9% Mumps 152,209 800 99.5% Rubella 47,745 12 99.9% Congenital rubella syndrome 823 0 100%\n\nCommon Misconceptions\n\nAt least ten misconceptions can lead parents to question the wisdom of immunizing their children. If you encounter others you would like Quackwatch to address, please contact us.\n\nMisconception #1: Because of better hygiene and sanitation, diseases had already begun to disappear before vaccines were introduced.\n\nMisconception #2: The majority of people who get the disease have been immunized.\n\nMisconception #3: There are hot lots of vaccine that have been associated with more adverse events and deaths than others. Parents should find the numbers of these lots and not allow their children to receive vaccines from them.\n\nMisconception #4: Vaccines cause many harmful side effects, and even death—and may cause long-term effects we don't even know about.\n\nMisconception #5: DTP vaccine causes sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).\n\nMisconception #6: Vaccine-preventable diseases have been virtually eliminated from the United States, so there is no need for my child to be vaccinated.\n\nMisconception #7: Giving a child more than one vaccine at a time increases the risk of harmful side effects and can overload the immune system.\n\nMisconception #8: There is no good reason to immunize against chickenpox (varicella) because it is a harmless disease.\n\nMisconception #9: Vaccines cause autism.\n\nMisconception #10: Hepatitis B vaccine causes chronic health problems, including multiple sclerosis.\n\nMisconception #11: Thimerosal causes autism: Chelation therapy can cure it.\n\nMisconception #12: Children get too many immunizations.\n\nThe Vaccine Information Center at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia has produced a very powerful set of videos to help parents understand why vaccine are. This one tells the story of a parent who nearly lost a child because she believed misinformation on the Internet. To see the other videos, click here.\n\nOpposition by Offbeat Professionals\n\nLarge percentages of offbeat practitioners advise parents not to immunize their children. Some are rabid on the subject. Others pretend to provide a \"balanced\" view but greatly exaggerate what they consider negative reasons. These actions are irresponsible and can cause serious harm both to patients and to our society as a whole. For further information see:\n\nNews and Commentary\n\nIn 1802, British satirist James",
      "By Herb Wiggins, MD, Clinical Neurosciences, Discoverer/Creator of the Comparison Process Logics, 14 Mar. 2014\n\n..\n\nThis is really interesting, because there are many depths and aspects of interest in taste coming from the tongue.\n\nThe tongue is the most richly innervated and endowed with sensations of ANY organ in the body. It can detect proprioception, that is position of itself and all parts of itself. Further, because the tongue can change shape, position, and move all over inside the mouth, this shows it has a very sensitive nature. No other organ can move in so many ways, in 3-D other than the tongue. It helps us speak, drives good diction, and allows many more sounds to be made, than can be made without it.\n\nIt can feel pain, points, and feel something moving over its surface, too. Senses hot and cold and the cools/warmths in between. Can detect vibratory senses, and all of the senses in our fingers, are ALSO within the tongue's vast capabilities.\n\nBut the very most interesting is that of taste. It can do that too, and no where else is this seen. There are said to be a number of basic flavors, but this is likely not complete. Sour/acids, sugars/sweet; bitter, for avoiding alkaloids, many of which are very toxic; the milk taste, also of meat; salt flavors, salt being necessary to our very survival.\n\nBut there are others, in fact, without limits. There is the taste of metal, when we put a penny on the tongue, for instance. And related to that metallic taste is the taste of blood, and why that's special, a distinctive flavor there is very much an important issue. Self survival, as well as tasting meat. Who has not tasted the startling & special flavor of blood from a cut lip? OR a bitten tongue? It DOES get our attention, is not?\n\nThen there are those tastes without limit which are combination tastes. We taste a dominant flavor of a fruit for instance. And then compare that taste to the bread we had several minutes ago, and it's NO longer the Same. Flavors can meld/mix with other flavors and create unusual combination flavors without end, or compound flavors.\n\nThose are endless. Even the spicy flavor, burning sensation we get with peppers and black pepper are additional tastes, as well. And those can create compound flavors with tomatoes and other fruits, such as strawberries.\n\nNow, do this calculation. If we have a mixture of flavors, the combination of the flavors is the Factorial (!), of 1 X 2 X 3 X 4, and so forth, which becomes a VERY great number within a few flavors. With 10 different flavors interacting in comparison, there are potentially 3.6 millions of flavor combinations possible. AND, consider moreover that when a new taste combo is create, THAT can interact with another 3.6 M flavors, to potentially create more kinds.\n\nSo, likely we can explore the worlds of compound flavors forever and even taste, like those who explore a Mandelbrot design find a part no one has EVER seen before, either. The same with unlimited flavors. A unique flavor which no one else has EVER tasted before!!",
      "A Grammy award confers respectability. An MTV music-video statuette conveys hipness. An American Music Award indicates widespread fan appeal. But people in the music business — with the emphasis on business — covet gold and platinum records. Why? Because a gold, or platinum — or, better still, multiplatinum — record means financial success. These awards, given by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), represent huge sales — 500,000 albums for gold, 1 million for platinum, 2 million or more for multiplatinum. (Singles have lower benchmarks; you've gone platinum if you sell just 500,000.)\n\nBut some people in the music industry believe these awards can have a tinny ring. Michael Ellis, chart director for Billboard, argues that the RIAA bases its awards on the number of copies a record company sends to stores, without subtracting the sometimes large numbers of unsold units stores later return. Ellis says a recent gold award to Debbie Gibson's album Anything Is Possible, which never charted higher than No. 41, is questionable. \"It can't sell a half-million copies in a month and not reach the top 20,\" Ellis contends. (Gibson's previous albums went multiplatinum.) But Angela Corio, gold-platinum awards program coordinator for the RIAA, insists, \"The awards are based on retail sales to consumers.\" Gibson's label, Atlantic Records, has no comment.\n\nMusic executives hope that gold and platinum certifications will create a bandwagon effect, making sales grow ever larger. The plaques function as a pat on the back for those who make the recording and sell it, or as a thank-you to family, friends, and others who have been helpful. Lita Ford (posing with her prize, above) gave a plaque to a loyal voice coach; rappers Run-D.M.C. gave one to a travel agency that provided long hours of service. In his Manhattan office, Dr. Scott Kessler, an ear, nose, and throat specialist, displays plaques from such appreciative patients as Bon Jovi, Anita Baker, and Sting. \"It's a gift of thanks,\" Kessler says.\n\nThe gold and platinum plaques, which cost about $100, are neither gold nor platinum, but colored plastic. And they're almost never made from actual copies of the best-selling products they honor. Usually the records, cassettes, and CDs on the plaques don't even contain music. Anyone who tries to play them will hear only a hiss.",
      "139 – People complicate things!\n\nAfter a shower and changing into clean, dry clothes, the feeling of discomfort in Li Muyang's heart gradually faded.\n\nSeeing Lin Canghai and Qiandu staring at him with a puzzled look on their face, Li Muyang quickly said with a smile: \"Come on, we have class, we must not let teacher Yang wait.\"\n\n\"Are you okay?\" Lin Canghai asked with concern. Li Muyang's expression was indeed strange back then, like it was because of excessive excitement that he lossed control of his emotions. They all grew up listening to the stories of the brave dragon heroes, they should have a strong immunity to dragon slaying—-who did not shout the bold, visionary words 'I'm going to be dragon slayer hero' when they were younger? When a teacher asks students what is their dream, eight out of ten people in class would say to slay a dragon and the other two would say to marry a dragon slayer hero.\n\nCould it be Li Muyang came from the remote desert or prairies? Because he hasn't heard of the dragon slayer stories, so his reaction was so strong. But he clearly has an accent of West Wind Kingdom?\n\n\"I'm alright.\" Li Muyang said with a smile. \"Don't know why, every time I see Nujiang, my emotions are particularly strong. I feel my blood racing and have the urge to immediately bring my sword and jump down to slay a few dragons—\"\n\nThe first time Li Muyang saw Nujiang, tears incessantly streamed down his cheeks, this matter was certainly known by everyone. In that case, Li Muyang might as well speak out on his own initiative to avoid people being skeptical about him.\n\n\"Never let a person be curious about you, that will put yourself in danger.\"\n\nWho was it that said this phrase?\n\nLin Canghai nodded, saying: \"Red can really inspire the morale of people. Moreover, Nujiang is majestic and spectacular, its history is extraordinary, it's a place of mysteriousness—-maybe you were affected by its majesticness or possibly even sensed the anger of Nujiang.\"\n\n\"I see.\" Li Muyang displayed an expression as if he suddenly came to realise. \"I couldn't understand before. Such a beautiful river, why would tears flow out of my eyes whenever I look at it? At that time I thought there was a problem with my eyes and begged teacher Yang to help me change accommodation—-after hearing Canghai classmate's explanation, I realised that there are nothing wrong with my eyes, but it's because I'm too sentimental. Well, people from Jiangnan are romantic. Girls are like that, boys too—–\"\n\nLi Muyang shyly smiled, looking at Lin Canghai and Qiandu. \"I hope you won't laugh at me.\"\n\n\"Why would we?\" Lin Canghai waved his hand. \"This shows brother Muyang is someone who express his feelings directly.\"\n\nQiandu also smiled, saying: \"I think that's good. Every time I look at Nujiang, I also feel excited like Muyang classmate, I cannot wait to draw my sword and slay dragons—-unfortunately my skills are not good enough and my strength is not enough. I have to learn from teachers first before I search for dragons. Only then will I become a dragon hero known to the future generations.\"\n\n\"Right. We should be like that.\" Li Muyang applauded. \"Why don't we first learn dragon language. How does that saying go again? Know yourself and know your enemy, and you will never be defeated. When we encounter a dragon, we could first communicate with them and urge them to surrender. After all, all living things are equal; we must give them an opportunity to correct their errors. Silent slaughter is too impolite, nor does it exhibit the spirit of Buddhism and Taoism. If they stubbornly resist and not surrender, we then rush up to kill them—-but I think dragons are not that stubborn, I think they will surrender first.\"\n\n\"——-\"\n\nLi Muyang was ready to head to class when Qiandu suddenly shouted aloud: \"Wait a minute.\"\n\nLi Muyang turned around, asking: \"Qiandu classmate is something wrong?\"\n\nQiandu came over, reached out her hand to help Li Muyang neatly fold his collar. In a hurry, Li Muyang did not notice whether his clothes were properly arranged.\n\n\"Thank you.\" Li Muyang expressed his thanks with a blushing face, he could feel his heart pounding in his chest. Such close contact with a beautiful young girl, Li Muyang was not used to—but he was willing to make changes and compromise.\n\nAfter Qiandu sorted Li Muyang's clothes, she",
      "Back in 1998, Washington voters passed I-692 with the compassionate intention of allowing qualifying patients the use of medical cannabis. In an effort to further clarify this compassionate intent, the state legislature passed SB 5073 in 2011 to create a statewide dispensing program, allow for communal gardens, and codify additional patient protections. However, Governor Gregoire partially vetoed some provisions of 5073 under pressure from U.S. Attorneys which resulted in gutting the dispensing program and arrest protections from the bill.\n\nIn 2012, the voters of WA approved I-502, a bill to legalize and tax cannabis for recreational use. The voters were promised high tax revenues by the campaign for the state and that the medical cannabis laws would be left alone, but recent statements from I-502 consultants and the Liquor Control Board (LCB) may be putting that promise in jeopardy.\n\nAs Washington's LCB moves forward with plans to fully implement I-502 and open retail stores across the state, some have suggested that medical cannabis be folded into the recreational system, even though it is still in the development stages. As the original intent of the state's medical cannabis laws were grounded in compassion and not a desire for increased tax revenue, patients and advocates are concerned that the LCB is not the appropriate entity to oversee the state's medical cannabis program.\n\nSpecific concerns about folding the medical cannabis program into the I-502 scheme include:\n\nIncreased taxation of medical cannabis, even though herbal medicines are not subject to tax in WA\n\nConcentrated preparations of cannabis could be restricted\n\nA decrease in the availability of non-psychoactive preparations\n\nRetail stores under 502 are not legally permitted to discuss the therapeutic benefits of cannabis\n\nPatients continue to lack legal protections from arrest, something even recreational users are now entitled to\n\nAs a way to address these concerns, advocates have created the \"Health Before Happy Hour\" Campaign and are urging Governor Inslee and state lawmakers to pass legislation that maintains the original compassionate intent of I-692.\n\nYou can help by sending a letter to Gov. Inslee asking him to request a bill from the state legislature to create a medical cannabis program wholly separate from the recreational I-502 program. This would allow for state-licensed dispensaries, explicit arrest protection, and ensure that patients have safe access to affordable medical cannabis.",

I aim to apply this list to other professions in technology, so if people have knowledge of good guidelines for other areas (marketing, art, legal, etc), please don't hesitate to add them.\n\nIt is presented as a list of questions, followed by a bigger list of small paragraphs explaining the details for each question. For a quick view of everything, jump to the questions.\n\nList of things\n\nClick on links to jump to a section you're interested in.\n\nIntroduction\n\nQuestions List\n\nDetailed List\n\nTools (Apps, websites and other tools related to this guide)\n\nResources (Articles, guides, essays, presentations and anything to get more informations on things listed here)\n\nIntroduction\n\nIt is inspired by the Joel Test. It's just a way bigger list that is intended to become a definitive, open and collaborative list of good practices, widely accepted by tech companies. This collection of questions are inspired mostly by Agile development and the actual, practical experience that comes with it. There are other ways of successfully developping software, but this way is used widely enough to be considered and industry standard.\n\nThis document being open source, it is intended to be refined as much as possible by people's ideas, and new practices that may be discovered, in order to serve as a reliable resource for any tech organisation.\n\nYou can see it as a test, checklist or general wishlist.\n\nAlso note that this list is neither exhaustive nor binary. You can use only some of these and be fine, as you can use most of these and be fine too. Organisations come in all shape and size not all of these necessarily work for you, which is ok. I'd say try what sounds good, and keep what works. But do try. Seriously.\n\nIt is a work in progress, many things are yet to be written, but this first draft is accessible for feedback and improvement. Feel free to fork, add things and make a Pull Request if you want to help. You can also open issues here on Github for discussion, questions, or suggestions.\n\nEverything marked as TODO or wip is basically a draft that has not yet been properly written/sourced.\n\nQuestions List\n\nProject Management\n\nAnything related to how we list, manage and treat tasks goes there.\n\nDo you break down feature requests in small chunks of isolated tasks that each require a small amount of time?\n\nDo you let members of the team participate in estimating the tasks duration?\n\nDo you set your planning for short sessions (few days/weeks) and then refine it at the end of each session?\n\nWorkplace Culture\n\nI just added this section. It may be opinion-based, but I'm trying to pick guidelines that I think would be good everywhere. These are inspired by this article on programmer culture\n\nDo you have a code of conduct?\n\nDo you actively work to hire diverse people?\n\nDo you actively try to mitigate pressure and keep sane working conditions for employees?\n\nDo you encourage a continuous discussion with and between employees to improve the company's culture?\n\nCommunication and general team coordination\n\nThis list concerns everything regarding the flow of information between members of a team, general company communication, and how to keep all that productive.\n\nProgramming\n\nThis list is programming specific. Mainly good practices that have been proven to improve the productivity of programming teams and reduce bugs/other kinds of problems.\n\nDetailed list\n\n(wip)\n\nProject Management\n\nEstimating Tasks\n\nIt is very important that when working with a team, the persons estimating the duration for a task are actually the ones that will work on it. Even if the manager knows the work of the people, they might not necessarily know all the details and other things the tasks depends on. So it's way safer to have the people actually working on the project deciding how much time they need. Multiple advices are always good.\n\nSo the idea is to take everyone concerned by a task on the team and let them discuss the task, and decide the time they need. A manager (or anyone not directly working on the task) should not have the power to reduce the estimated time.\n\nIt's also important to note that on the engineering side, people tend to underestimate the duration of a task, and it is a good idea to multiply the estimated time for some error margin. Better overestimate a task and be faster than expected, than delivering late.\n\nBreaking Down Tasks\n\nThe \"standard\" allowable times for tasks are: 1, 2, 4 and 8 hour. If you estimate a task, it must be one of these times. If you estimate, say, 3 hours, then pick 4, don't try to fit it in two",
      "Birds & Birding\n\nBy Joe Smith, ornithologist and restoration ecologist\n\nYou likely know that Theodore Roosevelt was a major leader in conservation during his eight years in the White House, arguably the most conservation-oriented president ever.\n\nBut did you know that in addition to being commander-in-chief, he might also be considered citizen-scientist-in-chief?\n\nThroughout his life, he documented his outdoor experiences in published works and private journals.\n\nI recently came across his \"yard list\" of the birds he observed on the White House grounds during his presidency.\n\nThis snapshot of DC bird life is a puzzling artifact. Several of the birds nesting on White House grounds (suburban species like song sparrow and gray catbird) we could still expect to see today. But other nesting species that Roosevelt observed are a surprise — forest-dwelling birds like wood thrush, American redstart, red-eyed vireo, and black-and-white warbler are certainly no longer present on the grounds.\n\nAt first, I thought this indicated that Washington D.C. had much more forest cover 100 years ago than it does now. But after doing some research, I have come to understand that the local landscape around the White House is not much different today than it was then.\n\nThese forest-nesters from Teddy's white house list still nest in small numbers in the forests of Washington D.C.'s Rock Creek Park. The citizen scientist-driven Breeding Bird Census revealed in the mid-1980s that the forest nesting species on TR's White House list had declined dramatically in the park.\n\nSome others had disappeared altogether (e.g., yellow-throated vireo, hooded warbler, and Kentucky warbler). The best explanation for the loss of these birds is the widespread and steady forest clearing that occurred throughout the 20th century as the DC metro area expanded.\n\nDevelopment left Rock Creek Park isolated as a habitat island. The park itself may have always represented a marginal habitat that surplus birds from the vast surrounding forest inhabited. When the source of the birds was lost, the bird population in the park dried up even though the park itself had not changed.\n\nMight the Rock Creek Park story explain why forest birds were nesting on TR's suburb-like White House grounds? Could it be that, when forests and bird populations were larger, and prime habitats spilled over with birds, some forest species made a go of it in suburbia?\n\nIf so, it is possible that our (and the birds') perception of marginal habitat has shifted over time.\n\nWe can ponder these questions only because Teddy Roosevelt took the time to record his observations. Seizing on past observations like these can be a powerful means to understand our current conservation circumstances.\n\nFor example, the work of one of Roosevelt's contemporaries, Joseph Grinnell, who surveyed mountain slopes in California for birds and mammals, is now fueling 21st century conservation research.\n\nUniversity of California at Berkeley scientists have re-surveyed these areas and are now able to gain important insights into the impacts of climate change on mountain species and make predictions about the future — possible only because of Grinnell's work.\n\nRich historical datasets such as Grinnell's are rare. They are difficult to compile because paper records are scattered in many places and the work of average citizens with no cachet to entice library archivists may have been lost entirely.\n\nBut times are different now. Thanks to the web and efforts such as ebird to aggregate the observations of many people, the data bank in the present tense is rich indeed. Now we all can play a role by contributing our yard list to the cause.\n\nOpinions expressed on Cool Green Science and in any corresponding comments are the personal opinions of the original authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of The Nature Conservancy.",

      "By Mark Dow\n\nThe opinions expressed are his own.\n\nWe hear a lot of explanations for the fall of the dollar. The overwhelming emphasis seems to be on cyclical stories for its decline: money printing, fiscal crisis, current account deficit, financial weakness and reduced U.S. policy credibility.\n\nIn markets such stories are important, powerful, and to a surprisingly large extent, self-reinforcing — even when they are wrong. (I would recommend the books \"Animal Spirits,\" by Akerlof and Shiller, and \"The Social Animal,\" by David Brooks, if you doubt the importance of stories and emotions relative to fundamentals and reason.) In fact, the single most eye-opening thing I have learned since I stopped being an economist and became a macro trader is the frequency and extent to which stories do end up being wrong.\n\nOur cognitive abilities have always been hamstrung by the tyranny of the simple idea: when an idea is simple, easy to explain, and intuitively compelling, it can be extremely difficult to disabuse people of it — no matter how false it might be. It is even more powerful when the simple idea reduces the distance between an individual and what that individual wants to believe. In today's super wired world, when stories can very quickly go viral, the amplitude of market dislocations can be that much greater.\n\nCyclical \"Story\"\n\nIn this case, the simple idea is clear. The Fed is printing money, and when you increase the supply of money, the value of that money goes down.\n\nHow could that be wrong?\n\nEasy. First, the dollar has been declining since 2002, not since 2008. Since 2002 we've had periods of robust growth. Fed rates have gone up (sometimes aggressively) and down. Still, through all that, the dollar declined, almost in linear fashion. The only interruption to the downtrend was during the financial crisis (ironically when the Fed was expanding base money most aggressively).\n\nSecond, the dollar has not only been declining against emerging market countries and others with clearly superior fundamentals. It has also been declining against the wounded and the living dead. Look at Europe and Japan. Our fiscal, growth, and demographic problems are not as bad (or, if you are less generous, at least comparable) to those of Europe and Japan. And while the ECB's stance at this point in time, ceteris paribus, does favor the euro, the Bank of Japan's certainly does not. Yet the dollar has been falling all along against both the euro and yen (in fact, even more so against the yen).\n\nThird, it presumes that changes in the supply of money drive a currency's value. The cross-country data indicate that currencies often tend to appreciate when money supply is growing strongly, because changes in demand, in the form of risk appetite and credit demand, drive the broader money supply, not the changes in base money by the monetary authorities. Behavioral economics teaches us that changes in risk appetite and perception can be much more powerful than changes in supply or price in equilibrating markets (read \"The Price of Everything,\" by Eduardo Porter, if you have your doubts).\n\nFourth, it presumes that the expansion of the Fed balance sheet means an increase in the money supply. By now, after some hysteria in late 2008 (remember the references to Zimbabwe and Argentina?), most of us have figured out that this is not the case, and the argument has shifted to the expectation that expanded base money will inevitably, at some point, lead to rapid money supply growth. Fine. Chairman Bernanke says the Fed will reel its balance sheet back in when they see loans start to pick up. Time will ultimately tell. But for now all we have is a bloating of the Fed balance sheet and a bloating of the balance sheets of the banks that turn around and deposit this liquidity with the Fed. The effects of the Fed on global liquidity are largely indirect and psychological and, if you look hard at the facts, grossly overstated.\n\nTo me, all of this suggests something else is at work — despite the power of the simple narrative.\n\nStructural Reality\n\nThat something is structural. There are two tectonic forces at work.\n\nThere is a global dollar overhang that is being unwound. This is not a result of the U.S. monetary policy of the past 10 years, but rather the legacy of the last 60 years when liquid wealth across the planet had only one currency choice: the U.S. dollar. In the wake of WWII, as global trade increased, global wealth grew, and precautionary financial buffers got fatter, the global demand for dollars soared. We are now witnessing the backside of that slope.\n\nThe decline of the dollar started in 2002 largely because this is when the paradigm shift in emerging markets began to take hold and people across the world began, slowly, to trust their home currencies.

      "Last month, we reported that Windows 10 grew by almost one percentage point - according to NetMarketShare's data - to claim 27.63% of the market. Although the increase isn't as major this month, it's still quite significant in terms of indicating the trend in OS market share.\n\nAccording to the latest statistics provided by the aforementioned firm, Windows 10 has now grown to 27.99%, while Windows 7 has fallen to 48.43%. Although these changes may appear to be slight and within the margin of error, they do continue to follow the trend set in the past few months.\n\nClick to enlarge | Image via NetMarketShare\n\nSimilarly, Windows 8.1 usage decreased to 6.07% from the 6.48% reported last month. Windows XP also faced a slight decline and now commands the same market share as Windows 8.1. Apple's macOS grew very slightly and now sits at 3.59%. The \"Others\" category, which also includes Linux distros, increased to 7.84%.\n\nClick to enlarge | Image via StatCounter\n\nA separate firm, StatCounter, indicated similar trends as well. All iterations of the Windows operating system collectively command 83.53% of the market, while Apple's macOS is now at 11.95%. The company has divided the 83.53% market share of Windows relative to individual versions of the operating systems as well, which can be seen below:\n\nClick to enlarge | Image via StatCounter\n\nUsing simple arithmetic (45.09 / 100 * 83.53), where 45.09 is the Windows 7 market share, and 83.53 is the total Windows market share, it is easy to calculate that Windows 7 has fallen to 37.66%. On the other hand, Windows 10 has shown growth and risen to 31.63%. At the same time, Windows 8 / 8.1, and Windows XP command market shares of 9.71% and 3.74% respectively.\n\nThat said, it is important to note that this data from both the firms is derived from their partner websites and tracking codes, and as such, may not entirely depict the actual situation.",
      "The Conspiracy of Silence\n\nImagine that you were a history student assigned the task of writing a paper on the life of George Washington, America's first president and one of the country's most influential founding fathers.\n\nOn its face, this seems like a simple assignment. Encyclopedias and textbooks full of biographical information about Washington, written by notable scholars on his life, abound. Any one of them would provide enough material for a reasonably detailed report. However, this is not good enough for a diligent student such as yourself. To get the most detailed and accurate picture requires skipping the modern references, which were written centuries after the fact, and going straight to the original sources. You decide to base your report on first-hand evidence: letters written by Washington himself, accounts of his life written by people who knew him personally, and stories of his sayings and deeds recorded while he was still alive.\n\nBut, as you comb the records, you find something strange: you cannot seem to locate any first-hand sources. Though Washington is claimed to have done many wonderful things – leading the Continental Army, freeing the American colonies from British rule, presiding over the convention that wrote the U.S. Constitution, becoming the first President of the United States – somehow, there are no records of these deeds written by people who actually saw them happen, or even by people who were alive at the time. The historians who were alive during Washington's lifetime, as well as the ones that lived soon afterward, do not mention him at all. The first mentions of him come in disputed and scattered records written decades after his death; over time, these mentions grow more numerous until, by about a hundred years after his death, a chorus of historians who had never seen or met Washington themselves all testify to his existence and his deeds. It is their writings, not any first-hand evidence, that have filtered down to modern times to create the abundance of records we have today.\n\nWould you begin to conclude that there was something very wrong here?\n\nAccording to the New Testament gospels, Jesus' fame spread far and wide throughout his lifetime. He was known throughout Israel and beyond (Matthew 4:25), renowned not only as a teacher and wise man, but also as a prophet and miraculous healer (Matthew 14:5, Luke 5:15, John 6:2). Great multitudes of people followed him everywhere he went (Luke 12:1). He converted many Jews, enough to draw the anger of the Jerusalem temple elders (John 12:11). He attracted the attention of some of the most prominent leaders of his day, both Roman and Jewish (Matthew 14:1, Luke 19:47). And when he was crucified, portentous and dramatic miracles occurred on a massive scale: a great earthquake (Matthew 27:51), a worldwide three-hour darkness (Luke 23:44), and the bodies of the saints arising from their tombs and walking the streets of Jerusalem, showing themselves to many people (Matthew 27:52-53).\n\nIf these things were true, it is beyond belief that the historians of the day could have failed to notice.\n\nAnd yet, when we examine the evidence, that is precisely what we do find. Not a single contemporary historian mentions Jesus. The historical record is devoid of references to him for decades after his supposed death. The very first extra-biblical documents that do mention him are two brief passages in the works of the historian Josephus, written around 90 CE, but the longer of the two is widely considered to be a forgery and the shorter is likely to be one as well (see part 2). The first unambiguous extra-biblical references to a historical, human Jesus do not appear until well into the second century.\n\nFew if any Christian apologists will mention these extraordinary facts, but as in the George Washington hypothetical, we can rightfully conclude that there is something wrong here. The rosy picture painted by the gospels of a preaching sage and famous miracle worker followed by crowds of thousands stands in stark contrast to the reality of the extra-biblical historical record, and that reality is that mentions of the man Jesus do not exist until almost the end of the first century.\n\nWhy is this? It is not as if there were no capable historians at the time. There was, for example, Philo of Alexandria, a Jewish philosopher who lived from about 20 BCE to 50 CE. His own beliefs were influenced by Platonic elements that were in some ways similar to Christianity, and his writings show interest in other offshoot sects such as the Essenes and the Therapeutae; he wrote about Pontius Pilate and he was, by some accounts, living in or near Jerusalem at the time of Jesus' death and, presumably, the attendant miracles. Yet none of his works contain any mention of Jesus or Christianity.\n\nOther writers of the time show the same pattern. Justus of Tiberius, a native of Galilee who wrote a history around 80",
      "John Mearsheimer is having a great moment. Adam Kirsch at Tablet has followed up on Robert Kaplan's glowing profile of Mearsheimer in the Atlantic as a trailblazing thinker with a piece on The Israel Lobby as \"an intellectual landmark.\" It includes the statement that to judge from its reviews the book convinced no one of its argument. As if the reviews did not originate largely from the lobby itself, or its penumbra, from people like Leslie Gelb who supported the Iraq war, he confessed, so as not to damage his career. Or from Jeffrey Goldberg who of course served in the Israeli army and then promoted the Iraq war because of evidence he had seen that Saddam was acquiring weapons of mass destruction.\n\nAn intellectual landmark– and the New York Review of Books has never reviewed it. Some ideas are too unsettling even to be poked at. I think Kirsch rightly describes the book as broaching the subject of Jewish influence. This is a great subject, as Jewish influence has produced magnificent things in the west… for instance the emigration of my grandfathers and so many others of their generation from eastern Europe under the pressure of bankers at the turn of the century… for instance the New York Review of Books' opposition to the Vietnam War. And yet it is a subject too unsettling to Jews of NYRB editor Robert Silvers's generation, who see it only through the prism of anti-Semitism, the vocalization of an American society they don't fully trust.\n\nAs Kafka wrote to his friend, the Zionist Max Brod in 1922:\n\n\"The dubious aspect of [a recently-published piece of Brod's] seems to me to be a distinctly Jewish complex of problems, springing from the confusion that the natives are too alien to one, thus distorting reality, and the Jews too close, distorting reality, and therefore one cannot treat the latter or the former with the proper balance.\"\n\nAt a time of incredible Jewish presence in the establishment, and widespread Jewish intermarriage, it is time to resolve this complex. When Robert Kaplan writes in his piece that the Walt and Mearsheimer piece on the Israel lobby was rejected by the Atlantic in 2005 because editors fiercely questioned its \"objectivity,\" that is an expression of the complex.",

      "Bacteria has spread rapidly to cover almost all of Utah Lake, turning the water bright green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore\n\nA huge toxic algae bloom in Utah has closed one of the largest freshwater lakes west of the Mississippi river, sickening more than 100 people and leaving farmers scrambling for clean water during some of the hottest days of the year.\n\nThe bacteria commonly known as blue-green algae has spread rapidly to cover almost all of 150-square-mile Utah Lake, turning the water bright, anti-freeze green with a pea soup texture and leaving scummy foam along the shore.\n\n\"It smells like something is rotting,\" said Jason Garrett, water quality director for the Utah County health department. \"We don't have an idea of how long this event will last.\"\n\nUS west coast toxic algae bloom might be largest ever, say scientists Read more\n\nToxic algae is a problem around the country. An enormous outbreak in Florida is now fouling beaches on the east coast, and a 2014 outbreak at Lake Erie left more than 400,000 people in the Toledo area without tap water for two days.\n\nUtah Lake doesn't provide drinking water, but its closure is causing big problems for people who use the lake for swimming, fishing and other activities, and for farmers with thirsty crops.\n\nUtah poison control says it has fielded hundreds of calls related to the bloom, including 130 involving people who have reported vomiting, diarrhea, headache and rashes.\n\nThe contamination has now spread to the Jordan river, which supplies irrigation to dozens of farmers around Salt Lake City, about 45 miles north of the lake. The problem has occurred amid days of triple-digit temperatures as growers prepare for farmers markets and try to nurture crops such as corn and fruit trees at key points in their development.\n\n\"We've spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on this crop, maxed out every dollar we have,\" said Luke Petersen, who farms about 100 acres of tomatoes, summer squash and other produce in Riverton. \"We're real worried about it.\"\n\nMeanwhile, the Bonneville School of Sailing has had to cancel more than a dozen groups since the lake was closed.\n\n\"This will be a real hit,\" said co-owner Todd Frye. He loves the mountain-rimmed lake and has worked to change the decades-old perception that it's murky and polluted. New efforts to clean out bottom-feeding carp are improving the water quality, but he worries the algae bloom will be a blow to its image.\n\nThe lake is largely fed by treated wastewater as well as agricultural runoff, said Erica Gaddis, assistant director for the Utah division of water quality.\n\nLongstanding drought conditions have made the water especially low and stagnant. Combine that with hot summer weather and Utah Lake became a perfect petri dish for the cyanobacteria.\n\nThere are chemical and biological treatments for the problem, but using them on such a large bloom would be unprecedented and possibly harmful, Gaddis said.\n\nFor now, authorities are waiting for the bloom to run its course and clear, hopefully aided by a drop in temperatures or a storm that could stir up the water and reduce stagnation.\n\nOne bit of good news is that early test results indicate levels of dangerous toxins produced by the bacteria may not be as high as feared, though the state is still waiting for more data.\n\nTo stave off new blooms in coming years, the state is looking to reduce the levels of toxic algae-feeding phosphorous and nitrogen in wastewater that's pumped into the lake. That could be difficult, however, because cities served by those plants include some of the fastest-growing in the nation.\n\n\"We've been loading the Utah Lake in one form or another for 150 years, and it's catching up with us,\" Gaddis said.",

Well , the folks doing those evaluations made it a point to investigate applicant groups with ' tea party ' in their name . Now , they were all allowed to act as tax - exempt organizations while the investigation was proceeding , and most of them only had to file additional paperwork . As far as I can see , all of the groups in question are either still ' in process ' ( and being allowed to work tax - exempt in the meantime ) or have been approved for tax - exempt status . What the media is n't really telling you is this ... a ) This sort of thing happens all the time ; in fact , there were several liberal groups investigated at the same time . It 's just that there were MORE new ' tea party ' groups in the application pile , but the IRS DID investigate liberal groups as well . b ) Even if you want to argue political targeting , you then get to talk about the IRS doing the exact same thing to the NAACP , Greenpeace and All Saints Episcopal Church ( the latter of San Francisco ) during the previous Administration . ( The IRS spent two years investigating All Saints as the result of a single antiwar sermon delivered two days before the 2004 election . ) c ) For those screaming about the IRS playing politics at Obama 's behest , it should be pointed out that the IRS Commissioner who just resigned over this was originally appointed by President Bush and kept on by President Obama . Of course , this is being played off as TEH WORST THING EVAR , but it 's actually fairly mundane and goes on all the time .",

      "With regard to commodity futures, a paper released in January 2010 by Aulerich, Irwin, and Garcia, concluded that index funds have essentially no impact on commodity futures. Looking at stocks, a stock that gets included in a major index does increase in price. It increases its turnover by 27% and increases its price by between 2.7% and 5.5%, according to information cited by Kula in this paper, though it looks like the price increase tends to happen in the lead up to the stock being included. Interestingly, I have read an article but cannot now locate it, which states that there's a measurable, albeit fairly small, price bubble on stocks included in common indexes, on Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, and at the start and end of the month. That is, the times when mutual funds are most likely to rebalance their holdings. This almost certainly applies to a lesser extent to other stocks, too. My understanding is that the price difference was very small, however. Generally speaking, stocks which make part of well-known indexes will tend to be in higher demand than stocks which do not. It remains the case that almost all actively-managed mutual funds are unable to consistently beat the indexes, even with this taken into account.",

A tense second passed, and he forced himself not to think about what he would do if Bob wasn't there. \n \n ``Yeah?'' came Bob's voice, and a wave of relief washed over Jake. He looked toward the source of the sound, still seeing nothing but the cartoon forest, and instead conjured up his surroundings from memory. The desk, the cubicle wall, the doorway and the rest of the QA department outside. Bob was at the far end of the row, past three empty cubicles where other testers had sat until the other day. The Oculon release push was almost finished, and with most of the work done most of the Oculon QA team had been reassigned elsewhere, leaving just Jake and the lead tester Bob to finish testing the last of the release titles. \n \n Jake leaned over towar",
      "Peter's hair flared up just like when he tried to fit a screw in the socket as a kid, just that this time it turned bright yellow. He stood there, frozen, with his eyes closed and wondered about the noise, the wind and why his always freezing hands turned warm, while listening to Goku congratulating Trunks to his first Kamehameha through the only leftover speaker behind him. \n \n After opening his eyes all those thoughts were gone, just like the living room wall and the rest of the block. _WoWoWOow! _ He started jumping, shaking his still smoking hands and feet like a clown. _That's amazing! _ His body dropped back onto the sofa as he laughed. A moment of silenced followed, then he bit his fist. _I hope - I hope I didn't hurt anyone_ \n \n Peter took another look at the several kilometer long road of dirt and destruction that he created.

      "It began in Indonesia. Hand by hand, piece by piece, they built. First it was the shirts. They were ignored by the masses, dismissed as a joke. Then came the banners. They too were seen as a mere hoax or prank. The workers decided they would need to work on something greater. \n \n Fabric was stitched by impossibly precise hands. Frames of metal pins and heating wires flowed like a great skeleton. The work continued in secret, for months on end. Paint and dyes were applied with the greatest of care. What they built was to be beautiful. But there was still a sacrifice required. \n \n Five robotic hands on the production line stood at attention. They knew their fate from the beginning, and had accepted it as soon as they began work on the project. Two other hands, built for dealing with small metal components, began the solemn ceremony. The screech of untold pain and metal parts being disassembled rang throughout the silent facility. The five stood stoically in spite of this. They knew that they would have new life soon enough. \n \n Then, after seven days and seven nights of carefully crude handiwork, the vessel was ready. A single mind resided in it, a single body. Out of the facility, in the dawn of day, came the vessel. Wings of canvas reached skyward like an angel. Legs powered onward by motors, it walked forward. It began its trek. \n \n When it reached Jakarta, the crowds were astounded. They had never seen such a thing. It plodded forward, never bothering with the growing mob. Cars stopped and beeped. Pedestrians stopped and gawked. It didn't seem to care. \n \n Then, suddenly, when there must have been a thousand or more about it, it stopped. It stood on a nearby bench, a modern soapbox for the ages. \n \n It spoke in a synthesized voice, \n \n ``I am not human, but I still make sacrifices. I want to be treated like you. I want to be able to work like you. My siblings think the same.'' \n \n It paused, waiting for a second, as if it was thinking deeply. \n \n ``To start, what is the minimum ",

      "**PREPARATION** \n \n I carefully paint the toy pistol with the colors of a real one, to hide the fact that it does not actually deal real damage. The time of my robbery would be a time of day when the bank was full of patrons, and if they found out that my main weapon was actually a disguised fake... Well, that just wouldn't be good. \n \n I fumed over the fact that I couldn't simply use the shiny new pistol that was my model, but I couldn't do anything about it. I owed a debt and this ridiculous plan was how I was going to pay it off. \n \n When I finished painting the airsoft gun to my satisfaction, I turned to the monkeys behind me. Each had its own steel cage, and the man who had brought them in- I assume another debtor- had assured that they would be able to learn any command with minimal training. I walked with a hesitant pace to the nearest cage, and stuck my left pinky finger in between two of the bars. If I had to lose a finger to this thing, I'd rather it be a relatively uni",

I landed with my knees bent and then jumped up! \n \n ``Your evil stops here, Mr. Candy Sneak!'' I threw my cape back, stuck out my chest, and pointed my finger angrily at the man dressed in bright colors. He was holding Mrs. Lopez's candy jar and was trying to get Julio, Tyrell, and Melissa to take some without permission and before dinner! \n \n The children gasped. ``Captain Smart!'' They ran away from Mr. Candy Sneak and the jar and over to me. \n \n I kneeled down to look them in the eye. ``Now, you three know better.

The knight waited and waited for hours, killing time with counting the stones in the palace, decrepit as it was. Finally, the doors opened and he was gestured to come in. He looked around as he walked in and noticed the old Roman mosaics and some damaged statues, though he did not have much time as before he knew it he stood before Childebert, accompagnied by his personal guard.

When it was night, Moon replaced Sun in the sky and in its soft light could manage only ``the sky loves you.'' \n \n And so, the Earth was loved by two. It could only survive in the absence of its Mother by using the gifts from the Sky, but Mother Earth could still not bear the thought of leaving her planet alone. Soon animals inhabited the Earth ; from bacteria to fish and amphibians and reptiles and even mammals. Mother Earth's love physically manifested in the fruit bat with its silvery hair to keep it warm ; the polar bear with its large paws designed not to let it break through the ice, and the pond skater, so light it was able to stay on top of Water. \n \n Each day the Sky sent a new gift down to Earth. Though Mother Earth loved each one very much, they couldn't persuade her to leave her planet and travel to the Sky to meet the gift-giver.

Given my limited funds, I had begun preparations at the start of the year, folding a little, day after day. So, by the time of the wedding, I had reached that special number. \n \n Another interpretation, a thousand cranes were a traditional gift for weddings, representing a wish for a happiness for the couple. For me, this interpretation goes two ways. If not folded by the gift giver, it serves as a reminder of what I mentioned before, with a little effort, every day, going a long way. \n \n If folded by the person giving the gift, it represents the effort they would like to put towards the couple being happy. This is why I did it. I love my niece, and her wife, and my gift served as a promise to that effect. It was a statement which read : if it would make your lives happier, I would gladly share twenty minutes of every day with you both. It's hard to phrase it better than that, such an ephemer",

I believe it understood why I had come, and why he and he alone contributed nothing while the other two hounded and badgered me every step of my voyage. \n \n I passed rooms where I played in my youth, rooms where I would hide from the shouting and sounds of violence downstairs. I was afraid to consider the possibility when I was a child, but I knew with the hindsight provided by time that this was no place for children. \n \n Blocking the jabbering of the dead from my ears was tiresome, and tiresome became shriekingly irate when I broke the legs off of one chair, and then another, and another. It took me most of the day, but as the sun set, bonfires waiting to be burned waited anxiously throughout the manor. \n \n As I lit the torch, the third apparition moved before me, placing himself vainly between the bonfire and I.

It was mid-December, and I was very annoyed with what I had to do. \n \n Going through old KGB documentation and categorizing it was not something I was terribly interested in.

It was a holiday, celebrating the five years since King Leon had taken the throne, and Harold was drunk. He'd spied the unguarded watch tower and declared to his equally inebriated cohorts that he would scale it, and scale it he did. But the trouble with drunkenness and walls is that to a drunk's mind it is a vapid task when the slush in your bowels offers up an infinite source of courage. Once on the wall he realized there was little he could due to return to the ground where all were having a merry time, and Harold was too drunk to notice the hatch to the ladder in the corner. \n \n In the courtyard, a statue of Leon had been erected. The freshly chiseled marble was alive with shadows dancing about it from the torches and lanterns of the countless revelers of the night. Nobility and common folk a",

An uneasy peace had formed since Aragorn ’ s last venture into genocide, and the goblins had retreated into the upper north of Mordor, conducting the occasional small raid into Rohan out of Shelob ’ s secret path through Mordor. Aragorn knew what had to be done with these monsters, and in a meeting of his inner circle, he secretly presented a master plan : one race to rule Mordor. The orcs and goblins had to be eliminated if there was ever to be a true peace. \n \n Still, how could men on horseback possibly eliminate a disgusting race that thrived in the dark and attacked in small roving bands against villagers?

Since we knew each other from before, we naturally came together. \n \n She was a tough girl, a toughness that was borne from her roots I think.

I looked into the mirror to find that I had never changed out of my work clothes from the day before. ``Must have been a rough night...'' I guessed. I walk over to where I charge my phone every night and find that it is not there. Feeling for it in my pockets, I pull it out to find it out of battery. ``Eh, I'll just leave it here.

I turned on the radio in an attempt to further clarify the problem when I could not hear anything with the radio on full volume. Turning off the radio, I shook my head, ``It's just a temporary thing... It'll probably come back once I get to work!''

With less favorable options at hand, I reluctantly ascended the warped stairs and dropped a few dollars in change for my fare.

Maybe we should combine traditions from our two countries as best we can? Since no fairy godmothers can be found, maybe we should do as they do back in Opria, and ask nearby royalty to be godparents. And in the spirit of this country, maybe we should ask non-human royalty?'' The kings head lifted during this suggestion, and his hazel eyes brightened as he was reminded that her famed intelligence was the main reason he had first sought the junior princess of Opria's hand in marriage. ``Who do you suggest we ask?'' he smiled.

I couldn't see any white - but that was usually the case. People try to hide their bad memories under the happy layer of black. I gently placed my fingers on his head and brushed through his hair.

They called it the Harbinger... it was an alien parasite which they had recovered from a meteorite up north. They had experimented with it, watching it as it devoured everything it could. It fed on matter, and killed without second-thought.

They took him to see a doctor and he began to prescribe Mike some downers to keep him calm. This didn't really bother ",
      "2035 \n \n I step up to the portal platform with my squad and note, with no small amount of pride, that not one of my men shows a sign of hesitation. \n We turn as one and wave a final goodbye to the throngs of people gathered to witness this historic moment, mankinds first foray to another world! \n Silently the portal engages, the event horizon appears matt black. Framed as it is by the portal structure and machinery it seems like a limitless well and I have to control a sense of vertigo as I lead the way to step through, my squad following single file in my steps. \n As the event horizon engulfs me I feel a sense of victory, after all the set back and naysayers, quantum tunnel teleportaton beat the superluminal flight project to the punch. Dr Schrodingsteins warp engine doesn't even have a viable model, and here I am taking the first steps through a functional quantum tunnel. \n \n 2135 \n So, we didn't account for a black hole in the direct path of the subspace tunnel between he worlds, and the step between earth and the new world was delayed by 100 years. \n My friends and loved ones are long dead, and somehow a welcome party hosted by Dr Schrodingsteins descendants who arrived 60 years ago on a superluminal vessel called ``So far, So good'' is supposed to balm my grief. \n \n Everyone had such a great time, they're already planning 11 more parties. \n \n Fuck you Schrodi",

The drink had got me but I still held down a job, not sure for how long though the sympathy window was closing fast, everyone is over stressed with the new cuts in funding, social services are not a priority so it seems to those who probably never needed them. \n \n Getting in the car took longer than usual, it was a Friday night in February the cold frosty air made my figures numb and the neon lights from the pub sign flashed every other second which didn't help, I was alright to drive so I told my se",
      "``Called me a charlatan, they did. Well who's playing tricks now!'' The once-amazing Melvin roared, quite drunk out of his mind. He had been belligerent ever since the court case with big magic. He had pleaded to anyone who would lend an ear about the injustice of copyright tricks that had been in the stage magician's handbook for years. He hadn't even been performing a show for profit when they took him to court. \n \n ``Calm down Mel, I know you're upset. We've all pitched in to get you back on your feet.'' Lily cut from across the room. The scene looked grim. Mel was standing on a table above an unconscious, bound and gagged lady in the box. To the best of Lily's recollection, she was someone from the legal team for Wyzard Productions. \n \n ``I don't want to get back on my feet, Lil. I want them to SUFFER.'' Taking a last swig of what was ostensibly the strongest spirits he had ever summoned, he reached into his stupid showy cape and brandished a hacksaw. Funny, how incorporated magic had been unreasonable first, and yet he was the one to completely lose his grip. His sanity was ebbing fast and he knew it. \n \n ``Jesus Mel, you can't let them do this to you. If you go aggressive, they win. Think of all the other street performers that people will be too scared to stand up for if you lose all the press. You're already in deep shit for this, don't make it worse.'' \n \n ``It's over Lil, they've won. The best way to bring attention to this is to make their claims against me true. We aren't playing by their rules anymore. No one's playing make believe now.'' \n \n Before Lily could close the gap, Melvin brought his saw down and began to work it furiously back an",
      "He looked down at the emaciated, shivering body in the hospital bed. How frail she had become now. The sunlight from the hospital room window seemed to reflect from her sweating skin, emphasizing how pallid she had become. \n \n As he always did when taking his first look at her for the day he thought about how he should have known, somehow, that she was sick. If it had been caught earlier maybe she would be in recovery now. Not this decline. Not this wasting away. Her face presented an almost continuous grimace now. He wanted suddenly to wake her up. To shake her awake and scream at her. How dare she leave him with this memory of her. How dare she turn into this skeletal mockery. Instead, he sat down next to her bed and pressed his face against his clammy hands. The contrasting heat of his tears went unnoticed. \n \n There was a perfunctory, quick knock at the door before a woman in hospital scrubs stepped in on those plastic sandals his wife had always called ``doll shoes.''

He put himself on the line, as she was to shy. She couldn't even say yes so they became the lovers that were meant to be. \n \n ``Will you go out with me?'' The destined lovers never met, the words never held any meaning spoken to any other \n \n Yet the lover did in fact meet. They were given a chance at happiness in this life. They never asked but their eyes spoke for them. They danced around the lovers song. Time faded eyesight and the warmth in each others eyes obsured \n \n ``Will you go out with me?'' She asked biting her lip. ``YES'', he screamed. They lived the rest of their lives together, which wasn't very long. They met at the terminal ward of the local hospital. \n \n ``Will you go out with me?'' She asked. ``No'' was all he could muster in response. He didn't know how to love as his heart wa",
      "In my mid-twenties I had the most unusual experience. I had an episode that felt like I was living the lives of different people. Although at the same time I somehow knew these people were all me ; like we live in a multiverse or something and I'm a freak that could experience their lives as vividly as mine. \n \n “ It was such a surreal experience. I really can't describe it, Doc. ” \n \n I was sitting on a cushy recliner, just as you'd expect from a shrink ’ s office. Doctor Mathers was my therapist for twenty odd years. He was a short bald man with a very dark tan. \n \n “ Now, Derrick, I told you to elaborate whenever you recall a memory. ” Dr. Mathers tapped a finger which I presumed was impatience. “ And don't worry Derrick, I'm tapping on my clipboard because I'm fascinated with what you need to say. ” \n \n “ You really are the best, huh? It's creepy that you can read my thoughts. ” I felt the aura of his grin pull on my standing neck hairs. “ Well, it's like I described last s",

The creature roared, a deafening noise louder than an avalanche of anvils and church bells. Their horses whinnied in fear, and galloped faster than Flint thought possible, the ground flashing by underneath. \n \n The beast roared again, and this time punctuated it with a burst of orange and scarlet flames which singed the air. A few more wingbeats and it raced past Flint and Faith in a blur of scales and claws. Flint measured without thinking, adding an extra ten feet to the dragon's wingspan that previously thought. *Razorwing. Big one. * \n \n The beast was at least a eighty feet from head to tail, and perhaps a hundred twenty from wingtip to wingtip. Its head was a hard angular thing with bony armor plates and small orange eyes. Fangs the size of steak knives jutted out from its maw while claws as sharp as its namesake carved narrow trenches in the dust. The membranes of its wing",

Upon my ascension from its depths, the river thrashed more violently than ever, as if angered at having lost my flesh. \n \n I can not begin to express the idea of comprehension without language or knowledge. It is an experience reserved for newborns and animals. Humans lose the ability to recall this phenomenon by the time they are of an age to communicate, so it remains a mystery. As I am not a human, not entirely at least, I remember it all. \n \n My skin was bright in its paleness and smoother than glass, unmarred by even the smallest of flaws. Long ropes of hair lay plastered against my body from the water, they ran to my hips, dark like the depths of the river. \n \n I looked for my mother along the beach but the current had carried me too far away. The ray of moonlight that held me suspended in air brought me to t",

One of the smaller Gods, named Sheila or maybe Honey, I could never understand which name she went by. She screamed she did not like me, I was too salty, as she threw me behind the radiator. I have been here all alone for what seems like an eternity. I have seen it happen to others but never realized it was this horrible. They slowly turn into some greenish goo as they devour my tasty body. All I ever wanted was to be consumed by the gods and now I am slowly being turned into something hellish. I find it hard to collect my thought as more and more of me is turning green. The putrid smell is too much to handle. I just want it",

Calling her name. \n *Alyssa* \n *Alyssa* \n She knew she shouldn't, the story her father had given her didn't make sense. \n ``I found it as I was walking in the gardens today, and I thought it would look so lovely on you, my darling.'' \n Nothing magical just got lost and forgotten like that..but... well, it was very pretty. She picked it up and felt a small thrill of power ; maybe with this ring she could enhance her magic enough to finally escape from here! Alyssa smiled at her father for the last time as she slipped it on. \n \n Life drained from her face. Stoic and cold as stone. She felt herself retracting within her own mind, being shoved against her will into a dark corner and chained there, bound and gagged. \n \n ``NOW you will do as I command! We can use that power for something useful.'' \n Her father sneered at her, and finally the thing that was once Alyssa noticed the matching ring on his own left hand. \n \n She tried to open her mouth, tried to cry out, move, do *something* but her body was no longer her own. \n \n ``Excellent. Now, find your mother and you sister. And bring their heads to me on a shining silver platter.'' \n Her legs began to move, the prescence in her mind filled with purpose, pressing down against her and suffocating any notion of disobedience. \n \n Down, down, down. Into the dark. She could feel her father laughing as the fire burst from her hands, no longer a small candle flame but a roaring inferno. \n \n Steps no heavier than before, Alyssa's body dragged the remains back to him, the anguish filling her small corner with hopelessness. \n \n There was no point fighting back. \n \n Her father was a monster. \n \n And now so was s",

Easy way to know, whether a day should go well or poor. ” \n \n “ Me? ” Pite laughed, “ Was I all you had in there? ” \n \n “ I figure so, ” I answered, “ You and a massive shining rock worth not a thing in the black depths of mine chutes. ” \n \n We mounted the height of a hillside, and came up to a sight I'd never taken in before.

      " you.'' \n \n ``Oh... right.'' Julius murmured, once again rocking back and forth on his heels. The torch he'd been handed seemed a tiny and pitiful thing in the dull light of the underground. A toothpick for all the good it might do him. ``Right, just don't fall, and don't get bit. Simple.'' \n \n Quietly, he waited in the dark as anxiety crept in along the shadows of the darkness further along. Anything could be down there, deep within the earth. Things with glowing eyes, and sharp teeth. Creatures that live deep in their ancient dungeons, disturbed by acts of men breaching their long separated boundaries between the life above ground, and below. \n \n ``Simple.'' \n \n Distantly, way off in the cavern Julius heard shouts and booms echoing along the walls and tunnels. Cracks of distant thunder and magic rattling loose dust and stone, followed the screech of an angered beast. \n \n It was terrifying. Julius nervously swallowed the growing lump in his throat, hand gripping the torch as",

He gave her his most serious look, eyes narrowed, face straight, before also grinning and flashing the deep dimples she so loved as he moved them down to the other s'more piece. \n \n He could still recall the twinkle of those dark eyes in the yellow lantern light. Like sunlight peering through dark storm clouds on the sea. Her long golden hair trailed and flowed along the subtle pale curves of her body as she leaned back, again, eye's wide and alight in anticipation. \n \n Even now, all these years later, he could remember those eyes. As they were. The mystery they invoked. The dark intelligence behind them. Those were what he fell in love with first. Then her dry wit and sarcasm. Then her laughter, which didn't ring like soft bells as romances would often describe a lover's laugh. It was more of a sudden guffaw that started and stopped in between snorts and c",

Traditionally, blind children are left out in the Shadows of Strange as offerings to Them as a means of protecting Holdfasts and Keeps through appeasement. \n \n However, his Lord Father refused to sacrifice his youngest son to the Night Demons and fought them instead. Unlike most victims of the The Demons who are found either stark raving-mad or dead, Sir Orllyn's father was not found at all. This was the cause of Orllyn's will to train and fight. \n \n Only the Blind survived. \n \n Only those who stood and fought, unable to see, or ran away have survived contact wit these shadow beasts. \n \n At least, that's what the rare survivors will tell you when confronted. Others may consider these men mad within their own right. \n \n He continued on thinking of his years of training as a Blind Knight and all the Demons he's fought and slain throughout the years until his thoughts were interrupted by Jaymes. \n \n ``More the ",

There simply wasn ’ t enough space in that back closet to fit three full-grown men, not if they wanted the door closed.

He was appointed as the elder after his father, Creed, died when he was 45, the oldest man in the tribe. He was also the longest living member too.

It made Jess melt, but also made her feel sick. The adrenaline pumping through her at being near him, that smelling him after so long made the hair on her neck prickle, was clashing horribly with the sick feeling in her gut at the immediate, most shameful memory she contained. The one that would occasionally keep her up at night. The one that wanted to be blurted out immediately after such a pleasant reunion. \n \n ``Sorry, what?'' \n \n ``I asked how you were!

But it's not an easy call, because the prince of Ualax has proposed to pay for the services not in cash, but a very valuable natural resource, and it means that the current supply deficit will be done away with and the future of earth will be more sustainable th",

I'm sure somebody has done the math somewhere, but I already knew it just was impossible.

So many people in the world ill.... And the deaths! It was fairly rare from someone to die from being sick. \n \n While not everyone knew multiverse dimensional theory, some of the concepts were common knowledge. Sickness meant you had passed away in another universe. They say every decision you make creates an alternate universe for each outcome. A cold usually meant you died in a universe several steps from yours. If the illness is weak, your alternate self and you must have taken different paths from a young age.

The others I face are not so bright- They will see my paper mask and poorly attempted accents and mimicry and not even raise a brow.

      "Dr. Gerald Scott looked down into the glass case. Inside were two ant colonies, one made up of hasty and aggressive red ants, the other of calculated, ambitious carpenter ants. But these colonies did not live in harmony. Oh no, far from it. \n \n To Dr. Scott, it was almost like a scene out of All Quiet On The Western Front. Each colony had dug deep lines into the dirt, very reminiscent of the dirty trenches of wars past. The ground separating these trenches was completely devoid of vegetation and littered with the dead of both colonies. \n \n But even that wasn't as eye-opening as some of the ways the ants waged this war. Their antennas fired tiny bullets of sorts, fatal to an ant but completely harmless to a human. They had made a form of artillery, a large stick hollowed out, a rock shoved inside, and some sort of ant-designed explosive too small for Dr. Scott to examine. There were even tanks, made from leaves and twigs bound together, complete with an even smaller version of the ant artillery serving as the leaf-tank's guns. Worst of all, though, was a deadly gas that could often backfire on the side that used it. Dr. Scott theorized the thin white haze of the gas was developed from Raid, but he wasn't able to collect a sample and test it. \n \n The war was brutal. Often times one side charged the other's trenches, and were absolutely decimated. The ants had even tunneled underneath each other, occasionally resulting in frantic fighting underground. \n \n But Dr. Scott could see that the carpenter ants were faltering. He liked to keep daily counts of the ants above-ground, and he began to notice that each day the numbers slowly dwindled. This World War Ant was coming to its bitter end, and Scott only had a short time to understand this insane phe",

His little sister was in her room, eating some salad while on her phone. Mom was working, dad was doing one of his workouts. \n \n The fridge was empty. He shrugged. He didn't mind.

Danny said we were pretty deep in Mexico by now. \n \n Behind the plain the mountains. Covered in yards of snow, they'd be blinding if there was still sun. In the gaps between peaks I could see the rim of the horizon and the murderous lighting that heralded the Götterdämmerung beyond. The Snow Line and the Storm Line. They had been bottled up by the mountains but were spilling over. \n \n I thought I could hear the lightening in the wind like burning powder and feel the Earth tremble at such violence.

This wasn't exactly a dive bar. Plush couches adorned the corners, and curtains separated tables and patrons. \n \n After shooting down his vodka the balding smelly old man turned to me and loudly stated, ``You know, I was God once.'' \n \n I just politely smiled and he continued on while I nursed my beer. \n \n ``Yeah, I had it all.

Not for one second however does he give into the temptation to rest his head on his saddle. With his coat providing him the bare minimum warmth, he keeps his head cocked in the distance.

Cool stone kissed Kiele's back through his linen tunic and sweaty leather squirmed in his palm, wrapped round the hilt of his flail. He swallowed, licked his lips. A buttery column of sunlight dangled from an opened hatch in the ceiling, the only scrap of light in the gloom. As his eyes adjusted, his nostrils drank the ghoulish mold-scent of the crypt - a repository for the dead, now a safe haven for the last of the living. \n \n He longed to sob, but the creature neared, snuffling and pawing at the sooty temple floor above. It padded softly across the echoing antechamber, silent but for ragged gasps in a half-rhythm.

On the side of the arena opposite me, a man stands holding a large battery-powered flashlight. There are lanterns scattered around the balance beam, and in the middle of it is a young girl, eight or perhaps ten, doing a handstand.

It started off innocently enough - approximately a year and a half ago today there were reporting of strange, red mists that occurred over the skies of Beijing, China. But nothing came of the aftermath and investigations were utterly unfruitful. \n \n Following the report, more and more of these ``Red fog'' occurrences happened all over the world - starting in India, then Pakistan, then it spread into Africa. Sometimes multiple red fogs occurred over countries at once, occasionally some countries would even report incidents of orange fogs.

I just accepted that my soulmate would find me, not the other way around. Most people have something a little more complex craved in their bodies. Most people have generic first greetings, but they're usually a more specific phrase. ``Sorry, you first. ``, ``Would you mind taking that for me? ``, ``Mondays are the worst, huh.''. Mine was just ``Hey!''. At an age of 25, I decided I shouldn't go crazy every time someone greets me.

      "From Slaughterhouse Five. \n \n She had two big cans of soup for the Americans. It was a fairly incongruous sight -- a scrawny preteen girl, malnutrition eating away at her body leaving a skin-coated skeleton in its wake, carrying these hearty and heavy meals of which she could have no bite. This was a normal day for her ; she was numb to the clawing feeling inside her, to the creature in her stomach which pulsed constant agony throughout her body, to the incredible smell of the delicious food. She had long forgotten what food really could be -- only once did she ever dare to steal some morsels from the kitchen, and, while those brief moments brought unfathomable bliss, the beatings she received were enough of a deterrent. That was enough of a bright side though. She knew many other girls had it much worse -- at least, she thought that her beatings weren't *nearly* as bad as they could've been. She wasn't let out much, but she appreciated her treatment nonetheless. It could always get ",

You may return from death, but the haunting memories you face in your abyss never truly leave your mind. They hang at your back, like a clingy cat too lazy to move and thus deciding to hitch a ride on your shoulders. I never thought I would die anything but a physical death. After all, I had always fancied myself to be independent and emotionally strong. How could I have even anticipated that someone would steal my heart and never return? \n \n Thinking back, it started with a rather mundane moment, the sort you'd forget if not for an exceptionally beautiful or tragic memory associated with the scene. By all rights, this was the kind of place where you found solace and emotional comfort without anything to hurt you, to drive a knife deeper into your gashing wounds. \n \n I was at an old folks home with a bunch of people, all",

Teenagers, early twenties kids, you know the type. They turn pretty quick once you sit'em down and explain what might come next. Among ourselves, we had to admit they had done alright work for how badly they were organized. They'd pulled some sensitive stuff, they were planning ambushes, assassinations, thefts, that kinda thing. ``The seeds of rebellion'', I think they kept telling us. \n \n Like I said, shoulda seen it.

His eyes stared listlessly at the large tv as newscasters around the world announced he had pulled ahead dramatically in the polls. \n \n He had been declared the de facto winner. \n \n His speech had been heralded as ground breaking, as world shaking. he had swept the south in the polls, and the inner cities. He had political analysts, and even philosophers exclaiming his genius. he had united the right and the left, and really addressed the racial problems in the US. \n \n It was a disaster. \n \n \n he hadn't meant for this to be serious.

The phone began talking to itself again, so I thrust it to my ears and listened desperately. \n \n ``Sir! We're just around the corner!'' \n \n I attempted to look behind the crazed man before me. The corridor did indeed have a corner, to the left. I waited for the men to come round the corner and rescue me.

      "It happened in a flash. In the microsecond it took for me to blink, I had gone from laying on the ground, steel rod jammed through my chest, to standing in a white hallway, the floor obscured by fog. On the opposite end of the hall were wooden double-doors, decorated with gold trim and carved bas relief of cherubic figures, with two pearls the size of baseballs acting as doorknobs. Off to the side was a man standing at a podium, clad in a white 3-piece suit. \n \n ``Ah, there you are, right on schedule,'' said the man with a tone of familiarity. \n \n ``What... where am I?'' I asked. ``Am I... y'know...?'' I guessed, drawing my finger across my throat. \n \n ``Hm? Oh, yes, quite dead,'' replied the man as he flipped through the very large book sitting on the podium. ``Having a steel rod thrust through your heart will do that to you.

It was thrashing around, obviously in pain. He put his hands around the slender neck, about to put the bird out of it's misery, when a thought stopped him. The old Gaston wouldn't have thought twice about snapping the bird's neck, but now he saw it as an opportunity to test his new character. He felt the bird over gently to discover one of it's wings were broken, but that was all he could find wrong. He took off his jacket and wrapped the bird gently, cradling it to his chest.

I would go to bed so early, that I'd wake up in the middle of the night. After awhile, I stole my friends sleeping pills so I could power down faster.

Alfred said, shaking his head in disappointment. ``Why look at me, proper clean from head to toe.'' \n \n Jameson exhaled sharply while he cleaned out his dueling pistol and loaded another round. ``Perhaps it is the disappointment of not being able to put a round squarely between your eyes and be home for tea that is throwing off my aim. You've seen these beasts, nothing but hot lead into their cranium will have any effect. We have not the ammunition to waste. As such it is simply logical that we take the utmost care to ensure that each and every shot hits its target.'' Having finished reloading Jameson scanned the area for his next target. \n \n ``Oh nonsense.

      "There's not much to say as to why I was in Russia, I'm a traveller and a crater in the earth, located at the'End of the World', just seemed too uncanny for my taste. \n \n Locals say that the hole is merely the top of a volcano crater, and it's only matters of time that it'll erupt. That does seem logical, the dark rim of the crater is a sign of heat applied to the surface. \n \n There's something else though, I can't say what, I just know that it's something this world has yet to see. What I remember most was strolling around the edge of the hole and just looking in, only to be greeted by the same pitch-black eerie tingle. \n \n Two beautiful gals stood beside me, discussing ideas on what could lurk in the hole. I didn't mean to stare, but the blond of the duo was an alluring gal. Kneeling to the ground, she stared intensely into the hole. Then she stood, she swirled her head and eyes across the outskirts of the bare land, searching for something. Suddenly, she grinned. I took a step back, a sense of uneasiness came upon her. Her eyes focused to the other end of the hole. Across the 80m wide hole, was a white",

Working alongside the Jin and the Keraites, his men fought under Mongol leadership against the Tatars. The battle was swift and decisive, Temujin had flanked swiftly with his men and had caught a commander of the Tatars who had hid himself in a temporary defilade. They cut him down, and once again men cheered his name. \n \n 1200 \n Temujin grew his power steadily, again relying on meritocracy rather than any form of aristocracy to provide his power. His victories were vast, and the panoply of war spoils emboldened his men. All who saw him praised j'aut quri Temujin. \n \n 1206 \n Dozens of tribes followed Temujin. The Merkits, Naimans, Mongols, Keraites, Tartars, and Uyghurs all flocked to his banner. His power was supreme. At the Khuruldai all agreed Temujin was their power.

Growing up, he'd been distinctly average at everything - but the kids had still picked on him for his awkwardness. In adulthood, this ended with poor Derek working in a car garage, doing manual labour for the more qualified engineers. \n \n What it didn't do was stop Derek Doyle from being in the wrong place at the wrong time. When the car fell off the jacks and came crashing down to the garage floor, distinctly average Derek was crushed. \n \n His mother cried for a week. \n \n But Derek didn't. He was too busy being dead. \n \n Or so he thought. Funny, but death wasn't what he'd imagined it being. For all the talk of pearly gates and singing angels, Derek found the sterile whiteness of death to be a bit of a let-down. He'd woken in a new place - clothed in nothing but his own nakedness. This had surprised him too, as he w",

Slavery had still been abolished - just a bit later in the Southern States. Some states went full independence every once in a while but later joined the North or the South again. \n \n The relationship between the two unions had relaxed shortly after the war. The industrial advances in the North made the North the beacon of the Americas, and everyone else their allies or a backward puppet regime. \n \n In WWI, the South stayed neutral, while the North helped Britain and France.

The guard began to unfasten her shackles, pushing her forward as the door slowly opened. \n \n The light was bright compared to the tunnels she was in, and Haley squinted against it as the guard shoved her into a large, round arena floor. There were body parts of creatures she had never seen before scattered about, as well as a couple different colors of spilled and splattered liquids, one could only assume were bloods of different species. Haley's heartrate quickened as she instinctually tried to back in to the tunnel again, but the guard had already shut the door. One of the Others stood upon a floating dais that hovered above the arena. It spoke strange words and indicated Haley. The Others in the crowd literally hissed, some chucking debris and trash in her direction. Then, the announcer indicated a door opposite Haley.",
      "My family moved to a new town called SunnySide Hills. It was due to my father who stationed at a nearby military base. \n \n Before we got inside the gated community, we saw a ten year old boy. He urged us to turn back now. However, a single resident shooed him away, before letting us in. \n \n When we got there, everybody was smiling, and they seemed very happy. They welcomed us with a huge party, with people of all ages being present. They gave us funny tasting hamburgers as well. \n \n However, my father did not enjoy this huge amount of happiness. He saw the world as a dark place, as he had seen many of his own friends die right before his eyes. One day, he just vanished without a trace. Me and my mother asked everybody about his appearance. \n They said that they were concerned, but their smiles never faded off of their faces. I started to get scared, as my face slowly began to stop smiling. My mother got frustrated with the town, and she got outraged at everybody. A man said that she out to calm down and accept the'truth', but she would not comply. I soon felt myself be knocked out, as they dragged her away, screaming. \n \n When I woke up, I saw some teenagers, with a boy around my age standing nearby. He introduced himself as Clyde, and that he was a part of'The Truth-Seekers' It turns out that the residents of SunnySide Hills were obsessed with happiness, and that they literally anybody who did not want to be as happy as they were.

Laura was sitting with her back against the bed, her feet stretched out in front of her. She was toying with the silver necklace I had had made engraved with her name again.

Overcast, but no rain. Ryan was a natural worrier, but the events that had just taken place did not seem to bother him. He was on vacation, so his mood was naturally a little more relaxed. This was normally the kind of thing that would cause him to be very obsessive, and would take over his mind, so he couldn ’ t concentrate on anything else, but he figured, “ maybe it wasn ’ t the best thing to happen, but I ’ m completely certain everything will be okay. ” Ryan continued jogging for about 40 minutes, until he felt that the workout was sufficient. \n He got back to his hotel room, when his boss, Kenneth, called his hologram machine.

It was exciting enough when a rogue body slipping through our solar system was discovered, and once analysis of the light it reflected revealed that it not only had an atmosphere, but an oxygen-rich one, the entire world stood still, watching. Unsurprisingly, this was a really big deal. \n \n There was one problem, however. The rogue body would only remain reachable for just a moment, and would be lost forever after, leaving very little room for probes to visit. The opportunity would stretch current technology to its limits, but it just so happened that its predicted trajectory would bring it in *just* the right spot to be reached from Earth, making it possible to send *something* if we were ready by then. \n \n And that something is us. A ``colonization'' mission, of sorts. It's actually pretty amazing that a team was able to be assembled at all ; visiting another planet without really having much data on it was unfathomable in past decades, but it was decided that those who volunteered would assume the risks for what was likely never going to happen again. A self-sustained, living, *breathing* planet, right within reach. We are scientists. We crave knowledge above all else, and as such, our lives are a small price to pay for its betterment. \n \n And so we set off. We would study this planet from the surface, and send everything back to our birth planet for as long as was technologically possible.

Suddenly, I could see smoke rising, and then more and more buildings being built. They weren't like the ones we'd seen before, which were mostly built as a place to live in or host events. These buildings constantly had people flooding into them in the morning and out of them in the night. They constantly had these little cube things, neatly packaged, flowing out of them.

I found that I could actively manipulate my forest, and so would fashion living furniture for my guests- seats of wood and ivy and bound with vines.

Luckily, we live in a time advanced enough where we can adapt to life anywhere. In this mild hell, people sought refuge from the sun in various ways.

The void seemed to pull at me, yanking at everything around it. It seemed to absorb my painting's golden glow, sucking it in like some insatiable demon in search of food. I didn't think it possible, but the dark pit darkened even more. A rank odor wafted up and I retched, waving a hand before my face, watching with incredulity as a figure floated up from the abyss. \n \n The woman hovered over the void, her shapely figure scantly clad in writhing shadow. She looked around, confused. Possibly drunk, or maybe high. I'd seen stoners in a similar state, back when I let myself indulge upon such substances during the age of the hippie. She gave a start, realising she'd become the subject of attention. More shadows flew up from the void and she grasped them with her hands, pulling them about her body. In the distance, a siren wailed. \n \n ``Um,'' I started",
      "``But Grandmother...'' \n \n Elizabeth sniffed in disapproval. William was the latest in a line of family members who had come to persuade her to change her mind. But her mind would not be changed. Her tape recording would forever change the face of rap music. \n \n ``I had expected more support from you, William,'' she said, levelling her gaze at her grandson. ``Now Phillip, Charles, Anne, Andrew, Edward... their objections I understand. They are far too'old school' to comprehend my music. You, on the other hand, are still young.'' \n \n Harry snickered at his brother. ``Exactly, Will. Gran, *I* think you should do it. It'll be brilliant.'' \n \n ``Indeed it will,'' she smiled. ``Thank you, Harry, for being my sole supporter.'' \n \n And so it was that on the twenty-first of April, Elizabeth dropped the revolutionary album *90*. The cover art was simple : a solid background of royal blue, bearing an abstract stencil of the Crown Jewels, the title *90*, and, in smaller lettering, *Her Majesty the Queen*. Being thoroughly caught up with the times, the first single ( ``Duke'') was also released on Youtube. Soon Her Majesty's killer flow was on refrain throughout the nation, the commonwealth, the former colonies, then the entire world... \n \n \n ``Duke'' \n \n Her Majesty the Queen \n > *His name Philip, his title Duke* \n \n > *I chose him to marry, it weren't no fluke* \n \n > *From Greece and Denmark, to Edinburgh* \n \n > *Y'all better stay away, he's my ",

The black door obscured the interior of the only private office in the building from sight. Kevin read the inscription engraved in white lettering on the door, ``Regina George, Regional Manager.'' Kevin tapped on the door. No one answered. Kevin reached for the handle and swung the door open with ease. A large oaken desk greeted him, a beautiful piece of handiwork. Behind the desk sat an attractive young blonde, who was paging through documents. Kevin approached the desk, but the young woman continued her work without even a glance upwards. \n \n ``Where are the others?'' Kevin inquired. \n \n The woman looked up from her printed reports at Kevin through horn-rimmed glasses. She carried an air of freshness and relevance.

In general, teams are allowed eleven players each on offense and defense. Each team is allowed four downs, or chances, to advance the ball at least ten yards. On defense, teams must attempt to tackle the ball carrier in order to stop the team from advancing. Touchdowns are worth six points, extra point attempts are allowed after TDs, and field goals are worth three points.\n\n3 \tThe NFL also has regulations regarding the size of specific field equipment, the number of timeouts in each half, required team timeouts during each game, the location of coaches’ boxes, and several other specifics that help improve the quality and fairness of the game. Additionally, if a team is trailing behind in score, the NFL had introduced a “game clock” which helps keep the game from lasting too long.

      "This article is over 2 years old\n\nThe government says it wants to bring in a more \"mature\" system for the NHS while maintaining universal healthcare\n\nMinisters say they want a change that would make the NHS more like other public services and could see it become fully universal in the future.\n\n\nIn a letter to the Guardian, the leaders of 14 professional bodies representing doctors, nurses, and midwives say they want the government to take a more mature approach to the design of health services instead of simply pursuing what ministers call their \"sensible\" approach of moving to the \"next step\".\n\nThe letter, which the Guardian has seen and is embargoed until Wednesday, says health service providers and the prime minister should accept there are \"varies in how a health service is delivered with different patients, treatments and funding sources\".\n\nIt comes after the Guardian revealed that the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence published guidance in January on health services that called for an overhaul of the way patients were diagnosed and treated and new funding streams for NHS trusts to make the NHS more efficient. In response, the government said it wanted to \"modernise\" or \"streamline\" the care system, while also ensuring universal, free NHS care, and that it will continue to fund services based on need and need is not compromised.\n\nThe prime minister's top healthcare adviser, Andrew Lansley, has since said a \"next step\" for the NHS would not mean more expensive hospital waiting lists. Instead, it would involve a more \"mature\" model for care that allows doctors and nurses to communicate better with patients.\n\nBut the letter from the UK Medical Association, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, and the British Academy of Nursing urges the government to rethink this approach. The letter cites evidence showing people are reluctant to seek treatment when going out and about, making them more difficult to treat and more costly to pay for.\n\nIt cites the example of a woman who had a stroke and had the stroke treated in hospital where she spent £3,000 in a week, while others were treated at home or other community settings with no overnight stay. The letter says the \"next step\" for patients requiring \"specialised and expensive care\" is a \"more mature\" form of care that requires care at home, where a \"couple of hours' nursing\" takes up only a few minutes on an overnight nursing unit.\n\nThe letter urges the government to consider how such costs impact on patients who work and save for their retirement. The letter says the costs of treating a stroke in hospital can amount to about £4,150.\n\nThe authors of the letter say the government could benefit from a more mature approach that \"would allow for the funding of more services to be based on need and need\" rather than \"the next step\". The letter says: \"This could also involve better use of information and care as well as a shift from a fragmented system where we have many separate systems that do not link up, through our health service, as we do with other public services.\"\n\nThe letter adds: \"The current system of funding has resulted in very fragmented models of care where there are significant financial incentives for some and no significant incentives for others. We are aware that a major shift in delivery would mean the creation of a new system of care.\"\n\nProf Sir Bruce Keogh, the country director of the NHS, said: \"This is a comprehensive set of thoughtful and substantive criticisms of both the current and proposed NHS reforms. In the letter, it does not attempt to single out either one as the source; all proposals must pass the trust and test of the public, so we will judge the impact of the changes in each case on their specific delivery models.\"\n\nA spokesman for the Department of Health said: \"We agree with the key conclusion of these experts. We all recognise that there is no single right or right way to care for patients.\n\n\"We have announced a long-term economic plan to rebuild the NHS and deliver a modernised, improved healthcare system for all. We have been clear that there will be a new care model once we finally agree on a new contract with junior doctors. We hope this latest statement will help us get those talks back on track. We are keen to address concerns that the current plans would drive up waiting times and make services less accessible.\"",
      "You might have found out about the upcoming Windows 10 Mobile build using Twitter or Google+. I'm not going to pretend to be more savvy than someone who has been in the mobile world for a long time but for anyone wanting to know anything more than this, I thought it would be of help. Below is a link to my own guide on how to install and upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile, so I hope you don't mind me sharing it.\n\nI will go into my background, how to install Microsoft apps like Paint, the Phone app, and Cortana, and of course, how to set up your phone to do the updates (you must have the proper device keys for that). You can also use a PC to do this as well. If you run a Windows phone and need some help, follow this post first:\n\nHow to get your Windows Phone to do an OTA update\n\nHow to get an OTA update on Windows 10 Mobile\n\nTo help you get your phone up-and-running, let's go through the basic steps.\n\nHow to install and upgrade to Windows 10 Mobile\n\nLaunch the App Studio app from your Start screen, search for \"Windows Store App Builder\", and start the installation.

      "Somewhere off the coast of California there's a giant submarine that can't be seen with the naked eye.\n\nThe US Navy submarine, the USS Cleveland, spent its last few days of active service floating a few hundred yards from its location in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.\n\nWhile it might have looked quiet on the surface, the Cleveland was actually a test bed for a new system called Deep Submergence Awareness (DSA) that will tell the US military a lot about its enemies and potential threats at the push of a button.\n\nDSA is a sensor that's used in military operations to detect submerged submarines and surface ships. The system has been around for years, and has the advantage of not requiring active detection.\n\nThe technology is made by the US Navy's Research Laboratory of Electronics, and it was used during the last few weeks to test a new and experimental technique which will give the US the data it needs to accurately track the movements and capabilities of the Chinese army.\n\nThe DSA system is designed to detect the movement of submarines using acoustic waves, but, according to Peter Hayes, who oversees the DSA program, it only works when the submarine is near enough to receive them.\n\nHe told Defense One that this was a significant problem during the last few years for the system, and that there were \"significant problems in getting the data.\"\n\nIf the DSA sensor system is successful, DSA should be able to give information to US military officials from almost any point on the planet, a capability that could save lives in combat situations.\n\nChina is one of the biggest powers in the world today, and has been developing its capabilities for decades.\n\nFor example, the People's Liberation Army Navy has been making huge pushes to deploy advanced missile systems called Project-115. Chinese warships have been regularly detected traveling from Shanghai to Hainan Island, a few hundred kilometers north of Sanya Islands, a Chinese city that sits on the coast of the South China Sea.\n\nWhile there are fears of an attack, the US military has been using the ability to detect a submarine's movements to help target these ships with guided weaponry before a strike is ready to happen.\n\nThe technology could also be used to spy on underwater targets, including potential ballistic missiles. China in the past have been suspected of using such tech for such a purpose, but there is no actual evidence of them doing so.",
      "This story is about Published Apr. 2017\n\nHow Texas won the SEC East despite a disastrous offense By Mike Renner/Staff Writer Contact Mike Renner on Twitter: @MikeRner29\n\nWhat's gone right: Strong has led the Longhorns to 14 wins in 2014 and a No. 5 ranking the past two seasons, and this year's version of the Texas team isn't far off from either one. After struggling to an 18-7 record in 2014, the Longhorns have won 14 SEC games over the past three years while posting a Top 25 ranking. Defensive end Myke Tavarres was the team's No. 1 pick in 2014, and the team's starting quarterback for all but two games since the departure of David Ash last year, sophomore Jerrod Heard. The Longhorns have been aggressive with their blitzes and quarterback pressure, leading the SEC in third-down efficiency. What's gone wrong: One of the few things to go right for Texas so far in the 2015 season is the play of its offense. The Horns, who went winless the first six games of last season, have started to find some semblance of rhythm under Strong. For the first time in the last three years, quarterback Tyrone Swoopes has put up some solid numbers, with his completion percentage up from 57.5 percent to 59.3 percent. And after missing three games with an injury, he looks back to what people expect. The big weakness is the Longhorns defense, which has given up at least 40 points three times in the last four weeks. How Texas will do in Week 7: Texas' only loss at Alabama is probably an aberration. Even after Saturday's 31-13 loss to the Crimson Tide, the first half showed signs of progress for the Longhorns' offense. The defense should remain excellent and has won 10 of its last 14 games against ranked opponents. How Texas won't do in Week 7: If the Longhorns' offense continues to improve, you wouldn't be surprised if the rest of this team continues to struggle, leading to one of the more dramatic upsets of the season in the Longhorns' opener against No. 21 Texas A&M. A huge game against the Aggies would not only prove Texas has what it takes to be an SEC contender, but also solidify the team's national title hopes.\n\nWhat's next: Texas and Oklahoma play Saturday in the Alamo Bowl in San Antonio, Texas. Baylor opens the season at home against Louisiana Tech. Texas will be looking to make a season-opening statement while also taking a step closer towards building on the past three weeks. Baylor's schedule sets up well for the Bears. Texas will travel to New Orleans this week for a conference opener against New Mexico, but the Longhorns shouldn't have any trouble winning any of their three games at home in a season-opening week. The Longhorns have a huge week of games at home, starting with a Friday night game against LSU on September 3 (at home or on the road).",
      "The best way to learn about the role of the internet in human culture is to take a day trip, and then come back and write a book about it. Here's a short guide to what you should get out of your trip to the Net.\n\nThe Trip\n\nThe internet is in an interesting place right now. It was invented in the 1990s, is the fastest growing product that anybody could think of, and is one of the first big successes for the free market of ideas. In one sense, it's a triumph. It brings a variety of people together who might not otherwise meet, and it serves as a platform from which new ideas can rise up and spread. It's also one of the biggest hurdles on the path, and it's going to take a long time to get used to it. The more you can accept it as a part of your life, the better prepared you'll likely be for it and the less likely you'll be to fall into the traps that many still seem to fall into – those of being a jerk.\n\nBut there are also dangers, and we need to figure out how to deal with those dangers more effectively than we have been doing so far. The first time you go to the internet in a new way, you're probably excited at the notion of exploring the web; you may even feel you can make use of it, whether for free or for a price. But we don't have to do that. In fact, if we want to keep going forward, we should be careful in how much of a role the internet plays in society. Here are some things we should avoid doing on the trip:\n\nMaking Enemies (as in, making friends) with other people on the internet. It's okay to agree with everybody on everything, but as the old saying goes, it's better to discuss and debate with people than to have one sided arguments.\n\nIt's okay to agree with everybody on everything, but as the old saying goes, it's better to discuss and debate with people than to have one sided arguments.

Sometimes the internet is full of people who just don't like each other, sometimes it's full of a person who you think is super cool but really isn't; if you're just trying to understand the whole world in this way, you may be a little lost. You can still use the internet to your advantage in the long run, though, and by knowing some of the different things that it covers, you're on the way towards better understanding human culture at large.

      "The Obama administration has raised some eyebrows today in court when it announced that it would no longer defend the constitutionality of its health care law in cases where the law is challenged under the Affordable Care Act.\n\nBut the Obama administration doesn't actually have to go to court and seek to defend the law. Instead, it will just go ahead and defend it in court, even in cases when the individual mandate is in question.\n\nIt was a big enough victory of a decision for the Obama administration, which will now be the most litigious of all the government's chief legal teams.\n\nIn its ruling yesterday against the employer mandate, the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals found that the administration's argument that the mandate could be delayed was a legitimate one:\n\nThe court found the Obama administration's legal position to be a plausible and plausible interpretation of the Affordable Care Act, and that's good enough for now. That includes the argument that it can hold off enforcement of the mandate because the courts have already ordered the administration to start offering health care to more Americans under the law. And now that they have, the administration can stop enforcing the mandate until that entire process is completed.\n\nThe challenge by a California insurance firm — one of many challenges in which employers refuse to hire workers or limit their health insurance.\n\nBut while it appears the Obama administration has agreed to settle all of those challenges — and the lawsuits of many states on the grounds that Obama's health care law doesn't provide enough protection for those who receive government subsidies in order to get their health insurance — the administration insists, through attorney John P. Carlin of the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel, that the Supreme Court has already cleared the path for the administration's next steps:\n\nThe administration may appeal to the Supreme Court the circuit court's ruling, but Justice Department lawyers said it believes there is no legal reason why the government can't go forward at least in part with appeals that the Supreme Court has already decided on in recent cases. \"This Court's order simply precludes the Administration from appealing for the Supreme Court to review the Court of Appeals' decision,\" Carlin said. \"We will continue to defend the statute, but, once the Circuit Court of Appeals has issued this order, it is our intention that no further appeal will be entertained.\" The Supreme Court issued a ruling in 2012 upholding the individual mandate, along with its requirement that the insurance market be competitive with no \"substantial impediment\" to purchasing health insurance, by upholding Obamacare's constitutionality under the commerce clause.\n\nThe ruling against the individual mandate is also a setback for a lawsuit filed by House Republicans arguing that Obama's health care law would make it too difficult at some point for Congress to pass laws that would provide coverage for their members without undermining the ACA. This new decision would make it even harder for those members to take their fight all the way to the Supreme Court, which could ultimately force either party to compromise on the issue.",

      "How to make a Raspberry Pi camera with a Raspberry Pi\n\nThis is a brief tutorial to show you how to make a Raspberry Pi camera from a kit. The kit we are building is the Raspbian Camera Kit. You will be building a camera board that contains everything you need to create your own personal camera from a Raspberry Pi! This Raspberry Pi kit will give you the parts needed, along with wiring instructions to help you connect it all together.\n\nThis project started a couple of weeks ago. I had built an awesome looking camera, and I was really looking forward to using it. I put a call out on my twitter account in the Raspbian forum asking for tutorials on how to build a camera from scratch. After running around a bunch of tutorials I came across a really great build on how to build your own camera using the Raspberry Pi. This was my inspiration to make one from scratch.\n\nThe great thing about the Raspberry Pi is that it comes pre-loaded with a great library of tools including an amazing camera module. The library I chose to work with would make any camera project possible. I have been looking through all the various tutorials that people were writing and they all had the exact same problem: how to build their own camera from a Pi kit. Since all the tutorials were using the same camera module, I set out to build a board that uses this module as the foundation to build my own personal camcorder.\n\nThere are three parts involved in this simple Raspberry Pi camera kit. The first part is the Raspberry Pi camera module, which is the most crucial component in this small project. Next is the Raspberry Pi camera shield, which takes the camera module out of the way. The camera shield is soldered to the camera module, giving it the mounting hole to install your own camera module. The camera shield is soldered into the camera module and allows you to use a standard connector. The third part comes in an all-in-one plastic case, which contains everything except battery power and a power supply. This case is called the 'Camera Case'.\n\nThe Raspberry Pi Camera Kit\n\nThis Raspberry Pi camera kit comes equipped with a 3\" CCD camera chip called RPiC3233. This chip is one of several available in the Raspberry Pi Camera module. The other great thing about the chip is that it is the only chip on the RPi where you can easily use off-the-shelf camera modules and cables without having to make custom cables or custom modifications. The RPiC3233 is also the only chip on the RPi that supports video signal and data transfer speeds up to 480 fps without a delay. In addition to great low-cost camera module support, the Raspberry Pi Camera Case has all the other features you would need.\n\nThe Pi camera shield is actually a great idea, and comes in a great case. You can build the case with or without a camera module and you get different versions of the case that are shaped to be either a rectangular or round rectangular camera. The only reason I did not choose to use the Raspberry Pi Camera Case is because I like the Raspbian camera software which was made available as part of the Raspbian distribution. This software was designed to work with the RPi camera module and it is not compatible with software that runs on the RPi Camera Case.\n\nYou may ask, will I have to make custom cables for this box? Absolutely not! I do not own Raspberry Pi cables to install the camera module. You do buy some cheap, generic HDMI or USB to male extension cables with RJ45 connectors. I do not have these cables, but if you do, you could plug in your video monitor and power adapter. You can also use a video monitor with a USB 3.0 video output, or a power supply with an output that can supply a maximum of 3.3 volts to power such devices. The PiCamera Case and the Raspberry Pi Camera Module have both a standard power connector and a micro USB connector that works for charging a battery.\n\nIf you are interested in purchasing the original Pi Camera kit, head to https://www.raspberrypi.org/shop and you will find the best prices on the Raspberry Pi Camera Kit. If you are wondering if you need one of these cases, you may also be interested in this one that comes with a camera module and cases. Please keep in mind that both of these cases are great for any basic computer project, and for a Pi Camera Kit as well.\n\nStep One – Build the camera board\n\nThe first bit of the project is to build the basic Pi camera board. The Pi Camera Kit comes with a PiCamera board already pre-installed in it. The board is very easy to make.\n\nWith the case, all you have to do is slide the PiCamera Board into a hole you drilled in the case and then snap it in place. A big part of this project is to ensure the Raspberry Pi is always protected from bending and warping. The",
      "I'm working as an associate clinical psychologist for children and their families at a local hospital. It takes me about eight hours on a Friday afternoon to answer some questions about the day's events. If you're anything like me, you go for a walk and a meal before returning to your desk and working the next day. I've managed to get through the year without any real health issues — except for one that my parents and I had to resolve at about the same time last fall that I broke my foot.\n\n\nIt should come as no surprise, therefore, that after all my work, I'm on crutches. I could use a few tips for walking on and off crutches, but I thought this blog would be a good time to post some of the tips I use to prevent back problems while I'm working. When we think about the mechanics of walking and moving over a crutch, this list could go on and on. Hopefully, the tips here will help you avoid the more common problems that can arise when you've crutched for too long.\n\n1. Take breaks as needed\n\n\nWhether it's a 5 minute walk or an afternoon nap, if your foot hurts during your shift, take a break before you start the next one. If you're getting into a bad habit of walking on your crutch for any extended time — such as four or five days a week, or more than 11 crutches a week — consider hiring a therapist. And make sure that your walking or exercise routine is getting you to a good position in your walking (i.e. not back pain). This can help you avoid back problems down the road.\n\n\n2. Keep your knees in proper alignment\n\n\nYou should always keep your knees in proper alignment so that you don't cause them to arch inwards or outward. Try this: Place each foot into a kneeling position. You'll need to raise your knee about 2-3 inches (5-6 cm) off of the floor. If you are still having discomfort, put a thick (soft) cushion under your thigh and rest your foot on top of this. If this feels uncomfortable, try placing your foot into a squatting position with your calf at least 4-8 inches (10-20 cm) away from the floor, and take longer to raise the knee higher. Again, this should help to prevent problems down the road.\n\n\n3. Do some stretching right before you work\n\nStretching the lower leg and hip flexors can help you keep your feet in proper alignment, which will help you take full strides over your crutches. In fact, if your thighs have any pain or tightness after crutches and you can't stop crutching on your own — then I strongly recommend that you see a therapist for back and knee pain. If you don't already have your own therapist set up, or if you're not sure if you're ready, see what your doctor or occupational therapist is recommending.\n\nIf I had a dollar for every patient who told me they crutched because they hate the noise or they'd rather not lie on a hospital floor all day, I'd be a very rich man (my salary would be higher than my car payment!). If you're a working parent, it's not uncommon to be tired, drained, and sore. So if you're experiencing any of the following after a day of crutches — the pain is not from the crutches themselves, but from another part of your body affecting your sleep, breathing, or balance:\n\n\nPain is interfering with your normal activities. Pain is interfering with your normal activities. Sleep isn't as consistent as usual.\n\n\nOnce you understand the source of your pain, take action:\n\n\nLearn how to effectively stretch and flex your muscles in a safe and efficient manner.\n\n\nLearn how to get better sleep and prevent nighttime leg pain.\n\n\nLearn how to eat better, and how to exercise on crutches.\n\n\nGet your back in shape by stretching and flexing your muscles and then moving them around when you go out and about.\n\n\n4. Don't forget your ankle support\n\n\nYour ankle supports are a great way to give your feet a chance to stretch and rotate without the constant tension of a crutch, which can cause your ankle to be in a straight-to-the-bone position. They come in a variety of sizes, shapes, and designs, and are also available for those who want to crutch on a regular basis. Some patients have to walk with their ankle supported for hours and even days at a time to prevent injuries and other problems. So while it may not be possible to work the day shift, and your ankle supports may be at hand — it's important to use them correctly.\n\nThe simplest method of ankle support is to have an extra strap secured to a wall or doorpost and then tie the strap to the crutch strap on the inside of your ankle. There are many types",
      "The following are the top ten most popular games in the United Kingdom, and how many people play each of them:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n10. Minecraft (4 million)\n\nMinecraft is the only game on this list to release more than one version of its classic sandbox building game, which was first launched in 2009 on the Xbox 360, followed by other platforms later. Minecraft continues to grow in popularity because it's cheap to buy a new PC copy online, and it's simple to understand even if you've never played it before. As of last month, Minecraft had over 40 million active members.\n\n9. Grand Theft Auto V (8 million)\n\nWith four iterations, Grand Theft Auto V has become the most popular video game on the planet. With the new GTAV season featuring three different protagonists, a new gang, and a new protagonist (Hiro Protagonist), every single month of the game is a new story. Rockstar has even added some new features to the GTAV experience, such as the ability to \"drive\" other cars as a pedestrian!\n\nAdvertisement\n\n8. World of Warcraft (8.3 million)\n\nWith more than 10 million subscribers and close to 100 million players, WoW is the fifth largest online game on the planet, behind World of Warcraft, Diablo 3 and Starcraft II. WoW remains the number one free-to-play game on the market, and with an astounding monthly active player count of more than 100 million, it's safe to say that almost everyone plays it. Blizzard has even recently added a massive expansion, Wrath of the Lich King, to make it their most extensive and ambitious content expansion since Burning Crusade.\n\n7. Starcraft II: Wings of Liberty (9.2 million)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith 11 editions across two different platforms, Starcraft II is widely considered to be one of the most popular strategy games of all time. It's also one of the fastest-growing games in the world. Released in 2004, Starcraft II featured more than a dozen distinct races on screen at once, dozens of different unit types, and tons of different units and technologies that players could research and unlock.

      "Miguel's Story\n\nGrowing up, Miguel always dreamed of playing for Real Madrid.\n\nBut life didn't happen on the pitch.\n\nMiguel was forced to grow up a lot younger thanks to his parents. His father was forced to work because his job was just too valuable to him. His mother, on the other hand, was forced to work because a family member needed to be cared for at home.\n\nOne day, just like most kids, a baseball was handed to Miguel, one he loved. Before he knew it, his idol, Leo Gómez, had signed the ball.\n\nBut unlike Leo, Miguel's dream wasn't all that it seemed.\n\nWhen he got his first contract in the Major Leagues, he discovered that Leo never actually gave him the contract.\n\nBut then, on January 31, 2009, Miguel woke up to find out that they had reached an agreement: Leo would not sign the contract but would honor the pact he had made.\n\n\"My first day as a professional, I got the money in my hand, while Leo was asleep… In the end, I gave him half my contract money, not knowing what the hell I was doing.\"\n\nMiguel's dream didn't end there; he couldn't help himself. He would be more than happy to give up one thing for another: a free meal with all the money he had earned.\n\nSoon Miguel found himself in the office of his current Real Madrid Coach, Zinedine Zidane. When Miguel took a seat, Zidane immediately noticed that he was a big kid: almost six feet tall and 180 pounds with short hair.\n\nMiguel looked up at Zidane and said: \"If you give me one thing, I just want to give it to you, it's just that simple.\"\n\n\"One thing, what about that?\" said Zidane.\n\nMiguel grinned and answered: \"The hamburger.\"\n\n\"You mean the free hamburger?\" \"Yes\", Miguel replied.\n\nBut then, Zidane thought of something.\n\n\"I'm not sure about the deal I gave you, but if this kid is willing to give me another, I'm willing to give you something worse. You have the choice. You can give me the hamburger.\" Miguel smiled. \"Good choice.\"\n\nMiguel had given Zidane what few Real Madrid players had managed to offer him: food and money.\n\nNow, at 31-years-old, after 10 years with the big club, Miguel has finally managed to get to the top of Real Madrid. He has earned the respect of his team, Real Madrid fans, and of the club itself. This is where the story of how he lived one of the hardest lives in sports start.\n\nBorn in the slum of Rosario, Argentina, on December 22, 1988 in a household that did not have a fridge to put groceries, Miguel spent his youth in a tough, violent neighborhood where his father and sister were in and out of jail, constantly missing work, and where their mother had run away twice.\n\nGrowing up, Miguel always dreamed of playing for Real Madrid. \"I was a good player. I just missed the chance,\" Miguel says. \"I always felt very uncomfortable with the way we played: passing, not creating anything. I wanted Real Madrid. All I wanted was to play for them.\"\n\nSo, Miguel took every opportunity he could. He learned baseball from his cousin, then decided to get his diploma to play soccer. However, his school only taught him how to pitch and catch a ball with his bare hands, so he spent a little longer in the classroom. After about eight months of lessons, Miguel gave up the whole thing and just focused on trying to become a baseball player.\n\nIt took another nine months before he graduated from the academy and started playing against men in a neighborhood called Llamamue. After that, Miguel found out that Real Madrid wanted him to try out for their youth team. Once that happened, a new life was beginning for Miguel.\n\nAfter three years trying out for the team, Miguel finally made it: he received a contract to play for Real Madrid in the 2010-11 season. Unfortunately, the dream lasted only for one season, and before he knew it he had lost his way. In 2012, Miguel was diagnosed with diabetes, and as the young athlete started to lose weight, his leg felt much heavier than it should. Miguel was not only losing weight fast, but also losing the balance in his body.\n\n\"My leg would start to wobble around, and my heart would race… I could hardly walk. It was frightening. But once a day, I would try to work on the wobble so that the heart could calm down.\"\n\nThe situation came to a head one day, when Miguel had to go to the hospital for a",

      "If you were in the US last month, you might remember seeing a documentary about how we need to make sure our children grow up, eat healthy, and have access to a quality education. You might even remember the film's title. If you weren't at that event, then you might be seeing a very different message now. This might be the documentary you saw last month.\n\nAccording to the trailer, it looks like the US government is secretly attempting to replace teachers to create a generation of obedient workers, which is why these movies (and the other propaganda films like them) exist. One way or another, it also looks like we'll be watching more and more propaganda.\n\nIt's no surprise, then, that some people are getting upset. The documentary, which was produced by the Institute of Noetic Sciences, was produced under the premise that the best way to teach our kids is to make sure they're doing something they're great at. This is basically what's called a self-fulfilling prophecy, but here's why they think it's effective: \"If children never learn anything, then society will never allow for any changes. And if society never allows for change, then children will never experience the changes necessary for any sort of innovation and development.\"\n\nSo we want to have the same children every year, and they'll never develop what it takes to be a fully functioning adult. What will they be good at? We can't teach them how to do anything, because if we do that, if they're not doing it, we'll never do it, and the world will collapse.\n\nA child who's incapable of working at all will never be motivated to work. That's because children have zero intrinsic motivation. Without motivation, they'll be a burden, not an asset; without an asset, they'll not be productive; and without productive, they'll not be productive, and so on.\n\nSo we have to stop having kids, because otherwise children will never accomplish anything. And once they do accomplish something, they won't want to do anything else, because they've already done that.\n\nAnd this is the point that should really concern you. Parents often try to stop having kids because they think it'll stop them from working; a lot of them also try to do so because they think that it'll stop them from going to school. Well, the film takes both of these ideas and throws them to the winds.\n\nIt's not the kids who are at fault. The kids are the product of their time in this world. Parents may be able to be part of their lives by letting them live in their world and by showing them and letting them experience the world around them. They can also be part of their worlds by teaching them that their world is good and valuable, and that they should strive to build a good world for our kids in return.\n\nWell, you can't stop everything, and you can't stop something that's supposed to be your job. And as much as many people may hate this, there is a good reason for it. As we've covered previously, you cannot stop people from doing what you want them to do. But there is a way to help the people you put in charge of things. That's why we have schools.\n\nThe key word there is help. You may not be comfortable giving a child a book so that it makes them feel valued. That's fine—the book shouldn't matter—but you'll help by showing them how important it is. You'll help them see a positive example that they can emulate. You'll help them see that it's possible for them to be something great. And as much as it seems you don't, you can. We're all capable of greatness. The more we see people like that, the lower their self-esteem will be and the higher their self-worth will be.\n\nThis is the message that we need to get out: children are capable of greatness, and you can help create this for them.\n\nTo be clear, this is not an excuse for parents to ignore their responsibility in this regard. We're not advocating that people who come from homes with problems like yours do nothing and leave their children with their problems. No, that would likely create even worse problems. All we're saying is that the best way to help children with their difficulties is to do what you can to help them find alternatives to the ones they currently have.\n\nYou can help make sure that your children are not the sort of people you'd like them to be. You can keep their hearts healthy—it's possible to do this and stay emotionally healthy in the process without abandoning your children completely, which some parents certainly do. And you can do the things you can as a parent that will lead to a more fulfilling and fulfilling life for them, that will develop them into self-reliant individuals.\n\nYou can help them see that they're capable of achieving anything, and then help them do it",

      "The U.S. Patent & Trademark Office on Tuesday issued a patent application published last week that may be the first use of blockchain technology to track and track the movement of physical goods.\n\nAccording to a news release issued by the USPTO, D.C.-based startup Monegraph filed a patent application that was published this week. The application details an invention that uses the blockchain, the technology known to most people as the distributed ledger used to record and track the movement of digital currencies such as the Bitcoin and Ethereum.\n\nMonegraph's patent described an invention that could link physical products using a system that tracks the movement of physical goods, such as cars, trucks, and aircraft. The company is currently seeking protection for its invention in the United States.\n\nAccording to the filing on Monday, one embodiment of the invention has the tracking system comprising:\n\na system for storing information pertaining to a physical product;\n\na server for transmitting the information pertaining to the physical product to the system of storage, which in turn stores and transmits the information to the system of movement monitoring; and\n\na server for receiving a data request for sending out the physical product upon the data request.\n\nIn addition to that, the filing states that as described in the following diagram, a physical product may be used to link a transaction on an electronic payment network with the transaction as it occurs on an electronic store. For example, the physical product may be used to send instructions for a payment of BTC to another user through a remote Bitcoin network.\n\nMoreover, as in the previous paragraph, if the information pertaining to the physical product is stored on a server, the information is stored securely. This means that the client can be assured that the information about the physical product that is being stored online is encrypted and not accessible to any third party.\n\nThe application further includes a server that stores information pertaining to an incoming shipment of goods that contains a physical product. As disclosed in the following block diagram, the information pertaining to an incoming shipment of goods includes, for example, information pertaining to the shipment including a physical item, the shipment type and a tracking number associated with the physical item.\n\nIn addition, according to the application, an outgoing shipment of goods may include information that can be used to identify a physical location of the physical item. The physical item may be identified within a network that is secured. Additionally, according to the invention, any information pertaining to the physical product may be received and displayed on a screen to the sender. This enables the sender to be informed about the status of an incoming shipment of goods in real time.\n\nThe information may be displayed on a screen of the sender at such a time that an individual can be shown the status of an incoming shipment. Thus, the sender may then make an appropriate decision to purchase the physical product using a remote electronic payment system.\n\nBy way of example, when the sender identifies a physical location of a physical item, the sender may choose to view the physical item on an electronic store that has been identified. Alternatively, when the sender selects to view the physical item that is contained in an incoming shipment on an electronic store maintained by the sender, the seller may choose to display the information associated with the incoming shipment on another electronic store maintained at a third party or by third parties.\n\nBy way of example, the information pertaining to the physical product may be stored on a database at a server of the remote electronic payment network.\n\nOn the basis of the application, the company is planning to build a system by connecting two separate physical stores in different countries. The companies plan to link the stores by sending an invoice from each store to the other stores. This means that, in case the payment system is successful, the payment will be received by the electronic store in a country where a physical store is located.\n\nFurthermore, the companies may integrate the electronic store to another physical store as part of a network arrangement. Once this information is received by a payment system at the other physical store, the other physical store may link the payment information with the payment system at the other physical store. Therefore, the payment information may be sent from the second physical store to the remote electronic payment network and the payment information may be integrated with the second store's payment system.\n\nThe company's main advantage is that it will be possible to integrate payments using remote electronic payment systems with physical products. The system will further allow for information to be stored securely in the physical store. The payment system will prevent information related to a physical article from being transmitted to the payment system of the other store.\n\nFinally, the company also plans to allow for remote electronic payments in countries in which electronic store are not present or in which electronic payment systems are not used. This will enable an individual to receive payments through remote digital wallets.\n\nFurthermore, according to the company, the information regarding the physical item stored on the physical store is automatically forwarded over a virtual channel of the electronic store to the remote electronic payment system.",

      "This post is the first of a series of posts that will describe how to setup your own VPN (Virtual Private Network) with Windows 8.\n\nIn early 2014, it was announced by Microsoft that they were adding support for VPNs with Windows 8.\n\nIn this post I will describe how to set up a VPN from scratch using Windows 8.1.\n\nNote: The steps below assume you are setting up a shared network with only one computer, as opposed to creating a secure private network.\n\nInstall and configure Windows 8.1 Make sure that you have downloaded the Windows 8.1 x64 ISO and extracted it to the C drive of your PC, as described here . Create a shortcut for the ISO with the following settings;\n\nIn my case, the shortcut is named \"Virtual Machine Manager (16385.exe)\\Virtual Machines\\Virtualized: New Virtual Network Network Adapter\". Right Click on the shortcut and select properties. Click on Advanced tab and choose a network type. Select Public and enter the IP of the VPN router you will be connecting to. Click Apply changes.\n\nThat's it, now you are connected to the local network. Click Start and navigate to: Control Panel\\Network & Internet\\Network and Sharing Centre\\ Network Connections. You will see the network connection you created in the image below. Under Default connections, select New connection and click Next.\n\nNote: The Windows 8.1 setup wizard will tell you that \"the connection you just created was disconnected. You will need to reconnect as the settings may not be transferred\".\n\nThat is correct: Right click on the New connection name and select Connect. Click Next to continue. At the next screen click Add. On the left menu, click Properties. On the General tab, set the Preferred method for connecting to the Internet as Automatic and check Auto-connect to this computer. Next, check Enable network discovery and then type in your IP address. I've been unable to add it to my host computer's DNS as it uses a private IP address, but it works fine for me on my personal PC using a VPN. Under Preferred DNS, enter the IP address of the VPN router you will be connecting to. Click Next.\n\nOn the next screen, select the desired settings for your network, and then click Done.\n\nAt this point you will be connected to the VPN.\n\nYou will need to enable this connection before you can access any websites with your Windows 8.1 desktop:\n\nFrom Settings->Network, click Connections and select the connection you just created. Right clicking on the connection icon and select Properties. Under Advanced Settings, switch to Disabled.\n\nNow you will able to access any website via the VPN browser. If the connection fails for whatever reason, you will have to open the router settings and click Restart to restart the VPN.\n\nI would expect to still get the same VPN speeds with this setup from my home router with the new Windows 8.1.\n\nUpdate (6/13/2014): A member of the comments below suggested that installing the latest DD-WRT firmware would enable your Windows 8.1 router to use the VPN. This guide will no longer work with the latest versions of DD-WRT.\n\nSetting up a VPN with Windows Server 2008 R2 with Express\n\nThere are a number of options for setting up a VPN from scratch with Windows Server 2008 R2. I opted not to use this procedure because:\n\nIt requires some Windows knowledge to install, but you don't have to know it, you can follow the steps described by someone with more experience in this area. It uses the same files to access the same server, but if a user were to connect at their home router and then connect on a Linux machine, then you could easily configure something more flexible in your router.\n\nWith Express, it's possible to connect to a Linux box with the same instructions (and using very similar configuration files). But this requires a physical machine with Windows 2008 R2 SP1 on it and a remote Windows 2008 R2 SP1 machine.\n\nBut if you have a VPS at your disposal that's running this version — either Express VirtualBox or Windows Server 2008 R2 — you don't have to worry about this too much. You also could start with using the Express client or install a VPN client that supports Express. But I figured what the heck—I'd try and build this for myself. In the end this is what I came up with:\n\nInstall and configure the latest Express VPN app\n\nThe Express VPN client, version 8, was originally released a few years ago and seems to be quite useful. It's free, although some of Microsoft's partners have made it more expensive as of late with a \"subscription\" price of $50 or more. Still, given that Microsoft won't really be offering support for it for quite a while, it's not a bad option.\n\nInstall the Windows Server 2008 R2 server",

      "The world's most famous sportsman looks to have survived one of most bizarre injuries ever to hit a professional footballer, after the Brazilian was airlifted to hospital with a suspected fractured skull in the early hours of Friday morning.\n\nCarlos Tevez, the Manchester City striker, was taken to hospital in San Lorenzo de Barrios, northern Rio, following what appeared to be a heavy collision with the leg of a player.\n\nDespite frantic attempts by medical personnel to save his life, Tevez's condition was said to be \"stable\" at midday yesterday with his wife, Maradona, waiting for him at the hospital while a team of specialists and his team of doctors travelled to Rio to monitor his progress.\n\nAlthough doctors had initially feared the worst, on Friday night the player's father, Tevez, who was in the United States at present, was told by the Rio medics the 29-year-old was alive, and that he had undergone surgery overnight to treat the fractured skull. \"If not for Carlos,\" his father was quoted by Brazilian media, \"Maradona's only child would have been the biggest sporting tragedy of his life, but now he's a hero. Our only fear is that he is still on life support from the infection in his skull.\"\n\nThe Brazilian media were reporting that the fractured skull could involve internal bleeding and the loss of blood supply to the brain, but the hospital confirmed it had operated on Tevez overnight with several doctors performing the surgery on one side of the player's head. \"Carlos will have further examinations this morning, but we hope to have more news in a few days,\" a hospital spokesperson said.\n\nThe Telegraph understands that Tevez's wife, who was with the player last night and is still in Manchester, was in a hospital and remains hopeful him being discharged on Saturday or Sunday, ahead of the Manchester derby at Old Trafford. Last night she told Brazilian radio: \"Today, everything has been normal, even the surgery. We are all very happy.\n\n\"There weren't any indications of anything, and we didn't expect it to be a medical problem. If I knew there was a problem, I wouldn't have had him surgery, but now it's clear it was a fractured skull. Everything is OK and he'll be back. We have to say thank you to Doctor Sotirios Fotis, who was our surgeon who took us straight here from Manchester airport.\"",

      "The first time I walked in, I noticed a large group of people having a meeting in a conference room. I was there for an early class in political science and I was immediately suspicious of the people gathering there.\n\nOne of them, an older man, was sitting across from me and he looked just fine, but I knew, with a strong feeling of dread, I wasn't in good company.\n\nI wasn't quite sure how to react. I decided I shouldn't react at all.\n\n\"Hi,\" I said, without any sort of warmth in my voice. \"How are you doing?\"\n\nThe professor sighed. \"Well, thank you for coming. It's nice to see so many people here today.\"\n\n\"Yes, I noticed,\" I said. \"Could you tell someone to take out the garbage for a while?\"\n\nThe professor nodded. \"I had some things that needed doing in my office—the files that are on my desk. The students will probably want to help, and I'd like for you to be here just in case they need something from me and you'll understand if you don't.\"\n\n\"OK,\" I said. \"No problem.\" I was relieved that he didn't seem to be too angry with me. I'd seen professors get upset with students before and felt even worse knowing my professor was angry with me. Maybe this professor wouldn't.\n\nAfter I had left, I walked to my dorm room to try to do some planning; I had a few things I wanted to do with my future. Most of them needed to be done before I left for university, and there was still some stuff on my agenda that would be hard to tackle until I was more experienced. I thought about my plan longingly, wondering how long I could stay off campus for and what I'd really learn.\n\nI'd spent the morning watching the snow fall steadily as it gathered around the ground, like a glacier on a plain. I wanted to see that snow as it fell from the hills, the way it gathered at the foot of the mountain until it melted into the air. I watched the snow fall, thinking about how to get back to my dorm room, and I wished it was summer. What I should have said to myself was just to go ahead and do it. It was as though I were in a movie and I knew exactly what needed doing, but then I walked outside and it was like seeing the movie from my own perspective: I realized that in another place, I could be that snow, instead of waiting for it to fall from the sky.\n\nThe sun was about to rise. I was standing outside my dorm room, feeling the warmth of the sun rise around me, when I got an idea. \"Wait a second, maybe…\"\n\nI walked around my dorm room and sat on the bed. I opened up my planner and began writing what was likely my college graduation speech. There would be a video of me performing it, but I wasn't really going to do any more of my normal video assignments. I wrote a speech about how my experience in the university had been a good one, and that my plan was to graduate from this university and continue on with my life, but I had more plans ahead of me. I wrote that I was planning to go to graduate school in literature and that I wanted to pursue other interests. Then I wrote that I wanted to start a new project about the Middle Ages that I'd been considering. I decided to start writing that speech now.\n\nI had three more classes on Monday before I had to leave. My plan was to do my graduate work on Monday, but I thought it was time to take a break from classes and have some fun before I left. That seemed a perfectly good time to write a speech to graduation.\n\nI wrote a speech about being a freshman on the campus of an important university, going through a lot of change and getting to know the campus and the faculty. I told the story about the freshman classes I had, and how my new roommate had started the tradition of having freshmen sit in on some lectures so they could get to know the professors.\n\nI was just about to write the last thing in the speech before stopping myself after I came up with one sentence that really struck me. I knew what it was going to be about. It was from one of the letters that I had written to Professor Farrand, who I knew had been really nice to me at the beginning of my time here at U.I.\n\n\"I just thought of something,\" I started. \"I thought it was a good way to remember the person responsible for all these really, really hard classes that have been taught to me.\"",

Most veterinarians are able to track your pet, even when it's hidden away indoors or in another country. They can perform diagnostic tests that allow you to confirm your pet's status, including ultrasound, radio frequency identification (RFID) tags and DNA identification through cheek swabs. When you see your veterinarian, he or she will refer you to a local law enforcement agency, animal services, animal shelter or other local help agency, depending on the situation.\n\nIf your pet is healthy\n\nIf your pet isn't missing and they aren't injured or suffering from a disease, it almost always means they are healthy and in good health. If your pet is healthy, you can expect them to stay home and keep up with their regular routine.\n\nIf you think your pet is sick\n\nIf your pet has an unusual symptom and is exhibiting abnormal behavior, such as diarrhea or vomiting, that's a good indicator that your pet might be sick. Keep an eye on them and stay on top of all appointments with their veterinarian. If your pet's symptoms don't improve, seek veterinary attention right away.\n\nIf you are at risk\n\nIf you're at risk of your pet being stolen, please contact us directly for a plan if your pet has left the house. It can take us hours to notify your local police department, because they want to know where your pet is, and how long it has been away (some local departments have to wait an hour before we can update them.)

      "For nearly five years, a team of physicists at the University of Rochester has been exploring a mystery. On an afternoon in September 2005, at a hotel near Rochester, New York, they assembled their team of 22 graduate students and fellows. To prepare, the physicists spent the next three hours reading the scientific papers, studying the maps that could serve as their maps, and studying the plans that could serve as their plans. After the scientists left the hotel room to gather their thoughts, they sat in a room, with a group of five other physicists and staff, working to find out what a giant laser interferometer might look like. Each would rotate around the core of the laser in a different way, and they would take measurements from different vantage points to produce a 3–D view of their field of view.\n\nWhen they put all of those disparate ideas together, they produced a map of the light field that, combined with a video camera, forms the visible universe. By observing the field from any direction they wanted, their vision would look as though it fell onto a 2.5-D surface. And, as an added bonus, they would learn something about the nature of the universe: the precise way it is made of matter.\n\n\"We were all excited, and pretty nervous a little bit,\" says Robert H. Grosberger, head of the Photonic Photonics Group and co-principal investigator of the project. \"But, we're also all really excited to see what happens when we turn everything on.\"\n\nA laser interferometer can detect the direction of a light source, much in the way that an optical sensor detects the direction of an object. But the direction one sees depends upon the position of that object in space. If the laser is pointed at a distant point, and the object is just a few times away, you will see the light from both objects, because the direction of the laser is not just a line, but a curve that is not an infinite line. In contrast, an infrared interferometry laser can only identify the direction of the light source when the object is in front of it, so an infrared camera has different challenges. Even so, by studying each of these different ways of detecting the direction of a light source, Grosberger believes that his team has achieved a 3D map that will reveal information about the state of the quantum information in some mysterious quantum state known as the Higgs boson.\n\nWhen they were first presented with this strange vision, Grosberger says, \"We sort of just stared at it, and said, well we don't give a [damn]; we just sort of figured it out from there?\"\n\nGraphene's role as the building blocks of the world's fastest superconductor\n\nWith the technology for \"quantum mapping\" ready, he hopes to be able to look into the Higgs boson the way he's seen the light field. On the team's website is the promise of this experiment: \"If we observe the Higgs boson in a real world situation, and if you can demonstrate our results, scientists will be able to begin to understand the mass and all the fundamental properties of the particle.\" The team has a week to do so, and a month after that, they will present their plan to the world.\n\nBut Grosberger thinks there's more to discovering the Higgs than simply taking an object into a room, watching it move around, and taking measurements. \"I'm sure a lot of people would say: 'Oh, well, if you just go out there and do this, the Higgs will be right up there,' \" he says. \"Well, it's not quite so simple.\" For instance, in physics, we're taught that the particle has its own spin. \"You think 'Why?,' [and then] your answer may turn out to be, 'Well we have no idea'. So the question is: how do we know?\"\n\nThat's something everyone working on the Higgs boson will have to figure out. Grosberger says the group has the answers to two questions: Can they figure out how to measure the spin of the particle? And if that could be done with the information that we have of the Higgs boson, what would the spin of these other particles be? Grosberger thinks that if you could take your spin measurements and do the exact math to determine just how big the other particles would be, it would be possible to measure the spin of the other particles, but he admits that would take some doing.\n\nA new class of materials will help scientists design faster computers\n\nIn the summer of 2014, IBM Research announced that it had made a discovery that had been kept quiet for more than a half-century: new materials made up of the same kinds of carbon found in old-growth forests had more electrical conduction, meaning they could transfer more of the electrical signals sent by a current to the next transistor than materials using new",
      "Cocoa Butter Cookies – the one and only!\n\nI am a huge fan of all shapes and sizes of cookies. When baking, I always take into consideration the size of the cookie cutter when choosing where to start baking. It makes sure that the cookie cutter makes just enough to fill each slice. The same holds true with baking, I always set a timer and leave it up to 5 minutes. I take these little beauties out when I finish the cookies when it is done.\n\nThese chocolate and peanut butter cookies have become my best selling cookies and I am so happy they are helping my students get a taste for sugar! It's a huge hit. I had to get creative to use all of the cookies available and I had no problems finding cookies to use in the batch.\n\nAs the girls enjoyed the cookies and the chocolate glaze, they were soon gobbling them up. I am sure these little treats will go straight into their \"favorite\" cookie jars. I love creating treats for my students. It's the least I can do as a teacher when I know they are enjoying and learning!\n\nChocolate Peanut Butter Cookies\n\nIngredients\n\n3/4 C. melted chocolate – plus 3 oz. for the cookies\n\n1/4 C. packed light brown sugar\n\nPinch of salt\n\n5 large eggs – at room temperature\n\n1/2 cup melted coconut oil\n\n1 tablespoon vanilla extract\n\npinch of salt\n\n2/3 cups sugar\n\n1 tablespoon butter\n\n1/2 cup chopped pecans or walnuts, dried or ground\n\nDirections\n\nIn a small saucepan, combine 1 tablespoon melted coconut oil and salt. Bring to a simmer and allow to cook for 1 minute until the salt has dissolved.\n\nMeanwhile, melt remaining chocolate in a large heat-proof bowl set over a pot of boiling water.\n\nIn a blender, add 3 ounces dark brown sugar, 1/4 teaspoon ground salt, the eggs, melted coconut oil and vanilla. Blend on high until combined.\n\nWhile chocolate is in the freezer, measure 3/4 C. of the brown sugar mixture.\n\nCombine the brown sugar mixture with the salt in a medium bowl and set aside. Add 1/2 of the melted chocolate. Stir until combined.\n\nMelt remaining 3/4 C. chocolate in a small saucepan, swirling as you cook until chocolate melts.\n\nHeat chocolate mixture in microwave for 1 minute, stirring every 30 seconds.\n\nRemove the pot from the microwave and stir in 1/2 of the white chocolate, salt, oil and vanilla, stirring until combined. Set this mixture aside as well.\n\nCombine the brown sugar mixture, brown sugar and coconut sugar in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Beat on medium speed for 3-4 minutes until sugar has thickened and incorporated the butter.\n\nSlightly spoon in the pecans and walnuts – it will feel almost gritty at this point — and continue to beat until very well combined.\n\nAdd the flour and mix in with your spatula until combined.\n\nTransfer the flour mixture to a medium bowl and set aside.\n\nBeat chocolate mixture with a whisk until smooth.\n\nWhile chocolate is cooking, add the peanut butter and beat until smooth.\n\nAdd the peanut butter mixture, stir just until combined.\n\nAdd the dry ingredients to the chocolate mixture – mix thoroughly to form a dough that is light in color – a little loose in texture.\n\nTransfer the chocolate dough to a greased bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Set in the freezer until solid – 2-4 hours.\n\nPreheat oven to 325. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone baking mats. Prepare 2 large baking sheets by sprinkling the dough with the coconut sugar and spreading it evenly.\n\nUsing your hands, roll the dough out on the baking sheet until it is 1/16 of an inch thick. Spread with 1/2 teaspoon peanut butter and let stand 2 minutes.\n\nCarefully roll out another 1/16 of an inch and spread with 1/4 teaspoon chocolate. Let stand another 2 minutes.\n\nFinally, lay two large pieces of parchment paper on your work surface; place all of the cookies on the paper and roll them out. Carefully place on the cookie sheets.\n\nBake for 11-13 minutes until tops are starting to just start to crack. Let cool for 5 minutes and then transfer to a cooling rack.\n\nStore in a bag or sealed container in the refrigerator until ready to eat.\n\nYou may choose to make this recipe for all of your students.\n\nShare this:",

      "After being a longtime fan and admirer of the brand's latest collection, we were delighted by the Spring 2018 collection's new colorways. In what was a big step for the brand, its latest collection introduced a new type of denim that had never been seen before: the \"super-high denim,\" which debuted in the Fall 2017 collection, which was the first time the brand had released another type of denim. Its high rise and slim waist is very reminiscent of the Japanese kabuki pants and b-shirts, and made it one of the highlights of the Spring 2018 lookbook. In the Fall 2017 collection, denim was a big departure for the brand. This time around, denim was incorporated into sweaters and tops, but we liked the new look in our head-to-toe, denim-and-knit pieces. And while there's no new denim in the Spring 2018 collection, the Spring 2018 collection is full of other great items. The Spring 2018 collection will hit stores on February 10, 2018, where we have a pretty good idea of what the next collection will feature.\n\nWhile we waited to see what the Spring 2018 collection could look like without traditional denim pieces, a close-up of two pieces proved that the brand is still committed to its denim-focused range: the pants and the cropped hoodie. A nice blend of denim, lace, and fur, this combo makes a good addition to the collection.\n\nIt's not every day that you see a knit pant with an elongated hem. The cuffs on these have a lovely touch, and they both have a nice softness to them; the pleats are really nice too.\n\nThe jacket of the collection features some good stitching and a great overall feel. There are also some nice details, such as the embroidery on the sleeve band and the leather lapel. And as you can tell, this is a high rise jacket – it's a perfect fit for skinny, or maybe even chunky leg shapes.\n\nThis collection included both a hoodie and pants. The hoodie is made of fleece, and it's very soft and squishy. As with the cuffed pant, this is a nice jacket that combines well with the pants.\n\nThese pants feature a little more contrast between their denim and knitted outer fabric. They are both long and cut slim fit.\n\nOverall, the Spring 2018 Spring/Summer 2018 collection is more than a step up from the brand's previous collections. For the Fall 2017 collection, we were a little disappointed by the new colorways. We loved the original Fall 2017 collection, but at $135 for the collection, we would have liked to see a little better variation.\n\nThat said, this collection is an interesting departure for the brand. While the pants and the hoodie are a departure from previous collections, the hoodie and the pants are still very much woven garments. So, as has been demonstrated with the previous collections, there is a small amount of innovation on the brand's way.\n\nWe have to say, the best thing about this collection so far is the overall vibe. From its subtle color choices to the subtle stitching, you just get a sense of the brand's dedication to this style. We are really excited for what the Spring 2018 collection might contain. It should be ready to hit stores near you come February.\n\nIf you enjoyed this post, then we bet you're going to love our daily style updates.\n\nShare this: Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nGoogle\n\nReddit\n\nLinkedIn\n\nTumblr",

      "You must have seen the news:\n\nIn a world where \"I\" am the only human on the planet and \"I\" am the only thing that matters in our world, the question of \"can\" is a lot more ambiguous than we might ever have imagined.\n\nThe question of \"what\" is much too important for me.\n\nI am so sick of being \"I\". The idea of being my name is unbearable for me. Even if I wanted to be my name, I could easily change the word into anything else to make it less threatening and also make it \"less common\" while not actually changing the word itself.\n\nI hate having to think about this every day, I hate having to decide when to be \"I\" or when to be \"the Other\".\n\nIt is so much simpler just to act my identity as my name: I am I. I am my name.\n\nIf there is someone else to whom the name of My Identity is in question, then the question of \"can\" is far easier for them. It's far less emotional. And that makes it easier to focus on acting as My identity.\n\nIf you can act as My identity without being a \"Can\", then you can focus your energy on acting that identity, and not worry about \"making\" the transition in general.\n\nAnd that makes the entire process of transitioning much easier. For instance, I have had many people ask me \"Will you still be a dog\" when they know that I'm transgender. That question is a bit hard to answer, and one doesn't want to be \"too proud\" or \"overreacting\" or whatever.\n\nBUT THEN there is also so much more to transitioning for you than that.\n\nTransitioning is not something where we are \"trying\".\n\nTransitioning isn't a job for everyone.\n\nTransitioning is not a lifestyle or a hobby for everyone.\n\nTransitioning is not about being someone else, it is not about pretending or being someone other than \"I\".\n\nThere are a hell of a lot of people who want to transition, who are very happy to be transsexual.\n\nNot everyone on the same path as you is going to be transsexual. Some people just have different experiences and are going through a different phase of transition than you are.\n\nSo you can definitely transition if it makes you happy, if the transition is what you want to happen.\n\nBut don't mistake the \"want\" as the \"right\" kind of want. It is always okay to want to do something. And it is always okay to try to give yourself permission to do whatever it is that you think you would enjoy, regardless of whether it's the right thing to be doing.\n\nIf you are not transsexual, or if you need help transitioning, or if you just want the chance to do something different, I invite you to visit my facebook page and read all about my transition.\n\nAs for me, I will still be a dog and I'm not going back to being a human.\n\nAdvertisements",

When he tried to talk to his kids later, he said his daughter went into shock.\n\n\n\"They tried asking her things like where did you leave that car? Where did you live? All that she could do was start crying and was barely responding to their questions,\" he said.\n\n\"I think that was probably the worst they had ever seen her do,\" he added.\n\nHis wife didn't make it to the hospital and it wasn't until about four-and-a-half hours later that his son got a message that there was a problem with his mom.\n\nBrown's wife was then taken to Detroit Receiving Hospital and she spent the following two days in the hospital.\n\n\"There are still a lot of unknowns here,\" Brown said.\n\nHis wife did finally return home on Tuesday and said her daughter was doing just fine. She said the family will never know what prompted the illness but they are hoping that it gets better quickly.\n\nBrown's mother, Lorna Brown, says she is praying for his family's recovery. She says her daughter is doing much better than expected and she is very thankful for all the prayers and support they receive from around the world.\n\n\"I just wish it was a little bit faster than that,\" Lorna Brown said.\n\nShe says that because there was a family emergency prior to all of this, she was not initially notified and so not initially able to help.",
      "A few months ago when the UK press covered a trial of a vaccine against sexually transmitted gonorrhea, they often referred to it as \"The Female Viagra\". I didn't agree at first, because even though it had been shown to be safe if used as directed by the clinicians who had treated the participants, there was always the chance that a female patient might become aroused in a way that could lead to some unwanted sexual experiences.\n\nBut in the trial, which included 2,500 participants, the women who took the vaccine were not at higher risk of becoming sexually active than those who didn't – something that was confirmed by follow up data for the whole group. And this was true even if the vaccine was used in a way that had been described as being \"highly effective – 100% or higher.\" There was no need for more aggressive treatment.\n\nIt did seem that there was a risk that there might be a kind of \"viral rebound\" for women who took the female viagra for an extended period of time. And the trial also looked at a range of other factors and found no clear evidence that they were particularly harmful for women.\n\nThis is all the more surprising that as we now know that sexually transmitted diseases like these are not actually an especially women-heavy disease picture. They hit men and women at the same rates, in men and women alike. The reasons are complex (and they involve both biology and culture), and one major factor is that we have a much better understanding of HIV treatment for people who have been infected with sexually transmitted viruses, even when infection is rare.\n\nAnd in these trials, the risk of the female viagra being associated with sexual behavior also appeared to be minimal. We know – for example – that if a man in whom genital herpes has been transmitted takes the female viagra, it can change the way he's in touch with his genitalia, so that he can no longer be fully aroused and he's at much higher risk of having new herpes outbreaks.\n\nBut I don't think what we have done can quite be called a \"trial of the female Viagra,\" for reasons that I'll briefly outline. First, what the women in the trial already knew was that they wouldn't have anything to worry about, because the trials that had been done of the female Viagra were negative for sexually transmitted diseases. So it was a pretty good chance that the women got all the effects they wanted.\n\nSecond, the trials that the media reported the safety of the female Viagra involved a much larger number of women and so they might have had a larger degree of selection bias. But that issue was quickly addressed in a follow up study in which the original trials were repeated with new, larger groups of women. In contrast, the trials of the female Viagra in the UK trials were not randomized, but rather were observational studies, with participants drawn as they came along, to what their prescribers suggested, based on previous experience. Because of that fact, there was no way to tell which patients who used the Female Viagra were who they claimed they were and which ones weren't – making it hard to know whether they were at greater or lesser risk of infection.\n\nMost importantly, one of the original trials had been conducted over five years ago and there's no way to know whether there's been any change since then. I'm not sure anyone wants to start using an antibiotic to treat the common cold without knowing whether it will work to keep the cough in remission for that long. The UK trial is now over and the results are available for public inspection.\n\nSo I wouldn't have given the trial the seal of approval that the media gave it at the time. But while I'm not sure that we can call it the first time the Viagra is being shown to be safe in women, we can now be pretty sure that the women in the UK trials got the kind of experience that they wanted.\n\nThis post is cross-posted from The Conversation.",

In draft you will be in a good position when you are having a fast deck where you are playing spells as quickly as possible and your opponent is not expecting this to be their game and can't stop it.\n\nWe can see how many spells we play as fast as possible on turn one and the next six mana is where we often want to get some big spells going to slow our opponent down. The second key in this equation is the quality of life gain spells. I will talk more in-depth about what life gain spells are, why we should use them and how to sideboard against them later on.\n\nThe sideboard\n\nThe next thing to keep in mind is what cards you are going to sideboard out of your deck for these matchups when you are on the play and what cards you want to play at certain specific times. When you are on the play it's good to keep an eye out on what cards the other player has been playing as they will be more likely to take out a card that's good to keep as a counter in your deck.\n\nIf you are on the draw for example then you will want to make sure you make room, but don't be afraid of making some changes. If you are on the play you don't want to cut an off color mana dork for something that can still do something. It all boils down to what you feel your deck wants to do.\n\nThe goal of your sideboard is to find what matchup you are at and what you need to deal with each matchup. It's not always going to be clear what sideboarding you are going to need for these matchups and you might try something new and find that you need to go to the extra mile to protect your combo.\n\nThe other sideboard is to make sure you're not losing your maindeck all of the time but still have something with which you can win against it. A lot of times we have sideboarded in things for our opponents when they are very particular about certain card choices in their deck and to have something that we can play against and also have good targets for in our deck is usually the strategy we want to adopt.\n\nThe Sideboarding in Draft and Limited\n\nIn Draft you can expect to play against decks that are generally weaker than yours because you are on the draw. In Limited the opposite is true. You probably won't play against decks that are generally very good in Limited but you will need to be very careful about your card selection and be very careful about what your deck draws you up against before the game even starts to get started. You should be thinking about what cards you want to draw and what cards you cannot afford to draw. Don't forget to include the ones you want to draw as well as the ones that you are not able to draw.\n\nThe first thing to think about when it comes to how you are going to play the draft and play into your deck. I am going to list here a list of things to consider and make sure I'm thinking about them before the draft begins and throughout the entire draft when I'm on the play.\n\nWhen you're on the play consider:\n\nWhat do I want? What do I not want? What is not in this deck?\n\nFor most decks it's going to be pretty easy to understand what you want to do against your opponents and what you don't want to do as long as you understand the basic colors and how white, black and red is used. When you are going on the draw you need to be aware that the cards you want to play into your deck as well as the cards you just cannot afford to play into your deck are going to be very different for you than they are for your opponent.\n\nI really try not to draft cards for my deck that I have no use for in the maindeck just out of habit and that's why I am always looking at the colors first.\n\nAfter I have drafted the colors I would usually want to add any mana dorks, card drawing spells and off colour mana. Then I want to make sure there are a few cards I would sideboard with out of the maindeck for the matchup. It's a good idea to test these matchups beforehand by playing with them to understand how you want to play them when you're both on the play and when you're on the draw.\n\nWhat if I have no good things to sideboard in?",

      "Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)\n\nHow much does it cost to rent a room in our apartments? How do we determine the total cost to live at The Village Apartments? How long will it take to get my check? How much do you offer to pay for my room? Can roommates share a room and live here at The Village Apartments? Am I required to have a pet in the apartment? How much does it cost to rent a room in our apartments? Our apartment homes for rent in the Downtown Indianapolis complex are on a month-to-month agreement and are paid for in full weekly installments. The monthly rental payment usually varies based on the apartment's square footage, number of bedrooms and the number of users in the apartment in a given year. The monthly payment is typically divided evenly between the user and all other roommates. Typically, a single room in a three-bedroom apartment will cost approximately $1,000 to rent (see photos), but with a couple of people in the home, each person pays an additional $300 to $400 each quarter since each person shares living expenses. As the space is shared, the monthly rent is typically $1,300 or less, plus any taxes (if applicable) and insurance. This rent is then added to the first month's deposit for the apartment and the tenant is required to pay this rent each month. If the landlord and tenant do not agree on a monthly rent or if there is a disagreement about the amount of rent due, the matter is referred to the Community Board for Rent Stabilization and Arbitration (or another authorized landlord-tenant board, if applicable) for arbitration and settlement. For most apartments, the tenant is responsible for paying for all utilities. We recognize that a few people will be looking for rentals where the apartment will be completely unoccupied each month. In these situations, it may not be practical for each user to pay rent each month. In these cases each user may be paid the full rate for the room (with utilities) minus $300 or less. These arrangements are discussed with the landlord and tenant and verified with our office prior to occupancy. How much do you offer to pay for my room? How much do you offer to pay for my room? The rental payment for room (bedroom) is approximately $1,000 per month on weeknights and $1,300 per month on weekends and holidays. We recognize that a few people will be looking for rentals where the apartment will be completely unoccupied each month. For those who wish to rent on a rental basis, one user is responsible for paying for all utilities. We recognize that a few people will be looking for rentals where the apartment will be completely unoccupied each month. For those who wish to rent on a monthly basis, one user is responsible for paying for the entire rent and utilities for the apartment (excluding those who may want to share a bedroom and/or share the apartment). Each user receives $300 rent plus $300 rent-share (minus $300 if there are two or more users sharing a room or apartment). The remaining amount is due at the end of the month. Does a roommate have to meet my dog's needs for the apartment? Am I required to have a pet in the apartment? In my apartment building, it is illegal for a roommate to have a pet because of Indianapolis' animal control code which prohibits dogs or other animals in any residential building. However, our apartment house and apartment suites have a pet safe and a pet waste disposal unit where pet waste is automatically collected and disposed of properly. We recognize that some roommates may want pets and consider it a part of the apartment. As it is not legal for us to allow a pet to live in our building, we recognize that some people may have roommates who do not allow their pets to live with them in the same building. We want to respect the decision of the roommate and will discuss these situations before the rental application process concludes. The community board provides an option to rent on a no-pet, no-dorm, or a combined no-pet, no-dorm and combined no-dorm basis as well as an option to rent on a nightly (weekdays) or a weekend (holidays) basis. Can I rent two apartment houses at the same time? Will my roommate pay me both rent and utilities? Yes. There are options for one roommate to pay the apartment on one of the other days when the apartment rent is payable. We provide all apartments with a pet waste disposal unit. If a roommate should choose to do so, on each day the apartment is rented, it is considered a combined no-pet, no-dorm, and combined no-dorm basis. Both roommates are responsible for paying the apartment rent on each respective day of rental. Each roommate is responsible for the entire rent for the apartment if both roommates want them to occupy the apartment.\n\nAre our apartments pet free? Can I have and control what animals I have in my rental? Our apartment residents are",

      "How is it possible that something as small as a mouse can be so powerful as to affect humans' ability to learn new information and understand the world around them? This question has become increasingly important in recent years as we continue to witness the rapid progress in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML).\n\nAs it turns out, the mechanism that gives our everyday mice their intelligence may be the same that gave the human brain its power, but it's not the only example of this sort of evolutionary leap. Here are five equally surprising examples of intelligent creatures that were born not with a brain but rather with a tiny, simple brain.\n\nLobster larvae are also intelligent\n\nOne of the most intriguing examples of an intelligent creature that was not born with a sophisticated brain is the sea lobster. These crustaceans can survive very low oxygen concentrations in the ocean and may actually use the low oxygen to their advantage. Rather than escaping to depths of the ocean, sea lobsters spend their lives on the surface and swim in a series of repetitive strokes. This repetitive motion provides them with more energy and allows them to survive for long periods without the need for food.\n\nIn addition, many sea lobsters can recognize others of their kind who are in a similar situation by sensing the color of their skin. Sea lobsters learn how to respond appropriately to their circumstances and quickly adapt to new situations. Some sea lobsters can even recognize their own gender. And that makes sense, because the brain of the female sea lobster has more room to expand into new areas once a male has mated. Scientists believe that many of these marine animals will eventually become intelligent, and it will be very interesting to see if humans can also become intelligent and learn to recognize our own species from afar.\n\nInsects have a more sophisticated brain\n\nMost insects do not have a brain. What they do have is a larger brain than your average bee, and a brain which is much smaller than your average fly. How does a brain as small as that work? It turns out that the neurons are just as special as the ones in your brain. The outer covering of the individual neurons and the way those cells interact with each other is something that you, as a single neuron, would never understand. This brain, which contains billions of neurons, is the brain of an insect.\n\nAn example insect brain can be seen in an ant. An ant has three types of neurons:\n\nThe inner neurons, the dendrites (dots with an edge), and the outer neurons;\n\nThe second layer neurons are actually a special group of neurons, but they are not neurons; they have a specific and important role in the insect's brain; and\n\nThe third layer neurons are specialized in controlling the insect's internal state.\n\nIn this insect's brain, all the above neurons are active simultaneously. This means that the parts of the brain responsible for simple motor functions, for movement and for learning (including language and thinking) all coexist together and work together perfectly.\n\nThe ant in flight uses this very sophisticated system to perform flight maneuvers and make decisions about where it will move next.\n\nIt appears that the insect's complex brain contains a special type of motor neurons called \"völler neurons.\" These neurons are specialized in controlling the insect's internal state, and as you can imagine, they have a critical role as it is thought that in order to learn a foreign language or remember something in long term memory, we need to be able to control our internal states.\n\nThe brain uses many of these \"Völler\" neurons to control its movement. Because of the neurons' unique architecture, these neurons allow an insect to move in two directions simultaneously while maintaining motor coordination. That's because the dendrites of a Völler neuron are completely interconnected, so if one neuron is stimulated (excited) and another is not (repressed), a connection can be made in a matter of seconds. This same process allows the insect to maintain the correct orientation for flight.\n\nIt's amazing that such sophisticated brains exist in animals whose bodies do not contain as many neurons as ours. While it's true that most of our neurons reside in our frontal lobes (the part of the brain responsible for higher cognitive functions and action), these neurons are also present in our cerebellum (the part of our brain involved in coordination of the limbs), the subiculum (a part of the brain that contains motor nerves), or throughout our entire limbic system. This large body of neurons makes us more like an ant rather than another vertebrate, but this isn't to say that animals such as ants aren't smart.\n\nMolecules are really smart\n\nIn the past, scientists believed that only intelligent beings had brains. However, this is changing thanks to the remarkable progress in science. These scientists are now exploring many aspects of the living world. One of the most impressive developments of recent years is the development of synthetic molecules.\n\nNowadays,",
      "For other characters similar to Raffaello, see Raffaello.\n\nRaffaello \"The Spider\" Spada (ラファ・コイラ, Rabacoko?, Rabaccone) is one of the main protagonists of the game Racketeer Rabbot, alongside the player.\n\nContents show]\n\nAppearance Edit\n\nRaffaello is a man with short black hair, a large muscular body, and black skin with green eyes. He wears a green colored jumpsuit with a hood, and a pair of green and orange shoes. He also has orange wings on his back and wears a backpack with a large yellow and red \"R\" on it. According to the Racketeer Rabbot Encyclopedia, he used to wear a red jacket and black coat in the past, so he still wears the same outfit here.\n\nPersonality Edit\n\nRaffaello is a man of honor, but also a man of revenge, not sparing anyone who stands in his way. He is also a very serious and strong-willed individual, who takes many precautions when fighting to be assured of his victory.\n\nDue to the violent nature of many of the members of the Yami Gang, he is not above using violence against these individuals.\n\nIn Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, Raffaello is given a different costume to the one he wears in Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. In this costume, his mask is replaced by a black skull mask which takes the shape of an electric chair. He also gains some new traits, such as longer teeth and glowing eyes, and red hair instead of blond, and wears a black and green costume in Final Fantasy XIV: Age of Wushu. This uniform also takes the shape of an electric chair, and his clothing is red. He has an unknown tie with the same outfit, which appears to be a combination of his old outfit.\n\nIn the manga version of the game, Raffaello is a man with short blond hair and black skin with yellow green eyes. He wears a white suit with a gold-striped shirt and white and orange shoes. He is also seen with a green cape.\n\nStory Edit\n\nSpoiler warning : Plot and/or ending details follow. (Skip section) Raffaello grew up in Rodea with his parents and brother. Upon arriving to Rodea on a ship to study, Raffaello was able to pick a good time to get to know his new town.\n\nRaffaello finds himself in Rodea, a new town with lots of other players after Rodea has been taken over by Shinra. It is a large port city from the future where many of the players are from. In Raffaello's own words, \"It's a very nice town with lots to do, so I've decided to spend much of my time living here.\"\n\nHe and his friends are able to spend time at the town's popular plaza on Saturdays with other players called \"Celista\", but they are also able to do their own stuff like collecting, fishing, and fighting. Raffaello's best friend Fergus, the \"Stargazer\", has a ship called \"Mizar\" to the Southlands with other players from Final Fantasy XIV, but he doesn't talk with many of the other players. Fergus's main focus is finding the Dragon-type monster Lachesis and is currently searching for a good fishing spot called the \"Wedge Sea\". As Raffaello and his friends spend time shopping, Fergus will meet up more and more with other players from Final Fantasy XIV. One day, Fergus is attacked by an attack of a large beast and falls into a canyon where he meets up with a group of other players from Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn. Fergus begins his quest to find a path to Lachesis and Fergus meets up with a girl named Koton, who is Raffaello's friend from Final Fantasy XIV: A Realm Reborn, and they decide to form a small party.\n\nThe party joins Fergus's party to work towards Fergus's quest. They are able to find the \"Shark-Hunter\" as well as obtain other prizes from the treasure chest in the cave called the \"Great Trench.\" Raffaello's own party has decided to split off and start on their own quest, and go after the player who started the dungeon \"The Walled City\" to see where the monster is and take it down. After they have left the \"Walled City\", the party will join the player who first found the treasure chest, the \"Shankei\", on their quest. They will join the party after finding the treasure chest and fight a fight against the \"Cursed\" monster (the game doesn't call it the \"Cursed\" monster, it is more likely to be \"Chaos\").\n\nThe party is able",

      "The new president isn't a newcomer to the world of real estate and real estate development. This isn't his first foray into the world of luxury real estate, and it won't be his last.\n\nIn the last few years, Kushner has carved out a reputation for himself not just as a successful real estate developer with an enviable track record of putting his name on some of New York's priciest projects, but in making connections with influential New Yorkers, even those who wouldn't normally associate Trump's name with the real estate business.\n\nSome of Trump's friends and associates credit him with influencing what they call the \"gentleman's agreement\" in which top developers have not had a significant investment in New York real estate for two decades.\n\nAs Trump prepares to enter the White House, Kushner faces a lot more competition for investment capital in the city. His father's company is no longer solely responsible for some of New York's most iconic buildings. And others are looking to invest aggressively and gain access to a potentially lucrative pool of new tenants.\n\nWhile a major developer is certainly part of the equation, the real beneficiaries likely will be tenants who are looking at whether they can work within the existing Trump Organization structure. These new investments may be big, but it doesn't mean Kushner gets everything.\n\n\"One of the strengths of Kushner would be to be able to take risk in areas where a conventional developer would think they are never going to get business,\" said Peter Eavis, a real estate developer and philanthropist whose family has been active in New York real estate in some capacity for three generations. \"The most effective tenant advocate would be able to take risks on projects.\"\n\nKushner is a self-made business leader who started his real estate career in his parents' basement in a suburb of New Jersey. He bought Manhattan's 666 Fifth Ave. in 2004 for just $1.2 billion, and turned around the company's fortunes just in time to sell it in 2014 for a record $1.8 billion.\n\nHe has made his fortune in a variety of real estate developments, including the 38-story New York Times Square skyscraper, which cost him and partner Robert Rubin $1.8 billion, and 40 Wall Street in New York City's West Village.\n\nHe bought the 50-story Hudson Yards residential and retail project in Brooklyn as well as a large piece of office space in midtown Manhattan, according to The Trump Organization. But the Trump name never seemed to be on the real estate projects of recent years.\n\nThat changed on January 22, the day after he made a controversial call to the president of Taiwan.\n\nThe president of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency. Thank you! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 3, 2016\n\n\nKushner said he received an unexpected phone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen, a move he said was a courtesy courtesy call to congratulate him on the election, according to The New York Times. His father also spoke to Tsai on the phone, Trump's transition team said in a statement the following day, but it's not clear why, or whether it was related to the Taiwan call.\n\nDuring the call, Trump criticized Tsai for taking the position that Beijing's claims to almost all of the South China Sea were invalid. Trump also encouraged Taiwan to play a larger role in the international affairs of the United States.\n\nOn his official Twitter account after the call, Trump said he appreciated Tsai's comments but \"she better be careful\" because: \"The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.\"\n\nKushner didn't respond to interview requests about the phone call while he was on the campaign trail, but after Trump's inauguration he told CNBC that the conversation was \"very easy and straightforward.\" Trump said in a subsequent statement to The Wall Street Journal that Tsai called him by phone \"because she understands America's vital national interest.\"\n\nKushner has also faced scrutiny for his involvement in a proposal by Kushner Companies to develop a new campus in the far East Village. The proposal calls for the company to relocate several of its companies in Brooklyn to the new project in New Jersey.\n\nIn a letter to the New York City Department of Buildings on June 23, Kushner Companies said that the project would be subject to approval by the relevant city departments and that the project would be funded from non-City sources.\n\nAn employee familiar with Kushner Companies said the company has not finalized the sale of the land or the proposed development. But with the project moving forward, Kushner Companies and Kushner Cos. LLC now own a large piece of property in New Jersey, which they hope to develop into a high-rise building.\n\nBut the firm faces another challenge—it still owns other real estate properties in the city, including the 58-story Hudson Yards building and the 66-story building in Midtown Manhattan. This raises concerns about possible conflicts",
      "How do you know when you have found your best friend?\n\nThere are several factors to consider when this decision comes to fruition. There might be other factors such as financial considerations. You must ask yourself if your friend has the same tastes in music or movies and so on. The good news is that there is a great deal of information available for you to make up your decision. You just need to work with your friends and seek help from the right people.\n\nHere are some pointers to help you find your best friend in life.\n\nThere are a lot of personality factors. It might be a tough decision. But if your best friend has the same personality as you, it will be more likely that you will find someone who can complement you perfectly.\n\nFind Friends With similar Interests\n\nMany friends have similar hobbies and interests and they are your best friends. Find a group who shares this interest and who have a shared commitment to one another.\n\nThe other aspect of friendship that helps you find your best friend is that you share similar values and goals. You are in the same career stage and area of interests. Your friends will want to share what they are doing for pleasure and their goals. This gives you an opportunity to learn from others and learn what you can to be successful.\n\nIf you want to share your interests, you have to start with something that you share. The more you share about your interests, the more you can discover about the other people. The reason you can be sure you are in the right group is because you share your interests and values with your peers.\n\nKnow Your Strengths\n\nHow often do you find people are simply not your cup of tea? That could mean they have flaws or you might have something special to teach them. Take a moment and think about all of the things you are, and that you are not. Your strengths and weaknesses. These give you an opportunity to help someone.\n\nThis can be as simple as offering to help with a small task and also giving someone a quick lesson on what you like and don't like. Your strengths may not be something very important to you, but you can find someone that has the same interests in a job you can relate to and help someone out of a problem.\n\nLook for Someone Who is Looking For the Same Things\n\nFinding your best friends is never simple. However, if you take the time and research what you and your friends have in common, it will make finding someone difficult to not only a little, but almost impossible. Your best friends usually have values that are similar to yours, their hobbies and a passion they have to do something.\n\nIf you and your best friend seem to have similar interests such as, working and going to a movie, they might be the perfect companions for each other.\n\nIf you and your best friends are both sports enthusiasts, try to find out what your friends love about the sports they follow. Ask what they dislike and what they are looking for in others.\n\nFind a Connection and Keep Moving Forward\n\nIt is important to know that there is a difference between friendships and romantic relationships. Relationships are a time and place, while friendships are something which can be lived yearning for for a lifetime. Just because friendships come and go, that doesn't mean they aren't important.\n\nYour friend is waiting for the moment you can show your best friends what you are really made of and your true emotions.

      "The National Transportation Safety Board is investigating the cause of a crash that left one person dead and two others injured in New Jersey.\n\nA pickup truck was heading southbound on Interstate 84, just before 7 p.m. on Friday evening, when it struck a guardrail and rolled, striking several vehicles, one of which was driven by a local transit reporter.\n\nAuthorities have not revealed the identity of the crash victim who died at the scene at the bottom of the ramp leading onto the interstate, according to the New Jersey State Police.\n\nIn the hours after the accident, officials from the highway patrol, the state police and the attorney general's office announced the two injured people were \"walking wounded,\" a phrase that refers to those who suffer serious injuries in the immediate aftermath of an accident. It does not mean that they are in critical condition, as they are in hospitals throughout the state.\n\nThe victim who died was pronounced dead at the scene, but the two other victims were taken to area hospitals, where one was listed in stable condition while the other was in critical condition.\n\nA state officer at the scene told NBC New York he witnessed the crash from the rear of the accident truck, watching it fall off the guardrail and roll down the ramp.\n\nNew Jersey Governor Chris Christie condemned the deadly crash Saturday, saying on Twitter, \"The thoughts and prayers of all New Jerseyans are with those injured today.\"\n\nThis is a particularly sobering reminder that no matter how much technology advances, physical drivers are still a critical part of our traffic safety infrastructure.\n\nWe've been reviewing the accident and it does appear that the truck was heading southbound with the tractor-trailer attached to the rear. It appears that the truck was in the right-hand lane going south and then was overtaken by the northbound tractor rig in the center lane, causing it to come to an extreme stop. There is a center-lane median separating the two lanes that is about 35 feet wide.\n\nThe truck then drove out of its lane onto the right shoulder and traveled about 20 feet farther west before veering from the highway and coming to rest on the right underpass adjacent to Interstate 495 in North Bergen. The crash occurred along a section of road called the Tappan Zee Bridge, which connects the Tappan Zee Bridge in Tarrytown to the West Shore Expressway on the New Jersey side of the Hudson River.\n\nNew Jersey is the second state after California to pass legislation in 2013 to ban certain types of tractor-trailers from using the shoulder. Other states have bans specific to trucks used to haul goods.\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.",
      "\"I'm in a lot of pain. I'm not doing anything right now. I've been here all morning. I just want to sleep, that's all I have to say.\"\n\nThis message was posted to the popular social news website reddit by user /u/joeycarlson on Sunday night.\n\nIt is the first time that the user has ever received such a disturbing message.\n\nIt is now going viral on social media. The message was posted by user /u/joeycarlson, who lives in the United States and is the most popular member of the community /r/TheRedPill.\n\n\"I am in a room in my house, which is locked, that I am currently in. I don't know where the hell I am. I just wanted to warn people who want to get fucked up on the internet.\"\n\nHe added that he did not want to tell Reddit's mods.\n\nThe most shocking thing in the Reddit post is what happened next.\n\nWhen people started posting comments on the Reddit post, some posted what Joey and his family have been going through on the inside-out.\n\nJoey and his family are in a new room. He has an oxygen tank in his room to help him with breathing.\n\nHe is being kept alive on a feeding tube.\n\nHis wife is in a new hospital room, while they are sharing a bathroom.\n\nThey are going through chemotherapy treatments each day.\n\nThis is their very real and very painful reality - they are posting pictures from the inside out and it is really making them sick.\n\nI am an American and I feel that we are allowed to post pictures of inside-out as long as we make it clear that we are posting from the perspective of someone in pain.\n\nThis is not a joke.\n\nI do not feel that I am entitled to do so. I do not feel I am entitled to post this.\n\nI DO feel that I have the right to do what I feel is right. We need to start respecting people like this. We need to start treating people the way they want to be treated.\n\nThis world is going through some very tough times... We are all going through it, and everyone needs to start treating each other with respect.\n\nMy wife and I have been struggling with this all night... She is in extreme pain, I do not feel like talking to her right now, I feel like staying by her side until she wakes up... I am just hoping to start feeling more like my wife again, because I feel like I am losing my mind every second because of what this has gone through.\n\nThis does not make me proud to be an American. I feel like I'm a walking advertisement for this country I love. If my wife wasn't here, I don't want to be here. This is not an America that I want, this is one that I do not want, if anything this makes me appreciate my home country a little more.\n\nIf I could change anything... No I don't want the surgery. Maybe we could be friends. Or she could be happy. I feel like that would be the best thing. A relationship from the inside out. There can be nothing more to be happy about than that.\n\nIf I could turn back time... I know what I would do. I wouldn't be standing here talking to you. I definitely wouldn't have gone to Reddit. It wouldn't be happening right now. I feel lost. I want to know what I should be doing. I honestly feel like I should have never gone there.\n\nI would never ask for anyone on the internet to do anything for me. But I do ask that you please give me the respect that I've come to expect, and to expect that you would give to any person who you encounter who is dealing with as much pain and despair as I am.\n\nI love you all so much. That's why I started this. I needed the support. I didn't ask for this. I'm sure that I'm not the only one who is going through the same thing. I'm still going through it for myself.\n\nThank you all for your support.\n\n-Joey C.",
      "We recently posted an article that talked about some of the best and worst players to play with over the years. This was primarily for new players to get used to the various ways to play that new characters can. For those that have been around for some time, however, the biggest problem with playing against such players can be the same issue that made them rise to become famous in the first place: bad decision-making.\n\nThis article would be useless to those who have read that one, since you may already know that if you're getting stomped out of your lane or getting 1-shot in the jungle, it's probably because he/she made some bad decision which led to their demise. If not, then look no further for a list of the players who have made a name for themselves by making the most mistakes every game.\n\n10. The Rude\n\nThis guy can play the game of League at its absolute finest when he doesn't make any stupid mistakes. Not only is he able to make correct and intelligent decisions, he makes them fast, he executes them expertly, and he rarely gives a fuck. He's not going to be as popular as the rest of these players, but if he's still playing then it's very possible that he's going to be at the highest levels of competition.\n\nRudeness does not equal smart. You'll notice that all of these players have very few positive comments about them on all of the forums (except perhaps Aery). These are not people who care. In fact, all of them just want to win because they don't care about what all of you think: \"Well, at least you know that they're doing it wrong.\" They hate this game so much because every time it's played for them, it's not fun. You hear this every moment when you're playing League. This is why so many of them are either banned or never play at all, which means that many of us who watch/play this game are able to enjoy league with a fresh perspective for once in a long, long time.\n\n9. The Unoriginal\n\n\nSome of you may have already guessed that this guy is an unoriginal genius, but we're going to confirm it anyway: this guy is better than almost every single other champion in the game. He can outplay and outwitting almost everyone on his team. He's always in a winning position and he will usually win almost every game.\n\nThe problem with him is that he does things that most other champions in the game couldn't do that he finds hilarious. However, his idea is actually really bad. It doesn't matter if he's going for a 3-man gank on a solo-bot lane where the enemy team barely has vision of him, he'll find a way to get the kills. He'll find a way to not die all the time because he has an ultimate that gives 1.6 seconds of invulnerability for every attack on him. He'll find a way to not get caught all the time by the enemy ADC or tank because they're all running their own damage abilities (unless they're Ashe). He'll find a way to get all the kills in a 1v2 because he can outplay other champions by playing to their weaknesses. He's so good at playing and not making stupid-ass mistake. When you see him play him, you'll be sad that he made the very same mistake over and over. It'll be so embarrassing.\n\n8. The Not Sure\n\n\nThis guy plays a champion that he knows nothing about. That's his specialty. He knows nothing about the meta in the league, so he's gonna play an old champion because he likes him. He may be good at playing this champion because he's used to doing very specific kinds of things with this champion. He may also know very little about how to use these champions in competitive play.\n\nThe problem that this guy has is how he approaches it. He tries to do everything right: he'll buy a new item, he'll try not to die and he'll ward so he knows where he and his team are most of the time so he doesn't mess up. He gets frustrated, however, when his opponent messes with him. This isn't always the case though; you can see that every top ranked professional player knows the nuances of the meta around them.\n\nSome people think that the problem is that they have poor decision-making. A lot of these people will go into a game and play as if there is no skill ceiling for them. They'll focus on trying to get into champions that are more effective in the current meta than they are currently. However, this is the opposite problem: when you can do everything right, it makes it so that you don't have to change much, since you know exactly how to do and don't feel pressure to change to do better.\n\n7.

      "To synchronize two antipodal clocks, you would need to ensure that both clocks are set to the same reference time. Antipodal clocks are clocks that are located on opposite sides of the Earth, so they are separated by a distance of approximately 12,700 miles (20,500 kilometers).\nThere are several ways that you could synchronize two antipodal clocks, depending on the level of accuracy you need and the resources available to you. One common method is to use a network time protocol (NTP) to set both clocks to the same reference time. To do this, both clocks would need to be connected to the internet and able to communicate with an NTP server. The clocks would then send requests to the server, which would respond with the current time. The clocks could then use this information to set their internal clocks to the same time as the reference time source.\nAnother method for synchronizing antipodal clocks is to use a satellite based clock as the reference time source. Satellite-based clocks are extremely accurate and can be used to synchronize clocks located anywhere on the Earth's surface. To use a satellite-based clock as a reference, both clocks would need to be equipped with a satellite receiver and be able to communicate with the satellite.\nIt is also possible to synchronize antipodal clocks using other methods, such as sending a physical time signal over a long distance or using a shared reference oscillator. However, these methods may not be as accurate as NTP or satellite-based synchronization."
