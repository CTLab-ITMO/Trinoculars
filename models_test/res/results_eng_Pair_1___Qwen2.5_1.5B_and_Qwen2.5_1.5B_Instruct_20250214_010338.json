      "\nThe 2008 global financial crisis was a major financial event that began with the collapse of the U.S. subprime mortgage market in 2007. The crisis quickly spread throughout the world as banks and other financial institutions defaulted on enormous amounts of debt, leading to plummeting stock markets and a global recession. This recession was the worst since the Great Depression and affected businesses and individuals around the world. Governments and central banks took action to try to contain the crisis, including bailouts of banks, reductions in interest rates, and asset purchasing programs. Despite these measures, the crisis continued to ravage economies until the beginning of 2009.",

      "HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Pennsylvania has just lost one of its great museums. The Smithsonian recently announced that Penn State University's Amherst Art Center will soon be closed for two years, and will be replaced by an 18-story dorm on the grounds.\n\nThe move is intended to make way for a new mixed-use development. The school's current building, erected in 1929, is slated for demolition. The museum's current collection — which includes the famed Monet — will go with it.\n\nAn exhibition featuring the work of 19th-century Swiss artist Gustav Klimt was scheduled to open Sept. 17, but is being indefinitely postponed.\n\nMany Penn State alumni are critical of the decision, citing the potential impact of the museum loss on the state's reputation.\n\n\"This is a massive loss to the university in terms of our reputation, our image as a national leader in higher education, and the sense of community that has been developed on campus,\" said Penn State University President Eric Barron.

      "Possible Solutions to the RSI Problem\n\n(in order of appearance to be included as solutions)\n\n[1.10] The above is only one possible solution to the problem.\n\n[1.11] To clarify, even for one of these possible solutions, there may be other similar solutions. For instance, the problem cannot be solved by simply setting the speed of a space probe to a point. We would need to ensure the probe has some method of communicating with the \"brain\" of the probe when it moves to some new location.\n\nFor this reason the number of possible solutions is also infinite. (In particular, it cannot be known with any certainty how many possible solutions exist, or how many of these are similar to the solutions shown above.) The number of infinite possible solutions for the problem of RSI is:\n\n[1.11] (Infinite.)\n\n[1.12] However, there are actually infinitely many solutions to the problem. The size of the infinite set is:\n\n[1.13] (Infinite)\n\n[1.14] (Infinite)\n\n[1.15] (Infinite)\n\n[1.16] (Infinite)\n\n[1.17] However, there are actually some known solutions to the problem.\n\n[1.17] For the purpose of the present article, the known solutions must be treated as a subcollection of the possible solutions.\n\n[1.18] The possible solutions, as an infinite number of sets, cannot be treated separately as sets for solving the problem, nor for any other purposes.\n\n[1.19] Therefore, even for one of the possible solutions to the problem of RSI, it is impossible to give a valid algorithm. To see why, we must discuss at length \"one simple algorithm\".\n\n\"One Simple Algorithm\"\n\n[1.20] The purpose of this section is to provide a list of algorithms for solving the problem of RSI for a given set of possible solutions. The set of possible solutions can be given as a single vector, or as an arbitrary collection of vectors. We will only present solutions within a specified range of all possible solutions.\n\n[1.21] For each possible solution a set of possible algorithms appears, which can be used to solve the problem. These \"one simple algorithms\" are:\n\n(1) Let each element of the set A be its own \"ruler\". Then, one of the following forms must be applied to the elements of A :\n\n(2a) Each element of A must have a constant speed proportional to its element's distance from the origin.\n\n(2b) Every element of A must have a constant speed proportional to its element's distance from the origin and its element's normal direction, to the right, or to the left.\n\n(3) Let P appear in the set of \"all solutions\". If the speed of the probe is at a certain distance from the origin, then the corresponding element of A must equal P. If the speed of the probe is at a certain distance from the origin and all directions of its normal direction are the same, then each element of A must equal P.\n\nHowever, a more general set of possible solutions to the problem exists. It is known that an integer n, where n is a positive integer, and a given set A, is a sub-set of A. The sub-set of A is denoted by S n for some constant C, and C is known to have a definite size. Let us assume A has a size of 2n, and that C 0=20 and C 1=10. Then the known sets A and S n have size n=2n/C 0 and size n=2n/C 1 respectively. These two known sets have the same values for every element of A and S n , where each one has the same size. Furthermore, these two sets of sizes are equal because they have the same size C in all coordinates and are in a unit square.\n\n[1.22] Thus, there exists a set of all possible solutions which will cover exactly the entire range of possible solutions for a given set A, provided that C 0 is given for all the elements of A. Furthermore, there exist known solutions to this sub-set of A which are solutions to any known problem, given any speed vector n=2n/C 0 and n=2n/C 1 .\n\n[1.23] To see this, we examine, for all n =2n/C 0 and n =2n/C 1 , the range of all possible solutions of the problem for all known speeds. For example, one can find a solution for C n =2n/C 0 in the interval [0,1]. Likewise, one can find a solution for C n =2n/C 1 in the interval [0,",
      "There have been more than a few rumblings about the possibility that the next Marvel Studios film could take place in the X-Men's pre-New Mutants era. The X-Men universe has been rebooted numerous times since 2000 and although Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart and James McAvoy have appeared in some form or another (I kid, I kid), there hasn't been a truly new film since 2012's X-Men: Days of Future Past.\n\nHowever, just last month it was revealed that the next X-Men film would see the X-Men team up with a more modern group of foes. With Deadpool and Logan starring in the franchise, it seems likely that the X-Men will be around for the foreseeable future. However, just a couple days ago, a new report from Latino Review suggested that the next film would be set on the Marvel's newest cinematic universe universe, and that a version of the original team up was in the works.\n\nDeadpool star Ryan Reynolds confirmed that the studio had reached out to him, adding that the X-Men: Apocalypse movie, which is set to hit theaters this May, was actually the first opportunity he got to sign on for a project that was not X-Men. However, Reynolds indicated that, although it seemed like this was a natural fit, the film was not ready yet.\n\n\"So far we've gotten the opportunity to sign onto things after they're announced, and they are all based, as far as I know, on Marvel properties that I love. So I think we're going to see a lot more,\" he told EW. \"But, yeah, X-Men: Apocalypse seems to be the first one that comes up. I can't tell you anything about this project. This is the last project that gets announced, and I'm not allowed to talk about it.\"\n\nIt's hard to know where the rumor goes from there, but, again, I'd imagine it's probably more along the lines of the sequel movie being a standalone. While most of those X-Men movies have been incredibly popular in their own right, there's never really been a shared universe. While a \"Mutant X-Men\" movie would make all of The Wolverine sound quite reasonable, there is more to the Marvel universe than just X-Men. Besides, with Deadpool and Logan still out there (and probably to be released before Deadpool 2), it seems unlikely that Fox would want to give up on the X-Men films.\n\nThis is all a bit vague, and the rumor mill does a pretty good job of filling in the missing details, but I'd assume that Deadpool 2 would still be set in the contemporary Marvel universe. While some fans have wondered for a while whether Deadpool 2 would be connected to the X-Men series and, with Fox's new shared universe plans, this is a big answer. Although Deadpool 2 was not a huge hit for the studio, it did make a decent amount of money, so I would expect even more Marvel characters to appear in Fox's films moving forward.\n\nWhile it seems that the original X-Men movies may have a few years left in their run, it seems more likely that the X-movies of the future are going to have more of a shared universe approach. Deadpool has become a cultural phenomenon in the last couple years, and he continues to make a sizable amount of money. Fox seems to be interested in moving forward with the sequel, and maybe they're even thinking about developing it into a new franchise for their cinematic universe.\n\nIf that's the case, they should probably start planning a whole new X-Men movie franchise — because it seems like it's going to be the next decade.",

      "There are two types of self-interest. Self-interest with a capital S and self-interest without a capital S. The former is easy to recognize. It is the pursuit of profit, whatever the cost, and to the extent that it can be found in one's own economic interest as opposed to simply seeking profits that can then be used to improve or make larger profits for other people, that is good. The latter is almost impossible to recognize as it usually refers to behavior like that of a parasite or parasite, where the only interest in existence is not self-interest but serving one's master in whatever way it can. The latter is often referred to as \"self-serving\", \"self-interest\", or \"selfish\", whereas the former is \"self-preservation\" and often refers to behavior that would be considered \"evil\" by those who would prefer that all others make altruistic choices that do not take away from the \"self\". This, however, should not be construed as an attempt to justify self-interest on the basis of morality, or to equate it with the \"good\" moral behavior for which people are responsible.",

      "As the U.S. Department of Labor's Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) continues to investigate the injuries that killed or injured more than 300 Americans at a Walmart in Bentonville, Arkansas, there have been increasing calls from the media and activists for Walmart to be held accountable for its actions.\n\nLast week, for example, the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas called on Wal-Mart, the state's largest private employer, to be investigated for \"its failure to keep its stores safe for its workers and its failure to adequately warn employees about the dangers of working in its stores.\" The group suggested that this failure had contributed to the death of five people who died in the accident and more than 160 workers injured on the job.\n\nThe Arkansas Democrat Gazette also published a story last Thursday calling on Walmart to \"take immediate action\" to prevent this kind of tragedy from happening again. The paper cited both the Walmart worker's suit filed against Wal-Mart by the workers' union and the company's response to OSHA's investigation:\n\n\"We are continuing on our efforts to assist the families and help ensure a safety-minded culture at Walmart. The safety of our associates and our associates' families is a top priority and the company will continue to keep safety a focus of our efforts.\"\n\nThe Daily Kos also commented on this issue last week:\n\n\"This isn't the first fatality for [Walmart]. In February, when eight Walmart workers were killed in a gas station explosion, Walmart did not suspend work for the day. Three months earlier…A Walmart employee was killed in a Walmart-owned factory in Guatemala. In June of this same year [2008], an employee was fired for a gun accident at Walmart.\"\n\nIn response, Wal-Mart's Vice President of Global Communications, David Tovar, issued a statement last Friday in response to these two reports saying:\n\nWalmart has taken important steps over the past several months to improve training, safety and management practices across its supply chain. A new policy is in place for the entire production team of one of our major Walmart stores in the United States, and these are the steps for all of Walmart's stores that use our supply chain on an ongoing basis: We have added two additional safety managers and a trainer. The new safety management team trained 400 managers and associates over the past summer. We have increased our training of our associates and are also currently conducting a comprehensive review of safety processes and procedures across our entire U.S. supply chain.\n\nIn addition to these actions, Walmart has taken several steps over the past several years to help protect Walmart employees… We are continuing our efforts to make store and supplier training a priority and are developing a comprehensive plan that is targeted at every store to develop best practices for employee safety and healthy working conditions.\n\nThese reports echo the claims that activists have made for quite some time: that there are significant safety risks that go beyond those we have already discussed, that Walmart is ignoring public health hazards, and that it is not doing enough to protect Americans' public safety.\n\nWhile the media continues to focus on the deaths as a key issue, it has been more than two years since the first worker was killed at a Walmart store. The current case, which is ongoing, raises several issues that are important to discuss — and some in the media have taken up this cause.\n\nWhat are the problems with OSHA's investigation into the Bentonville accident?\n\nOSHA has investigated Walmart for nearly two decades, but only this month has it announced its conclusions. And while the findings of this investigation are likely to trigger further questions and criticisms, OSHA's focus was primarily on the company's failure to provide safe working conditions or respond quickly to potential safety hazards, rather than on the dangers in and around Walmart itself.\n\nWhile some of the problems have already been highlighted by advocates over time, there are still several issues we need to discuss.\n\nFirst, as noted by Mother Jones and others, a key problem with OSHA's investigation is that it relied not just on testimony from Walmart, but also on the workers' testimony, and didn't ask for evidence to challenge that testimony, which may not have been entirely accurate.\n\nIn its investigation, OSHA cited a number of Walmart workers, including:\n\n\"[A]n employee who, during the accident, heard the loud sound of a conveyor belt clanging through the warehouse walls.\"\n\n\"[A]n employee who, prior to the accident, had smelled gas in the warehouse building.\"\n\n\"[T]he employee who was in the bathroom area when an ammonia odor came from the ceiling tiles.\"\n\n\"[A]n employee who saw a gas can in front of the storage area and who heard noises from the can.\"\n\n\"[E]xperts from the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health determined that several employees, including a supervisor and manager, did not understand or do their jobs properly.\"\n\nOf most",
      "\"This is a big deal to the company, and it's just part of this growth,\" said Scott Miller, the senior vice president of global brand marketing at Disney.\n\nMr. Miller added that some new restaurants — including the flagship, a 5,700-square-foot cafe on the eighth floor — would have more of an \"elevators and escalators feel\" that would emphasize the importance of \"personal service and attention.\"\n\nIn the future, Disney plans to expand the number of its locations to more than 100. That compares with about 30 restaurants at the most recent count, which were in the San Francisco Bay Area. At the current pace, it would take 60 years for the company to expand to 100 such restaurants in the U.S., Mr. Miller said. Disney could be on its way to becoming the largest restaurant company in the world. It owns, for example, 714 restaurants in Japan.\n\nDisney's strategy is to offer a few places in each \"destination,\" or city that is its corporate headquarters. Among those are the three \"international\" locations, in New York, Tokyo and Shanghai; the company is also pursuing a plan to bring the restaurants into the Bay Area's Central Valley.\n\nBy expanding its overseas presence, Disney hopes to increase its influence in the fast-growing Chinese tourism industry in which it is a dominant tourist destination.\n\n\"China could well be the first billion-dollar market for the company in the next few years. What we're doing there, really, is a form of cultural diplomacy, \"said David Sacks, the chief executive of the hospitality company Darden Restaurants, who said last fall he expected more chain restaurants to open in the U.S. in the next few years.\n\nDisney wants to be part of the change — which could mean making many of the new restaurants feel more like global brands. That makes sense for the company's businesses, both of which may benefit: Disney's parks and resorts generate about $11 billion in annual operating income for the company. The hotels, which sell rooms and suites, are one of its strongest profit centers.\n\nTo achieve that, \"you want to look like a global hotel company,\" said Robert A. Dickey, a restaurant consultant and author.\n\nIn New York, with a population of 17.1 million, there were only 5,721 Disney restaurants in 2001. By 2009, the number nearly tripled to 34,912.\n\nDisney hopes to keep growing. At the Paris location, the company is preparing to add a wine bar this year.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nThat does not mean that Disney is closing down any of its traditional locations in America.\n\nThe company is currently building two new Disney-branded restaurants — called Mickey and Minnie's Dockside Diner and Mickey's Cafe — in downtown Detroit and is renovating a long-closed location at Disney Springs in Kissimmee that is to be called Mickey's Cantina.\n\nPhoto\n\nIn Seattle, Disney is renovating its former location, the Dumbo Diner, which has a history dating to the 1920s.\n\nDisney has not found new places to open in any of these cities. But the company says it will continue to evaluate the markets and may consider reopening a location in London, which was considered as one of the locations for the opening of Disney World in Florida in 2011.\n\nAt the Paris eatery, the Disney logo that sits on the table in many Disney restaurants, or in the window of every Disney Store, is not being replaced. Instead, the company is replacing its traditional menu of hamburgers, fries and chicken with a new restaurant theme reminiscent of \"Star Wars,\" \"Disneyworld\" and \"Star Trek.\"\n\n\"This is in service of reinventing its entire brand, and I think they've just done such a great job of not only changing the style of the restaurant but also the name,\" said Mr. Miller, who noted that Disney has done similar moves with other stores.\n\nInside, a menu inspired by that of a traditional French bakery will be on everything. And the restaurant will offer drinks made with local produce. That said, the name itself is still \"Mickey Mouse's\" signature drink — a strawberry-and-orange concoction — but the new look will likely be familiar to anyone who has visited a theme park.\n\nThe new Paris eatery is the first of four Disney-themed restaurants to open in the United States this year — at Animal Kingdom in Florida, Disney World in Florida and the Magic Kingdom in Florida.\n\nAdvertisement Continue reading the main story\n\nDisney also expects to launch two new restaurants in Germany this year, one in Chicago and the other in Las Vegas.\n\nThe next target for expansions is China. \"This is something we're seriously considering,\" Mr. Sacks said.\n\nA Disney spokeswoman declined to disclose the company's China plans.

      "There were no comments Wednesday on Mayor Rob Ford's suggestion that some of his staff can't handle being around other people.\n\nBut even at the end of a heated council session, the mayor continued to offer provocative comments to the press.\n\n\"We have some very good staff out there. The first thing I say to them when I greet them is, you have to come to the city, they've got to come to the city,\" he said. \"Then one of them said I've got to go over to my friend, John Tory, who has to come to my council meetings in this city.\n\n\"If you don't want to come down to the city, if you want to come down to John Tory's house, you know what I'm saying? You have to leave.\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nA number of councilors turned in their chairs to face the cameras; several were wearing black shirts printed with \"I'm With You.\" A number of councillors, including most on the left wing of Ford's conservative, anti-politics caucus, sat in their chairs, apparently uncomfortable with Ford's remarks. Ford left the floor to return to the mayor's office before the end of the session, seemingly trying to avoid a confrontation with his staff. The remarks continued in a scrum of media after the session. \"Some of them are scared,\" he said at one point. \"Some of them have kids . . . There should be some respect for what they do.\n\n\"If they think they're so special, why can't they just have an office, a small office? Why can't their kids go over on the other side of the street where they're doing their thing, why can't they say, 'Hey, I'm having a meeting, I need some people'?\"\n\nArticle Continued Below\n\nHe called the mayor's staff \"super-duper smart\" and said it was \"unfortunate\" members of council didn't show more respect for them. \"I'm very frustrated that they're not being supported and supported and supported,\" he continued. \"They should have their own office, they should have their own cubicle.\" And he said he's proud of some of the people he's working with and that they shouldn't \"walk around with a (expletive)\" on their shoulder. \"You know how we can get an (expletive) with a bunch of people? By just coming up and just walking up and having a face-to-face conversation. I think that would be a very, very good thing,\" he said. Ford's remarks are reminiscent of his infamous 2009 \"crushing the opposition\" remarks at city hall, in which he accused reporters of trying to undermine him and the city, while suggesting they should leave city hall because \"you don't have to put up with this s--t.\" He also came under fire last year for telling reporters he had a \"secret\" agenda to privatize the city's garbage collection systems with a private company. Councillor Doug Ford offered few words in his remarks Wednesday: He sat quietly next to the mayor during a brief exchange between the pair. Doug Ford was also at the mayor's side when it happened on Thursday. The mayor has not commented on what his brother might do in the wake of Thursday's session. A spokesman for Councillor Gary Crawford, who left the mayor's office to meet with the city manager, had not returned calls by the time of publication. Councillor Paula Fletcher said she doesn't know the mayor's \"secret agenda.\" \"I've got no idea who the mayor is working to. I've seen him in my office,\" said Fletcher. Councillor Karen Stintz was also in her chair when Ford's remarks were made. \"I don't know who he's thinking about working for,\" she said. Asked about the mayor's latest remark, she said, \"I would suspect that there'll be someone on council doing more for him than anything they've done for themselves.\" \"I mean, the guy, he's a little bit of a rascal sometimes,\" Stintz said, when asked to elaborate. \"He's still very young and in his 20th year, so he has all of the potential in the world. I wouldn't give anything to be sitting next to him.\" With files from Sarah Boesveld and Sarah Boesveld",

      "\"A little more than three years ago an enormous earthquake shook the ground under our feet while I was in the midst of an all-Nepal trip,\" wrote the former US Ambassador to Nepal, Tom Hill in an op-ed published in The Hindu in Kathmandu on November 26.\n\nHill, who is also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, said that the earthquake in May 2011 had also affected him physically, emotionally and spiritually.\n\n\"I woke up in a tent in the middle of nowhere to find my tent covered in blood. There was so much dirt and leaves falling off the tent that I was covered. I was lucky to be unharmed,\" he said. \"In the months that followed this terrible experience, I took time for meditation in the wilderness.\"\n\nOn October 24, Hill wrote an op-ed in The Hindu about his experiences.\n\n\"I was in the midst of an all-Nepal tour when an earthquake shook the ground under our feet while I was in the midst of an all-Nepal tour.\"\n\nAfter completing his final Himalayan trek, Hill returned to the US.\n\nIt was during this second stay in Kathmandu that some of President Barack Obama's top advisors on Nepal and Afghanistan asked him about the condition of President Hamid Karzai, Hill wrote in his letter.\n\n\"They didn't mention the earthquake, but it had been on their minds,\" he said. \"After years of working with the president, they urged me to ask more questions.\"\n\n\"For me, these questions are not about the question of the future of Kabul, but how the international community will respond to the people of Afghanistan,\" Hill said in Kathmandu. \"If we fail to support the Afghan people, then what good did this mission really accomplish, and what can our next mission accomplish. The stakes and consequences of failure must not be underestimated.\"\n\nHowever, the earthquake had not only affected his physical and spiritual well-being, but also his diplomatic and human rights interests, Hill said.\n\n\"In the months that followed this terrible experience, I took time for meditation in the wilderness.\"\n\nPresident Karzai was in the United States at the time of the earthquake, which was also felt by a number of other countries in the region around Nepal.\n\n\"For my personal safety, I would request that I be kept out of direct contact with the president,\" Hill wrote in Kathmandu. \"A few of my staff members and I were in and out of the president's quarters through the end of that winter, however, to no avail. I was in a tent on the north side of the compound, which was still intact, when the earthquake struck.\"\n\n\"My personal safety did not permit me to walk outside that tent in case I had a heart attack,\" he said.\n\nHill said that he was not sure the president had been injured by the earthquake, but after some discussion he thought that the earthquake had damaged parts of the building that could have been a part of the president's private quarters.\n\n\"I was shocked to see the extent of the damage, as was the president's staff,\" Hill wrote in his letter.\n\nHill left Afghanistan for Nepal around May 3, after the US government's decision to end its seven-year, $7.6-billion combat mission in Afghanistan by 2014.\n\n\"The decision to put me on leave was in the best interest of the security of the United States and Afghanistan,\" wrote Hill. \"It allowed me to give them time to prepare for my return to Kabul, where my family is living. It also allowed me to continue my travels around Asia, including a visit to Hong Kong in July that is available to all former foreign service officers.\"\n\nHill is the second member of Obama's foreign policy team to write a letter to The Hindu.\n\nIn a September 24 article in The Hindu, Victoria Nuland, the US Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Eurasia, wrote about the need to ensure a peaceful post-conflict transition in Afghanistan.\n\nAt the time, Nuland was the top US envoy to Ukraine.\n\n\"The US government's long-term strategy for Afghanistan remains focused on supporting the Afghan government as it works to build the Afghan state, and on assisting the Afghan people in the building of their democratic institutions and the rule of law, the foundations for a sustainable peace in Afghanistan,\" wrote Nuland.\n\nShe said a number of measures were underway to help transition post-conflict-era Afghanistan, including the establishment of an independent government, an Afghan-led security conference, a transitional justice mechanism, the building Afghan courts that are able to prosecute crimes committed before 2002, and providing more humanitarian assistance, including food assistance, to help Afghan refugees flee to Pakistan.\n\n\"These steps should help to address a fundamental structural challenge in post-conflict rebuilding in Afghanistan,\" wrote Nuland. \"We must ensure",
      "Rome – For most of its history, Rome has been a hub of civilization in the Italian peninsula, but in this new film, Rizzoli will tell the story of the Roman city. A team of Italian and American producers have created an interactive project depicting a virtual, 3D, photographic re-creation of what Rome would look like in the future and the historical and geographic landmarks that will be lost and forgotten if urban design is left to the whims of the market. The project is based on research and data produced by the global urban research firm Urban Analytics, which has conducted a number of historical and demographic studies to map the city and its inhabitants over the past 40 years.\n\nAs many of these cities throughout history have struggled with economic issues at a time of great urbanisation and a need for more jobs and services, the new digital map of Rome depicts a city that has been transformed by this new economic climate. The project was created by Fondazione Rizzoli and the film is called 'Rome 2020', produced by Rizzoli and distributed by the American-Italian production company Urban Analytics. In it, the Italian actors are asked by the camera at different times to describe a scenario in which Rome would be today. From the ancient and medieval streets to the city walls, the virtual recreation of Rome becomes more real by the second, until it is indistinguishable from what it was in ancient times, when Rome was a world leader in learning and education. In the end, however, what seems like a digital recreation of a modern city in its own right is nothing more than an interactive computer simulation, which uses an open source open data platform to display a dynamic, digital and interactive version of Rome. The project will run over the course of a few weeks, and will allow the general public to experience the new reality of a Rome with the help of a virtual Rome of their own design.\n\n\"There is a strong relationship between digital technologies and the environment, in terms of how cities can be made, developed, enhanced in a creative sense and how the city can be viewed and explored in new ways, which is something we see at Rizzoli,\" says Alberto De Luca, senior brand creative director and vice president of brand planning, Rizzoli USA. \"This project is the culmination of this evolution that we're witnessing and represents a new reality, which we hope to see more of in the next decade.\"\n\nThis is not the first time that Rizzoli has created a digital version of the city, but the 'Rome 2020' project is one of the first that allows visitors and tourists to see the virtual city while exploring all of its landmarks and landmarks and also in the realtime during their travels into Rome.\n\n\"This is the next step in our growth strategy to allow our brands to reach new audiences that cannot be reached through traditional channels. Our goal is to enable brands to have a direct influence on how the landscape is evolving in a number of industries, for example tourism, where we are witnessing an increasingly sophisticated and global approach to planning, design and development, thus leading the way towards an urban future,\" says Roberto Cavagna, President of the Fondazione EO. \"Our hope is that 'Rome 2020' will open new perspectives for people living in and visiting Rome.\"\n\n\"Rome 2020' is a fantastic opportunity to bring global urban researchers and urban professionals together in Rizzoli's offices in the north of Italy and to provide a forum to explore new ways to look at urbanism and development in our cities through interactive technologies. Our aim in creating this project is to share data-driven research with the whole global community, which will then be made publicly available,\" says Fumiaki Matsuzaki, founder and CEO, Urban Analytics.\n\n\"We have been engaged to develop and lead this project. The collaboration has shown us that it is possible to create a creative solution to an complex problem; by working with a brand to understand its consumer in relation to the city, and then finding the right combination of tools and skills to create such a project,\" says Gianni Cappellaro, co-founder and CEO, Rizzoli E OCC.\n\n\"This year we are witnessing a significant shift in how urban development and social wellbeing are tackled, from global experts in city design providing advice to city authorities to the innovative start-ups providing urban solutions in digital development,\" adds Alessandra Pigneri, head of urban research and development, Urban Analytics. \"Urban Analytics have been a key partner for Rizzoli and Urban Analytics will be a partner for Rome 2020.\"\n\nRome 2020 is currently only for public consumption, and will be on display in various venues around the city and at three events: Rizzoli and Urban Analytics on 13 and 14 August in Bologna and on 15 August at the National Museum for Archaeology and Rome, and also at the European Museum of Modern Art in Venice (11 November).\n\nRome 2020 - Project website: http://rome2020.urb",

      "The following is an excerpt from The War Within: How America Will Be Losing Our Civil War Before We Even Know It by Peter A. Schram. Copyright © 2013 by Peter A. Schram, M.Phil. Reprinted by permission of Da Capo Press, a member of the Perseus Books Group.\n\nPresident Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) are doing more to undermine the Senate than they are to help. While the new Supreme Court nominee is underway and the Senate is still conducting its routine business, the president's actions have undermined one of our greatest institutions: Senate confirmation.\n\nHe has failed to fill judicial vacancies across the country, including numerous judgeships across the Midwest. When they take control of the Senate this fall, Republicans will have an extra seat to fill. In many cases, the vacancies left behind by their nominees will be filled by Democrats.\n\nSo let's review. Senate Democrats have held the Senate, not the president who is nominally their leader. With respect to the vacant Supreme Court seats, there are three open seats. The seat of Justice Stevens is vacant. We are told that there are as many as six Supreme Court vacancies, including the vacancy over the Antonin Scalia seat. When Trump takes office, Senate Democrats will have two years to fill the rest of Justice Stevens' seat, and Justice Kennedy's seat, and the vacancy over Scalia's seat.\n\nThe other open seat is that of Justice David Souter. Although many are calling for Senator Mitch McConnell to hold a one-vote majority (meaning to have no more than 49 votes to block Trump's nominees), McConnell has promised that he will not obstruct any of Trump's nominees.\n\nIn this time of uncertainty and disruption, senators must do their jobs. Senate Democrats have failed to hold the majority in the Senate and have no plans to do so in the near future. A Trump presidency has the right to fill at least seven Supreme Court vacancies and a number of additional Senate seats over the next two years, and they must do their job immediately, and not wait until they take control of the senate in November 2018 to do so.\n\nThe president's actions have also helped make the situation even worse. He is filling two or three vacancies a week, and Democrats are holding out for every excuse to delay action. Even the New York Times, which is far more liberal than most senators, is now asking that Trump nominate a full slate of qualified nominees even while he's refusing to confirm them.\n\nSenate Republicans should remember that the stakes are very high. Just as they were handed a perfect political storm, Republicans who voted against the first Supreme Court filibuster should take care to ensure that this does not become their second one. Senate Democrats should start by holding hearings on every nominee and not holding anything back.\n\nThe president's actions need to be checked, not increased, or there could quickly be a crisis on our hands. With every move the president makes now, he only raises the chances of an eventual failure, one we can ill afford.",

      "A federal judge declined on Tuesday to block a federal judge from temporarily halting the implementation of Arizona's SB1070 law on medical marijuana, but he said the U.S. Attorney General's office should drop its opposition.\n\nU.S. District Judge Michael Hogan denied a request by federal prosecutors to block SB1070, the anti-marijuana measure signed by Arizona Governor Jan Brewer in August.\n\nThe U.S. Attorney's office filed a legal objection in December to the measure, saying any medical use of marijuana — whether for medicinal purposes or not — would violate federal law and could expose the state's medical marijuana program to federal criminal prosecution.\n\nBut on Tuesday, Hogan said federal prosecutors should withdraw their objection and that the U.S. Attorney's office should not oppose the bill in the future.\n\n\"We did not believe that there was anything in the legislative record indicating that this state would face a lawsuit by the United States Department of Justice with regard to the implementation of this law or that there were any federal investigations of patients or medical-marijuana-use patients,\" Hogan wrote. \"So we declined to intervene and allow federal prosecutors to proceed on their own.\"\n\nThe decision comes less than two months before the state-organized Arizona Medical Marijuana Program opens for applications. Federal prosecution under the federal Controlled Substances Act for medical marijuana use, even for medicinal purposes, is a long-standing and common occurrence in this state. More than 60 people from Arizona, as well as other states, have been arrested in federally drug-related cases for using medical marijuana in violation of state law.\n\nThe law also allows individuals to possess more marijuana than the Arizona legislature had originally intended, and that was one reason the U.S. Attorney's office objected to the law.\n\nIn his opinion, Hogan wrote the state's medical marijuana program \"will be the largest in the nation\" and that the federal government must be \"prepared to enforce the (bill's) provisions in any appropriate way in light of future decisions regarding medical marijuana usage, even if they are ultimately challenged in court.\"\n\nThe bill originally had a provision to limit the number of growers, but it was removed later in the process.\n\nIn a motion to block SB1070 in January, U.S. Attorney John Hulette said Brewer had \"committed a grave error,\" saying the law \"will likely result in Arizona's compliance with federal law or its enforcement,\" the Republic reported.\n\nHulette also said the medical marijuana expansion bill would \"seriously harm Arizona's efforts to build a partnership with the federal government.\"\n\nBrewer said in a statement Tuesday night the U.S. Attorney's office should back off its opposition.\n\n\"Federal opposition to our patients' access to medical marijuana through a coordinated state program was a mistake,\" Brewer said. \"That opposition cannot be tolerated and will not be tolerated. We will keep working through the regulatory process in an effort to make this work for our patients.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the federal Bureau of Prisons announced it would \"review and potentially rescind\" a grant it gave Arizona to support the state's medical marijuana program and would not reconsider its designation of the state's medical marijuana dispensaries as regulated drug dealers.\n\nBrewer said at the time that while the change would not affect the medical-marijuana program, it \"strikes a blow\" to Arizona's drug-control efforts while \"troubling federal law.\"\n\n\"The Department of Justice's ongoing enforcement of the federal Controlled Substances Act is a key component of our efforts to put Arizona and our entire state economy on a path toward fiscal sustainability — a challenge that requires a comprehensive approach to drug reform,\" Brewer said.",
      "ROBERT KENNER, Associated Press\n\nALBANY, N.Y. (AP) — Gov. Andrew Cuomo has (sort of) been to the zoo over the years, just not the actual zoo.\n\nA New York Times investigation of all the public records and comments left by state lawmakers, lawmakers and aides to Cuomo over the past 25 years indicates Cuomo is one of the few New Yorkers whose knowledge and interest in the big red animal haven't waned.\n\nThe Times found Cuomo has been to the zoo only twice — one was during the Democratic National Convention last year when he attended the event. He also visited New York City Zoo in 1998 for a fundraiser for Democrats in South Carolina.\n\n\"He had some problems with New York Zoological Society and I had some problems with New York Zoo, so he didn't want to go to the one that doesn't exist or the one that had fewer things,\" said Richard Pappalardo, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in 1997 who went to the zoo and has been a frequent Cuomo donor over the years.\n\nWhile Cuomo once made the trek back to the zoo to give a talk to a student group in 1997, he said it was not because he was a big fan of the Bronx Zoo.\n\n\"It wasn't about New York Zoo at all. It wasn't about the Bronx Zoo,\" he told the Times in 1998. \"Obviously something just happened that didn't work out, but it was a lot of other things.\"\n\nThe Times asked a spokesman for Cuomo's office repeatedly to clarify the governor's attendance record at the Bronx Zoo and if anyone in the governor's administration had ever expressed displeasure regarding a Bronx Zoo visit.\n\nA spokesman for the office said Cuomo's record with the Bronx Zoo is spotty because of his travel schedule and was not a specific policy issue that was in play during his tenure as New York's governor. The spokesman also said the governor's record is similar to other New Yorkers and that there was never a fuss.\n\nThe spokesman said the governor does not keep a calendar of his visits to the zoo.\n\nA 1997 article in the Buffalo News on the governor's attendance at the Bronx Zoo featured a photo of the governor on the tarmac in Buffalo before he took off on the two-day trip from the airport. The newspaper noted Cuomo would fly direct to Buffalo for the fundraiser and then head the rest of the way to the Bronx for the zoo events.\n\n\"His schedule for the week included only a few official meetings, all of them involving the convention,\" the newspaper said. \"At the zoo, there were no events, no press conferences, no fundraisers, no photo ops. All was quiet. No big speeches, no big rallies.\"\n\nA newspaper review found Cuomo has never made a special tour of the Bronx Zoo.\n\nIn 2013, when the Bronx Zoo was considering moving three elephants to China to save them from being poached, Cuomo and State Senator Diane Savino were in favor of moving the elephants, the Times reported.\n\nCuomo told the newspaper it's easy to be in favor of protecting elephants, because nobody's actually slaughtered them for their tusks.\n\n\"The elephant is a great creature,\" in fact, he told the Buffalo News and Times Union of Albany in the piece published in the newspaper on the topic. \"There's one right there, there's another there.\"\n\n___\n\nFollow Robert Kennedy on Twitter at http://twitter.com/RobertKennedyAP",
      "This is the third post of what I hope is a series that will lead to a comprehensive account of the events at RIM in the context of the company and its products and services, and the management that they provide.\n\nSome background: RIM, formerly known as Research In Motion, was spun out as a stand-alone company on June 8th, 2010. It was renamed to BlackBerry on June 26th, 2010, the day that it was introduced to the public. The first of several \"flagship\" BB10 devices, its primary target was the mobile phone market, where it had just become the 5th largest player in the US. The company had two core focuses: to deliver high-end software that was used only in the mobile market, and to provide \"good enough\" hardware with a focus on low-end devices and the middle class.\n\nPrior to the initial launch of the BlackBerry 10 operating system, many of RIM's products had already been announced for release in March, a month later than their planned launches, due primarily due to the large amount of R&D and development time that was needed for the next-generation platform. This led many analysts and analysts to question the success of RIM's strategy.\n\nBlackBerry 10\n\nBlackBerry 10 was launched in March, 2010, and it is the third major revision of the operating system developed by the company. The operating system provides a number of improvements to the BlackBerry experience. For example, it contains native multitasking support, which helps to make the OS better suited the current, relatively lower-end, tablet devices. It supports the new Android-based Emotion UI framework in applications and also offers the ability to run Android applications directly in Android on existing BB10 devices. While RIM has still not yet confirmed that the Android-based emojis will actually run on a smartphone (and it's possible that they won't), RIM's marketing materials stated that RIM's iOS-based mobile platform was not yet ready for release in the US, and should be tested in the coming months.\n\nBlackBerry 10 will be released in the UK, France, Germany, Spain, Russia, Mexico and Australia on February 16th.\n\nRIM has introduced a number of BlackBerry 10 features to their mobile platform since its launch. Many of these improvements are tied to the smartphone market. For example, some features are intended to help make the smartphone more convenient, such as the phone-calling app or the BlackBerry Hub.\n\nBlackBerry Hub\n\nThe BlackBerry Hub has been the most visible and effective part of the introduction of the BlackBerry 10 OS. It enables users with a BlackBerry 10 smartphone to call and access all of the information and services that come included with all BlackBerry 10 mobile devices, such as BBM, mail, calendar, call history and even the ability to store contacts, photos, calendar events and links in their BlackBerry Hub.\n\nBlackBerry Messaging\n\nThe BlackBerry Messaging (MMS) app is a new feature added to the Android Market that is available to Android users who have a device running Android 4.0 or later. The BlackBerry Messaging app allows Android users to be able to send MMS messages with other users on their account.\n\nBlackBerry Calendar\n\nA number of additional features are available for developers and users of the BlackBerry Hub and Messaging, and they include:\n\n– You can schedule events based on your location\n\n– You can make photos and videos available to all BlackBerry 10 users on the same device\n\n– Add contacts to your contact list and share contacts with them\n\n– Make video calls and take photos from your camera roll\n\nRIM's latest device, the BlackBerry Z10.\n\nBlackBerry Hub\n\nWhile the Blackberry Hub is the one main area that RIM made a lot of changes in its product strategy, it is by no means the entire story. The BlackBerry Hub is the interface that is currently visible in Android devices running BB10. To access it from Android's Play Store, users must first install the BlackBerry Hub Manager app from developer app store. This provides users with a menu listing all the features of the Hub, with options for each for quick access. If you are on a BB10 phone, you can then make changes to each feature within the Hub as a way to test it before installing it on your device. For example, there is a quick access to the BBM app to send messages. Then, with the ability to set which devices get a share menu and share links, you are able to share all of your photos, calendar events with other users and the like. If you are not a user on a BB10 device you can enable the ability to share a link to your email with everyone on your contact list by installing the Email Sharing option (Settings > More > Sharing > Share link).\n\nBlackBerry Hub Manager\n\nBlackBerry Messages app\n\nOne additional feature added for BlackBerry 10 is the BlackBerry Messages app. This allows for",

      "The first year of the new Congress has gone like this: President Trump has been a lightning rod for the nation's political debate, making a name for himself as a showman with colorful tweeting. He's made headlines for all the wrong reasons — the immigration ban, the bizarre response to North Korea, his feud with the gold star parents of a fallen soldier — but one of his most high-profile efforts is gaining praise among conservatives: his plan to eliminate the Dodd-Frank financial law.\n\n\"Dodd-Frank may be the most damaging piece of legislation in decades, and the best way to stop it is to repeal it,\" Mike Lee of Utah told Time magazine this week.\n\nThe Republicans who have introduced such legislation are getting ready for some of the thorniest fights in 2018, as they try to win over their constituents after several years of losing them in 2010.\n\n\"I will do everything I can to get rid of Dodd-Frank,\" Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky said in February.\n\nThe pushback has been fierce as well. \"Repealing Dodd-Frank is a bad idea,\" said Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.\n\nBut Trump's opponents say he might have already won: In a recent poll by Politico and Morning Consult, just 29 percent of those surveyed opposed Trump's plan to get rid of Dodd-Frank, compared with 57 percent who approved.\n\nFor now, though, the effort to completely deregulate Wall Street and the financial sector seems destined to remain in its infancy. But on Capitol Hill and in campaign finance circles, many conservatives are gearing up to fight Trump's approach.\n\nThe GOP is a coalition full of interests: Main Street banks, small and midsize securities firms with $100 million or less in assets, and foreign governments that have made billions of dollars trading in the U.S. markets.\n\nAnd those interests are not likely to be on the same page.\n\n\"You know you're going to get a fight between the financial companies and the Trump administration when you have both of them on the same ticket,\" said John Bonifaz, director of Free Speech for People, a group that defends free speech in the digital world and lobbies on the issues of speech and civil liberties.\n\n\"If Dodd-Frank is getting scrapped, you can bet there will also be some fierce lobbying between the lobbyists for financial interests and the lobbyists for financial institutions, because that's the natural constituency for these guys,\" he said.\n\nMany advocates see the repeal in particular as a huge victory for the financial industry. On Tuesday, Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, the liberal Harvard professor and anti-Trump firebrand, made clear in a tweet that the financial industry, which backed Trump against Hillary Clinton, wanted him to go after it. \"Dodd-Frank isn't going away,\" she wrote.\n\nMany lawmakers have said they want to protect the rules in Dodd-Frank but have balked at taking the executive branch to the Supreme Court, where it could be overruled by the opposing party.\n\nIf Dodd-Frank isn't going away, there's little reason to think it will be undone anytime soon\n\nMeanwhile, the repeal is a hard sell.\n\n\"Republicans have always talked a lot about getting rid of Dodd-Frank. But we're not hearing much discussion about how we get that done,\" said Jim Manley, a former Hillary Clinton aide who is now a Washington lobbyist.\n\nThe legislation would only reduce protections for smaller institutions that already get waivers from the law, but not the big ones that are underwritten by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\n\"The Dodd-Frank Act was passed with no Republican co-sponsors, and it was never supposed to be undone by legislation. Its entire purpose was to make sure Wall Street didn't get too big to fail,\" said Dennis Kelleher, president of Better Markets, a coalition of small and midsize banks that support the Dodd-Frank financial rules.\n\n\"It's very hard to get Republicans to sign on to that,\" Kelleher said. \"If they're interested in getting rid of Dodd-Frank, they need to be talking about getting rid of the banks and the big banks.\"\n\nDodd-Frank's supporters are now getting ready to lobby Congress. \"We're going to be prepared for every scenario,\" said James Gattuso, head of the consumer bureau under President Obama. \"I am extremely confident that our efforts will not be in vain.\"\n\nGattuso and other Democratic officials have taken a public stand against repealing those regulations — a risky move against a GOP that is generally hostile to public regulations. In the long battle over regulation in the White House, Trump has sometimes praised the small-banks' lobbying efforts, and he has named several that supported his campaign over Democratic rival Hillary Clinton.\n\nThere are risks for Democrats too. A strong backlash against the repeal could hurt the party's chances",
      "By Chris Wright\n\n\nWe all know that the top five football leagues in the world are the Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A and Ligue 1, but the Football League is now preparing for a shift of power.\n\n\nIt's been well documented that the 'Big 5' clubs have effectively been holding the power in all other areas of the game with the vast majority of the money from TV rights (especially overseas) coming from those clubs' coffers.\n\n\nNow that they have made a full-throated return to the football pitch via the Football League, it now looks like the old boys club clubs are about to be given a massive dose in some of the financial spheres that previously existed in the hands of the smaller clubs.\n\n\nAccording to the Sunday Times' Gary Lineker, the Premier League clubs are preparing new rules that will allow them to own and operate their own TV networks, as well as a new 'financial services' company.\n\n\nThe Financial Services Companies (FSC) will be part owned and run by the clubs and the Premier League will effectively be able to choose who is on their boards; they may, of course, choose other clubs for board positions, but it seems rather unfair that their own clubs are to be treated as if they were little children who need to be reared in the right manner by an adult.\n\n\nThat's not to say there aren't also rules and regulations that need to be broken with regards to the FSC's independence, if anything they could be more independent than the Football League already is.\n\n\nOn top of that, the Football League will also be able to negotiate contracts on their own, with the clubs still having a say on certain matters in respect of the clubs' running of the companies. It would be a little hard to imagine the Premier League not having some influence, whether that's on personnel or the direction of the FSC itself, but let's just say they would need very big influence indeed.\n\n\nAs you might have guessed it will be a little hard to take into account the fact that the Premier League is the most profitable football league in history, while also having an incredible global reach and a massive fan base.\n\n\nA few years back it was a little difficult to tell whether or not the clubs actually shared any common interests, if the FA and Premier League actually had any common interests; now there's no telling what that common interest may be.\n\n\nIt seems quite fitting that we'll be talking about this on the 25th anniversary of the Premier League's inception, the start of a new decade.\n\n\nChris, do you agree with all of this? Does the fact the FSC will now take more control over the Premier League make things better or worse for the smaller clubs, or does that actually make things better and better for the Premier League? Let us know below…\n\n\nFor all the best pics, videos and stories from around the sporting world, follow FootballPhotoBlog on Twitter!",
      "In December, a group of high school students protested the opening of an Iranian-funded high school and threatened to boycott finals, the Associated Press reports. Students from several schools in a San Diego suburb had marched to an elementary school to demand that the school board not approve the construction of an $81 million high school for Iranian students. The San Diego Unified School District opened the school Wednesday, after students successfully petitioned the state legislature, passed a referendum, and got Gov. Jerry Brown to issue a waiver to allow the school to open.\n\nThe group of students involved in the fight against the school's opening, The Freedom Alliance, claimed that it was a civil rights issue and \"opposite points of view.\" And it is true that there are many who consider Iranian students living in the United States to be foreigners with very different rights that U.S. citizens. However, the group's statement is inaccurate in that it equates the rights of Iran-American students with the right of any other group of students to receive an education.\n\nIt was one of three protests organized that day to prevent the opening of a high school and to send a message to the state about Iran's nuclear program. Students at Alameda Union High School, in Alameda, Calif., were planning to protest a separate school for Iran. When they saw the students protesting in solidarity with the Iranian students, however, they decided that they do not want to participate in any way and left peacefully.\n\nThat's not to say that these students do not understand the issues they seek to protest. The statement that the Freedom Alliance used was about Iran. The statement stated that these students \"oppose the creation of a new school district for Muslim students which will provide financial assistance to Muslim students who are living in the US and are unable to continue attending the traditional high schools in Iran.\" The Freedom Alliance was trying to send a message to Iranian students living in the United States, as well as people not living in Iran, that they should be able to pursue higher education here without facing discrimination from Iranians that they see as their friends.\n\n\"We will not give in and we will defend our rights, and you have given up yours,\" the Freedom Alliance stated. The Freedom Alliance also said that they would not attend Friday's graduation ceremony, and when it was suggested that they come forward to explain their actions, the group refused.\n\nBut what the Freedom Alliance is protesting is something far larger than the right to attend an Iranian-sponsored school. Iranian students living in the United States, whether they're U.S. citizens or not, have a right to get an education without the threat of discrimination from the Iranian government. It is true that many Iranians living in the United States, for most of their history, were under the thumb of a brutal, dictatorial empire that tried to impose an Islamized version of the Iranian state. But that history doesn't change how the students living in the United States are viewed by Iranians, or by their families, friends, or communities. Iranian-supported students also benefit from the same financial resources that U.S. students do: tuition free at public universities and state schools. While both Iranian and American students are denied a tuition-free education, Iranian students are under the thumb of the Iranian government, while U.S. students enjoy the same financial support.\n\nIt goes without saying that Iranian students have a right to receive a education, regardless of the government that they live in. To hold a student's right to education hostage is akin to holding a person's right to a home hostage. It's even worse than holding a person's right for a job hostage, because the right to education, regardless of who funds it, is tied to the individual's ability to provide that education. With that in mind, the fact that Iranian students may be facing discrimination within their countries of origin is something more than just a social right, but it should be a political concern to those who want to make sure that both sides of a particular issue are given equal play, including both sides' perspective. No one should be held hostage by their country of origin when the issue at hand has so much more at stake.",

      "I'm in the very early innings of my writing career. That is, I'm working towards having a novel I'm proud of, but I'm not there yet. I'm about halfway through my first draft of a book that, while still in the early stages of production, I'm very pleased with. I have a rough outline of how my book will end, and I've gone through the process of writing it and rewriting it and revising it and rereading it all before deciding it's ready. So, I can tell where the book is going, but I can still make changes and improve upon it. It's an iterative process, and that's what makes it fun.\n\nNow, that doesn't mean my books should stay this way forever. It's just good planning, it says that my writing life shouldn't be so much like this. I'm still learning, and I'm still figuring things out. And I am going to continue to learn. Every book I write, I continue to experiment with, and that means, for the foreseeable future, an ever-changing novel. I've been learning how to write fiction since my early teens, and that can be a very rewarding thing, but it does mean I have to make constant revisions to my book, and in the time it takes, those changes can turn into big, huge changes. Sometimes, I'll discover that a novel was so fun that I really don't want to mess with any more, so I end up deciding to scrap it for good. Other times, I decide to keep the book, and so when I do have a book that I'm proud of, I know its history and I'm excited to give readers the opportunity to learn more about it, like I did with THIS ONE (and this isn't even a good book, I'd be careful about calling it a great book)\n\nI'm going to keep changing my work in different ways, and my work will constantly evolve from my previous book to this one. That's fine, but I know it's always going to be a little different than my last book, and that's okay. I'm not a writer so much as I'm a reader, and I will write books that readers love and tell their friends about, just like I've always done.\n\nSo, that's where I'm at right now. I'm proud of this chapter. I have a rough outline, and my writing life isn't exactly like this. But, I know what I want to do and that's enough.",
      "How often do we encounter the fact that we didn't get that item we wanted at the store?\n\nIn my experience, it often comes when it's the final week of the year and there is a heavy pile of clothes in your closet that you know you don't need.\n\nSo there you are, on the verge of throwing everything in (and maybe regretting it a few days later) but then, you get in the grocery aisle and it's exactly what you were looking for.\n\nHere's how to spot it.\n\nIt's not an all-out buying rush — it's a lack of urgency. If you've been noticing that you're putting it off to a later date, you're right — you were in the right place at the right time! It's easy to put it off when you've been putting off buying it for months because you don't want to put off more money.\n\nThe idea is to get right back in action. Start spending that extra money on your gift list (or your monthly bills or whatever you need). But if you can't afford it as soon as you can get it, give yourself at least a couple of months to work toward the item. If you spend your next dollar now, you are giving yourself the edge you need to eventually make the purchase.\n\nThe key here is to really look for opportunities for your money. Don't get caught up in buying stuff just because no one is paying attention to you!\n\nInstead, focus on something else you need instead. A new pair of jeans can get you going for a weekend getaway instead of a new pair of pants. If you're feeling guilty about putting off getting the dress you want to wear to that friend's wedding, skip it for the week and get an extra day for yourself. (Maybe you can even take the wedding dress with you.)\n\nOnce it's in your hands, don't give it a second thought.\n\nRemember, everything you buy has a purpose and that purpose is to earn your money back. Don't start making excuses as to why you can't spend all your money on one thing and why it's a good idea to put off buying.\n\nIf you don't have a gift basket, try a $3 donation box. If you're just short on money, donate a small amount instead of putting it out on credit card. If you think giving presents is just too much of a chore, look at doing it with a friend.\n\nNow you have the perfect excuse, right?\n\nMake a list of your priorities, things you want to focus on or things you'd like to be doing more of.\n\nThen think about what you can do to get yourself into the right mindset. Try a few things to get the desired outcome. If you feel like you're getting there, you can probably put it off for a bit.\n\nOnce you feel more in control, then set that next purchase in motion. You'll need to set up your budget system and stick to it. Do it and try not to feel overwhelmed. It will be your first task and you'll likely feel overwhelmed. Remember, the key is to not feel overwhelmed, but use this time to build momentum and get back to work! (Hint: If you do it in 10 minutes, it'll be a lot easier!)\n\nYou'll need this willpower and willpower often.\n\nHow do you manage when you're overwhelmed with a new-year shopping list?

      "\"What the heck. That's kind of weird. Why's everyone in uniform? So, what can I do for you?\"\n\n\"I saw it on one of the news channels. They're trying to move the base to the east coast and I just gotta know more about it. I'll see if I can get more info on that later.\"\n\nI was about to ask why they moved to the east coast and where was it, but then there was another group coming down the hill.\n\n\"…?\"\n\nThe first wave of cavalry came to an abrupt stop and looked back.\n\n\"Did you call out to me?\"\n\nSieg and I were the only two wearing the school's uniform, but I was the only one in a uniform that wasn't red. The other knights were all wearing some sort of red uniform.\n\n\"Yeah, it was pretty obvious the girl was standing there looking like she noticed us.\"\n\n\"We're also here to watch the military parade. I mean, there are still people that need to be killed, so we should help out as much as possible. So… We're on this side of the school?\"\n\n\"I got it. I'm here by myself. Do you know anyone who can talk?\"\n\n\"Hmmm…\"\n\nThe first squadron looked around for a second before continuing forward. There were a few knights in their army uniforms and one of them had an odd looking gun.\n\n\"Do you think they're just testing out the airship?\"\n\n\"That's a weird place for things to happen,\" said the other knight. \"I'll bet things are being modified here, too. It'll probably start soon. It's a little bit scary.\"\n\n\"What part of it?\"\n\n\"The military parade. It's not so much an airship, but a transport type. That means it'll be carrying people as well.\"\n\nSieg looked down the hillside. The airship that was being used wasn't that large, but there were only two of them.\n\n\"Is that why there's a single one in the air?\"\n\n\"There hasn't been one in the air since we were able to operate this one when we first started. As such, we are limited on the number we can transport. And the reason why the military parade is being held out here is because that's where the airship is and the base is… That's why it's important to learn everything we can.\"\n\nThe man who looked like he just came back from a military parade stopped the second wave of cavalry that was stopping and looked at the soldiers.\n\n\"Well then. Please keep your voices down. Please watch carefully. And, please don't get injured.\"\n\nHe sounded so worried that I started to feel sorry for him a little but, what in the world would he know? Was this about the people who were supposed to be helping? We decided to leave them be while we walked down together.\n\n… However, those cavalry seemed to come from somewhere else as they soon had their weapons ready.\n\n\"Hey… Don't you just shoot anyone who gets in the way?\"\n\n\"Huh?\"\n\nAt one point, I remembered something that was written on this wall… and then I noticed something else. What's this?\n\n… It was written this way on the second floor…\n\n\"Y-Yeah.\"\n\nIn my place there was a knight who was holding a hammer in his hand.\n\n\"Oya.\"\n\nBut… he said that while letting a smile on his face. Did he have a good look at me? We were standing in the same place.\n\n\"Hey, you. I'm also taking care of me weapon to be able to protect me and people like you from whatever sort of things come in your line of sight, so…\"\n\n… No. That's, no, that's not really what he's saying at all…\n\nThe airship began to fly. When we started heading down the hill, we realized we hadn't noticed the formation of the cavalry in front of us. It looked like they were going to attack from the front. The men in the front of the group began to move their shields.\n\n\"So… That's the military parade huh.\"\n\n\"Eh? Ah, actually it's the knight training exercise.\"\n\nThe knights who were in the air gave each other an embarrassed smile and lowered their swords. Sieg continued walking forward.\n\n\"It's the knight's academy's parade. It'll last one hour and they'll be using swords and armor for the exercises. So, it was kind of a bit strange that there were just two of us when we saw it, but it'll be cool to watch since there'll be knights running in front of us.

New Orleans is diverse,\" he said.\n\nThe mayor also explained that the Facebook page has \"opened doors\" among people the city didn't reach last year. \"I want everyone to see it,\" he noted, because it's \"partly a reflection of New Orleans as it is today.\n\n\"You might say that New Orleanians are generally unapologetically proud of our diverse culture.

      "What? How? Why? Will the NFL be interested?\n\nThe Buffalo Bills had a busy offseason, but the one that stands out most to me was the addition of quarterback Ryan Fitzpatrick. It was a move that many in the organization didn't think would happen, but in the two seasons since, the Bills have been the best team in the AFC.\n\nThis past weekend may have been no different when the Texans came to town, but the Texans have become much more interesting this season and with a win Monday night, they could be back in the playoff hunt.\n\nRyan Fitzpatrick is a quality quarterback who has a ton of experience in the NFL. As noted by ESPN's Ron Jaworski, Fitzpatrick is still only 27 years old. A healthy and productive Fitzpatrick will put the Buffalo Bills team's offense in a much better position to succeed.\n\nThe Bills are going to need Fitzpatrick because the team could not find a suitable replacement for Tyrod Taylor. The problem is that Rex Ryan is not only not willing to use the franchise tag on Taylor this year, but he has no plans to do so in the future. The Bills are also not in great rebuilding mode, and without a top quarterback, it makes it tough for the team to grow.",

      "In an interview with Vogue last month, President Barack Obama said that if he didn't have marijuana, he \"might be having a beer.\" Although his remarks may have been interpreted as joking, many drug policy reform advocates believe that Obama's statement indicates a desire to continue using marijuana after he leaves office.\n\nLegalized in Colorado and Washington state, marijuana is a $30 million dollar a year industry in those states for medical marijuana. That alone should prompt congressional concern about the impact that marijuana legalization would have on the federal budget. A Congressional Research Service report last year found that \"the federal government could lose nearly $40 billion in tax revenue from marijuana legalization in the next decade.\"\n\n\"It could end up being a huge deal,\" Dan Riffle of the Marijuana Policy Project told the Washington Post.\n\nAccording to Riffle, \"you could see states who are starting to move toward decriminalizing marijuana being forced into a position of paying back all that money in taxes.\" A former White House drug advisor even suggested last year that the federal government has already started to feel the financial benefits of marijuana legalization. In the Washington Examiner interview, former drug czar Michael Botticelli said \"I think the feds are going to feel like they're getting tax revenue from [marijuana] legalization … it's going get easier to impose prohibition.\"\n\n\"We need a strong Justice Department for the entire country,\" Riffle added. \"To leave something on the books that's highly illegal that doesn't lead to much of a drug problem, that's going to get you a lot of revenue, that's going to be a big deal.\"\n\nEven Obama himself made a statement about marijuana legalization during a recent campaign stop. The president said that he did not support \"any form of legalization,\" referring to the idea of legalizing marijuana. Though Obama may have been joking, drug policy reform advocates point out that he likely has no regrets about using the drug because they believe it has been effective in helping him achieve the goals he has made for the United States.\n\nThe Washington Post asked former White House drug advisor Gil Kerlikowske about this question earlier this year. He said, \"The war on drugs has only been waged on a small scale. We know from a lot of evidence that prohibition does more harm than good.\"\n\nObama has been in the White House since 2009. If he is serious about ending marijuana prohibition, it won't happen without Congress.",

      "\"Hang on: why are we spending an estimated £3.4billion a year on the NHS when our NHS budgets were £24billion? Are we not the wealthiest country in the world?\"\n\nHe was talking to his party's general election manifesto, a document that promised to create a \"National Health Service\" for the whole United Kingdom, \"one of the world's leading models of social-economic reform\".\n\nWell, that is how health care is financed in the United States, and the reason for that is also what the \"national health service\" would be, and we would then have to talk about spending a lot more per person on health care than other parts of Europe and the United States do.\n\nBut we are already spending less per person on health care in Scotland, per year, than we spend on England. And that is a reason for optimism.\n\nAs the Institute for Fiscal Studies has pointed out, Scotland is saving money because we are reducing people's health needs. That is a good thing for a nation to do and a very good thing for those who live within its borders.\n\nA recent analysis by the National Centre for Social Research suggests that if a Scottish Government was to reverse a number of current UK cuts, it could save more than £300m a year by 2020-21, which it could then use for investment in frontline services.\n\nOf course this would depend on all the money being spent on the NHS, but the NHS in Scotland is now spending slightly more per person on health care than the British Medical Association (BMA) currently claims.\n\nThis is not just the case for Scotland. If you compare the UK's health spending as a share of GDP in 2014 with the UK's health spending as a share of GDP in 2002, we are actually spending more per head than our neighbours.\n\nThis is because the NHS has, in most other countries, been the equivalent of a publicly- funded health service, but not in the UK. As the BMA rightly say, that's because of its centralised governance arrangements.\n\nThe biggest cut to the NHS in the United Kingdom occurred in England when Tony Blair's Government decided to impose a national health service, or \"NHS\", on the entire nation. By 2003 the number of GPs had been reduced by half and by 2008 the number of hospitals had been reduced by one-quarter (Source: Institute of Fiscal Studies).\n\nThe Scottish Government is in a strong position to reverse the trend towards this centralisation.\n\nThere are many countries – including Switzerland, Germany, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands – that have very successfully decentralised their health system. They have a better quality of care because they are better at finding efficiencies and cost-saving.\n\nScotland, though, is not like Switzerland: it is a big country, so it is able to make an extra effort to find good solutions to health service problems.\n\nThe key point on the public finances is, therefore: whatever the number of people who are employed in the NHS, there will be more and better paying jobs if the NHS provides services better than other jurisdictions' health services.\n\nIf we had a government that was able to bring the NHS into Scotland's national economic and financial framework, then perhaps we could put it on a more sustainable long-term footing, and the NHS would no longer have to make the same kind of huge cuts. That would be a good thing.",
      "TAMPA, Fla., June 22, 2013 /PRNewswire/ -- Famed entrepreneur and philanthropist David Susskind is the grand marshal of the 37th annual \"Great American Truck Race,\" which starts on Saturday, June 22, 2014 on I-75 in Tampa, Florida.\n\nThe seven-hour, 60-mile truck race from Tampa International Airport to Tallahassee, Florida will start from 5:15 p.m. EDT on June 22. The race features a truck speed record that was set in 2011, with a record of 114mph set by Larry Stutchbury in a Ford F-150. The record was re-set in 2013 when Kevin Kloza in a Ford F-150 hit 105mph in under a minute, completing the 60-mile run in 12 hours and 59 minutes.\n\nSusskind has been a long-time supporter of the Great American Truck Race beginning with his first race in 1979. He was once asked to be the \"poster boy for the race.\" In 2012, he was honored as \"Great American Truck King – 2011″ and 2013 saw him awarded the \"Great American Truck Race Queen – 2013″. David has been a mentor to many of his racing friends, some of the past winners include former drivers like Dick Trickle, Randy Bortolotti and Steve Yager. In 2015, Kloza, who had just recently moved up to full truck truck racing, became the first female to run in the race. Other notable past winners of the event include Steve Yager (1988, 1999, 2008, 2012) and Randy Bortolotti (2001, 2014)\n\nThe race, which was created by the American Trucking Associations, features eight \"tracks\" with 20 trucks taking part in the race. The races have a starting line at Tallahassee International Airport and a finishing line in Tallahassee. There are eight separate classes of trucks: Group 1\n\n1 1/2 ton and over\n\n3-ton trucks (tow trucks and semitrailer trucks)\n\n4-ton (tractor trailers)\n\n6-ton (large flatbed trailers and flatbed truck tractors; semi-truck trailers)\n\n8-ton (truck tractors).

      "A recent article from the Washington Post reported that a growing body of research suggests that the so-called red meat paradox – where more people are dying of heart disease and stroke as a result of eating the same amount of red meat – does not hold up against \"real world\" reality. The researchers concluded that people need not \"reduce or eliminate red meat from their daily diet.\"\n\nThis finding was met with a significant amount of criticism from nutritionists and nutritionists alike. Some, however, argued that there are numerous other reasons for the apparent paradox between red meat and health. For example, a 2012 article on the American Journal of Cardiology stated that the research cited above could not explain \"many other health benefits associated with red or processed meat, including reduced risk of bowel cancer, colorectal cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart attack and stroke.\"\n\nThis recent article in the Washington Post, however, takes a much stronger stance against the argument that the red meat paradox can be easily explained, noting that \"the most compelling explanation for the paradox is that the health benefits of red meat are largely due to its saturated fat content.\"\n\nThe researchers did admit, however, that while this explanation might seem implausible from a purely scientific standpoint, it is plausible from a political viewpoint.\n\n\"The fact that the United States and other developed nations have a long history of high red meat consumption may in part explain, at least partly, this discrepancy in mortality rates,\" they wrote. \"A more plausible explanation is that social institutions – cultural values and legal protections for meat consumption – are partly to blame.\"\n\nThe authors then presented the argument that social beliefs concerning vegetarianism and red meat production (for example, eating meats raised on grass) has a major influence on nutrition.\n\n\"We have come to expect that Americans, as a whole (particularly young adults in particular), will eat lower fat, lower cholesterol foods, as this is a social norm, often expressed in an unspoken promise to eat whole foods,\" the authors wrote.\n\nHowever, the paper noted that this behavior has been gradually changing over time, with the rate of red meat consumption declining over the past 40 years while other healthy and healthy-compared-to-saturated fat, whole foods products (for example, milk and dairy products) have increased.\n\n\"For example, the percentage of total calories and the percentage of calories from fat per 1000 calories consumed in the United States have changed significantly since 1960,\" the authors wrote. \"In 1960, 15.2% of calories were from fat and 27.7% of calories were from saturated fat; in 2000, 14.9% of calories were from fat and 37.9% of calories were from saturated fat; and in 2010, it was 14.7% and 27.7%.\"\n\nAs for \"cisgender\" people, they noted that \"over the past two decades we have come very close to achieving the transition to a more inclusive diet for individuals of all genders and sexual identities.\"\n\nWhile that claim may seem counter-intuitive to most, it actually is a fairly accurate one, the paper's authors write.\n\n\"There has been a shift from focusing on the effect of a particular nutrient or food on a disease outcome to focused instead on the health and well-being of an individual,\" they wrote. \"There are certainly many benefits of diets higher in whole foods, including fiber, protein and various micronutrients. The same foods are available to all of us; we just need to choose what we eat.\"\n\n\"People are much more likely to achieve optimal health if they eat a whole and varied diet that includes several fruits, vegetables and whole grains than if they were merely reducing fat, sugary drinks and trans fats,\" they added.",

      "The first two seasons of The Leftovers were among HBO's most brilliant moments, but as it approaches its third season, the show looks to be falling into its own storytelling patterns and rhythms. Here's a breakdown of why The Leftovers will likely go down as one of the best television shows of the next few years.\n\n1. The story is too big for just one season.\n\nSeason 1: After six years of being buried under darkness, a mysterious, supernatural entity — The Guilty Remnant — strikes again to bring humanity back to the brink of extinction. What's driving the Guilty Remnant is a question The Leftovers never fully answers; when can it be stopped? Why are they still at the center of human affairs after the events of the first season? These questions remain open and are likely going to lead to the biggest mysteries of the entire series and beyond.\n\n2. That mystery will drive Season 3 in ways its original one never could.\n\nMany fans loved how the first season introduced what appeared to be a very distinct and consistent style of storytelling. In fact, many of the first season's biggest mysteries were answered by the end of the first 10 episodes, and when you think of it that way, it only raises questions in the second season. Why was Kevin Garvey so obsessed with finding the Guilty Remnant so early on in the series, even if it was ultimately a fruitless search? Why did Michael's mom end up becoming an \"angel\" that could manipulate others and make them believe in something as simple as a miracle? Why did Michael's brother, Nora, become so desperate to make a difference in the middle of a massive natural disaster? These problems — which will likely continue to pop up throughout Season 3 — will only intensify as Season 3 ramps up.\n\n3. Season 3 will be harder to get into than the Season 1 finale could have been.\n\nFans of the original series likely felt somewhat spoiled when the episode which introduced Kevin Garvey, Kevin Garvey the Guilty Remnant, the Guilty Remnant the light, and Kevin Garvey that Kevin Garvey the Light was essentially the story of the entire first season. It's understandable why those who were more familiar with the show would be frustrated with this new approach, because that's the general idea. But after two seasons of digging into the mysteries and characters of the show, Season 3 will be a big leap by bringing in an entirely new crew of characters to bring fans to an entirely new place.\n\n4. The show is a hard watch at times, but the second half is pretty great.\n\nSeason 3 introduces a few new characters and some new aspects of the show's mythology that will definitely keep fans excited for what's to come. While not everything that happens in Season 3 will be good news (which, let's be honest, is true with any TV show to varying degrees) the second half of the season is always interesting. Kevin Garvey's journey to realize his role with the Guilty Remnant, the return of the Guilty Remnant to the world, and of course, the \"light\" of Kevin Garvey, will help pull viewers into that world for at least a few weeks with the third season. Fans can, of course, expect some of that same darkness to return after these characters are exposed.\n\n5. A large chunk of the series is set in Australia.\n\nIt's easy to forget that The Leftovers has been a television show for two years without ever truly settling in American soil and I believe that it is one of the best reasons why. As I mentioned, Australia is the setting of both the original series and the second (though not the third) season, and much of the season is centered in Australia. A lot of the show's themes, characters, events, and mysteries revolve around the theme of loss and loss of community, and I don't see much of an issue with that on a global scale. The new season will likely explore those themes in ways the original series never could, which means plenty of great stories for The Leftovers to tell. And the best part is, it will probably be a lot of fun for those watching at home.\n\nImages: HBO, FX, Amazon, Universal Television",
      "The Supreme Court of Canada has ruled that the government must give people in low-income families a $3,300 tax credit in order to offset the rise in other taxes the new government will impose in coming years.\n\nOn Thursday, the Supreme Court reversed a lower court's decision that had exempted the credit from being paid to parents with children under 18.\n\nOn Monday, Justice Thomas Lederer, writing for the majority, said that while the government could exempt \"minor children\" from the $3,300 credit from 2016 to 2019, it could not go ahead with the program when parents with children aged 16 to 18 are included.\n\nThe court said in its decision that parents of teen children will have to pay taxes on the income they receive, even though they are no longer receiving any benefits through the Children's Fitness Tax Credit.\n\nThe decision was welcomed by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business, which represents small businesses.\n\nBut the decision has upset some social conservatives.\n\n'Pork barrel,' says Tory critic\n\n\"Pork barrel. That is a very accurate description; that's what this government is now,\" says Conservative finance critic Pierre Poilievre.\n\nI'm not sure we need this, and I would like to see the court step aside here and let the Conservatives get on with the business of delivering benefits to Canadians. Pierre Poilievre, federal finance critic\n\nHe points out that the Conservative government was elected in part on a promise of \"doing something about the middle class squeeze.\"\n\n\"What I think will happen is, more taxes, more costs for people, more income taxes, less benefits to families. The middle class squeeze is real, and it needs to be addressed,\" Poilievre says.\n\nWhile the Conservatives have been saying for months that they would be cutting the tax incentive to children who are disabled, Poilievre says they have kept up the rhetoric.\n\n\"So we have now, apparently, a Liberal government now that's going to be taking money away from parents of kids under 18, not to mention their seniors, to pay for the promises we made to lower income people.\"\n\nBut he adds that the decision on the eligibility of those receiving the fitness tax credit was also a mistake.\n\nIn addition to the $3,300 deduction, the government is also expanding the Tax-Free Savings Account to allow the saving of up to $5,000 a year.\n\nIn the meantime, Poilievre is urging the prime minister to do more to help lower- and middle-income people.\n\n\"The reality is, what we need to be focused on is ensuring everybody who's on a fixed income, has their expenses covered is getting the support that they need; people who are struggling are going to have additional costs,\" says Poilievre.\n\nWhile Poilievre thinks the fitness tax credit was the wrong place for the government to be spending money, other Conservatives say the exemption is still worth it because it will help more people, including children.\n\nConservative MP Scott Reid called the exemption an \"important tool\" and argued that it had helped \"thousands of families\" and would continue to do so.\n\nConservative Leader Stephen Harper wants to raise taxes by $5.4 billion over the next two years in the 2013 election budget, including a tax increase on low and middle-income Canadians.",
      "The National Security Agency's spying program is \"worse than the Stasi,\" said Snowden, comparing himself to a whistleblower in post-Soviet Russia before he spoke at the National Press Club in Washington on Tuesday.\n\nIn June, Snowden became the world's most wanted man after the Guardian and The Washington Post revealed details of his revelations about U.S. surveillance programs. Since then, more than a dozen countries have launched investigations into the disclosures, which have led many to question the surveillance programs Snowden revealed, as well as the nation's ability to keep secrets without the use of secret services.\n\nThe former NSA contractor, who says he leaked information to help inform the public about security leaks, said he has a legal right to disclose the information and said the U.S. needs to be careful about collecting information and holding people accountable.\n\n\"Every one of Americans has a constitutional right to know that their government doesn't hold them indefinitely without charges or trial,\" he said. \"But it's not as important as it sounds. If the American people knew every time you picked up data from a foreign country, it's actually a dragnet of information, then they wouldn't consent.\"\n\nSnowden's comments were in stark contrast to those made by the U.S. government. The New York Times reported in May that the N.S.A. was collecting data from foreign allies with little to no oversight. The president's daily briefing notes to the public for the first two months of 2014 indicated that the N.S.A. was collecting phone and e-mail records of millions of Americans, but the briefing never explicitly disclosed the type of information the agency wanted from the foreign counterparts.\n\nOn Tuesday, Snowden said the N.S.A. was gathering the phone records in bulk and said the agency's collection of metadata was more widespread than previously understood. He added that most U.S. citizens didn't know this because \"when you sign up for cellphones or for internet-based services it's not always clear your data will be retained by a third party,\" which makes it harder for individuals who are on a certain list to know if there was an incident or suspicion that they were under surveillance.\n\nWhen he leaked the documents, Snowden said he believed that Americans had the right to know the details of what the government was doing with their personal data. The American public needs to know what the government is doing with the information because some countries, such as China, have the same surveillance systems, he said.",

      "The World is a strange and wonderful place; its peoples, religions and races are diverse, its climates and landscapes magnificent and diverse. Even the most powerful Empires and Empires of Science, like the Terran Confederacy and the Kingdom of Xibalba, and the most ancient races, the Eldar, have struggled to define their place in this diverse universe.\nThe Great Devourer, an ancient Warp entity that lurks in the Warp rift known as the Eye of Terror is not immune to this diversity.\nThe Eye of Terror was the site of many major civilisations and wars; The C'tan of Nurgle, the Orks of Slaanesh, the Eldar of Slaanesh, the Nagas of Tzeentch, the Necrons of Slaanesh, the Slann of the Necrontyr, the Orks of Khorne and the T'au of the Emperor's Children. The Great Devourer is said to have created many races and civilisations. It has the ability to create the life forms and worlds of different races, and so create different cultures.\nFor the Eldar, their homeworld of Calth is divided into six major domains: Anlec, Morna, Yarant, Kaledor, Qadira and Sotha. Each of these is a spiritual and cultural place that embodies a particular element of the Eldar culture.\nThe Warp is a place of vast and often unpredictable change and is often not well understood by mortal beings. It is the realm of the Warp Seers. The Eldar refer to this realm as the Shifting Wastes because of its changing and turbulent nature.\nAs an entity of Chaos, the Warp is a place of endless transformation. The energies of this Realm can be harnessed to create psychic constructs called Daemons that can change shape, attack and use their own power as weapons. The Eldar fear these powers, and the Warp is the source of the greatest fear for the Eldar civilisation.\nA Dark Eldar of the Way of the Warp\nThe Eldar fear the powers of the Warp, believing that within the Warp there is an ever shifting stream of Warp energy, which the Daemon Slaanesh is able to manipulate to produce Chaos entities such as Daemons and Warp entities.\nThe Eldar fear the powers of the Warp because of its capacity for changing, transforming and disrupting the flow of time throughout the universe. The Eldar believe this change and disruption makes the world a dangerous place, especially for those who cannot perceive it. In fact the Warp's ability to manipulate time and space can make the world seem to move in slow motion for a time, and sometimes even move backwards and forwards in time. Thus the Eldar are unable to perceive these changes. Therefore the Eldar believe in \"the way of the Warp\" wherein if they do not have a direct connection to the warp itself they can travel through its various foci and avoid the Warp's effects.\nThe Eldar are the most intelligent and the most adept in Warp travel, as a result they are also the most susceptible to the Warp's effects and thus more likely to fall victim to the Warp's shifting currents and to it's insidious influences. In other words the Eldar fear the ways of the warp because they perceive that such ways can make a world less safe for those who cannot perceive it, be it a young man or woman who is born in the prime of life, or an elder who never had to fear the perils of the Warp, as they always knew their destiny was clear from the beginning.\nThe Eldar also have a particular fear of the psychic forces within the Warp, which are described as a storm of powerful energies that emanate from its many foci, each of which is said to be a small area of the galaxy filled with energy more powerful than that of any other source. When such a psychic storm arises, it can have a powerful effect on a planet and as such the Eldar are aware that they must always have the capacity to protect their own homeworld and to ensure the safety of their people wherever they go. This is why the Eldar of Craftworld Ulthwé have no homeworld and their only place of residence is the Eye of Terror, and they only travel between these four Eldar homeworlds in times of need.\nThe Eldar are the most well-trained and disciplined of all the intelligent races known to the universe. When they first emerged from the darkness it was with so much more than they had on their feet. Even if they lived on the same planet they had to face a different kind of enemy than humans or robots. This is why they must always be ready to fight and defend themselves. This is why the Eldar of Craftworld Ulthwé have lost count of the times that the Eldar have been forced to fight alongside other intelligent races for protection against the threats of Chaos and the creatures that dwell in the Warp.\nEldar of the Dark City of Commorragh\nThe",

      "\n\"I feel like I'm living in a comic book.\" – The Voice of the Children\n\n\"That's the worst comic book ever made.\" – Comic Book Resources\n\n\"And I really hope it is.\" – New York Post\n\n\"It's like watching a bad version of the Avengers.\" – Entertainment Weekly\n\n\"I'm so sick of it. I feel like I'm living in a comic book.\" – Fox News\n\n\"There's this weird comic book in this book that I don't understand.\" – The New York Times\n\n\"I don't think that people have been more disappointed by the end of this book.\" – Entertainment Weekly\n\n\"Comic book movies are always a disappointment, they always end up as bad movies.\" – LA Times\n\n\"Why not just stick to superheroes?\" – The Hollywood Reporter\n\n\"It's an embarrassment. I mean, not even to the comic book people, because they will say it's just a comic book, but why is that kind of superhero movie being made?\" – Entertainment Weekly\n\nComic books make a fortune, but only because people love them. They need stories and people to create those stories. There is much to be proud of when it comes to comic book movies. They're all critically-acclaimed, and with good reason, but most of their success is built on what should not be there. Here are 10 reasons why comic book movies shouldn't be made.\n\n#1 – A comic is a piece of fiction.\n\nIn his book \"The Comics Art of Neal Adams,\" comic book master Neal Adams writes:\n\n\"A comic book is a piece of fiction. It is made up of words and pictures…What separates comics from other art form such as painting or dance is that the words are drawn on one-sided canvas that moves as the picture moves.\"\n\nIn essence, the words (written and spoken) are a part of a story, but they're not the story's characters and their actions are not the story's events. It's not quite accurate to say, but comics are a story telling medium, not a story telling medium/artist (writer). In other words, it's a story being told, not a story being told by a single artist.\n\n#2 – There isn't a story to tell in a comic book movie.\n\nFor the sake of argument, I'll define \"story\" as the sum of the events of the story told with each panel moving in a linear fashion. In that context, there is no story to tell in a movie about superheroes. They're characters that exist in comic books, and you wouldn't use the words \"story\" and \"superhero\" in the same sentence, would you?\n\nThe comics that make up this superhero world's greatest works may not be the greatest stories ever told: They may not even be very good stories (or stories that matter). But the characters, world, and stories that make these comics great are so good that they almost always make it into movie adaptations.\n\n#3 – They're for kids.\n\nLet's face it: This whole concept of a comic book movie being for kids may be true in the context of its current popularity (which is probably an extreme case), but it's not a valid reason for a movie to be made.\n\nIn the eyes of the powers that be, if they're not for kids, they're not for you, and if you're not for kids, you don't want a movie made about them. It may sound funny, but they're saying that it's okay for grown-ups to sit through a film in which kids get killed, but that it isn't okay for your kids to sit through it. It's like the movie \"Fantasy Island\" with its overtures to parents.\n\nLook to the world of the internet and you'll see that children are the most powerful demographic in pop culture. They're the kids who love superhero movies, and they're the kids who consume them: They are the most powerful. They are the ones who need to be watched in order to fully understand the characters and the world they live in.\n\n#4 – They're too violent.\n\nNo, really, this one deserves an entire column on its own: The idea that comic book movies are \"too violent\" is one of the few myths that still persists about comic books.\n\nIt's also dangerous. There are plenty of movies (and television shows) in our culture that are too violent and some, like Game of Thrones, are borderline pornographic. But there's no reason why a movie must be a piece of porn to be seen by an adolescent boy. There will always be young men who don't want to see violence on-screen, or who don't want to see the kinds of characters who live and die and fight and win and die on the big screen. And it's also worth remembering that it's not always the violence we",
      "The Department of Energy in the past has argued that wind and solar generate the least amounts of pollution when energy demands are highest, but the Energy Department's new research (PDF) shows a major shift of the argument that wind and solar are the lowest emitting energy sources, particularly in the US.\n\nAccording to the analysis, which was released yesterday, the most energy-intensive forms of electricity are still generated by coal-fired power plants, primarily burning coal with a relatively high carbon content. But renewables, and to a lesser extent nuclear and natural gas, do generate the highest amounts of energy-intense \"net energy\" or energy produced \"without emission,\" the new analysis reveals.\n\nA key factor in this is that the more energy-intensive wind or solar power generation is, the more the energy is produced without emission. When you factor in the fact that the coal is being burned inefficiently or not at all, the amount of energy consumed by the coal plants becomes more and more significant.\n\nIn fact, coal-fired power plants are actually a net power producer when total energy demands (i.e. total energy consumption) are considered. The coal plants actually produce more energy (and do not have to burn more coal), than the windpower or solar plants that are producing much more energy (and use very little fossil fuels).\n\nThis is especially important for power plants that are the most energy-intensive – they do not use coal or even oil to generate the electricity to be sold to electricity customers. The Energy Department researchers say that nuclear and natural gas may generate a higher amount of power than solar or wind from less energy-intensive operations because these plants do not use fossil fuels to generate the electricity when they generate it.\n\nThe report also indicates that solar power sources are responsible for an increase in the carbon content of the nation's air after accounting for energy intensity increases of renewables and efficiency. But the report's authors say the main factor determining carbon content is not wind or solar, but the increase in energy demand and electricity produced – not where the source of power is generated.\n\n\"Many people have argued for a century or more that electricity generated without emission would not exist,\" said Tom Paris, the senior researcher at the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as quoted in the report. \"That is no longer the case, and renewable energy technologies have changed the way energy is generated to provide reliable clean energy to consumers and businesses,\" he said.\n\nThe research was conducted by an interdisciplinary team whose work focused on the Department's Renewable Energy Sources Program. The report is a collaboration between the DOE's Oak Ridge National Laboratory, UC Berkeley and the University of Washington.\n\nTop image: A wind turbine at the Iowa State University's Ocomunn Beach wind farm.

      "It was around 6pm on a Friday evening and I was sitting at the kitchen table watching HBO and watching the show The Wire, that I got a phone call from my sister. She had heard a couple of people in our apartment building in the East Harlem neighborhood of New York being stabbed multiple times with a large knife.\n\nWe were both about ten minutes away from the scene. It was still pretty early, but if I wanted to spend any time in that part of the city I would be a complete mess. It was also around 12 years ago, so that meant that the stabbing was in my neighborhood, in front of my house. I was more than an hour out of town.\n\nI jumped in my car, drove three blocks, parked and began running to the scene. At first I thought that the police were being thorough, but then I saw a large body bag, a pile of bloody mattresses and a couple of bodies stacked next to them. Then I saw a couple of police cars pulling into the alley from the other side, which confirmed what I had previously thought: this was in my backyard.\n\nI was in denial; I was thinking: hey, there must be a mistake. I drove back to the scene and started looking for the guy who had stabbed people in my neighborhood. Then my sister heard the other people at the apartment in the building, yelling at the police. One of the cops had been stabbed in the neck, one in the hand, and three in the torso. None of the injuries appeared life threatening. I knew exactly what they meant. I saw one of the cops fall to the ground. I was scared. I rushed to help him up. Unfortunately his arm had been broken. I could see blood gushing from it like a fire hose. The police told me to come with them to another part of the apartment building, but I wasn't moving.\n\nI went to a neighbor's apartment on the first floor and asked her if I could use her phone to call my sister. She said yeah if I was nice to her. I had been really scared the whole time. There were also more victims.\n\nI heard gunshots and people were screaming. I knew I had to go help out. I ran up the stairwell to a second-floor apartment and knocked on the door. It was a really old building. People were moving furniture into the basement as people began to break into the apartment at the bottom and start breaking things. I broke down the door, entered the apartment and immediately saw a white male holding onto the girl who was in the bed with him.\n\nHe told me that this was a horrible idea, that he didn't want to stab anyone, but that someone had gotten stabbed with a large knife and someone was going to come help him. I told him to get back in the chair and take a deep breath of ammonia. Then I told him to turn around and look out the window. The two stairwells led to another apartment and I said:\n\n\"This floor has a lot of blood on the stairs, and in the kitchen, so I'll be back to pick up my sister and tell her to put some white cloths on her face.\"\n\nHe got up to leave and I said to him in Italian, \"We have a lot of blood. If you don't come back with me I'll find you, and I will kill you.\" He got on the phone and the other officer told him to take a deep breath of ammonia and leave.\n\nThey told me that the girl who was stabbed in her neck and hands had made it over the second floor and had been picked up by paramedics. She was in critical condition. I knew that something bad had happened immediately. I told him \"You don't have to go. It's okay,\" but he said:\n\n\"I know it's not okay. I can't take it back.\" I thought he was talking to me as if my sister had stabbed him in the neck. He couldn't take the stress, and he knew it too.\n\nI went over to the girl in the bed, who was crying. She said in English, \"They stabbed me.\" I told her \"We're really sorry. This is not your fault,\" and told her to tell everyone at the apartment what had happened. She was really scared. I looked at her and told her:\n\n\"Don't be afraid.\"\n\nI knew she was telling my sister how to look after her, and that I would be OK. I hugged her, told her God loved her and she was going to be okay, and told her to get better.\n\nAfter a minute we looked at each other and the girl said \"I love you so much\".\n\nThen I went inside my sister's apartment. I spent a little while talking to the police and talking to my sister, who was just as scared as me. As soon as they found out that I was from the apartment in the building with",
      "The New York City FC and Montreal Impact are just days away from hosting one of the most compelling rivalry games in the history of Major League Soccer.\n\nThe two clubs will square off on June 17th when NYCFC welcomes to Yankee Stadium their former coach and one of their most vocal supporters, Patrick Vieira. The Frenchman is currently in New York, following the completion of a six year, $200 million dollar deal with the team.\n\nVieira is widely regarded as one of the worst managers in MLS history, a fact that his former players are certain to try and put to rest as soon as possible. However, as is fitting for an already well-established rivalry, that may not be the only thing NYCFC and Vieira can use to distract from that fact.\n\nThe players of the New York City Football Club are not known for their subtlety, and with the way they're playing this year, Vieira might be more than happy to see the best out of his former players.\n\nTake, for instance, the performance of NYCFC defender Ethan White, who recently appeared on radio station Power 97 discussing Vieira's future with NYCFC.\n\n\"To be honest with you, I don't really know what he's going to do. I don't really know what sort of future he's going to have. He's not coming back. But the thing is, our manager has never really shown he knows how to treat me as like a man. So that's why I have to take advantage of that.\"\n\nEthan White is one of the most polarizing figures in the New York City FC history. Whether it was his reckless behavior on the field, his insubordination off it, or his inability to keep the ball off of a teammate's foot, the player's abrasive personality endeared him to New York City fans and made him one of MLS' all time great defenders, but that attitude never translated into consistent play on the pitch, leaving him at a distinct disadvantage compared to his teammates, and a potential problem for Vieira should NYCFC want to win in MLS.\n\n\"I think I can still win trophies. That would be nice. I think I can give that kind of support and that kind of confidence that I didn't always have when I was playing.\" — Ethan White, in an interview with Power 97.5\n\nWhether you agree with White's assessment of Vieira, or you think it's an overreaction based off of the fact that two former NYCFC players, David Villa and Andrea Pirlo, have already announced they are leaving the team in the summer, there's a strong argument to be made that Vieira's relationship with White may have been his undoing.\n\nA large reason Vieira left New York City to join NYCFC was to be reunited with the player whom he called \"the best player in world football.\" However, when the two parted ways, a rift grew among both parties that had been growing over the years, ultimately preventing Vieira from reestablishing himself with a New York soccer fan base he only wanted to remain with in the first place.\n\nWhile White had not made it clear his feelings about Vieira, at least not yet, he certainly had plenty to say about how the coach used him, and his current relationship with Vieira, in his recent interview with Power 97.5.\n\n\"He's been kind of, like, 'What am I doing here, Ethan?' or 'Why am I still here??' That's all he's ever done is 'Why am I still here?' You go, 'Well, I don't really know.' And like, what's gonna happen? It's disappointing. There's a lot of things that I haven't really been privy to because I didn't understand what was going on.\"\n\n\"I have so many things to be excited for that I'm going to feel really bad when we're losing and he's still not feeling me, even though he's like, 'I don't think I'll ever see you again until the offseason.' And I haven't received a Christmas card in six years, and I'm like, 'You know exactly what Christmas is?'\" — Ethan White\n\nA large reason Vieira left New York City to join NYCFC was to be reunited with the player whom he called \"the best player in world football.\" However, when the two parted ways, a rift grew among both parties that had been growing over the years, ultimately preventing Vieira from reestablishing himself with a New York soccer fan base he only wanted to remain with in the first place.\n\nWith Vieira leaving the league for a rival league, White is one of few who will be more than happy to make his way to the opposite team, not only to support Vieira through his time away from the Bronx, but to remind NYCFC they are not alone right now.\n\nWith both sides still in the thick of MLS playoff mode, NYCFC",
      "The first day of fall is upon us, so that means it's time to start figuring out which Halloween costumes you want to wear this year. Of course, Halloween is all about spooking people on Halloween night and creating a spooky atmosphere. But, you don't have to feel afraid of ghosts and goblins to put on a good Halloween costume. You just have to be sure you're selecting one that will actually help you out on the night or frighten your parents to death. After all, some of the more interesting costumes will also make for good conversation starters. Don't be afraid to play some tricks on your family or friends with your new Halloween costume, and enjoy your new-found knowledge of history and folklore. I guarantee that at least one of you will end up in a state of deep confusion when you get your head examined for a brain tumor later in the night.\n\n1. The Hunchbacked Witch\n\nThis costume will make you look like a truly crazy person on Halloween night, and a real witch lover, too. It's a good idea to spend a little extra on this costume, and if you are interested in learning more about witches, there are quite a few documentaries and documentaries to watch on Netflix or online. There are plenty of witches to be had as long as you get a few extras included in your costume.\n\n2. The Dark Lady on the Haunted Trail\n\nI have heard that having a big nose will make you seem more mysterious on Halloween night. So, take the time to choose a witch costume with a large nose. For a witch with a large nose, you'll need to dress her in a witch costume that makes her seem terrifying and sinister while her nose stays the size of a normal human face. I'll admit that a large nose can make her look a little freaky and scary, especially when she is in front of a scary ghost, but when the lights go off and everyone is screaming for her life, she can be very adorable and endearing!\n\n3. The Pirate Costume\n\nPirate costumes are perfect for people suffering from seasickness. No one wants a pirate on Halloween night, but you don't have to worry about the spooky side of the sea with this costume. Most people will think you're a cool, out-there individual that the whole town will want to know, and you'll be sure to get a lot of likes and likes on Facebook. I think the pirate costume will make anyone feel just as brave as a pirate himself.\n\n4. The Old Woman and the Undead\n\n\nHave you ever looked in the mirror and thought to yourself that you look exactly like every zombie movie that you can see in your mind's eye? How about the zombie movies that you know are going to happen on Halloween night? No, I didn't think so! Not only are zombies and other undead really scary and creepy, they are also really cool for conversation starters and scary moments on Halloween night, as a result. Everyone is going to be impressed by your ability to talk sense into zombies when you wear this zombie costume.\n\n5. The Zombie\n\nWearing a zombie costume on Halloween can make you look more alive and more \"tough and mean\" on the night, as opposed to the kind of zombie that comes out at night and slowly eats the living. If you're willing to get your hands dirty, go for the zombie costume.\n\n6. The Phantom of the Masquerade\n\n\nIf you're a big fan of the Halloween Horror Nights tour during the fall, make sure to watch part of the event in real life. You won't be walking around that night going, \"Oh, I'm going to the Halloween Horror Nights event at midnight, no one is going to know I'm there, I'm going to die.\" That's not going to happen with your regular costume. Halloween costumes are supposed to be different for each person.\n\n7. The Monster of the Week\n\n\nNo matter what your interests and interests are as a person, you can always choose a costume that is meant to scare you. That will help get you noticed and get you attention. For example, this Halloween costume could be a costume if you want to scare kids. Or, it could be a costume to scare women at Halloween parties. Or, if you wear an outfit like the Phantom of the Masquerade costume, you'll have a great scare for the whole crowd!\n\n8. The Skeleton\n\n\nI'm a big fan of scary people, and one of the things that make scary people scary are skeletons. Skeletons scare me more than any other person, simply because I know how they are supposed to look with their head down on their feet and that they can look scary. It should be noted that this costume will probably be popular with women and children, because the skeletons in Halloween movies are female skeletons.\n\n9. The Werewolf\n\n\nIt's true that a zombie is scary enough to scare people, but what about a werewolf? I",

      "Kissing the Ground\n\nIn the summer after my junior year in high school, a friend asked if I would teach a summer program for \"nonconventional\" students so they could have an alternative to the traditional public school program. She didn't know that our school had been the only in our neighborhood to embrace religious education and the concept of \"special rights\" for all students.\n\nWith my wife and me, we started a Christian college on a campus surrounded on three sides by public schools. It was a small, mostly nondenominational school with a diverse student body.\n\nThe idea was that after graduation, these students would be free to do whatever they wanted, as they saw fit. We made it the \"new Normal\" in West Oakland. We welcomed students from different cultures, religions, and sexual identities, and we encouraged nonconventional thinking, and the ability to question conventional wisdom — the \"conventional wisdom\" being the school of faith.\n\nWhen word of this program got out, one local parent wrote a letter to the editor that described how, after his son was bullied, he decided to stay home while he tried to \"do something proactive\" to reduce bullying. However, he was still bullied, and it was a matter of days before he realized that he had to leave the campus. He wrote: \"The school wants to 'deal with any students who may cause problems or have behaviors that are disruptive.' I felt very uncomfortable with this description of how a small private college in an affluent, and very liberal suburb can be a leader on bullying issues, no matter what the reason.\n\n\"And I don't know how anyone can describe the college as a safe place for nonconventional students.\"\n\nThe letter went viral. The local newspaper ran an article about a small town where the \"no-bullying\" policy was actually a \"no-conventional-thinking\" policy. Some parents expressed their unease with the school, and some even threatened to pull their own children from the school. (Some parents did not pull their children and others did not take their children when they were accepted.)\n\nAfter that, it became common for students to show up at the school's office to report a threat, or to see anti-bullying teachers. One student approached the school's head of administration about the anti-bullying training he received as well, and complained that the school had trained only in \"conventional school discipline.\" The administration eventually backed off from his idea of a \"bullyproof\" environment, and, in general, the school was much more sensitive to the fact that any student, any time, was not safe, especially at school.\n\nThis experience is emblematic of how, even in a liberal place like Silicon Valley, students are increasingly turning to a \"school of religion\" for guidance and accountability.\n\nThe school's motto was actually inspired by the Bible. Students would sing at morning and afternoon assemblies, \"Jesus, Mary, Joseph, and the angels are here . . . God works in mysterious ways.\" There was a chapel, and two \"sacred spaces\" — the \"new norm,\" and the \"new normal.\" There were \"spiritual education\" programs, and a youth ministry. Students wrote their own Bibles, and many of their prayers were written for them by fellow students. They met weekly, and the school organized prayer support groups. They took classes such as \"Christian Ethics\" and \"Christian Thought.\" And, yes, they learned about God.\n\nAnd, yes, they learned about evolution and how it clashed with some Christian teachings about the earth and God's \"law of creation.\"\n\nThe school's board of directors is full of evangelical Christians. The principal is from a fundamentalist church. Some employees are evangelical Christians or Mormons or both. The school is supported by two pastors.\n\nMany parents told me that when they spoke to their children about being nonconventional (as in, gender-transitioning), they were met with hostility.\n\n\"For instance, a very young student, about 9 years old, wanted to be the gender-neutral 'boy' for Halloween, and his mother, who wanted to be the girl 'kid,' was not OK with that because her 'boy' children dressed as the 'girls,' too,\" one parent wrote in an email. \"It got to the point where she had him wear a 'stereotypical girl' dress and he would be the only boy in the entire school.\"\n\nThe school also had \"café-table events\" where adults and children alike could discuss issues such as \"sex before marriage.\" (The school's curriculum says that sex is a \"choice,\" which is a \"false belief.\") Students were encouraged to write about their own gender, or gender-variance issues, and to share their stories with each other.\n\nFor students who were struggling with gender issues that didn't match their assigned gender, the school's ministry offered online courses, such",
      "If the past year was defined by one thing: a new generation of high school football programs using the power of social media, the next 10 years would be defined by another: a new wave of college football programs creating, monetizing, and marketing video.\n\nFrom the SEC to the ACC, from conferences like the Big Ten and those in the Sun Belt that have recently added their own conference-wide video initiatives, from the new wave of conferences that have made video a priority and want to establish a foothold on Twitter and Facebook to the old guard of conferences with established video strategies, here are five new strategies that college football's marketing executives in the next 10 years will adopt to market video during football.\n\n1. Create an all-encompassing, branded social media presence on platforms not directly linked to football.\n\nThe conference platforms: Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, YouTube, and others. If you don't have or intend to set up your own social media presence, the conference platforms are the best place to start. Each conference uses its social media platforms to engage with their fans and fans from rival schools – and not just the fans of their traditional rivals they will be competing with.\n\nFor example, every SEC football program has, at best, a \"fan\" page on either Twitter or YouTube. Most SEC conference staff also have a Facebook account or Twitter handle. So, for all SEC programs, this platform should be your social media headquarters for college football.\n\n2. Develop a video presence on these platforms, along with a well-developed Facebook presence for recruiting.\n\nIf not your social media platform, establish one first. Set up Facebook or Twitter profiles and set up links to videos and photos that reflect your brand identity. This creates a one-stop platform for recruiters to go to get information about recruiting programs across all social media platforms and also gives you an opportunity to post images from your season with the video.\n\nThe Facebook account is a little harder to get started with, but it can be worth it if you set it up with your favorite football player, player manager, or staff, and you have a strong fan following, or if you're a small school that doesn't have an NFL coach, who wants to share updates of your coaches throughout the season on your Facebook page.\n\nThe Instagram account can be a little tougher – it's harder to get a handle on who is posting their pictures or videos to your account than it is to get a handle on the Instagram profiles of your other football players or staff – but it's also a good idea to start posting pics of recruiting to both your Facebook and Instagram page. The challenge here is to find people who have played your program and who have already liked your football photo or video.\n\nThe YouTube account isn't always necessary, though they are a good place to get some good videos and images, as well as to get started with marketing programs such as the Rivals.com recruiting series.\n\n3. Create an online presence within these platforms.\n\nSet up an online presence on Twitter with regular tweets and Facebook posts. The social media accounts, of course, should show your best product of the season.\n\nIn addition to using social media to promote your business, you can also use social media to help recruits and fans stay up-to-date on recruiting and upcoming games. Use your Twitter account to interact with fans; post photos and videos of recruits; check recruiting stories at Rivals.com and other sports stories you will find on other sports sites.\n\nOn Facebook, keep your fans up-to-date on recruiting news with your official page; post recruits' photos and videos; interact with fan pages; and keep tabs on the latest headlines at Rivals.com.\n\nThe Instagram account is also an effective form of recruitment-related advertising; if you have a number of kids who all have Instagram accounts and some are active, you could post photos from your recruitment, such as photos of recruits during practice; photos of the players who have committed, and photos of players who have already pledged, at a time and in a manner that aligns with popular recruiting trends.\n\n4. Create a video program for recruiting and engagement on Twitter.\n\nUsing these four channels to promote recruitment, fans of a football program can follow you on Twitter, visit them on Instagram, and/or engage with them on Facebook to receive updates. In order to accomplish this, each recruiter must be involved in each of these platforms.\n\nWhile it's best to have multiple recruits and a representative from each program involved in each of these areas, it's also a great way to leverage Twitter. If you follow at least two of your top recruits, you could set up a post, as I did, to show fans of both schools that they had been following, in the case of Auburn, both of Nick Marshall and Peyton Barber. There isn't a lot else to say about this tactic. The goal is to find and follow multiple recruits and get as many",
      "A small group of anti-abortion protesters, some wearing black masks and carrying signs like \"God hates abortion,\" stood outside the University of California at Berkeley's Sproul Plaza on Monday demanding a campus speaking event on abortion by late August.\n\nU. of California Berkeley Students for Life group spokeswoman Kayla Whaling told the Berkeley Press Democrat that the group chose U. of California Berkeley as the venue of the demonstration because student groups have the power to block free speech when they become too vocal.\n\nAccording to the Berkeley Press Democrat, Berkeley Students for Life's goal is to \"shut down the speaker and force a debate on abortion.\"\n\nOn its website, the group says it wants to \"keep abortion access off campus for the foreseeable future\" because \"many individuals will be forced to travel to other campuses to access their abortion care.\"\n\nThe group has said it wants to prevent abortion from happening due to \"the immoral nature of sex selection abortion. Women who abort are hurting the cause they claim to have loved most in their lives.\"\n\n\"Abortion advocates use all sorts of tactics by which they attempt to restrict access and increase the number of abortions,\" the group's website states. \"We are fighting this battle as well.\"\n\nThe Berkeley Students for Life group said Monday it has been \"very supportive of our campus' and the students' efforts to have an abortion-related speakers come to campus.\" However, the Berkeley Students for Life group said it is not asking the students at UC Berkeley to support abortion.\n\nThe students' spokesman pointed out that it's up to the students at UC Berkeley to decide whether they \"like\" or \"dislike\" a speaker, and a decision about which speakers to choose is up to them.\n\nThe protest group was met by the protesters shortly before 2:30 p.m., but by the time it had reached the door of Sproul Plaza, the groups had begun fighting. At one point, there were seven groups of protesters standing side by side with three police cars and one ambulance nearby.\n\nIt was not immediately clear what sparked the violence or how many people were involved. Video from Berkeley Police Department shows one man being led away on a stretcher.\n\nFollow Adelle Nazarian on Twitter @AdelleNaz and on Facebook.",
      "The story of the \"Skeletons\" and the \"Witch House\" has always captured an interest amongst fans of Horror fiction.\n\nThe story of the \"Skeletons\" and the \"Witch House\" has always captured an interest amongst fans of Horror fiction. They are an interesting, terrifying bunch. Some of their more famous stories were told in \"The Haunting of Hill House\", \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\", \"Rose Edith\", as well as on classic and indie horror short-stories anthologies.\n\nThe most famous story is of course \"The Skeleton\"\n\nThis is the story of the four \"Skeletons\". A ghost family. A house that is haunted by the spirit of an earlier occupant who died and left behind a skeleton. The spirits haunt the house as well.\n\nThis unique story was first printed in the July, 1919 issue of The Haunted Mansion Magazine.\n\nIn this one story, a new house is built. Two skeletons, John and Edith, move into the house. Each have different personalities. Edith is more outgoing, lively, and not at all scared of the new house. John is rather serious and has a hard time interacting with his new neighbors. The skeleton family lives peacefully in the new house for a while. Then one night, the house is discovered to be haunted. And what's more interesting is when the house starts to act weird. The ghost haunting the house does not seem to be anything human but is more similar to a real thing than can be explained by man.\n\nThis haunted house story gets more and more dark. It becomes more and more supernatural. We are left thinking that these bones are not just ghost but something truly evil.\n\nThe Skeleton\n\n\"The Skeleton\" is by far the most popular story related to the Skeleton family and is actually the only true story in which the skeletons act more like ghosts than anything else. This story has been adapted in a variety of ways and has been used in various adaptations of Horror movies and short horror stories such as John Carpenter's Halloween, The Grudge, Saw, The Amityville Horror, and The Haunting of Hill House.\n\nThe reason I chose this ghost story is due to the fact that it features the skeletons as humans and they are not just skeletons in a house.\n\nIf you are interested in the background story of the movie Halloween you can catch a good review on Reddit by a fellow CreepyPasta member.\n\nHowever, at the end we will not cover the plot of the movie. It is actually a pretty awesome movie and I suggest you see it. A lot of the characters, like the kid and his mom, are well-written and make sense, as well as some of the supporting characters that you have to listen to.\n\nI have tried to get at least 10 minutes here talking about the story. So I am leaving out some of the most notable events, but I hope you enjoy reading about the Skeleton family and their adventures and horrors.\n\nIf you are more interested in reading the full book than the movie, they have a version available to download here.\n\nIt is available in a lot of different formats, so I recommend you read in the appropriate ebook formats.\n\nThe movie will definitely help you to identify the story better, though.\n\nI will post some other ghost stories and Halloween related posts in the future.\n\nAdvertisements",
      "The New York City Police Department has \"a duty to protect the integrity, neutrality and equality of the City of New York,\" but its officers are being punished for doing the right thing and speaking out against police brutality, an American Civil Liberties Union report found .\n\nThe report, \" The report, \" \" NYPD's Culture of Denial ,\" says that \"NYPD officers who come forward with information about police abuse or wrong-doing have been punished.\" A key element of the document, which was produced under the authority of U.S. Assistant Attorney General Lanny Breuer, is a list of examples of alleged retaliation against police officers.\n\nThe NYPD's culture of denial is just the latest example of the institutional racism that plagues the agency, writes the authors, who cite many of the same data the city has been using to monitor and reform its police practice.\n\nOne example cited is the recent incident that involved the beating of Akai Gurley, the unarmed, mentally ill man who was killed in an apparent police action.\n\nGurley had allegedly broken down in an elevator and attacked an officer who had arrested him. When the officer, Joseph Weekley, tried to stop him, Gurley reportedly resisted — until another officer pulled up and started beating Gurley.\n\n\"We are deeply troubled by the allegations of an officer beating an innocent, disabled man who had done nothing to get himself in such a bad position,\" New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio said in an official statement on Wednesday, the Associated Press reports. The mayor added that Weekley's \"bias and biaslessness toward the African-American community\" are unacceptable.\n\nHowever, the Times reports that the video of the incident, obtained through a public records request by several news outlets — including the NYCLU — shows Gurley being knocked on the ground and then allegedly beaten repeatedly by the NYPD. The report concludes there is a \"substantial possibility that [Weekley] was criminally negligent and violated New York's criminal code.\"\n\nThe Times writes that the \"evidence that some officers were engaging in a 'culture of denial' or 'denial of misconduct' was cited by more than 80 witnesses to the department and its internal affairs division, who claimed that their reports were being rejected, ignored, or downgraded to 'unsatisfactory' status.\"\n\nAnother example cited by the NYT describes how, in a 2012 incident in Brooklyn's Prospect Park, officers shot to death a mentally ill man. In that incident, the officer who called the police to investigate claims that the man was running towards him with a knife, later admitted that \"he had not given the suspect verbal instructions to drop the knife, had no knowledge of the victim's history, and had no reasonable grounds to suspect that the man posed a threat to him.\"\n\nAccording to the Times, \"the officers who fired the shots have not been disciplined, but they say they 'felt overwhelmed, intimidated, and under pressure' by the situation so they opened fire in self-defense.\"\n\nAnother common trait, according to the newspaper, which includes many of the same data the city police department has been using since 2010, is that the NYPD's \"officer misconduct rate, which is also referred to as 'officer per 1,000' or 'officer ratio,' is 1 in 3.\" The Times reports that the NYPD's rate is far higher than the country's average of about 1 in 13.\n\n\"If New York City had a 'zero tolerance' policy for officers who abuse civilians, this would be a disaster,\" said NYCLU executive director Donna Lieberman. \"The New York Police Department, which now requires its officers to report every use of force every day, cannot continue a policy of police denial, where officers lie and conceal what they know is wrong. The police have a moral and legal responsibility to tell the truth about what happened.\"\n\nIn one especially egregious incident, cops have been caught lying about the shooting of Amadou Diallo, a black immigrant who was shot and killed by the NYPD in 1999. In order to ensure accuracy in their reports — a practice known euphemistically among cops as \"reporting to the scene\" — a cop named Patrick Lynch told investigators that he \"saw nothing but the floor and ceiling in the apartment for a very short period of time,\" before he \"heard two gunshots and 'froze' as if he fell.\" He also lied about seeing a \"liquor bottle\" being thrown to the floor, as if he had seen an object, and about the sound a gunshot made. In reality, Diallo was shot in the back.\n\nBut this \"culture of denial\" doesn't just target police officers. As the NYT notes, a 2007 survey found that only 28 percent of police officers had reported crimes to police by the end of the previous year, compared to 44 percent of civilians.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images",

      "The Department of Justice announced on Thursday that a federal grand jury indicted the owner of a pizza parlor in Florida on charges of tax evasion, money laundering, extortion and racketeering, and that the man owns 30 other businesses. A civil court filing last week revealed that the owner of Papa John's and other related entities declared $5,000 in profits in the 2014 tax year.\n\nAccording to the civil complaint against David Green, he failed to report over $40,000 in taxable income. He is also accused of failing to properly file and record personal and business income for 2012 and 2013 and failing to comply with certain tax reporting provisions.\n\nThe department said Green's employees made payments to his employees, his own personal employees, friends, and even fellow pizza parlor owners for \"pizza.\"\n\nThe Department of Justice also alleges that Green misappropriated hundreds of thousands of dollars, including $15,500 the day after President Obama was re-elected. He also allegedly stole more than $5,000 in 2014 from a company that employed him for over two decades.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe filing also revealed that Green allegedly used his business to benefit a number of well-known political figures. He allegedly benefited Florida Rep. Ted Deutch, who is known to be friendly with Green's business friends. Green paid a $1,000 gift card to Deutch in December 2014, the same month the congressman announced that he would be running for the Florida State Senate. Deutch is also the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.\n\nA statement released by Deutch's lawyer said that his client was not a target of the indictment. \"Papa John's, like all American companies, pays its taxes, and follows the law,\" said Michael Mershon, Deutch's attorney. \"As the matter is currently being adjudicated, we have no further comment.\" Deutch is expected to make a statement later on Thursday.\n\nGreen's arrest has prompted calls for a boycott of the pizza chain.

Hydraulic fracturing generates pressure that may cause natural gas to move from shale into more easily accessible aquifers,\" the report says.\n\n\"A major concern is groundwater contamination from the combination of the movement of the gas and the production process used to fracture the shale rock. Methane or hydrocarbons released during the injection process could migrate into surface and ground water.\"\n\nAt a press conference, Army Secretary Mike Michaud said that while the report does not recommend how the Army Corps should approach its task, \"the report can be used to strengthen our national regulatory structure\" in regulating fracking.\n\n\"I would love for the government to adopt some sort of model [of regulation],\" he said. \"There has been an enormous amount of misinformation.

They're not going to get it all at the same time. But they're getting the information they need.\"\n\nThe study notes that there is \"evidence of potential water contamination from low-volume hydraulic fracturing operations with a total volume of fluids in the range of thousands of gallons per well,\" and says that an EPA study of well impacts may provide data about these operations.\n\nAccording to Michaud, the Army Corps report should have \"a positive impact on the health of people in Louisiana. . . .

      "\"The man who brought the world the most famous TV show of modern times has been jailed for 20 months for his part in the £1.7 billion fraud.\n\nThe jury at the Old Bailey found David Irving guilty of four counts of conspiracy to defraud between January 2002 and December 2008, all involving Britain Telecom customers, BBC Panorama and the City of London.\n\nIrving, 70, was convicted of three counts of conspiracy to defraud and three of false accounting, the last after his co-conspirators gave evidence against him.\n\nThe judge said it was \"difficult to imagine a more serious series of offences\". In all, Irving's defence claimed he was the victim of a long-running conspiracy against him when, in reality, he had been an active participant for many years.\n\nProsecutor Richard Humphrys, said Irving was one of the most powerful, prolific and successful tax evaders known to the security world in the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nMr Humphrys added that Irving had carried out \"the most sophisticated attempt to conceal his finances on Earth\".\n\nHe was involved in two of the biggest and most complex tax frauds in history.\n\nFrom January through to December 2002, he led a conspiracy to make fraudulently obtained cash payments to 1,400 UK Telecom customers between 1994 and 1998. Irving was also responsible for the theft of millions of pounds in cash, corporate bank accounts, CDs and other valuables from the company.\n\nThe vast scale of the fraud was partly enabled by his close relationship with the head of Britain Telecom Group, Brian Martin, and the fact he was one of Britain's richest men.\n\nThe evidence given against Irving in the trial was compelling.\n\nIn the early 1990s Irving took part in a fraud by a private consortium of companies which caused £2.5 billion of damage. This was the so-called \"crash programme\" by an Austrian businessman who ran two companies: SGS and SONZ.\n\nIrving's SONZ had helped develop the SGS technology which enabled computers to access telephone systems to help make landline calls by making small adjustments to the sound that people heard and therefore costing them less than if they were using their own telephone systems.\n\nIrving also helped develop the technology which enabled British Telecom phones to connect to international mobile phone systems via satellite. This enabled AT&T to make more calls in Britain at a lower cost and thus pay the same tax as the big firms did in Ireland.\n\nThe jury heard that in the early 1990s it became clear that Irving's UK-based company was the biggest contributor and beneficiary of SGS and SONZ.\n\nEvidence indicated that, although he had no financial interest in the companies at that time, that was unlikely to have stopped him having a \"passive, beneficial and influential\" role.\n\nThe conspiracy resulted in £1.7 billion in tax being dodged in the years 1998, 1999 and 2000 when Irving claimed he was unable to access his accounts because of his ill health.\n\n\"At a time when he was unable to make his money back and was in the grip of ill-health, he was engaged in a conspiracy to steal from the British taxpayer and take the money for himself on the backs of the victims,\" said Mr Humphrys.\n\nThis trial had been taking place for five years prior. In the two days of the verdict, around 100 jurors heard evidence from around 300 witnesses. They were told that the fraud, dating back to at least 1994, was perpetrated in a wide variety of ways including by the so-called \"courier\" companies which received £500 million a month of payments made by UK Telecom.\n\nDavid Irving is understood to hold more than 250 shares in UK Telecom.\n\nThe judge said it was \"a shocking trial which, like many others before it, should not be allowed to go ahead on the basis of Mr Irving's claims that he was in the dark\".\n\nIrving's family did not attend the sentencing. A statement from his solicitor, Graham Lewis, read: \"My client accepts the verdicts and is thankful to the jury for all their hard work and deliberation. He has paid a considerable price for his actions in this trial but his actions are not a criminal matter.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for the UK Telecom network of companies, which includes BP and AstraZeneca, said the company \"will await the outcome of the trial\" but that it \"remains committed to tackling tax evasion in all its forms\".",

Though described as an action-adventure show, the crew of the Serenity frequently finds themselves in conflict with the governments of Earth and Mars in an increasingly complex war over the \"Yellow Cake of Doom\" - a precious resource found on a distant planet.\n\nFandom\n\nThe series' popularity with the general audience has led to it being listed on several online databases such as TV Tropes; however, the series has been criticized for its portrayal of the women on the crew, particularly the females of colour, as being portrayed for the first time in such a way in the series, the first episode of the series, and its sequels. In particular, it was criticized for its treatment of Dr. Bryson, a black male who had been the ship's doctor and had become an ally to the female main characters, and later husband and father to the family's third member, Zoe. The series was also criticized for portraying a black man as the crew's leader, the Captain Mal Reynolds from the previous series' series, despite Serenity's captain being a white woman, and for giving the captain-of-the-covenant character the ability to turn people into a race of creatures known as the \"space slugs\", despite in the later episodes, he did not use this power, and instead only showed his powers in the aftermath of their defeat.\n\nIn recent years, the series' status as a cult classic among sci-fi devotees has begun to give the series itself its own fanbase, who tend to enjoy both the episodic story-telling and the unique portrayal of character. Due to criticism that the series' depiction of racism and gender roles were outdated, and that gender roles in a utopian society had been left out, the writers of the show have made attempts to revise many of its themes and depictions at different points in the show's run. For example, the gender roles of the female members of Serenity's crew are now much more in tune with contemporary society and are treated more with the usual gendered stereotypes and tropes that characterize sci-fi and fantasy movies and shows at the time the series was created. The gender roles of Jack, Mal, and Zoe have also been changed considerably. Due to the changes the writers made, Serenity's fans have created a sub-community known as \"Bros4Serenity\", which includes a collection of fanfiction and fanart based around many of the changes made to the series. The series also spawned four spin-offs: Serenity, Serenity: The Movie, Serenity: From Fear, and Serenity: Part 1. Serenity: Season Two, a prequel to the series, aired in 2010 and focused on the events after the original season finale. Season three, which was the first of the four series produced, debuted in late 2013, focusing on the crew of Serenity trying to escape from a newly discovered planet, before settling and founding an off-the-Earth colony on a former penal colony on Earth. Season four began airing in early 2016, focusing once again on the escape of Serenity from a planet with dangerous creatures called the \"red slugs\", which took it into uncharted space with the help of the former prisoners of the penal colony. Serenity: Homecoming, a sequel to Season Three, was announced in 2016 for release in April 2018 and aired in May 2018.\n\nFirefly: Serenity & Serenity II followed Serenity's crew of five, featuring the re-established role of Dr. Henry Hayes (James Franciscus, who played Hank Hall in Seasons 1-3), and a female lead character, the former Captain Carol Barnes (Linda Hamilton, who had played Lieutenant Lula Mae Daniels in seasons 1-3). The series follows the crew's adventures after the apparent destruction of the Serenity. Season Two saw the appearance of the third companion",

      "By By Tim Sandle Sep 24, 2015 in Technology It's a story that has been told for eons, but the mystery of the last of the \"Golden Age\" radio transmissions from Germany still has no tangible solutions. The signal, known to scientists as the \"Doppler Shift,\" was a vital and historic message to Allied soldiers. After the end of World War II, German authorities refused to allow the transmissions to be listened to. But for years, some historians believed it would be possible to decode it. The \"Doppler Shift\" is a frequency shift which has been known since the early 20th century. It was a technique to send a radio signal at a frequency that was slightly shifted in space when the radio wave travelled across it, hence the name Doppler Shift. In the 1930s the Doppler shift became part of the radio industry when the government mandated that commercial radio stations be set to this shifting. It was necessary as the signal from a car radio has a higher frequency than that of a telephone, causing a frequency shift. The Doppler Shift was a critical part of wartime communication as it allowed the Allies to see through the German line. In 1944, the Allies finally succeeded in decoding the signals sent from the Allies in the field. The secret of the Doppler shift was passed to the US government and to Israel, where it was used to create a second code, known as the \"Israeli Code,\" which became much more secure. After the Allies were defeated at the end of the war, the Doppler Shift was taken back from German authorities. However, since the Allies knew the frequency shift, it was possible to break this code through the use of modern digital signal processing. It also meant that the \"Doppler Shift Message\" would be heard as a noise or a glitch in the code. But over thirty years after it was discovered, this information has still not been cracked. It's the latest In September 2014, an artist's rendering of the final transmissions from the \"Doppler Shift Experiment,\" a secret wartime code that was discovered in the late 1940s, and which was thought to have been cracked by the Allies in the late 1960s, and which is widely considered to be one of the most significant military cryptologic efforts in history. The discovery of this military cryptologic code was made by physicists, and is widely regarded as the top military code breaking work of the Cold War. However, it is still considered to be one of the most complex codes ever cracked. For a history of other Doppler Shift transmissions, see the history of the signals from the \"Doppler Shift Experiment\" There, after the Allies won the war, a \"Doppler Shift Message\" was sent back to soldiers stationed in Germany in 1944. The message explained that those not able at the time to transmit the signal, or who died while doing so, would receive the message, which read: \"There you are. I am at your side, waiting for you. I am with you. The sky is blue, you are alive.\"The secret of the Doppler Shift was passed to the US government and to Israel, where it was used to create a second code, known as the \"Israeli Code,\" which became much more secure. After the Allies were defeated at the end of the war, the Doppler Shift was taken back from German authorities. However, since the Allies knew the frequency shift, it was possible to break this code through the use of modern digital signal processing. It also meant that the \"Doppler Shift Message\" would be heard as a noise or a glitch in the code.But over thirty years after it was discovered, this information has still not been cracked. It's the latest revelation on a missing page in one of the most widely known mysteries of a century of German intelligence operations. In August 2014, a journalist investigating the Doppler Shift transmissions published a claim that the transmissions are the result of a computer glitch, and that those who decode them will be hearing \"a crackling or a beeping sound that is not audible any other way.\" The journalist went on to say the Doppler Shift transmissions will be broadcast in a few weeks time.If the Doppler Shift messages are in fact not what they appear to be, this would also mean that the world's most secure signals are missing from the collection of the NSA, Britain's Government Communications Headquarters, and Israel. So this would also mean that, all these years later, no one has been able to decode them, which still means they could still help us determine what happened in the Middle East during World War II.

      "In November last year, a 16-year-old girl was taken off life support after she had been diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, an incurable and incurable disease; the girl, whose first name in the documents was 'Hana,' was to leave this life after four days. It was a sad end to one of Australia's most famous transgender women. And in the end, Hana's name may not have helped her. Her parents are fighting for their daughter's right to decide her own name.\n\nThis is an amazing story of an Australian teenager fighting to survive with a terminal disease who became involved in an international debate on transgender rights. But her story is now in danger. Hana's father has been told by doctors that they no longer consider her a competent enough human being to decide what to name her; the doctors have advised the Australian government not to help fund Hana's life-support treatment — Hana's family says that would violate international law.\n\nWe should be all proud that Hana is alive, even if it appears that her name has become an issue. There have been numerous transgender people in Australia in recent years, all of them facing different challenges, some of whom are dying and others only barely living. It's a difficult thing to live with — and it seems that most of us don't want to take part in the discussion, in the conversation, or in the fight for transgender rights or support for those fighting cancer.\n\nThis is the moment to speak and act so that no others face a similar ordeal to Hana's.\n\nHana has been with her parents, Gev and Vevle, in Sydney, since she was a toddler — the family was so desperate to save her life she was moved to Melbourne in 2016 — and since the Australian government changed the law in this way, the family has been fighting to keep her health care as simple as possible. The state of Victoria has already given them nearly $1 million to get Hana treated but still they have to navigate the Australian law and government bureaucracy to raise money for her care.\n\nHana's name is, in our opinion, a clear attempt to hijack her body in the name of a trans identity. That's what our own culture is doing every day. Take the recent cases of the transgender celebrity Laverne Cox and Caitlyn Jenner. Transgender people have been using their bodies in public and private since the dawn of time, so it should be a natural part of being who we are. But that doesn't mean we should be using our bodies as an excuse for our identity. I think we should all be able to choose our name, or our gender and sexual orientation, or our birth date, and it should be our choice to take or not take care of ourselves. This is for our own good and for the health of our society — not because we think it will make us more attractive for the attention of men and women.\n\nIf we don't speak out against transgender individuals, we are allowing the use of this issue as a way to undermine the trans rights struggle. Instead, let's call for an end to transgender surgery; let's end the pressure for young children to undergo genital surgery; let's end the shaming and bullying — even when there is no physical reason — of trans people. And most importantly, let's support the transgender community so people can start living their lives — without the constant threat of surgery, being labeled a cross-dresser and violence, even death.\n\nIt also seems that Hana and her family do not realize — and perhaps their lack of understanding has something to do with their lack of action — the difference between a name and a gender. If Hana was female, she would have been known before we knew Hana's identity — her parents would have known her as a girl. So why do people insist on keeping her identity a secret?\n\nAnd if Hana's parents want to give their daughter her name, Hana has been asking for it for some time and has clearly expressed her wishes that she would keep it. So why are they pushing for her name to be changed? The answer seems clear: To deprive Hana's mother access to what's probably an enormous amount of money. They have no idea what will happen after a few days of Hana not surviving her treatment. If her name is changed, it may end up costing Hana's parents thousands of dollars.\n\nWhile I'm very proud of the fact that people have started to question the transgender identity issue, some of us need to say that we're sorry that it became so controversial. In the past few years, there have been suicides and deaths of transgender children — it's just heartbreaking and heartbreaking to think that the same conversation we were having in 2013-2014 may end up with transgender individuals dying because trans activists got together and decided what name to give them.\n\nWe need to look at this as a movement that could do us all a great deal of good. And that's why we need to",
      "How to use the new M1A1 Abrams tank\n\nUpdated, 21 October 2014 - Revised to include details at the end of the article on how you could use this in modding.\n\nThe A1V-5 is the new M1A1 tank in the T-72 family (including the \"M1\" and \"M1A1\").\n\nIn many games, the M1A1 is a simple copy of the T-72, except the turret was changed from the T-54 to the T-72's, and had a different gun.\n\nHowever, when you start playing World of Tanks (the real one, not the Russian mod of Warcraft 3), you realize it was a very smart move to do this. The original reason for the conversion was to help in Russian tank recruitment. It would be the only Soviet tank in a major video game made of authentic parts that didn't come from the real one. A tank that was supposed to be \"boring\" had to have a lot of fan service injected into it. However, it could still be used in Wargaming's real games.\n\nIt could only be put into the real World of Tanks if the original creator (Miklas Smedberg, of Red Storm) and developers (Wargaming) agree that you can do so.\n\nYou can use any of the M1A1 tanks in the game. They come out at the same rate as their real ones, and don't have a camouflage that changes their colors and/or texture. They'll get the same tank skins, the same colors and textures.\n\nThis is the M1A1 in World of Tanks!",
      "The following article is entirely the opinion of Justin Elliott and does not reflect the views of the Inquisitr.\n\nThe President-elect Donald Trump's tweet last Friday afternoon about \"highly respected\" CIA officials, who he believes are not doing a good job, was a classic Trumpian move. He has little-to-no understanding of the CIA or the bureaucracy that operates within it. He also doesn't care about \"fear of his\" and his own ego. So it wasn't surprising to see Trump attack and disparage the intelligence community. In fact, his behavior since the inauguration, both before and after the CIA's highly classified report about Russian's election hacking, has raised some red flags for the president-elect.\n\nHe's not just targeting the CIA. His tweets about the intelligence community have been even more aggressive and threatening the rest of the government. For weeks he has been threatening to withhold funding from the media. While the media is of course a government agency that's funded by taxes, no president has gone as far as Trump to try make good on his threats.\n\nTrump's tweets about the intelligence community, as well as his threat to withhold funding are a little like calling a friend, \"Uncle Tom.\" His friends might have the best interests of everyone at heart, but Trump still sees them as an enemy. It is a very dangerous game.\n\nThis week Trump will be the next president of the United States. He's in no way a legitimate president or fit for the U.S. presidency. However, what he has been shown so far by the election results is that most Americans don't like him, and he has some serious trust issues. It would definitely hurt the country if Trump acted out like he did last night on Twitter.\n\nHowever, what would do a much wider harm is for Trump to not do something in the next couple days that helps him move past the controversy caused by his behavior last night on Twitter. He would be making himself look weak, and that would hurt his brand. So right now, it's extremely important for Trump to do something to make up for the damage his actions last night caused his brand in the eyes of the American public.\n\nIf there is anyone within the Obama administration who can help Trump do that, it is General Michael Flynn. The retired three-star general was forced to resign following his connections with Russia. He did not receive the level of vetting that previous presidents received and he was not even vetted by Congress. So it seems to me that the best thing to do for Trump is to get General Flynn involved in some way.\n\nThe Washington Times reports that Trump is \"interested\" in Flynn's consulting work in Turkey. According to CNN, \"Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner and top transition official Stephen Miller met with Turkish Energy Minister Berat Albayrak to discuss a possible plan for expanding U.S.-Turkish energy cooperation, the Turkish news agency Anadolu reported on Monday. The officials left with a preliminary outline of a plan called 'New New Economy.'\"\n\nA big project that would help Trump move past the controversy over his tweets and the Russia ties it sparked is expanding the Turkish oil sector. The Turkish government has been trying to expand its oil exports, but the Obama-era sanctions against Russia severely limited its ability to get the necessary approvals. If we can get Trump's son-in-law involved in some way, it would definitely move him past Russian-Clinton-Obama collusion, and the scandal it caused, into a position where he could actually make progress on the oil and gas sector.\n\nNow that we know that the president-elect is in \"considering\" Flynn's consulting work in Turkey, we can ask ourselves \"Why?\" Flynn had some serious connections in Turkey with the Turkish government and the Erdogan regime, which Trump has praised and defended at different points on Twitter. But then he also attacked the current Turkish government, which is now facing allegations that some have used the military takeover over the summer to undermine the opposition party.\n\nIf we wanted to go back to Flynn and get him to work for Trump, it seems to me he would be able to leverage that work in a way to make the next president look like a man of peace.",
      "PITTSBURGH — For the first time in three years, Pittsburgh will host another Super Bowl — and Pittsburgh is hosting it for the first time in 24 years.\n\nThe Steelers, who have had no Super Bowls in three decades, have been tapped to bid on the event, NFL said on Tuesday.\n\nBidding on Super Bowls began last week in Phoenix, with the league opening the bidding process to the general public Friday with a media announcement.\n\nThe New England Patriots and Super Bowl champion Seattle Seahawks made bids earlier this year but pulled their names because they had not secured the necessary permissions and facilities from the NFL and local municipalities.\n\nThat's why Pittsburgh's bid is a surprise.\n\nNFL Executive Vice President and Chief Strategy Officer Troy Vincent said the league had known that the Steelers had made the trip to Phoenix but wasn't expecting the franchise to bid.\n\n\"It's never been done before,\" Vincent said. \"The last time it happened was in '87. So, there's a couple of things we've got to get sorted out, but we're happy to work with the city and the Steelers to make sure we get a successful bid and a game that everyone can enjoy.\"\n\nVincent said the team would make a \"substantial\" contribution to community costs, but that the franchise would also \"use our ownership and our stadium to benefit everyone in the city.\"\n\nThe NFL is looking for the city to provide public subsidies, a hotel tax or the opportunity to sell naming rights to the stadium where the game is held.\n\nThe Steelers are currently paying $8 million a year into the taxpayer-funded stadium, while a portion of revenue from the Steelers-Bengals game is funneled into the stadium to pay off principal on the stadium's debt.\n\nThe city's total public subsidy for Super Bowl XLVIII's operation — $200 million — is in addition to the $100 million in city funding for the renovations that were completed in 2010 after the city awarded the stadium a nearly $70 million renovation contract. The stadium opened in 2008.\n\n\"We want this to be about bringing all the fans together,\" Vincent said. \"We think we can make it a fantastic event that has a lot of excitement and a lot of people that are going to want to come, and they'll be able to enjoy it.\"\n\nVincent said the league hopes to make the first bid in late March or early April and that the game will be held in the late summer or early fall of 2015.\n\nLast year, the league added a new element to the bidding process that allows cities bidding on multiple Super Bowl to submit a single proposal — whether it be to host one of the games, to host a future Super Bowl or to be awarded the event outright.\n\nPittsburgh's bid is part of the NFL's multiyear effort to improve game day fan experiences by including a host of amenities such as expanded beer offerings, an outdoor concert venue and enhanced fan-friendly food and drink opportunities. It is the only bid from a city in the Northeast to be approved and selected by the league.\n\nThe Steelers have been among the NFL's most successful franchises when it comes to Super Bowls. Only Philadelphia has hosted more Super Bowls than Pittsburgh, with Super Bowl XL and Super Bowl XXXVIII held in Pittsburgh.\n\nThe Steelers have had a streak of 10 straight Super Bowl appearances end in recent years when the team lost to San Francisco in Super Bowl XLIV and Seattle in Super Bowl XLV, and in 2012, the team was eliminated in the second round of Super Bowl XLV by the Indianapolis Colts.\n\nIn a statement issued Tuesday, Steelers president Art Rooney II said: \"We believe that the city is deserving of Super Bowl XLVIII. The league is excited about the possibility of bringing another world-class sporting event to Pittsburgh while creating a great experience for our fans, players and the Steelers community.\n\n\"This will be the most competitive bid that the Steelers have applied for since 1994, when they submitted three separate bids.\"\n\nThe NFL had previously planned to hold the Super Bowl in New Orleans but a year-long NFL lockout halted that event. That led the league to start seeking a new host city each year — and the 2016 event is set in Denver in January 2015, where the Ravens and Colts will play their Super Bowl.\n\nLast year, Denver Mayor Michael Hancock hosted a ceremonial groundbreaking for a $1.86 billion stadium that will be connected to a new stadium where the Broncos and Super Bowl 50 host team, the Colorado Rockies, will play in August 2016.\n\nCopyright 2014 The Associated Press.

      "\"This might be it! I'm going to make it back to the surface!\"\n\n— Kratos as he is seen preparing to attack Athena.\n\nKratos (ケルト, Kisutofu?) and the other heroes who fell into the Labyrinth were in a coma for months after returning from the Underworld.\n\nContents show]\n\nBiography Edit\n\nPersonality Edit\n\nKratos was initially very hostile and merciless towards those who could not pass his exams, but he quickly became more compassionate in his outlook in the Labyrinth.\n\nKratos was very good with people. Not just any people, but his own family. He loved them and would sacrifice his own life to protect them. As a result, he had difficulty in understanding that the world is not perfect, and that he should not make it his goal to save everyone all the time.\n\nKratos also expressed that he believed that God loved people more than anything; something his father, Athena, felt to much on many occasions. However, he also believed many Gods had fallen short of their goal, as it felt very self-congratulatory, or at least overly-friendly. It's likely that this is a reflection on Kratos' thoughts of his father, as he seemed to be extremely envious of the Gods.\n\nKratos' loyalty and honor had never wavered. No matter what his father did, Kratos had refused to be defeated. However, his feelings never changed and, as a result, he felt guilty when he was unable to protect his friends. He was a man who followed the rules, but was also willing to ignore and challenge them if it was required.\n\nHis loyalty became a burden as he had fallen into the Labyrinth and become the Minotaur King. Although Kratos was willing to kill himself in order to stop Athena, he was reluctant to kill others. He is also prone to anger, especially when others are in danger. However, he became very tolerant over time, with Athena's advice and his father's encouragement.\n\nHe was shown to have a very positive personality. During his visit from Poseidon, Kratos was happy that they were reunited. He also said that he would not hesitate to fight if he had to because he felt a sense of duty to Athena and his father. Kratos seemed to have a much more peaceful disposition than the other heroes, with Athena even remarking that Kratos was the only hero to treat their father kindly up to that point.\n\nAfter his ordeal in the Labyrinth, Kratos became sad, depressed and suicidal. He blamed himself for the Labyrinth even after Athena explained that her powers would save him. His depression was finally replaced, however, by determination.\n\nBefore he entered the Labyrinth, Kratos possessed a very caring side. After his first encounter with the Minotaur King, Kratos had immediately gone into action and killed the Minotaur King's father. To Athena's amazement, Kratos was also very kind and compassionate to those he came across. It is possible that this side of his personality was retained after he left the Underworld.\n\nKratos was also a proud and boastful person. He would brag and boast about his feats before others, sometimes even to the point of arrogance. Athena was disgusted by Kratos's boasting when it was directed towards her. He would also become jealous of those who were more strong or capable than him, especially those with magical powers. Despite this, Kratos was very selfless when saving others.\n\nHis pride was broken after he killed the Minotaur King, after which Athena realized that her actions were what separated Kratos from his family. Also, after meeting Ares, Kratos was shown to have been very ashamed by his past actions, and he felt ashamed for feeling the way he did at the end of the Underworld. He also became even more confident, proud and confident by being able to face his own demons and not let them control him.\n\nAura was a very powerful energy that formed around the Gods. When Kratos saw it as he entered the Labyrinth, he felt overwhelmed by the energy and was driven into the darkness. He believed that it is a dangerous power that can easily kill him as he lost all control of himself when he was in the Underworld. However, he was eventually reminded how Kratos had saved him by destroying the Minotaur King, and he was convinced by Zeus that even with Aura running rampant, Kratos will not die. Kratos was able to control his Aura in the Labyrinth and use it to heal his injuries from the Labyrinth.\n\nAs part of his transformation into the Minotaur King, Kratos had to drink the blood of the God of War who had fallen in battle. He had originally planned to just take the God's strength to become stronger, but when he saw how Hades had died in battle, Kratos realized that Hades had a purpose to live",
      "The U.S. Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division has sued Arizona's Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio for violating the federal Fair Housing Act by banning Muslims from the Maricopa County jail. The suit says the Muslim ban violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment, which bans sex discrimination and which was implemented by the Supreme Court in its 1963 decision in the case of Plessy v. Ferguson.\n\nThere may be some irony in all this. Back in 1999, an ACLU lawsuit claimed Phoenix's Sheriff Joe Arpaio's immigration policy was a violation of the 14th Amendment. The ACLU challenged the sheriff based on his treatment of immigrants.\n\n\"The Supreme Court has made it quite clear that it's not acceptable for politicians to engage in racial discrimination,\" said U.S. Attorney Ben Wagner in a press release. \"Today's decision shows that we will not tolerate discrimination and will hold public officials accountable for violating the Constitution.\"\n\nThe suit says that, since the suit was filed in 1999, the sheriff has adopted and continued to enforce a policy that forbids people from the Arab, South Asian, and Muslim communities from being incarcerated, even after they have been issued proper court orders and have not returned to the United States illegally. Arpaio's policy also denies food to inmates and prohibits them from using the prison's commissary and vending machines.\n\n\"No one is safe in this country when the government targets individuals because of their faith or racial origin,\" said ACLU Staff Attorney Rebecca Robertson in a press release. \"Americans of all backgrounds must be free from government-issued religious and ethnic profiling.\"\n\nThe lawsuit claims that the policy was meant to put Muslims and Arabs under \"special scrutiny.\"\n\nThe lawsuit also claims that Arpaio's policy is racially discriminatory because it targets immigrants from countries with predominantly Muslim populations.\n\nArpaio has denied the complaint, but the ACLU has been given a deadline to move it out of court.\n\nThe Muslim ban policy has made for strange bedfellows in state government and even in the nation's capital, where one of Arpaio's main backers, Rep. Trent Franks (R-Ariz) is working to repeal the Affordable Care Act with the help of Rep. Steve King (R-Iowa).\n\nIt may seem like nothing's changed in two decades, but, as ACLU attorney Paul Gillman puts it, \"The history of laws banning Muslims from cities and towns dates only back a century, and in the most prominent contexts were based on stereotypes and stereotypes of Muslims that are deeply rooted in the American experience.\"\n\nThe lawsuit was filed Thursday.\n\nMORE: Arizona sheriff to federal government: 'Get the hell out of my jail'",
      "(CNN) A few weeks ago I was chatting with a longtime client of mine. I had just read something nice he had written on Facebook and asked him what he thought about it. He replied: \"I think it's great.\"\n\nThe sentiment came back -- maybe even better -- from two of the most high-profile people he's ever worked for.\n\nWhen I told that to another client last month, he nodded -- but then quickly added, \"But I'm also a big fan of Trump.\"\n\nI'm here to tell you now: The guy I'm talking to is wrong. Trump is not \"a big fan\" of Trump. Trump is a big fan of Trump.\n\nI don't know exactly when this phenomenon started. I suspect it started last week, when Donald Trump's interview with The New York Times -- during which he gave an astonishing account of his relationship with Putin -- took off on the internet.\n\nAt the time, everyone was talking in terms of Trump being a \"Putin friend\" and a Russia ally. I could hear the echo in their voices; they'd seen plenty of their own political leaders making similar claims. But these weren't just politicians. They were businessmen. They were Trump-esque personalities.\n\nAnd what a difference a man makes.\n\nI have met and befriended plenty of billionaires -- people you probably haven't heard of -- whom I've admired in private life, and who I've known professionally for years.\n\nBut Trump's case was special. For one thing, there was something else in Trump's story I could not fully grasp, which is the relationship between wealth, power and being liked.\n\nThat in itself is significant. Being liked is the currency of success, and of power. It's what gives you and your friends the leverage -- both for your future career and for your political career, if one has a future. In this case, the value of the presidency -- even for a billionaire business-person with no foreign policy experience -- can't be fully calculated.\n\nBut let's step back for a second. When you start talking about Trump this way -- as someone who likes Trump -- you're also talking about Trump as some kind of self-made success.\n\nTrump's family had a small fortune from construction and real estate development. Donald Trump started his very own company, Trump Organization, in 1973. Trump had only recently broken into television, and at 30 years old, he became one of the most popular hosts on reality television.\n\nBut that was before being on The Apprentice. It was before he was known at all outside Trump Tower and The Plaza, before he'd even run for president.\n\nSo how much of the success he had was his own doing? And how much did he have to do if he wanted to be what his friends refer to as \"a superstar\"?\n\nTrump made a lot of money in his very first big venture. He didn't set out to be the biggest celebrity, and he didn't have to. It just worked out that way.\n\nWhat do you think he could have done at the same stage in his life to get noticed?\n\nThe guy who created Trump University was a real estate developer. There's a lot of people who want to go into politics and make big money. But who else could you blame for not wanting to take the plunge?\n\nI have a friend who has gone after political office with a long-shot plan to elect a Democrat to the Senate, and who has never spoken to Donald Trump, ever. Maybe this guy was smart and maybe he was unlucky, or maybe Trump's charisma just overwhelmed this kind of man's desire to put his personal identity and personal fortune over politics, at least for a while.\n\nWhat if, instead of trying to out-Trump Trump, you asked about his career -- and how much luck he had in terms of the talent and luck that the \"great luck\" of his life gave him?\n\nThis doesn't only apply to Trump. But it should apply to you. It should apply to the rest of us.\n\nThe \"great luck\" and the \"genius\" of the people we know, the people whose lives we admire, the people whose careers we envy -- there's a lot of them we could be talking about instead of talking about Trump.\n\nIf we were asking about the most impressive or admirable parts of their careers, would we even have to decide how much success or success they've had to be considered good fortune?\n\nIf the answer is yes, a lot of Americans might feel good about that.",
      "How do I get up here as a kid and play golf? How do you play golf for a living? Here are some useful tips.\n\nI know golf is not a sport as such, but it's a game. The golf courses aren't set up with people just standing around watching the ball travel down the fairway. You have to be smart. And sometimes a simple piece of advice can make a huge difference in your game.\n\nMy first year as a PGA pro was a disaster. I had terrible equipment and couldn't figure out how to play. I was frustrated, but I knew there was a shortcut, and I knew that with a little work, I could overcome the obstacles and do pretty well.\n\nIt was in the summer, my second year on the PGA Tour, when I started to take action to address my problem. During a visit to the PGA Professional Center at Pinehurst, NC for a visit to the club, I was struck by the size, layout, and quality of the courses there. I was impressed by their facilities. I knew they had a lot of gear but what surprised me was how much of it didn't look \"used.\" There were very basic greens and fairways, but nothing about the course looked disrepairable. It was obvious to me they didn't play much.\n\nAfter my visit, I sat down with Mike Voss, Head Trainer at PGA West. As he told me what I should do to make sure I was prepared to play well, I knew something was different. For one thing, there wasn't a lot of chatter, people were very serious and focused, but also there was a quiet confidence in PGA West in the area. They had great instructors, fantastic greens, and excellent facilities.\n\nAfter reading Mike's book \"It's Not Just the Ball: A Life Guide to Success In Golf,\" I became committed. I would learn how to play in Pinehurst by following Mike's advice and by going out to the courses I had never played before to learn from experienced pros. Once I had learned enough and was ready to go into a tournament, I would spend time before the practice round getting to know the course, picking the par putts I would like to hit, and how to hit them.\n\nThe PGA Tour and its affiliate PGA of America have developed a lot of their courses in the last 20 years. They don't just go out and buy golf courses, but rather they ask their professional employees and volunteer groundskeepers to work on a course and help put it together. They also have their own clubs for practicing and preparing.\n\nI spent two hours before the practice round on the driving range with a PGA Tour Professional in his training outfit. Each time he did a putt I was focused on the shot and asked him questions. I knew I would have to practice with him to be ready in case I ended up using his putters for the tournament (I was a great putter, especially back in my early days). The Professional didn't even have to teach me. He explained to me the basics of each shot and how to approach it. He also provided good information on what to do in case the weather was bad and he got hit by any particular shot. If there was a good shot and I had time to putt, I asked to see it in a video provided by the PGA Tour because the video showed me every time the PGA Tour showed me a putt out there.\n\nDuring the second round I made a few holes with a few of them. By that point I had learned enough to go into a round with confidence. As the round went on, I made a few more holes. In the third round I made a few more holes and on those days I could play pretty well, but still fell more short than everyone expected, losing by four shots. At that point I realized a very important thing: I was making a lot of mistakes, and I was not making the correct ones. It wasn't because this course was so difficult so much as I had spent way too much time before a round simply practicing.\n\nThis is a common problem with golfers. A lot of them spend too much time practicing so that they can play at a high level, rather than just playing to get better at the game. They think golf is just a game to be played, and it's not. Golf is a sport that requires a lot of preparation and attention to detail in order to play well. You have have to keep practicing and studying until you know every shot. That's why it's much easier to read this book and be comfortable with some advice in that book than it would be if I didn't, because when I'm in the heat of the moment and need guidance, I can just go on Google to do it. In order to make good decisions, I have to be able to see the entire picture, which I can't do without reading and studying.\n\nBy the fourth round",
      "You can find plenty of reasons to enjoy the weather, like relaxing on the beach or watching the sun set over the mountains. But here's something else you might want to avoid: sunburns.\n\nIf you've ever thought, \"I'll try but just the right light, air and temperature won't do,\" you're not alone. Unfortunately, sunburns can be as painful as sunburns, although you can avoid them just as you're able to enjoy the benefits of sun to the fullest.\n\n\"People don't realize that skin cancer exists and it's much more common than you could think,\" said Dr. Scott A. Flanders, chair of dermatology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center.\n\n\"We're used to thinking it's a tan that makes us develop cancer, but actually skin cancers can be caused by UV exposure, not just a tan.\"\n\nIt's a misconception that there are two types of skin cancers.\n\n\"When we talk about sunburns, we're actually talking about sun damage caused by overexposure to sun,\" explained Dr. Flanders, pointing to a common misunderstanding among those dealing with a sunburn in the summer.\n\nInstead of using sunscreen and reapplying after exposure, they overuse makeup and stay toasty, resulting in the burn, he said. Or, in the case of people who regularly stay indoors, they burn too much skin because the sun is hitting the part of skin that contains the most dermal blood vessels. And there's evidence those cells that are not burned are more prone to skin cancer.\n\nMost people are completely aware of the fact that sunburns produce a burn, but the effects and length of time are dependent on their exposure time, according to the American Academy of Dermatology.\n\nThe \"burns\" are actually the start of a skin cancer, and the longer they go on, the more likely your skin will be affected down the road. But you can prevent that from happening.\n\nThe trick is to minimize the amount time you spend in the sun and to apply a sunscreen every two or three hours during the day, even if you're not directly exposed. You can also use a broad spectrum, water-resistant sunscreen to prevent the sun damage.\n\nAfter the sunburn, a good skin care routine usually includes a regimen of moisturizers and moisturizing lotions. These can help soothe the skin and reduce any irritation or redness.\n\nHowever, as with any burn or sun damage, it's important to see an doctor right away to determine the best possible treatment for your needs.",
      "Kerry: 'I was wrong' to criticize Netanyahu over settlements\n\nIn an interview published Saturday, Secretary of State John Kerry said he was \"sad\" to have criticized Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu for his handling of the Israel-Palestinian peace talks, the Times of Israel reports.\n\nKerry was criticized by several pro-Israel groups for his comments on Thursday when he told NBC's \"Meet the Press\" that the settlements — the settlements which the international community has designated \"illegal\" under international law — were one of the key driving forces behind the failed negotiations.\n\nBut he told the Times of Israel that he was \"saddened\" to have done so. \"I wish I had said it differently,\" Kerry said, adding that he believes the settlements would \"end up destroying the prospect of any two-state solution.\"\n\nKerry also said that he had raised the issue of building more settlements — which Israel has already announced plans to do — during his talks with Netanyahu, which took place Wednesday \"in some detail.\"\n\nBut, he said, \"I was wrong, I am sorry. I shouldn't have done it because I don't think it's helpful because I don't believe it's helpful to the cause.\"\n\nKerry also blamed the Palestinians for being too passive during his talks with them, for allegedly trying to get the U.S. to abandon its demand for a two-state solution.\n\n\"I was disappointed,\" he told the Times of Israel. \"We've got to get to another place and I hope the Israelis will take me to another place and I hope that I can learn from the process more than I did and I also hope that the Palestinian leadership learns from it as well.\"\n\nThe secretary said he was \"tough\" with Netanyahu, noting that the \"unfortunate reality\" was that the prime minister had \"made progress, had reached a real understanding, had been able to put these things on the table that were very positive things for peace. You had been doing this with the prime minister, saying, 'You've got to take them off the table. This is not going to work.'\"\n\nAsked if he had called Netanyahu \"on the carpet\" for his talks with the White House, he said, \"I never have in a formal way and I certainly never said it a few times to him.\"",
      "\"I'll be damned if there ain't anything you can do to make this place better.\"\n\n\nThe sound of his father's voice was the last sound he heard before his head was slammed against the wall.\n\n\n\"I was there the same time as you, Harry. How could you not see that he had something else planned?\"\n\n\nThe first few minutes were difficult for Harry to believe that his dad was actually here. The last couple years have been filled with him constantly worried about his father, but this was quite something he did not expect to experience. A cold sweat ran down each of his arms as he looked around the room.\n\n\n\"That's right. Do you see all the damage to the house?\"\n\n\n\"Nope, just the rooms around here,\" his father replied. \"You want to know why I was here in the first place?\"\n\n\nAnother moment passed before Harry began to understand where it had come from. His parents were here for a reason and that reason was to help his father get what was rightfully his. \"What?\" he asked.\n\n\nHis father was quiet for a moment. He looked Harry over, then nodded towards his chair. \"So I'll be blunt...you haven't done anything to help me. I won't ask for an exact number here, but I'm willing to bet that you've failed a decent amount of your OWLs. I know you said that you went to Diagon alley. I know you've done quite a bit of studying in your time here. I saw you on the Quidditch pitch a couple of days ago. You were even in sixth year in fifth years' classes...what is it that you've learned during your time here that has you so confident about your ability to lead us? I don't think it's just a quick study. You've done nothing of substance for the last several years and you don't seem too interested in it now.\n\n\n\"And what's that? Your best friend's wife is pregnant. You and Ron are getting along like a house on fire. You're practically the best of friends. Even if your Dad thinks you're wasting his time and resources by not working with him, what difference would it make if he's right?\" Harry started getting worried now, knowing how strongly the man hated the boy and how much he cared for him.\n\n\n\"So let me get this right,\" his father said, turning to face him. \"You can't work with me? And you're not going to make any friends? What happened to being your own man, Harry?\"\n\n\nHarry's heart sank. He knew that his father was right, but that didn't mean that he was ready to be out of his comfort zone. To be perfectly honest, he was terrified to get involved with his father in any way. But he had no idea how to make them happy if he just left now. He thought about Ron and Hermione and said nothing. After a moment's hesitation he nodded.\n\n\n\"Okay. When you look around here and all the things you have done that you shouldn't have done, I'm going to come through here and tell you that this room was a mess before I got here. You don't need much justification here and you don't think much of me, Harry. So let's call it a draw.\"\n\n\nWith that, Harry took a deep breath, then slowly closed his eyes. His heart sank.\n\n\n\"Let's just say that if you had stayed where you are or started working on something, I might not have had to do what I did tonight. I had no idea that I was going to have to tell someone my secret before I even said the words to Harry. Now, let's get some sleep. I'll start doing what you said last night.\" His father left the room, leaving his son alone in the room for the first time in two weeks.\n\n\n* * * * *\n\n\nHarry was awoken by the sound of his parents' footsteps outside his room door. He tried to fight off the feeling that someone was watching him. His eyes shot open to see the look of confusion on his parents' faces. \"Who is it? Harry?\" Ron practically shouted from near the door.\n\n\nHarry's arms crossed dangerously. \"I'll tell you now, I don't know anyone else that knows our mother's business. I don't suppose you're aware that we were here before our families arrived?\" Harry asked the question quietly. He did not want to give Ron any information he might have found out about him. He also did not want to give his parents any more information about the people around them, which made him more and more apprehensive as he stood there.\n\nRon turned around, then looked away. \"How are things with you two?\"\n\n\n\"Pretty good. We're almost done with school.\"\n\n\nBoth of them had heard a lot about her over the last weeks and were quite interested to hear more. \"",

      "\"They say if you don't eat the fish on the menu, you will not like it,\" says Mikel, gesturing around the cavernous restaurant in the town of Quilmes in the southern province of Oaxaca.\n\nSo it was that in the midst of a bustling lunch hour, the Mexican-American waitress at Mikel's, on the edge of Oaxaca City, took the opportunity of a lull in the din to pluck out two golden prawns from the tank on the menu and drop them into a basket before me, my wife and daughter.\n\nThey have been ordered before. But never on a plate. \"You see, the prawns are the special,\" adds Mikel. \"They're delicious. They're a little different from our regular menu.\"\n\nIndeed! As soon as I had my mouth full of the delicately fried seafood, I found myself wishing that the prawns were more available. And while Mikel knows this, that's just the kind of place he opened.\n\nBut the question you might pose is, why on Earth would you go to a restaurant in Mexico where the menu offers a plate of prawns instead of, say, a menu offering an enchilada? Or two enchiladas? Or some kind of seafood pasta entree? In order to provide an answer to that question, let's first look at why prawns, along with a handful of other tasty seafood, are not on display on the menu.\n\nThe prawns on Oaxacan menus are called náhuatl, derived from Naqala, pronounced \"noah-qellah\" -- literally like \"curls\", a reference to the stringy texture of the flesh and the way they cook.\n\nAs far as I could tell, this practice has only sprung up in recent years and has grown in popularity. The dish has a rich history, with some cultures using prawns to help thicken sauces or to help create a more intense taste for food prepared with the meat. But it has only just started to gain traction in Oaxaca, especially among the elite chefs and celebrities of the local restaurant scene.\n\nThis is what Oaxacan chefs are saying about the special. Photo from Yelp\n\n\nA few months ago, a group of food bloggers took to the Internet to promote a restaurant concept in the town of Cancun, which serves náhuatl. The restaurant, Nachos de Baxalote, has since become a phenomenon. A handful of other establishments in the town are also serving the dish, which is popular in some parts of the country and also served in parts of Japan, Japan's island of Okinawa and Thailand.\n\nIn the country, a dish similar to náhuatl is a popular menu offering in some places in the south, such as the city of Veracruz, or the small town of Nuevo Laredo. But it is not the only one around here. In a place like Quilmes, you find náhuatl served in restaurants like Mikel's, with different sauces, like a red sauce and a white sauce. (The white sauce is what's used in the quesadilla mentioned above.)\n\nIn terms of taste, though, the white sauce is decidedly less satisfying than the red sauce (if there's any difference). Also in Quilmes, the dish is served with a green chili sauce made with tomatillos and tomatoes.\n\nBut there's one other ingredient that has become synonymous with the dish in Oaxaca and that's the red sauce. It's true that it has a fiery flavor that makes its red-rimmed appearance, and it can add a certain spice and heat to a dish for which tomatillos and tomatoes aren't usually used. But the red sauce is almost always too hot for the plate, and it usually leaves the plate, in my experience, too greasy. And even when I was ordering it, I never took to enjoying it, either.\n\nIn Veracruz, náhuatl is served on the side of náhuatl-stuffed tacos. Photo from Yelp\n\n\nNow, in the city of Oaxaca, the red sauce -- more correctly called the marinadilla (from the dialect náhuatlan) -- has become a common menu offering. And not just any menu offering, but one on which most diners order the red sauce, no matter the dish.\n\nI've tried that red sauce. It was a disappointment. A bitter and garlicky sauce, it left my belly feeling empty.\n\nFor the people of Oaxaca, however, the red sauce has become a symbol of the dish, something with which the restaurant business is intertwined. A sign outside a popular neighborhood restaurant in Oaxaca City proclaims on a large board alongside the price that the red sauce is \"the national dish",

      "On Tuesday night's episode of CNN's Reliable Sources, hosts Brian Stelter and Don Lemon played video of Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn's recent interview in which he said, \"I believe in the power of the presidency, and I believe in Congress.\"\n\nAs Lemon pointed out, some media and elected officials were \"up in arms\" over Cornyn's comments, particularly Sen. Lindsey Graham, who said the comments represent an \"assault on the institutional norms\" of a republic.\n\nBut Cornyn told Lemon back in February that he never considered resigning because he saw no reason why he shouldn't finish out his term in Congress, and it's clearly obvious that he'll be in the Senate for at least another two years. But when it comes to the role of the presidency, as a whole, Lemon insisted that \"there is no reason to think that we wouldn't want to avoid impeachment.\"\n\nWell, there are three reasons.\n\nAs CNN's chief political correspondent Dana Bash noted, the three \"constitutional\" reasons to impeach Donald Trump are as follows: obstruction of justice, violation of the Espionage Act, and treason. These are the things that every president has committed at one point or another. These are the things that have always been grounds for impeachment. Now, it's a serious accusation on the president's part to claim that he is under investigation, that a grand jury is looking into the matter, but it doesn't seem to be true.\n\nSecondly, there are constitutional reasons to impeach Hillary Clinton too, including her e-mail scandal and the way she treated the State Department during her tenure. Even if you want to go down the road of impeachment specifically concerning her use of private email servers, the more serious claim that the public has is that Clinton engaged in a kind of pay-to-play, as Bash noted.\n\nFinally, there are constitutional reasons to impeach Richard Nixon (again); the Watergate scandal, which ultimately led to the ouster of his presidency but it's fair to say that was over a political scandal rather than anything Trump has been accused of (which, it's worth remembering, involves the president's campaign trying to discredit and undermine an FBI investigation). What was the president's crime in that case? What is the crime here?\n\nBut the question here isn't whether or not Trump is guilty of obstruction of justice, violation the Espionage Act, and treason. The question at hand is whether or not the people of the United States are going to let our country slide in the eyes of the world by putting Trump in the Oval Office, but only for an unknown amount of time.\n\nFor some, as CNN's Fareed Zakaria argued back in November, that is a \"political calculation that Trump has made, and it will come back to haunt him.\" But the fact that Zakaria, a seasoned politician who was a Republican during George W. Bush's administration, has a lot of respect for the way that President Obama governed shouldn't obscure what he actually said on the topic.\n\nThe political calculation isn't that Clinton would have ended up impeached and removed from the presidency. The political calculation is that this country would have been better served as a constitutional republic, with a president from outside the top two political parties who could actually serve out his term and not have to worry about the specter of the \"next president.\"\n\nCNN's Stelter responded when I mentioned that one of his colleagues had said the president's latest comments on Russia represent an \"assault on the institutional norms of the United States\" by insisting that the media \"welcomes\" \"the attacks from the White House\" because it's the \"norms\" that matter.\n\nHe went on to explain:",

Legere will answer questions about 4G deployment, T-Mobile's network investment plan and how much 4G LTE service can offer customers versus standard 3G service.\n\nLegere has been outspoken in his criticism of US carriers' reliance on data fees for access to data services. The comments have prompted the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to launch a study into competition in the wireless industry and Legere told FierceWireless in August that the study could lead to the FCC reclassifying certain wireless services as a \"common carrier,\" a designation that would force US carriers to share their infrastructure and provide consumers with a basic set of services.\n\nFor example, US carriers have been pushing LTE-Advanced technology, which is capable of using much less spectrum than the 2.5GHz spectrum used for traditional 3G, and which is more energy efficient. The FCC has yet to establish clear rules around this new spectrum.\n\nLegere's comments have also prompted the FCC to reconsider its previous plan to allow nationwide Wi-Fi access across the United States. The FCC originally approved the Wi-Fi plan, which would have allowed any US city to deploy unlimited W-Fi networks if they paid an application fee. US carriers lobbied the FCC to reverse its decision, arguing that the plan would hurt them financially, though the FCC voted to postpone a decision on Wi-Fi until next year, saying it would hold further hearings on the issue this year.\n\nThis morning, T-Mobile released details of its new Wi-Fi roaming service offering, allowing customers to connect to W-Fi networks without having to pay a fee. The new service has been dubbed \"Simple Choice\" as it allows existing W-Fi data plans to be used to access a variety of data services, such as streaming video content, video chat services, and cloud storage.\n\nMeanwhile, T-Mobile plans to launch high-speed HSPA+ data service at the end of the year, a service that will enable customers to consume twice the data that they currently consume in standard data service, Legere said on Tuesday. The company will begin testing this new plan this year and roll it out nationwide throughout 2015.\n\n\"This is really about giving people the ability to bring their own data to our network, as if they're bringing one device,\" Legere explained. \"As a consumer, you're now sharing your data network with other devices -- whether you're on your smartphone, tablet, or other mobile device -- and we want to give you more freedom than ever to bring your own data.\"",
      "There has been considerable speculation concerning whether the first American baby to die at 28 weeks gestation died of a rare condition or not. That debate has been ongoing since the tragic death in September of Texas baby Lacey S. Johnson, whose death was ruled a suicide.\n\nBut the news just came in that New Jersey baby Grace S. May died last week from a rare genetic condition called NOCD.\n\nThe condition, which appears in only 1 in 4,500 pregnancies, is diagnosed in utero and causes babies to be born with abnormally small heads, which can lead to severe growth failures, seizures, vision problems and even death. It was first identified in Japan in the early 1960s.\n\nMay's mother, Anna Ducharme, told MSNBC, \"We were told in her 20s that she would not make it past the 20th week of pregnancy. So when she told us at 28 weeks her chances of survival were very slim.\"\n\nIt wasn't until May's fourth trimester that a midwife noticed a condition on Grace's head that looked almost the same as May's.\n\nAfter seeing a doctor, doctors realized that the condition might be so rare that they never would see it in a mother before the 28th week.\n\nGrace's family plans to have her cremated rather than bury her.\n\nThere have been a total of 21 babies that died from NOCD in the United States in the past 15 years, but at least 13 of those babies are still alive.\n\nHere are the pictures of Grace's stillbirth.",
      "Fifty years after the US military invaded Vietnam based on a highly-misinformed 'Lyndon Johnson's War' propaganda, that campaign was the subject of a book published this week by the US Army War College. The book, called \"Dereliction of Duty: The Untold Story of the Unequivocal Military Support of Presidential Decision to Invade Vietnam\", is being released just as the anniversary of the 1962 US invasion approaches. The 'war' of which the book is a review was a war in which all sides were complicit: the US, its friends and enemies, in both Vietnam and Southeast Asia, and beyond.\n\nThe US military involvement in Vietnam was the longest continuous, and certainly the most destructive, US war in human history. In that war, the US conducted a number of bombing campaigns, as well as a campaign of ground troops.\n\nDespite the fact that America was on the wrong side, the US Army insisted that the war was the 'right' war. US war planners justified this by arguing from the beginning that the war was \"anti-Communist in purpose but not in means\". The United States government consistently presented the war in a way that sought to obscure the true nature and aims of the war. In the book \"Dereliction of Duty\", the author, Dr John R. Deni, outlines the ways the US propaganda machine sought to obscure Vietnam's anti-Communist nature:\n\nThe government sponsored anti-Communist propaganda through a myriad of agencies, including, of course, the Agency for International Development. The CIA operated a vast network of front organizations, called fronts in propaganda parlance. The National Endowment for Democracy, a CIA project, supported a host of groups and individuals who played a major role in disseminating government propaganda designed to distort the historical record, support an 'anti-Communist' position, and provide moral justifications for military interventions.\n\nThe book explains the reasons the US military wanted to use the Vietnamese people as a 'human shield':\n\nIt was important not only for American forces to avoid unnecessary casualties, but also to make sure that the people of South Vietnam, who were often too poor to provide themselves with the kind of medical treatment that they wanted, did not die unnecessarily. That is why the Americans encouraged South Vietnamese farmers to hide their food supplies, which may have been needed to feed the war effort. The US soldiers saw people doing this all around the country, but there were no reports of Americans being found out. (1)\n\nThe propaganda campaign included the use of 'human shields'. In a series of articles in The New York Times from 1969 and 1970, investigative journalist Seymour Hersh exposed the use of 'human shields' to support the war effort, specifically:\n\nThe killing of North Vietnamese soldiers hiding in villages, which was alleged to have taken place during the 1970 invasion of Cambodia; American helicopter crews, which allegedly turned over unarmed civilians and then attacked them; and the secret prison camps in which captured North Vietnamese agents were kept after their surrender to American forces. (2)\n\nThe book goes on to describe how the war was waged in the 'war on terror' to justify US military actions in numerous cases:\n\nIt's not possible to accurately convey the horror of a nuclear bombardment or the terror of a chemical attack without some basic knowledge of what they are. The first thing that military officers are trained to do when confronted by such horrors is to make sure that their enemy's population does not die too many years before the conflict begins. These horrific weapons were used so that, according to General William E. Odom, commanding general of US forces in Vietnam in 1965-66, the Vietnamese \"would not have enough time to flee their country to make any kind of resistance.\"\n\nThe US military is also implicated in the human rights violations of former South Vietnamese President Nguyen Van Thieu:\n\nIf the Vietnamese had had any sense they would not have agreed to this military coup, given the nature of their communist government. The Vietnamese people did not know that they were in the control of a military coup at that time. (3)\n\nDeni goes into detail in the book of how the US media distorted the anti-Communist nature of the war:\n\nBut while newspapers and broadcasters took great pains to portray the U.S. as the defender of a 'democratic' society, it was clear that US military advisers were the primary instigators of the 'democratic' campaign which, in reality, served to consolidate the dictatorship in Saigon. (4)\n\nThe most revealing discussion of the role of the military in the anti-Communist propaganda campaign, however, is the book's discussion of Vietnam's National Assembly, the body that was supposed to be conducting the democratic elections that the US was trying to impose. Deni:\n\nIn the 1970 election campaigns, the Americans worked very hard to portray the election as free and fair, though these were, in fact, the only elections in South Vietnam for years.",
      "The \"coup\" in Ukraine over the weekend came after more than a decade in the making. In 2008, after years of pro-Western economic reforms and rising oil prices, Ukraine's first post-Soviet president, Viktor Yushchenko, won a second term on a platform of pushing through a constitutional reform that would have given citizens more power and autonomy. The West saw this as a major breakthrough because of the new freedoms it promised, but Yushchenko's political opponents did not want to go along. They saw him as authoritarian and out-of-touch. Yushchenko's supporters, including Russia, were angry that Yushchenko's reformist instincts had hurt their cause in their country.\n\nOn Dec. 5, 2008, Russia's Vladimir Putin took over from Yushchenko as president and swiftly seized control of Ukraine. On Dec. 6, Russia occupied another disputed territory, Crimea.\n\nYanukovych, the billionaire who had just been elected president, knew that he and his allies would come under pressure. In fact, Yushchenko himself had sent Yanukovych two warning shots, one in 2009 via telephone from his Kyiv home and the other in October 2011 on the night that Yanukovych was to be sworn in as president. \"I'm very worried about this man,\" Yushchenko told Yanukovych, according to a transcript of the call reviewed by ICIJ. \"He seems crazy. He talks about revolution. He's not doing anything to stop this regime\" and \"I hope he'll change his mind and leave.\" Yanukovych did not reply.\n\nYanukovych and his allies knew that they were facing not just protests but a coup d'état.\n\nIn June 2010, a month before Ukraine's presidential election, a court sentenced Yanukovych to two terms at a correctional institute for electoral fraud. It was a sentence that appeared to be symbolic, rather than a practical jail sentence. But the decision had symbolic meaning for the president. While many Ukrainians viewed Yanukovych's tenure as a period of stability and progress, he had alienated not just his supporters, but also some in his own government who resented his heavy-handed methods. It was also seen as a punishment to send a message to Yanukovych and his supporters that they could not act with impunity.\n\nAs the months passed, Yushchenko's enemies in Kyiv felt that his government had lost its grip, and they started to look for a way back to power, according to the former Kyiv mayor and government insider. In September 2010, Yushchenko's then security minister, Serhiy Lyovochkin, told the president that the cabinet should be changed, but he said that change should come gradually and that the president needed time to \"cool off.\" On Sept. 20, the Ukrainian army, under Yushchenko's watch, declared that it would not take part in a battle with Russian troops in eastern Ukraine if the Russians pulled back their forces from the border.\n\nA few weeks later, Yanukovych told Russian President Dmitry Medvedev that he would stay in office as long as he won presidential elections on Dec. 25. In reality, there was nobody more determined to stay in office than Yanukovych, who had just been released from prison for the first time since being elected on a pro-Western platform. Still, Yanukovych saw the crisis in Ukraine as a chance for him to finally rid himself of a political opponent, a man who had spent a lifetime opposing him.\n\nA week before Kyiv protests erupted, Ukraine's new justice minister, Arsen Avakov, ordered the arrest of the former head of parliament and a senior member of Yanukovych's political party, and their homes were raided by his intelligence service. Yanukovych and his supporters knew they were facing not just protests but a coup d'état.\n\nThe following morning, Oct. 25, Yanukovych held a meeting where he asked his supporters to take to the streets if needed, according to the U.S. intelligence official. He also told them that he would not resign, even if he received no support. On the day of the protests, several of Yanukovych's closest allies — including Yulia Tymoshenko, his former prime minister and a longtime supporter — were brought to a meeting room and told to sign a document promising that they would not try to overthrow the government. But it didn't stop protesters who had gathered at Independence Square in central Kyiv from starting what became the largest protest in Ukraine's long history.\n\nYanukovych had made a big mistake in not taking action at this point.\n\nThe day after a government convoy was attacked by protesters in Kyiv, Putin publicly criticized Yanukovych for not cracking down harder against those who were disrupting his government.\n\nBut by the next day, Yanukovych had made a big mistake in not taking action at this point. In what can only be called a fatal misstep, the president's administration launched a repressive crackdown and arrested dozens of activists in Kyiv over the next few days as part of a coordinated campaign, according to the U.S. intelligence official",
      "In October 2016, I published a post about the need to rethink the language I had been using for the blog at The Daily Grail. I had been using the term \"cognitive dissonance\" which had, among other problems, been used by one of my clients to describe a sense of discomfort or self-doubt that they had been forced to acknowledge and deal with over the years, usually as the result of some sort of painful trauma.\n\nThe post sparked a long discussion, which I won't recap here, but the most surprising thing to me, and a surprise to many people, was that a lot of it was driven by very young people.\n\nAt that stage, the blog was not on a dedicated social network like Twitter or Facebook, and so was not visible to all but a select group of people. But the majority of comments I read on that post came from people under 33.\n\nTo my knowledge I am not the youngest man ever to have written for The Daily Grail, but I do wonder if, having grown up, read a lot of stories about the internet, and now having an office with which to write, that I have somehow developed an unusually sensitive ear for young people.\n\nBut maybe it is all that sensitiveness that has led me up the garden path and into the garden party: a post that, to me, was about a lot more than just words, or at least it was about a lot less than it seemed at the time.\n\nA few days ago, a friend and colleague remarked on the importance of finding out what you can say in different contexts and situations. He pointed me to an amazing TED talk on the question by author and writer Rebecca Solnit, which I watched as a way of getting a sense for things I had not yet really thought about.\n\nIn the TED video, Solnit starts by saying it is hard to convey complex ideas to a non-specialist listener, and then goes on to say that we all have an ingrained tendency to tell ourselves what we ought to know. In her eyes, in order to make a point, she writes, all you need to do is be honest.\n\nThere is a problem with this approach, especially if you are a writer, writer who writes a lot, or a writer who writes about something you know little about. People have a natural tendency to make themselves more comfortable by making things less complex: they want to write about the things people like to read about. This can sometimes work well - it is one of the reasons, for example, that lots of journalists and novelists seem to have an almost automatic, if somewhat awkward, knack of speaking to people in the \"normal\" way, with no need to explain why.\n\nBut, I believe, it does the author a disservice, as there is no greater sign of disrepair in our society than an inability to empathise with people you don't know. For people, who lack a direct connection to others, Solnit's message is doubly valuable and hard to come by: as much as we like to think of ourselves as enlightened, we are all too aware of just how limited both our world-view and our capacity to understand another person's life outside our own is, both because of our upbringing and because of our unique social circumstances (I know I have talked about my parents).\n\nThere is, after all, a reason that a TED talk is typically followed by several questions, and why they are often followed by explanations. It's because you are still explaining yourself - the talk was to introduce you to some ideas, and then to explore a little beyond that. If, by the time you have finished, you feel you have not only explained yourself, but perhaps you have made a case for your own worldview, we know how difficult it is, and we would not be surprised if you find that people are inclined to think a little further than they have come to.\n\nIn other words, we live in a world where empathy - our ability to put ourselves in somebody else's shoes - is difficult. In a world where we believe that most people are fundamentally good, good people, we are going to be at a disadvantage. The reason has to do with our natural tendencies. Solnit says it best herself, in the video: we are all, fundamentally, \"bad people\", and we believe it, we have internalized it, and we do it without question.\n\nFor years, I have had the privilege of being in the studio with Solnit, speaking to her as part of her podcast series, which is called The Solnit Project . (The first episode is available in audio format here.) The idea is that I spend a considerable part of my time discussing the issues that I write about, and ask her to explain them to me in an accessible way. One of the things I learn from doing this is how her ideas are not only accessible to non-specialist ears, they are the most relevant in a situation that is often hostile to them",
      "I've just returned from a four-day cruise at New York 's John F. Kennedy International for the annual World Wine Challenge event, and while I did my job as a critic—pitting wine against my sense of style and taste—I was also a spectator.\n\nMost people have had more than one wine to drink at a tasting event, or maybe even three. But I can honestly say I never have. I often say I only drink two wine, the same way I'll say I only eat two meals per day. So for those of you out there who want to know my secret, I'll tell you my secret and then you can tell me yours.\n\nA wine, by my own definition, is a single element that will bring out my taste. If I love the grape, I will drink the beer or the red wine, or whatever is closest. If I don't love the beer or the red wine, I won't drink it. The same wine or wine category could taste different to the same person depending on which of eight elements is most dominant.\n\nAnd it works the same when it comes to style. If a category is strong with one style, I won't drink it. The way I see it, styles are like sub-domains of wines and can be subdivided into sub-styles. And a sub-style is like a sub-sub-genre. There are sub-sub-genres of country-style sherry, so some people can have one sherry, some drink a lot, others have one sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub genre of sherry. And then it goes all the way from there up to different sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- Sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-and on and on, sub-sub- sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub. Or maybe you are into French Champagne. You want to drink French Champagne; that's an individual sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- sub-sub-sub- sub-sub-sub, just like the sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub- sub-sub-sub-subsub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub-sub.\n\nThe point is, style is different for different people. And I've noticed that in most tastings, the person doing the tasting is most likely to be the person who lives in the neighborhood where the sommelier lives.\n\nSo now you know my secret, so go forth (or, I hope, take a quick break) and give this event a try. You might just like it a little better than I do.",
      "If you don't pay your debt off, it's like you're saying, 'No thanks, sorry we didn't pay, I don't want to have anything to do with that.'\"\n\nThat was the advice the company's co-founder, Kevin Hall, gave to me when I asked him to write about how his company helps people with student loan debt.\n\nHall is an attorney. I asked him how he came up with the idea for First American Student. He explains:\n\n\"I grew up in the 1970s in an under-served community, and I felt that the people I worked with didn't have a voice in their communities, so I wanted to do something about that,\" he says. \"It was never a question that people would be able to pay back the loans, which is why we chose student loans in the first place.\"\n\nWhile the term \"student loan\" has become synonymous with loans for undergraduate education, it's also a popular term for debt incurred by graduate students and law school graduates. A 2014 report by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau reported that 40% of grad students don't pay off their loans until they're 60 years old.\n\nHall doesn't consider himself a student loan expert. That's partially because he hasn't graduated from law school, but the other part is because student loans can be difficult for people to understand and manage.\n\n\"Because of the high-profile nature of it, it's almost like a black box,\" Smith says. \"If you don't pay your student loans back, it's like you're saying, 'No thanks, sorry we didn't pay, I don't want to have anything to do with that.'\"\n\nHall and his company are taking an approach to student loan debt that's both practical and aspirational. The company gives people a chance to avoid default and pay off their loans. But to qualify, you have to be a first-year graduate, have at least $10,000 in your bank account, and live on your own rather than on your parents' dime. Hall says First American \"made a decision as a company that we want to help people, and also as a company that we want to be as transparent with our students as much as our lenders are.\"\n\n\"We've just been very, very focused on helping people,\" Smith says.\n\nFirst American provides four main services that help graduates pay off their student loans: a loan deferment program, money management services for grad student expenses (like car payments and rent), a loan forgiveness program, and an educational discount program. Most of the services are available to students who have gone back to school in the past five years — and those who were in school at least a year before they went to college.",
      "\"I am a Republican because I am a Christian\"\n\nWhen you hear this sort of statement from somebody in your faith, who is they? Most people in the world? A couple of generations ago, probably someone like Mitt Romney?\n\nOr maybe John McCain?\n\nMaybe Jeb Bush?\n\nMaybe you heard it recently from the head of the Religious Right, or from an official in the Republican Party who wants to run and win?\n\nA religious conservative is a Republican in the GOP primary. \"I am a Christian\" means that a religious conservative will vote for the Republican presidential nominee.\n\nHere's the thing… there's no reason to think that's true. I don't know anyone who really believes there is a political or religious problem with being a Christian… but a Christian who's been in the Republican Party for a couple of generations thinks they are the \"problem.\"\n\nIt's not about that.\n\nIt's about what does it mean to be a Christian in the Republican Party? The party of Lincoln? The \"Party of Lincoln\"? The party of the first two presidents? The party that gave us the Ten Commandments? The party that took the first freedom from an enemy – slavery – and kept that freedom forever?\n\nYou know, in addition to the first two presidential elections, the Republican Party also nominated Gerald Ford. A conservative with the name of Dwight. A true constitutional conservative who said \"the right of citizens of the United States to choose their political representatives… must be respected at all times.\" A conservative who said \"I have never wavered in my support of a free society where all men are free.\"\n\nIt was a big moment – and it was all about him being a Christian.\n\nWhen he became the nominee, religious conservatives were elated. \"The man is a born again Christian! He'll be our leader! He will lead our movement!\"\n\nThe next six years? They were full of problems. It would be years before a genuine conservative candidate could get the nomination, and it wouldn't even be that until the 1976 elections.\n\nBut look at Gerald Ford now. For the first time since the 1960's, there are genuine \"electable\" candidates for the Republican nomination. And the religious right is terrified.\n\nHere's a conservative, a true constitutional Conservative, and the Religious Right hates him.\n\nThey are so terrified, that their leader calls him a liar.\n\nIn his interview with Rick Lazio, Romney complained that a lot of people are going to come after him because he's a Mormon. Well, if that's the case, then I'm going to give them a little gift in that they won't be able to call him a liar…\n\nWhat kind of liar has a Mormon as his running mate?\n\nAnd to be perfectly clear, this isn't some little dig. Mitt Romney has been a big liar for a long time now – and to the Religious Right's surprise, Mitt Romney still is.\n\nHe took money from big businesses like Nike (shudder) while he was governor and was a huge corporate tax raiser – and his record when he was in private equity and was running Bain Capital was that he had done all this terrible destruction and greed – and yet he was still in office until 2012.\n\nHe was the guy who had a lot of \"business experience\" while a governor of his state. And yet he was in charge during that period of Massachusetts… when the \"Romneycare\" health care reform was supposed to have made health insurance affordable for everyone. He was president of the Massachusetts Olympics, and the people of the state – which should have been full of Olympic champions, but was full of poor people who were unable to afford their medications – were paying for Romney's extravagant Olympic games.\n\nSo Mitt Romney does kind of look like a guy who has a \"business experience,\" and yet at the same time he got all this money from the same big corporations that he supposedly was going to \"cut.\"\n\nThat's how Mitt Romney makes it sound. You know, the \"not-that-many-years-ago\" story that nobody ever remembers.\n\nYou know what else was a \"little thing\" that Mitt Romney got big money from during his time as governor? There were laws against him giving gifts to any government appointees. Well, if he did that, he would be the opposite of a true Christian! He would be one of those ungodly people who gave cash to government officials and told them to do whatever it was that he wanted them to do!\n\nSo when the Romney camp says he never gives money to politicians, it's not just a \"little thing\" that he always gave money to politicians. It really is \"not that many years ago\" when he gave big money to politicians while he was a \"small businessman.\"\n\nWhen they say that he doesn't have a personal relationship to Mitt Romney, what they mean is Romney just gave him",

We're still trying to establish who the shooter or shooters were.\"\n\nRelated: A Look at the Events Leading Up to and During the 2014 Winter Olympics\n\nPolice said they were called to the nightclub in Nyhavn, a suburb of Copenhagen, shortly after midnight on January 1, when a report of shots being fired was received.\n\nA number of people sustained gunshot wounds and were treated on the scene. Those who were treated received \"first aid,\" Frederiksen said, \"and the Copenhagen Fire Department provided first aid to the injured.\"\n\nPolice say they arrested a 37-year-old Copenhagen resident on suspicion of being involved in shooting. He was expected to undergo a psychiatric evaluation.\n\nIt was not clear Friday evening when Frederiksen would disclose the suspect's name.\n\nThe killing spree by an American college student who attended a party where many were celebrating the end of the year in the Danish capital started early, when an altercation broke out between two girls and escalated to a fight, Frederiksen said.\n\nRelated: Danish Parliament Members Condemn 'Sickening' Attack on Christmas Party\n\n\"What happened after that was we have a stabbing and a shooting,\" the police spokesman said.

      "The US military has has \"a lot of work to do\" when it comes to gender separation of men and women on military bases. Despite a growing sense that more is needed, the US military is still not on its best behavior. The Pentagon's policy on gender separation of men and women on military bases is one of the most common and frustrating points of conversation among veterans.\n\nAnd yet the military itself is the root source of this problem.\n\nThe Department of Defense is not the only agency that doesn't offer enough separation counseling when men come to a facility for a mental health treatment diagnosis or treatment. Veterans, too, have had the experience of being forced to go alone:\n\n\"One very senior male veteran, a Marine Corps veteran, was taken to the VA, not to a VA facility, but to the local emergency room and then later a local mental health facility.\"\n\nAs recently as the late 1980s, there was a growing awareness on how to best handle men coming into the department to be diagnosed with or treated for various mental disorders or medical needs. This awareness led to a shift in policy from prior to the mid-2000s, when men could be admitted to the VA's main mental health hospitals in a timely manner and not be separated.\n\nNow, nearly 25 years later, the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), which serves as the government health care provider for veterans, still doesn't have the tools necessary to separate men and women during a mental health visit. The VHA's current policy allows for immediate diagnosis and treatment, regardless of gender or disability status, and in most cases does not permit full separation.\n\nAccording to the Department of Veteran Affairs, if a veteran is referred by the Veteran Affairs Department within the VA to a different VHA health care provider, that particular veteran may be discharged or be placed in a different facility. However, the VA can't separate a man from women who are being treated for domestic violence until an allegation of domestic violence is filed with police. The policy is still as haphazard today as it was on the day of the original policy's inception, but that's largely because there has been no new development or new research about this issue.\n\n\"You're going to hear many different reasons for why this policy hasn't changed,\" said Liza Featherstone with the VA Mental Health Service Administration of the US Office of the Assistant Secretary of VA, in an interview with the Washington Post.\n\nFeatherstone said that until the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination in employment, healthcare, and rental policies, the Department of Veterans Affairs was forced to put in place its own policy on gender separation.\n\nBut since the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the VA's right to restrict the use of marital status in employment decisions, the VA has been able to put in place policies to separate male vets without further legislative action.\n\n\"The other problem is the VHA is still stuck in its old ways. They'll do an internal investigation that sometimes will take 18 months to a year, and it usually involves a male who's saying he's had some problems and they end up doing this separation for the veterans who are being abused and neglectful,\" said Jennifer Jones, an employee of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, who has been with the hotline since the 1980s.\n\nIf the VA is able to hold a separate investigation, men might have the entire time spent in the hospital without getting the help the law says they deserve and they'll still be treated as if they're being investigated for domestic violence.\n\n\"[Male veterans] go to the hospital because they can't afford their own place. They do so much better in a hospital situation than off the base. But, as soon as they come to a VA hospital, we say 'No, you have to go home and take your medication,'\" said Jones.\n\nThe problem with this internal investigation and the bureaucratic hoops a veteran must jump through to even be separated from his wife isn't only that it can have a negative impact on the morale of a veteran trying to treat his mental health. It also has a negative effect on the military's ability to do the job it was hired to do, and that's preparing men for war.\n\n\"[Military service is] one of the single best predictors of who goes to war and who doesn't at the age of 18,\" said David Perry, a professor of international relations based at the Fletcher School at Tufts University, to Military.com. There's even evidence to suggest that \"patrol and training\" in the US military are linked to service in Iraq.\n\nThat's because a person who has seen an experience similar to his own, and is willing to sign up, is more likely to support that person in taking their country into war. There's another reason why a person who joins the military, is willing to fight for his country and is ready to go overseas, is going to get into combat sooner",
      "You know, in this day and age, I'm shocked that in our own day we ever have to discuss the idea of women's rights, but that's the way it is. The way things are right now and how things are going, the only thing you can do and should do is work and make money, and that's not really going to change anything when it comes to women's rights in terms of what's going on in our society. It isn't going to change the way women are treated right now in our society. All it's going to do is create something more like it in the future. People don't go around wanting a society where women are treated just like men on equal footing. It's just the way things are.\n\nYou could look at the way American society has grown on issues like gay rights, drug use, and women's rights. We've come a long way and there is nothing we can do to stop that trend. The problem is that because you're a white guy, it's not going to happen to you. You're in a position where you see yourself on the cutting edge of progress on certain issues—but other people are not. It's sad to see, because in my opinion, we're all on that same level. There's no way around it. And that's why when women's rights are in the minority when it comes to society, people still talk about women's rights. Because it's so hard to see women's rights as a whole when so many people are on the same level as you. If you have the luxury of being able to live from paycheck to paycheck as opposed to being able to see how women's rights affect your situation, then that is the power of money. It's the power of privilege and it's the most fundamental power the most privileged have on the whole planet.\n\nI'm not saying all white men have the same power, the power that is different. But when you're in a position to help in any way to put in place a more equal society, you should do it. That's what everyone should do, that's what you should do whenever you get a chance to, no matter if you're a man or woman. We can't afford to be in a kind of self-pitying position that we never talk about the way things are today and how they're going to be in the next five, ten, fifty years.",
      "In the past year, the city has installed a system of bike-share stations around San Francisco. The stations (pictured) all use a system of bicycles, with stations spaced at a 20-foot radius from one another, that are shared by a single user. The bike-share system has a unique feature — a docking station, at which users can hang bikes once they've found one within a 15-mile radius.\n\nA New York Times article described the experience of a rider in an interview published Tuesday.\n\n\"I usually take a half hour to get the bike to my apartment, then I just put it back on the rack in two minutes,\" said Sarah Lutman, a 31-year-old entrepreneur who lives in a high-rise in downtown San Francisco. \"I just get on at the stop and I'm on my bike.\"\n\nThe stations are small, and the bikes are easy to find.\n\nLutman said she uses the system more than others because the stations are closer to her home and more convenient to get in and out of.\n\n\"I can come by at lunchtime and I could go home and not worry about it,\" Lutman said.\n\nThe Times article explains that about 400 of the 200 stations the city is planning to roll out have the docking stations. The stations have a bike-share app where users can check out a bike, book it into a docking station nearby, or check out a bike from the station while it's parked. Users pay a daily rate based on how many bikes they check out. The bike stations charge an annual fee, which is based on usage, but the system can be managed using a monthly or annual pass.\n\nAn example of a San Francisco bike share station (Photo: SFMTA)\n\n\nLutman said she usually uses a monthly pass, because one dock can hold up to five bikes. The system also charges for docking fees at some stations.\n\nThe system, in an email to KPIX 5 News, said docking fees were being applied to the docking stations as a \"one-time fee\" and would be refunded after 10 days. The company said the system, from the ground up, is all digital and the pricing model would not change.\n\nLutman said she wasn't concerned about the fees, because she knew she'd be back to check out the bikes at a different station after 10 days.\n\nThe companies behind the New York bike-share system say they have raised at least $2.2 million from investors. They said the revenue would come from docking fees and the program, which was modeled on Seattle's bike sharing business, Go Capital, which raised roughly $400 million over the past five years.\n\nThe companies did not provide additional background on funding for the bike sharing system.\n\nGo Capital's president, Paul Allen, wrote in a blog post in July that he started working on the concept in 2010 and has been working in the public bike-share business since 2000.\n\nAs of July, Go Capital operated a bike sharing system in Boston. The system now owns and operates three bike sharing companies — Motivate Bike Share, D-Cycles and Spin. A fifth vendor is slated to be launched in the next few months, but Spin didn't want to comment on the San Francisco launch, saying they hoped to start in \"substantially fewer than six months.\"\n\nThe bikes are priced from $7 to $18. A month's membership costs $70, though the company promises unlimited trips for a price that's $10 cheaper than the cost of a monthly pass.\n\nGo Capital is using a business model similar to one used by a company called Alta Bicycle Share in San Francisco: charging a monthly fee to members and charging a fee for each trip.\n\nAlta's business model was created by Alta Cabs. The service has been successful, growing from 15 bikes in July 2011 to 350 bikes in today.\n\nThe bike-share kiosks in San Francisco's market are located in the Tenderloin and Hayes Valley area.\n\nLike this: Like Loading...",

      "\"The one thing that's important to note, of course, is the time element: it's only December,\" Dr. Robert Stenstrom, director of the Center for Health and Wellness at Tufts Medical Center, said in an interview with HealthDay.\n\n\"So, the data is going to be limited for a while. Our initial findings are encouraging. People are feeling better and getting better, and the longer period of time that we have in which they'll feel better has been a very encouraging sign,\" he noted.\n\nThe findings are a result of a study published last week in the Journal of Clinical Oncology that analyzed data from 1,071 adults ages 40 and older at the Mayo Clinic.\n\nThe researchers used information on body mass index (BMI), smoking status, medical history and blood pressure, among other measures, to analyze the participants' weight and blood tests during the previous year.\n\nOf those surveyed, 4.3 percent had Type II diabetes, according to the study's findings.\n\nThe researchers defined Type II diabetes as a condition of the body's immune system that causes blood sugar levels to reach such high levels that they can affect cells that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates the metabolism of blood sugar.\n\nThe Mayo Clinic study is small, but researchers are still trying to determine how people are managing the disease, a problem caused by lifestyle choices such as diet and exercise, the researchers said.\n\n\"The study is preliminary, and the results are just beginning to be validated. We have yet to validate the findings that we found in this study,\" Dr. Stenstrom told HealthDay, adding that it is possible that the disease could take longer to control, as the average diabetes control period is much longer than the average person's lifetime.\n\nThe findings could make a difference in how cancer patients and persons under the age of 65 respond to health care providers, said Dr. Stenstrom, who is also president of the American Cancer Society.\n\nType II diabetes is usually diagnosed earlier in the process than Type I, he said, and in addition to limiting glucose intake, patients can try to help prevent the disease by controlling their calorie intake.\n\nFollow MyHealthNewsDaily staff writer Rachael Rettner on Twitter @RachaelRettner.

      "In the years since the 2008 financial crisis in the U.S., there has been talk about the need to address the lack of \"fuelled demand.\" This has mainly been discussed in terms of reducing the amount of credit in circulation, through either expanding the size or scope of mortgage lending, or by introducing a \"market for credit\" as a form of capital discipline. These strategies are often proposed by governments as a means of helping the poor and the unemployed avoid falling back on debt peonage through excessive credit — a strategy dubbed quantitative easing (QE).\n\nWhile QE will likely play a role in addressing the shortage, there is another potential strategy worth consideration as well. It has been argued that the rise of digital currencies like bitcoin could help stimulate demand for bitcoin, which is currently in a rather precarious position.\n\nBitcoin's Price is Rising on the Hype\n\nThere are a few reasons why, at this point, there is such a clamor to embrace Bitcoin. The first is that it has proven its viability by being able to maintain a price in the tens of dollars over more than two and a half years. This has allowed individuals and businesses to test its efficacy as an alternative currency.\n\nWhat also is important is Bitcoin's low inflation rate: its value is defined as the total quantity of bitcoin issued with every bitcoin. Since the Bitcoin protocol has no central authority, the value of Bitcoin is independent of the whims and capriciousness of Bitcoin miners and users alike. While this is very difficult in practice, its viability in developing nations like Brazil is already apparent.\n\nMoreover, as most of the world's most important payments systems operate entirely through cash, their customers are usually unaware of Bitcoin's existence. The lack of awareness and distrust of other electronic currencies is the primary cause for today's Bitcoin glut and instability. At $1,250 per coin, Bitcoin may be worth even more in the current market conditions, but it is doubtful this will last long.\n\nHowever, given the current state of Bitcoin and its scarcity, it may be a while until Bitcoin becomes a staple within the world economy. While there was talk of cryptocurrencies being accepted across major retailers and payment platforms, like mobile payment services, mobile wallets and online payments, only a few have shown interest. However, these services are still too new to make the leap into mainstream use.\n\nNevertheless, it is worth remembering that Bitcoin is not only a currency. It is also an asset class with potential growth, and it will continue to be so, especially as governments make their regulatory decisions on the future of cryptocurrencies.",

      "What would your name have been on the ballot under our old system? (And yes, this was a rhetorical question.)\n\nAs you likely know, we have a new, highly controversial method of nominating candidates for president, which is the use of a caucus — essentially, a vote on the floor of the state conventions. It is designed to give all Democrats a say, to help members of the same political party feel that they're being heard.\n\nUnfortunately, the process is fraught with problems for Democrats. For example, it puts a bunch of party insiders in charge. It limits members of Congress' power to be able to make a difference (which is why I support Sanders). It creates a system in which our state chairs will appoint those who represent them at the state party caucuses, often making it possible for the chair to control what the delegates do.\n\nNow, I realize that there are a lot of good people in this room, and many of us are just plain tired of politics as usual. I also realize the party structure in Iowa could not be reformed. But instead of running from the very real problems of our system, I'd like to propose an alternative way forward.\n\nMy suggestion to reform the caucus system would be to give it the same system that existed in Maine — the \"binding caucus\" system in which delegates are bound to the results of the caucus, and are not allowed to change them.\n\nFor example, our current system:\n\nIf your candidate gets less than 50 percent of the vote, you may stay home\n\nIf your candidate gets more than 50 percent of the vote, you can vote for anyone\n\nIf your candidate gets less than 33 percent, you can vote for the candidate with the next highest vote count, up to one-third of the caucus delegates, regardless of the outcome of the vote\n\nIf your candidate gets more than 33 percent, you can change your vote anytime you liked between now and the state convention\n\nSo, if your candidate got less than 30 percent of the vote, you can go home on caucuses where your votes are supposed to count, and be free again to vote and vote for your choice. You may, however, not change your ballots unless your candidate actually does better than the margin separating you and your next choice. And, of course, if you want to change your vote at all from one caucus to the next, you'd need to do it before the state convention.\n\nWith this system, we would have a system where we would actually be able to govern the caucus, not just use it as a way to pick the state party chair. It would give Iowa Democrats a chance to actually get control of their party, instead of just choosing politicians.\n\nSo this year, it comes down to this: I know the state party chair and caucus chair will try to ignore me. I know they will try to keep this caucus a closed caucus. I know they will try to limit who comes into the caucus, and the number of people who can be seated at the convention. I know that if the rules are changed, they will go back to their old ways.\n\nThat may or may not be the case this year, but the fact is that when I get up to speak, I will have a small group of people representing the same small group of candidates that I was hoping to have representing Iowa Democrats.",

      "The last three weeks of the 2012 regular season saw one of the most incredible stories in the NFL -- the Jets' last-minute victory in Indianapolis.\n\nBut what happened in the final two minutes in Indy? How come they went to the field on time, and what was that final series of plays that allowed them to win on a last-minute field goal?\n\nHere's a primer on the Indianapolis Colts' final two plays in the victory over the Jets.\n\n1. Three-Minute Drive, 17-17\n\nThis drive by the Jets begins with a play that many teams never think they would see. On 2nd-and-9, the Jets are lined up in their base defense, with Michael Vick running the clock, and he finds Steve Breaston to pull the ball down to the Jets' one-yard line.\n\nA lot of teams probably would've just picked up their third-and-goal from the 1-yard line, but the Jets decide to go for it. The play starts in Vick's right corner of the end zone.\n\nThe Jets need one yard in order for the onside kick to be successful, but they don't have enough time. So they line up for their two-point conversion.\n\nInstead of taking a knee, Vick takes off across the field for five yards and then rolls to the sideline. He takes a knee again, and then takes off again to get to the second-and-short.\n\nThen, on 3rd-and-1, he rolls out, takes a knee -- and gets the ball to the one. The Jets need one yard in order to get the onside kick to be successful, so they're now down to third-and-3 at the Colts 36-yard line.\n\nInstead of taking a drop, Vick slides around the formation, gets inside of a Colts defender, then takes off to the one, the last time he would be on the field in this drive.\n\nAfter the Giants scored the last touchdown of the first quarter, the Jets needed to score again in order to win the game. They had a two-point conversion on their own 1-yard line with about three minutes left in the first half. They needed this, but no game plan would have gotten them to the second-and-goal, on a short field from the Colts' 38-yard line. Here's why:\n\nThere's two more Colts defenders to account for -- one at the line of scrimmage, and the second one at the goal line.\n\nTwo yards, and two Colts defenders will be in the area where the play is blocked.\n\nTwo yards, and one Colts defender will be in the area where the play is blocked.\n\nTwo yards, and neither Colts defender will be in the area where the play is blocked.\n\nTwo yards, and three Colts defenders will be in the area where the play is blocked.\n\nThree yards, and only one Colts defender will be in the area where the play is blocked, and just one Colts defender will be down the seam.\n\nThree yards, and then the ball goes forward -- and as the Jets defense tries to get over to stop it, they leave too many men in the area to block it.\n\nWhen it's third down and two, the Colts have 13 players down the seam, and four men in the backfield to block the play. The only men down the seam left are a linebacker (Shaq Mason), and a safety (Eric Walden). But Walden also goes to block for a Jets defensive back, so he's also not the only down-the-shemastr line man to block the play.\n\nThat leaves four blockers -- two Colts defenders, a linebacker, and two running backs -- all on the same side of the field.\n\nThat leaves eight men at the line of scrimmage, in a three-receiver set -- four Colts defenders, two offensive linemen, and two running backs.\n\nIt's a perfect time and place to block for Michael Vick, and the Colts make a great play by going for it. On 1st-and-10, the Jets block for Vick and kick a field goal.\n\nThe Jets score on the next play.\n\n2. Three-Minute Drive, 19-19\n\nThis is when the real story begins.\n\nBy now, most everyone -- including Jets fans -- realizes that the Jets needed a win in order to make the playoffs. Even though the Colts held the lead and the Patriots looked unstoppable on offense, it was not enough.\n\nThe Jets still wanted what it would take to compete for the playoffs: they needed a victory. They needed to score enough points to get into the playoffs, and they needed to pull out the victories against the Cowboys and Steelers.\n\nThe Colts still didn't need a win in order to win the NFL Championship, but they felt it was a good chance. They wanted to win",

      "It looks like a giant pair of glasses that has been used to cover a pair of ears, until you look closer. This strange design was developed back when the Nazi regime was trying to combat Nazi ideology and in the process cover up any obvious Nazi symbolism.\n\nThe Nazi Helmet from WWII looks like a giant pair of glasses until you look even closer. This strange design was developed back when the Nazi regime was trying to combat Nazis ideology and in the process cover up any obvious Nazis symbolism. What does it say about modern times that a design that may have been originally created to battle communism has become the norm for Nazi memorabilia and even the design of the German military? This kind of thing is indicative of how much society has changed and how much is still to change.\n\nHitler was an avid artist, his personal art collection was known for its eccentric nature. The art contained a large number of unique photographs, which were often accompanied by Hitler's often idiosyncratic comments. Some of the most popular pieces included photographs of Hitler and the Nazi troops in action; images of Hitler surrounded by children; a painting Hitler in profile with one arm raised; and photographs of Hitler's infamous private plane.\n\nI love the fact that Hitler was an avid photographer and so was his family and many others. It's interesting that his father owned and worked at the famous photo studio of Theo van Doesburg in Amsterdam. This allowed van Doesburg to take photos of Hitler when Hitler was young at school or during photo shoots that were part of the Nazi party's propaganda war.\n\nHitler's most famous portraits can be found in museums all over the world. A notable example of this can be found at the German Foreign Ministry Archives in Berlin. The collection itself is housed in a dark and damp vault, with heavy steel doors that have been used to contain priceless artefacts from the Holocaust. The photographs here have been carefully selected by staff who know how important and unique these documents are, as well as how sensitive they are to damage.\n\nThis has been a long time coming, as a small exhibit called 'Holocaust: Nazi Collectables and Other Items' was first unveiled by the museum in 2009.\n\nA small crowd of visitors have gathered to watch the show. The collection was previously on display at the German Foreign Ministry in Berlin. Visitors have also brought their own photographic prints to take to a nearby museum to print as part of the exhibition but some people are choosing to ignore this by bringing their own pictures.\n\nAnother interesting feature of the exhibition is one which looks like it may be a secret room. This room is actually two rooms that sit side-by-side in the museum. One room is filled with personal items; such as the book that Hitler wrote while he was being treated in a mental hospital. The second room contains some of Hitler's private art collection which includes a large collection of pictures of girls and women.\n\nThis is a strange sight, especially considering just how popular Hitler was in German art at the time. Hitler was frequently seen surrounded by adoring girls and even girls and women who wore provocative outfits. In some cases, Hitler was seen in the company of young girls dressed up as maids, dancing together in front of his art collection. Some of these girls were actually assistants to the Nazi leader.\n\nThis show was originally put together in conjunction with the Berlin History Museum before it was transferred to the Munich History Museum in 2011. Some of the people attending the show are clearly not interested in seeing the show, but instead in posing for pictures, some of which are obviously being taken for some reason. One of the German visitors in attendance says \"that's not very nice, it's not art\". Another male visitor said \"that's disgusting, that should be done somewhere else, not in a museum\". It's fascinating to see how some people still feel this way despite knowing about Hitler's past.\n\nThis exhibit has been extremely well-received by everyone who has seen it. It's obvious that art from the time is often deeply rooted in the political beliefs of time. As we've moved forward and look at things, the fact that this exhibit is so well-received proves that it's not just some throwaway artifact.\n\nIt's interesting that while the show was originally commissioned to commemorate Hitler's death, they've taken this opportunity of an exhibit to showcase some of his artwork.

      "The University of California is \"looking for something\" with \"a good name,\" according to the university's dean of admissions.\n\nBut the search was done after the UC Berkeley chancellor sent a message to the U.S. Department of Education on Jan. 4 saying there was a \"clear need\" across the campus for \"a new admission process.\"\n\nA letter from Chancellor Nicholas Dirks to the Under Secretary for Civil Rights Elizabeth Wilkins said he had asked to make sure that the Department of Education \"fully understands the intent of this announcement and the concerns we have raised about the process the campus is using for admission and admissions process.\"\n\n\"When I spoke to Secretary Wilkins, I asked her to consider the broader implications of the action and the need for a new admission process for colleges and universities who, having previously admitted undocumented students to our student body, need to rethink that process,\" Dirks wrote. \"Our university is looking for something with a good name, and we've asked for it.\"\n\nUC Berkeley Chancellor Nicholas Dirks says the campus is looking \"for something with a good name\" with a new admissions process and with \"a clear and consistent goal\" for undocumented students, who may be confused about legal immigration status or feel discriminated against under current college admissions policies. (U.S. Department of Education)\n\nDirks said the U.S. Department of Education is looking to \"determine if a new process is needed or if existing processes are adequate in the best interest of students.\"\n\nThat is an unusual response from the university, which has been publicly fighting any effort to provide more clarity to students and parents about immigration status.\n\nDirks' letter to Wilkins said he wanted to make sure that there would be \"a path forward to clarify the admissions process\" for all UC Berkeley students regardless of legal status in the wake of the Jan. 26 announcement by federal immigration officials that they will be granting protections to approximately 800,000 undocumented people living in the country.\n\nAs part of the announcement, President Obama said that the University of California would \"immediately\" develop a process that was \"comprehensive, objective, fair to all applicants, including students from other countries and of all backgrounds, and ensures that undocumented students can receive the opportunities that will lead to a productive life and a bright future.\"\n\nUC Berkeley, Dirks said, is one of roughly 180 institutions that has signed on to the U.S. Department of Education's new plan, which will offer a pathway for undocumented immigrants to \"graduates of our nation's colleges and universities.\"\n\nDirks said in his letter that the search for a new admission process \"appears to focus largely on one point of reference: whether existing processes for securing a B.A. degree make a transition to an admissions process in which a student may be eligible for the benefits of DACA.\"\n\nDirks went on: \"What concerns me is that the process to be considered calls for a single point of reference for all students, regardless of their legal status. The plan does not call for a process in which students from certain socioeconomic backgrounds [emphasis added]: the 'priority minority group.' \"\n\nIn his letter to Wilkins, Dirks cited federal guidelines that already require colleges and universities to consider the ability of an applicant to \"read and follow directions\" and to \"understand and demonstrate academic and personal growth.\"\n\n\"There has been no requirement to consider 'economic status,' \" he continued in his letter. \"I understand and appreciate your desire to ensure that all students, regardless of their legal status, are treated fairly, but the process for developing a new admissions process may require some adjustments to the current processes for the benefit of all UC students.\"\n\nDirks said the university was seeking to \"avoid any misunderstanding about the circumstances under which applicants will qualify under the new criteria\" to receive a B.A. degree from UC Berkeley.\n\nUC Berkeley President Janet Napolitano has said she is trying to \"help our students navigate the complexities of federal immigration laws.\"\n\n\"The University of California stands ready to help students in their quest to gain a degree that sets them up for the future with the skills they'll need for a fulfilling career,\" she said in a statement. \"We look forward to continuing to work with the federal government on these matters, just as we do on any issues related to our students and to their future goals.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",
      "PATNA: BJP on Saturday said it was proud that its government had brought to the state an ordinance to ensure the right to reservation in government and private jobs for socially and educationally backward class (SAD) and scheduled castes , a bill to replace the recently passed Bihar Backward Classes Act, and a scheme to ensure reservation in higher education for the women belonging to the Scheduled Castes and Tribal Communities (SCSTC).This was a continuation of the party's criticism of the state government's move to bring to the state anti-reservation legislation and said it was committed to providing reservation to the economically weaker sections of society.SAD, which includes Jatavs as well as other backward communities, has not been given reservations in the state's public employment. Though the legislation to make such groups eligible for reservation under Section 15 of the Constitution was passed in the state in 2009, no decision was taken to implement the decision in practice.A senior government functionary, who did not wish to be identified, said the bill was under the \"tender stage\" but it will now be placed in the House for discussion.The SCST community in particular has complained that, in recent times, most government jobs that were left vacant remained unfilled due to low demand from them. The provision of the bill would ensure reservations at the level of \"per se\" in public positions, including those in the private sector. It would provide for 50% reservation in private government jobs for SCSTs.The proposal to amend the existing provision of Bihar Backward Classes Act to provide reservation at the level of \"per se\" in both public and private sectors came after a petition filed by the Jatav group and others seeking reservations in the private sector.The bill also provides for providing 100% reservation in various categories of government appointment under both category and salary system.SAD is a socio-economic category that includes Jats, Dalits and lower castes with the highest concentration in Bihar's Bihari belt. The state has the highest percentage of Dalits among all other Indian states, and it is a significant source of migrant labour from other states to Bihar, which in turn helps raise salaries. The demand for reservations in the Jatav group was in response to the situation where Jats were finding it difficult to secure government jobs due to the non-availability of reservation.\"I welcome the government's decision. It is indeed an acknowledgement of the right to reservation for SAD. We should also note, that the government has also brought legislation to take back quota to Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribes (SCST),\" BJP's Bihar president Rambada Mishra said.Bihar, which accounts for 15% of the total population in India, enjoys considerable reservations for Scheduled Castes and Tribes and a small amount for OBCs, the Scheduled Castes and Tribes and Backward Classes. The Congress was the sole opposition party to pass the bill.BJP has long demanded reservations for the SAD community under the reservation quota in the central and state government appointments. This bill will only be a first step and it would be better to extend the same rights in the private sector too, it said.At least five other state governments have also approached the National Commission for Backward Classes for reservation in government services. While two government departments of Tamil Nadu had taken the decision to give preference to SCST, the Madras high court has ruled that it should not have done so. The Gujarat government had also sought reservation for SCST in government jobs and the Union Cabinet had approved it.",
      "It's not a good thing that some of the most respected names in the sport continue to give the NFL a bad name.\n\nThey are the only ones allowed to do so—the players who make up the NFLPA.\n\nAfter nearly 20 years of working for the union that represents the players in the National Football League, former NFLPA executive director DeMaurice Smith is ready to retire from football. Smith retired in April, shortly after the NFLPA decided to suspend four players who had been involved in the Ray Rice domestic violence scandal: Adrian Peterson, Greg Hardy, Jon Dorenbos and Scott Fujita.\n\nNow, Smith is ready to talk about life away from football. This is not the first time the former executive has decided to retire from football—last year, he did the same and went on to serve as the general counsel for the Department of Homeland Security.\n\nSo if you ask Smith, he would tell you that the NFL is not a good environment to be an athlete, and especially not an athlete in the National Football League. And while Smith hasn't been the official head of the union since this spring, that hasn't stopped him from continuing to speak out about what the players are going through on a daily basis.\n\n\"This league is not for the good of the game,\" Smith said. \"It's not.\"\n\nBefore heading off to retirement for a few years anyway, Smith gave a lengthy interview with Mike Florio of Pro Football Talk that covered a lot of NFL issues. Here are some of his key takeaways:\n\nThe NFL hasn't been a good league for players: \"I've been around the league long enough to know that there is no league out there that is a great place to play and a great place to coach,\" Smith said. \"The NFL is not only not a great place for players but also for coaches.\"\n\nSmith continued on to say that many players are on drugs, and said he's seen players taking over-the-counter items such as pain blockers that aren't necessarily related to painkillers. \"It's all over the place, especially in the locker room,\" he said. \"It goes on so much that it's crazy. Sometimes they have to take the pill from the nurse, but there's still pills from the pharmacy, pills you wouldn't think of that are actually going into the locker room.\"\n\nOn the issue of concussions in the NFL: \"The NFL is doing nothing to help us deal with the concussion problem, because they don't care,\" Smith said. \"It is their job to create the conditions so that people will play as hard as they could and will get a concussion. They make money off of the concussion problem. \"But now that we know what the NFL is doing, how do you say we are going to work for a safe environment? Because the NFL is not safe. And we are not going to work for a safe environment.\"\n\nThe NFL has no standards on concussions: \"I've never seen a concussion protocol that says, 'You have to come back the next game,' but then if the team that has said 'You have to come back the next game,' don't come back the next game. That's ridiculous, to me.\" Smith added, \"I think the concussion issue is going to take care of itself because the league is not going to change its rules or policies.\"\n\nThere are too many problems with the NFL as it stands today: \"As the players know, the NFL has no standards in place for safety, so it is a very dangerous league to play in today. And as I talk to more and more players, I see it and I hear it all the time. The problems are growing.\" Smith said that he doesn't think the NFL will ever change its policies that make it easier in the NFL for players to be punished in any way, including fines, suspensions and other penalties for a player who gets injured in the way of the game.\n\n\"These issues have become so pervasive in the NFL that we have to do something about it, or it's going to continue to be the same because if there is one thing that I know with the players, it's that they will want to be part of something different.\"\n\nHere is the full audio interview with DeMaurice Smith (from Pro Football Talk):\n\nListen to DeMaurice Smith's quotes on \"NFL rules to help reduce concussions\" below.",
      "Anime and manga featuring cute girls have always been a staple in today's pop culture, no matter what age you are. But if you are looking for a brand new anime or manga with lots of girls, look no further than the upcoming \"Sekirei.\" \"Sekirei\" is a short, five-episode anime that will be broadcast next May on MBS. The anime is targeted to be free to watch, but only \"Sekirei\" subscribers will get free bonus videos – one a week.\n\n\"Sekirei\" is a comedy that follows a high school girl named Touko Shirai, who is forced to join the school's student council. As a new member of the council, she has to get used to dealing with everyone.\n\nThe \"Sekirei\" anime also features a heroine who is \"slightly more experienced\" in the school government. This way, the anime can be more accessible for people who may not be as familiar with the characters of the earlier games, which are \"adventure stories\" in the games industry, and are geared for a younger audience.\n\nThe trailer shows Touko being made to become president of the school by Koyori Kuzuhara, a member of the student council. Touko is a member of the school's soccer team and is known for playing a good role in the soccer matches, since she always looks professional. As her first official leader, Touko is supposed to do her best to manage the school.\n\nFor those of you in the East Asian region and just happen to be in the vicinity of Tokyo, then next Sunday, December 6, you can get your hands on tickets for the \"Sekirei\" anime for a very reasonable price. If you are in the region, it is suggested that you use www.mogon.co.jp/Mogon to get your tickets. After the pre-sale period ends, tickets are available for a price of 1,000 yen, which converts to about $8 per ticket.

      "\"We're very proud of the way we do things, and the way we've dealt with this from the beginning,\" Schilling said. \"I wasn't surprised at all when we found out this was going on.\"\n\nIn the past, when a reporter or magazine reporter asked Schilling if he had been disciplined for making inappropriate comments to a female employee — including \"I just hope she puts out\" and \"I hate women, and I really hate the way women act\" — he would simply say, \"Yeah, I mean, I'm just a big old strong male with strong opinions on a few things.\"\n\nIn the past, when one of Schilling's Twitter followers said he or she was \"f—ing gay and I hope you die,\" Schilling responded as if it was OK.\n\nThen when the reporter asked if he'd changed his views, Schilling responded as if it were fine that he'd joked about a woman's weight. He also defended his old comments to the Boston Globe by arguing that he was just saying that men who have affairs and \"don't have a family life and they get a fat wife and a fat divorce\" can be \"better at baseball.\"\n\nSchilling said that his old attitude toward women was just harmless humor. He didn't realize \"it was such an issue,\" he said.\n\n\"I didn't realize how much this would haunt me for so long,\" he said. \"This whole experience has made me realize how much I'd like to be able to just be a guy and have a normal day-to-day life in terms of what people think of me.\"\n\nHe still has his opinion about women. Schilling said that women would be better at baseball if they lost 80 pounds. He also said that women would be \"better at business\" if they had sex with men more often.\n\n\"I guess that was me sort of being too hard on women,\" he said. \"I think women should just take [exercises like] Pilates, and be normal people.\"",
      "As they prepare for their 2016-17 season opener against the Florida Panthers, the Anaheim Ducks announced Monday that forward Rickard Rakell will miss the first six weeks of the season with a lower-body injury.\n\nThe 22-year-old Rakell will have surgery Monday morning to repair a fracture in his lower-body, which he sustained in the pre-season opener against the Winnipeg Jets on Oct. 5.\n\nThe injury is to the left side of Rakell's body.\n\n\"It is unfortunate, but it is something that we are very serious about,\" Ducks head coach Bruce Boudreau said. \"I talked to Rickard and he was down. He had a bad feeling in his leg and he sat out in Winnipeg.\"\n\nDuring his breakout 2014-15 season, Rakell was the third overall pick in the first round of the 2014 draft, the highest selection Anaheim has selected since the team took center Jason Bonsignore with the first pick of the 1997 NHL Draft.\n\nRakell (5'10\", 176 pounds) has three goals, two assists, 32 penalty minutes and a minus-5 rating in 30 games with Anaheim this year.\n\nRakell will wear No. 4 with the Ducks, the same number he had with Kelowna of the Western Hockey League during the 2014-15 season.\n\nBoudreau noted that Rakell \"looked great during the pre-game skate this morning\" and was scheduled to play with the team Tuesday against the Philadelphia Flyers.",
      "A year ago today, it was announced that WWE signed Jey Uso to a deal that would make him the company's first ever black wrestler, a position that they only hold for one night a year. Uso will debut in a few weeks on SmackDown Live, but while he is undoubtedly a WWE superstar, he hasn't wrestled his first match on broadcast television. That doesn't necessarily mean that he won't do so by some miracle in the future (after all, he's a superstar that only one company can afford to own), but it's probably a good idea to plan for the worst, especially when it comes to Uso's debut.\n\nWith all that said, here are my predictions for every NXT Championship match and all of the main-event matches that Uso is set to wrestle this year.\n\nWWE Championship Match: Sami Zayn vs. Sheamus\n\nUso has one good match in his whole career, so he will get the win here and be a big boost to what is already a very crowded match-up of great talents. Although I hope that Zayn gets the win, with the only other contenders in that match only being one very talented young wrestler, I'm going with the one that's already had a memorable match.\n\nWWE Intercontinental Championship Match: Finn Balor vs. Alberto Del Rio\n\nI have no inside info on how this will go down. Finn Balor is one of the hottest talents outside of the WWE, and the idea that WWE would let Del Rio face a more experienced veteran is a complete surprise. However, if they have a surprise win, that would make it a lot of fun to watch. That said, Balor is the current WWE champion, and we can only assume that he is going to come out of this match victorious.\n\nWWE United States Championship Match: Kevin Owens vs. Sami Zayn\n\nMy biggest fear with this match is that it doesn't have a winner, so there'll be no excitement or excitement at all.\n\nElimination Chamber Match: The Miz vs. Baron Corbin\n\nBoth of these guys have proven themselves as the best singles wrestlers on TV after the first few weeks of Raw, and that makes it seem unlikely that they'll lose here. Corbin is getting a big push and a push over the SummerSlam match, meaning that they'll likely go at it until one is sent to the back through a table and the other one has no choice but to tap.\n\nSlammy Awards: The Miz: First Survivor Series Appearance\n\nThe Miz's win in Survivor Series means that he has made it to the main event for Survivor Series three separate times in his illustrious career. The only other wrestler to do so was Bret Hart in 2003 (who started off on RAW, so he wasn't a full-time fan yet).\n\nThe Miz: First Survivor Series Victory\n\nSpeaking of Bret Hart, The Miz made the Survivor Series final in his debut match, which is probably more impressive than him winning in his debut match ever being noteworthy.\n\nSlammy Awards: Baron Corbin: First WWE Championship Appearance\n\nThe Miz will almost certainly win this match.\n\nWWE Tag Team Championship Match: Ryback & Big E Langston vs. American Alpha\n\nIn the Tag Team division, one team can be considered invincible, but one can't. The Tag Champs will definitely beat The American Alpha and take the Tag Team Championship for awhile, but they are a brand of their own with no competition of theirs.\n\nSlammy Awards: The Miz: Tag Team Championship Contender\n\nThe Miz can do this all day long, and he hasn't lost a match as of yet. I'm betting one of the competitors to lose here is him.\n\nTag Team Championship Match: The Miz & R-Truth vs. American Alpha\n\nThis is a must-win for The Miz and R-Truth, because without anyone going over the top to win the title, this looks like a loss on the other side of the bracket (which is really the same story as in the main event). So, while American Alpha seems to have a better team on TV, Miz & Truth definitely will too.\n\nSlammy Awards: The Miz: First WrestleMania Victory\n\nThe Miz has never won any major title that was actually in the WWE Hall of Fame, so of course I'm betting on him as the winner.\n\nTriple Crown Match: AJ Styles vs. Kevin Owens\n\nThis will be the most exciting WrestleMania match of the year, because if Kevin Owens loses, it will be considered the end of Owens' WrestleMania career. And it might be the end of his career. AJ Styles will have to wrestle to make sure that doesn't happen, so I expect him to win here by virtue of him being the next face of the WWE. But then again, he might just beat Owens anyways and he'll be",

      "In a letter to President Obama, Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee calls for a moratorium on executions in the United States. Lee's letter, obtained by WGN/AWA, says President Obama, \"needs to make a decision that is not simply a preference, but based on the science and is in the best interests of all Americans that are affected by this decision.\"\n\nHer letter asks that the execution of drug-involved offenders be put on hold for a year \"to allow for new scientific analysis on the use of capital punishment and to provide further examination of the question of why we have executed so many people, and to hear from the majority of Americans, as well as the legal community, about how the death penalty should be implemented.\"\n\n\"I believe it would not be fair to the majority of Americans that would suffer if these individuals were executed,\" Lee said in a statement to WGN/AWA. \"And on the point of fairness, I think we ought to at least pause.\"\n\nThe Texas Tribune thanks its sponsors. Become one.\n\nLee is among a group of members of Congress who were invited by the District of Columbia Council to meet with members of the city's legislative delegation about the use of capital punishment.\n\nLee, a member of the House Armed Services Committee and a member of the Judiciary Committee, said in a letter last week that her constituents have expressed support for the death penalty and she would hope that a moratorium might prevent them.\n\nThis is not the first time that Lee has called for the use of the death penalty. In 2013, she told reporters, \"For many years now, I've been calling on my colleagues and all members of Congress, and particularly lawmakers on the Armed Services Committees, to consider abolishing the death penalty in this country.\" Lee was a member of the House Armed Services Committee at the time.\n\nWGN/AWA notes that Lee is part of a group of members of Congress who have called for the United States to not be the only member of the international community that executes people:\n\n\n\"As a member of the Armed Services Committee and a member of the judiciary committee, Lee is part of a group of members of Congress who have introduced the 'End the Death Penalty Act,' which would do nothing to rein in capital punishment, but would at least hold off executions until we can figure out the best way to carry out the death penalty in this country,\" said Mark Plummer, deputy director of government transparency with The Brennan Center for Justice. \"Despite her position on capital punishment, it is noteworthy that Representative Jackson Lee is among members of Congress who have publicly called for the United States to not be the only member of the international community that executes people.\"\n\nRep. Jackson Lee is the third Texas Democrat to have called for a nationwide moratorium on executions in the past two years, after she and Rep.

      "The state government has passed a motion making Tamil Nadu one of few states in India where it is unlawful for women to display 'manusmriti' (Indian holy law) on their body.\n\nThe motion was passed by the House during a discussion on the 'Right to Privacy Protection Act, 2016', with the approval of all the ruling party MLAs.\n\nThe state government's motion comes in the wake of a PIL filed by an anonymous man on an anti-woman law that prohibits wearing of skirts longer than a knee-length, which states that only men could worship and perform rituals at the temple.\n\nThe petitioner sought to ban women from wearing manusmriti on their body, arguing that wearing it amounted to violation of freedom of faith and religious expression. He said this not only violated the right to privacy but also freedom of belief. \"In addition, wearing or displaying the manusmriti to a stranger constitutes offence under Section 144 of IPC,\" he had argued.\n\nThe PIL was filed after the High Court in Chennai had directed the Tamil Nadu government not to enforce the ban.\n\nHowever the state government has now clarified in its written reply to the court that the PIL was wrong. \"The wearing of manusmriti on the body cannot be declared illegal. The wearing of manusmriti may be deemed by the legislature or authorities under Article 25 (1) to be a religious worship or act under the laws of a place of worship etc.,\" the state government said.\n\nHowever in a rare move, the state government has also advised the court to refer the case to the Supreme Court.\n\n\"If it is a matter relating to religious freedom, then the highest court of the land should handle the entire matter,\" the government said referring to the apex court's stance on whether right to freedom of expression or personal freedom overrides religion.\n\nIn 2015 the Supreme Court had rejected an appeal against a Supreme Court order banning the display of 'manusmriti' on women, declaring it a violation of privacy under Article 21 of Constitution. It ruled that an individual's bodily functions should be protected from public display. This judgment had brought a ban on Muslim women wearing 'manusmriti' on their bodies.\n\nFirst Published: Jan 27, 2016 19:38 IST",

      "For over 20 years, The New York Times has been a pioneering voice in the arena of social media. When I began at The Times in 1998, we did not have an email service, and the Internet and email was a thing of the future. Now, it is an integral part of what we do every day.\n\nAt a recent conference, I had a chance to have a short conversation with Mark Thompson, the editor of The Times' Web site, and he shared some insights. We discuss how a decade ago, many tech companies thought we were crazy for not using email, and now that so many of them have joined forces with The Times to build their own email services — and some really impressive social services — we should see a shift in how a lot of media organizations work. As The Times is such a powerful voice in online culture, how should we approach these new services? And are there ways for us to build relationships with companies who are trying to get into this space?\n\nThe discussion of email and whether or not we think it is going away is ongoing. Mark's response is interesting because he says that The Times still does not use email to send news or to publish news. He says that we believe that email should be more about collaboration, not personalizing content for your inbox.\n\nWhat we should ask ourselves is whether email is a tool that is available to us in exchange for content. (And yes, I am talking about personalization.) We have a strong identity at The Times. We have a brand and we have a business model. While I am not opposed to personalization, I don't think most online tools or services can work for a media organization like ours.\n\nMark says that there is a huge difference between a traditional inbox and an email inbox. He says most people think they want to use their email for personal interaction. And if you are in the business of creating work tools, email is not a solution. Email is a tool, and the tool should not be used to make a personal connection. While Mark thinks that personalization is a way to build trust, I think we would be better off if we moved from \"personalize\" to \"personalize in a way that isn't personally creepy or intrusive.\"\n\nIn my opinion, if we want to build relationships with these companies, the relationship should be built on trust. And if we are relying on these companies to help us in our quest to build trust, we won't be able to do it. We need to go back to the basics: we need to show real commitment (and work in the right way) to our clients, and we need to demonstrate to our audiences that we have learned from our mistakes and that we are actively going to fix them. You want to know why our website is so important to our readers and advertisers? The site is built off of relationships between us and our readers.\n\nFor example, I spend a lot of time getting updates from our advertisers. (You can read a post-mortem on that here.) My goal as a company is to keep you aware of new products and services which we are involved with, and to get you to sign up for them. I do not want to have to have to have an email conversation with every single ad company I know. I think it would be awesome if our social channels could help build these relationships.\n\nHow to do this? I think we need to show in our social channels that we care about making sure the relationship between us and our readers and advertisers are healthy.

      "I remember the game in 2009. It was as beautiful a game as I'd ever seen. After the Eagles got in overtime against Detroit, I couldn't help but feel a lot of hope. We would get the first Super Bowl win in franchise history. And, I think that's why the game took me so long, and then I never picked up a newspaper until this morning.\n\nI don't remember the time frame very well, I was in high school. We were already pretty close when we played, and it was my first game ever. But after the game when we came back to the locker room, our coach asked me and my friends, \"You ready to go to college right?\"\n\nI told him no. It was still a little before my senior year in high school. But we went in and had a great time. For what it's worth, I didn't know any better at the time though. I just thought it was cool to go to college.\n\nIt wasn't until three more years ago when I found out that I had cancer. I had it in my head that I couldn't make it to the next game, because I'd lost my voice from the cancer.\n\nI'm glad we got into the playoffs, and went to four straight Super Bowls, and even made the big one two years in a row. I think when you add a year, that makes it three Super Bowls. But when you look at it, it feels like I was already a part of it, at least that's what I tell myself.\n\nI'm always rooting for my friends to have the most fun possible and live the greatest life that they can. I always think about all of us together.",
      "A woman in the UK is taking a stand against the \"rape culture\" and asking her to stop blaming her own rapist instead of the real rapist, after his DNA was found on her underwear.\n\nThe woman -- who claims she is in her 30s -- was attacked by a stranger at a hotel in Sheffield, South Yorkshire, while on vacation with her friend. The case went all the way up to the court and her attacker's conviction was later overturned.\n\nBut the woman is still angry that the case was not taken more seriously due to the woman being a non-White immigrant who could not get a fair trial under the current system.\n\nShe was raped in a hotel room last year when she was with someone she trusted.\n\nThe woman told the BBC:\n\n\"It made me feel disgusted ... I felt as though my victim status was very much to blame.\"\n\nThe crime and her subsequent defense was even the subject of an op-ed for The Guardian, in which the author, a White female journalist, blames herself for not \"trying hard enough\" on behalf of the non-White victim.\n\nThe woman states she decided not to \"put one foot in front of the other\" and instead tried to protect her friends.\n\nBut, she adds, \"You can't just do those things and hope that it will all work out.\"\n\nShe also says that in the meantime, she is \"tired of the 'Rape culture' attitude... that all rape victims are women in danger because of their dress, their behavior, or their culture\" and is now \"asking people in positions of power to stop blaming rape victims, their clothing, or any other behavior.\"\n\nThe woman, who was raped after a night out at a restaurant with her friend, is now calling for people who know her attacker to take a DNA sample and give it to police so that they can connect this DNA to her attacker.\n\nThe incident was mentioned in the article \"Women's Rights After Rape\" by author Emma Jane Kirby.\n\nHere's what Kirby had to say about the case:\n\n\"I went to [the rape] trial because I thought that, if the DNA found on my friend hadn't exonerated him, it would have at least helped his case. \"But I was disappointed. The defence tried to prove that my friend had lured him into the bedroom by sending him to the shops. Yet the only evidence the defence collected in this case was a receipt with the victim and her friend's names and details - a detail that would have been impossible to miss had my friend been walking down the street.\"\n\nThe fact that an entire investigation could potentially have been put into jeopardy because of clothing or drink can make any rape accusation -- be it \"drunken\" or not -- a very \"risky\" one indeed. And the fact that the investigation could have so easily been put on hold because of the clothing in question has to stop.\n\nThe woman, for her part, also wants people to stop blaming her for being raped. She writes:",
      "A new book by author and political scientist Robert Putnam claims that social science evidence suggests that the American way of life has declined over the past decade. In particular, Putnam blames the increase in inequality. The study says that the bottom 50 percent of the population has received almost no income growth since the 1970s and that the top 1 percent (the top 0.1 percent and the top 0.01 percent) has seen a large increase. (To put the income data in perspective, the average U.S. household earned $58,000 in 2012).\n\nThe results in Putnam's new book, The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined and Societies Have Succeeded, are based on a number of studies that find that there has been a decline in violent crime rates in almost a dozen countries around the world since the year 2000. For example, the murder rate in the UK has dropped by more than 50 percent since the '90s.\n\nIn the US, however, there has been no real reversal: The murder rate in 2012 was 5.1. The United Kingdom has a 25.4 percent higher murder rate.\n\nHowever, according to data put out by the FBI, overall the murder rate in the US is down, while violent crime is up. In comparison, the violent crime rate has more than doubled since 1968 in most parts of the country. The murder rate in England and Wales, by contrast, has plummeted since 1979, dropping by half in the last 31 years, though violent crime has increased by about 40 percent.\n\nThe murder rate in the US can also be compared to countries like India, Greece, Iceland, South Africa, Australia and Canada, among others. In most of these places, murder rates are declining or flat. When it comes to violent crime, however, the US seems to be lagging behind the rest of the world in the 21st century.\n\nHere's a chart put out by the Bureau of Justice Statistics based on FBI data on the murder rate in each of the 50 states and the District of Columbia at the time of its most recent report in 2013 (the 2013 data include the most recent three months for each state):\n\nThis chart shows that, even including recent upswings in violent crime, the murder rate in the US has been relatively stable. Putnam attributes most of this stability to the fact that many areas of the US are relatively safe compared to other places in the world, and that this is because many communities are very close to one another, and \"because of the fact that the homicide rate is highly correlated with income. Since the average homicide victim is in a lower income category, the homicide rate in the U.S. is much higher in places with higher incomes.\" But Putnam also thinks that the lack of a significant national crime wave since the '60s is a major factor.\n\nPutnam's view may be hard for some people to swallow because of how much we've enjoyed violent crime in the past few decades. The average murder rate in the year 1999 was 8.1 per 100,000 people, a 10 percent rise since 1961. We've also experienced a rise in other murders, including suicides, drug-related crime, assaults, and even the most horrific murders. A study last year from the Center for Disease Control estimated that about one in eight people on Earth died of a violent crime last year—that's more than 400 million individuals.\n\nBut the fact remains that there is no real national crime wave and that any decrease in violent crime rates (relative to the rest of the world) is more than likely because of the changes in policing and sentencing laws that have taken place over the past half-century, the legalization of same-sex marriage and the decline in violent video games.\n\nOne of the reasons Putnam puts so few pins in the murder rate is that it is still too young to see a national crime wave, meaning that it might just be too soon to tell.\n\nIt's also worth mentioning that the FBI's overall murder stats are not quite accurate in the same way as Putnam's more specific figure. Putnam uses the FBI's annual Uniform Crime Report to define murder broadly, meaning that the vast majority of murders aren't counted by the FBI.\n\nA more accurate statistic would be the murder rate in large metropolitan areas, particularly the ones with high levels of violent crime in general. This is likely the biggest number of murders that the FBI counts, and it's where the murder rate has increased the most during the past two decades.\n\nPutnam does put in some good caveats about the limitations of his analysis, however. Some of his findings rely on assumptions and statistics that he doesn't control for. For example, he doesn't take into account differences in the population by age or gender, nor does he take into account social factors such as urban centers, suburbs, urban neighborhoods, the level of urbanization of the country, or the level of violence.\n\nBut, for the",
      "\"The only thing this country has got to fear is fear itself, and that's the real reason why the world needs American leadership.\" ~ Abraham Lincoln (attributed)\n\nOn April 1st, we got some \"F-bomb\" news from our friend The Blaze:\n\nPresident Obama on Friday sent a written request that any information about people involved in the investigation in Benghazi or the attack in Pakistan must be disclosed to Congress as it related to Benghazi and the Sept. 11, 2012 attack in Pakistan that killed the US ambassador.\n\nIn the past, congressional Republicans have used the issue of the Benghazi attacks as a way to launch an unrelated investigation into the IRS's targeting of tea party groups. In fact, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced his intention to hold a \"special\" investigation into Benghazi just days after the White House requested the Obama administration disclose who was involved in the attacks that killed Amb. J. Christopher Stevens.\n\nThe idea is that it would keep the administration from burying the issue in a report.\n\nThe administration maintains the reports are classified and that any information they release would provide the wrong impression.\n\nThat's a little ironic, considering the reports in question were released over a year ago in the form of a report by the Accountability Review Board, chaired by Ambassador Thomas Pickering, which concluded that the security situation in Benghazi was not as dire as has been portrayed, but that the lack of security was due in part to the State Department's failure to have adequate security planning for the UN outpost in the city.\n\nMore to the point, Pickering recommended that the State Department consider the recommendations of a House report that was already underway, but when Pickering saw its conclusions, he called for more staffing in Benghazi and suggested the administration adopt recommendations made by his own panel to better protect US diplomatic facilities abroad, according to the American Foreign Service Association's \"State Department and Security at US Embassies and Consulates Worldwide.\"\n\nAfter the attack, officials said the embassy had been attacked \"once or twice\" before, but never with such effect.\n\nBut this Benghazi investigation, and the investigations that have followed it into other parts of the administration's foreign policy, have only served to underline the GOP's point.\n\nTo the right, Benghazi is nothing more than another political \"scandal,\" an attempt to make the administration look bad.\n\nTo the left, Benghazi is an opportunity to attack and denigrate the Obama administration, which has a history of responding to acts of terrorism, whether real or perceived.\n\nThe Obama administration itself is caught in the middle.\n\nWhat happened in Benghazi, a city of just over 25,000 people, was traumatic, and for days after it happened people struggled to determine whether or not the attack was terrorist, political, or something else.\n\nIt was initially believed that it was related to the anti-Muslim video that had sparked violent protests three weeks earlier; an administration official told the Washington Post they \"feared\" a backlash from al-Qaeda but the incident later came to be believed linked to a demonstration against the film's \"distasteful\" content (rather than an extremist group).\n\nBut despite all the initial reports that came in, the Obama administration was slow to address the incident.\n\n\"While the administration has described the assault as a terrorist attack, it hasn't officially acknowledged that there was an anti-Muslim video factor,\" wrote The Guardian's Andrew Miller. \"And it has still not released video footage of the incident to counter the idea that the attack was connected to the violence in Cairo.\"\n\nBy the time the Obama administration finally came to its senses, it was too late to respond.\n\nThe Obama administration has refused to release a transcript of a three-hour phone call between President Obama and the Ambassador to Libya J. Christopher Stevens, where he tells Stevens \"the ambassador and all of our people are safe.\"\n\nAs a result, and despite reports that the US embassy in Tripoli was attacked by gunmen a week earlier, the White House has not commented.\n\nAnd unlike Benghazi, and unlike Benghazi-like incidents prior, the attack in Benghazi was not an isolated incident in a foreign land.\n\nThere are multiple reports that the attack was a pre-meditated attack on the U.S. embassy in Egypt. US intelligence officials have reportedly told CBS News that Egyptian authorities may have planned an initial attack in Cairo months ago but when it came time to carry it out, the Egyptian government informed the US embassy they were no longer capable of carrying out an attack. \"We tried to get them to change their mind, but they said they have been informed by the leadership that they couldn't carry it out,\" an intelligence official told CBS News.\n\n\"We have intelligence that indicates they may be planning an attack against US personnel and interests overseas, we urge Egypt to do everything they can to protect our personnel, facilities, and facilities around the globe,\" said an unnamed State Department official, according to Reuters.\n\nEven after the",
      "The New York Knicks were expected to trade for DeMarcus Cousins prior to the trade deadline. The Philadelphia 76ers were not as lucky.\n\nA report from ESPN said the Sixers had \"very little\" hope for the future when they were dealt to the Knicks in a six-player deal on Thursday. The report quoted an unnamed source inside Philly's organization as saying, \"It's dead.\"\n\nThe report added the Sixers have now lost three straight games and are struggling to get ahead of the game on either end of the floor. They are 3-11, and coach Brett Brown isn't happy about the effort level.\n\nThe Sixers were expecting to offer the most talent for the Kings in a deal for Cousins, which could have potentially involved the Kings trading DeMarcus Cousins and Jrue Holiday at the deadline.\n\nThe Sixers were hoping to land All-Star point guard Jason Terry's expiring deal — a deal Philadelphia has attempted to make several times in the past few years.\n\nThe Kings were thought to have the best shot at landing Cousins, who has been a fixture in front of the home fans of Sacramento since being acquired by the Kings in a February trade with the New Orleans Pelicans.\n\nThe team was expected to be a darkhorse contender in the Western Conference. However, the Sixers have been a disaster of an organization thus far this post-season.\n\nThe Knicks were expected to add back up guard Courtney Lee after the departure of Tim Hardaway Jr. to the Atlanta Hawks. Lee had been on the trading block for years, and there was even a report from Sports Illustrated's Chris Mannix earlier this season suggesting the Knicks were in talks with Lee to facilitate a trade.\n\nThe Sixers also reportedly received two second round picks, but no prospects. The Pelicans apparently didn't want to receive any compensation for their young core in trading the two second round picks for the Kings' 2018 first round pick. The Kings' 2018 first round pick is protected 1th to 3rd.\n\nThe Pelicans had a deal in place with Phoenix for Eric Gordon that would have cost the Suns an additional second round pick. However, the Suns were unwilling to give up their 2018 first round pick in the deal if Gordon was on their roster.\n\nIt's been a disappointing start to the season for New Orleans, which was widely expected to contend by many as they look to make a deep run in the postseason.\n\nThe Pelicans have been without their starting point guard Jrue Holiday, and their point guard and center has both been out of action. They have the 11th worst record in the Western Conference.\n\nThe Sixers don't have a player from their 2017 first round draft class on their roster yet. Rookie Nik Stauskas was expected to be a lottery pick and was projected to be the best player in the draft at the moment. However, the Sixers took Joel Embiid #4 overall and Stauskas #32 overall.\n\nNerlens Noel is a top five pick in 2017. They have Joel Embiid, a lottery pick, Nerlens Noel, Dario Saric and Jahlil Okafor. The Sixers will also have Joel Embiid after next season, and he has already been sidelined for a number of games with a stress injury.\n\nEmbiid has been the most disappointing Sixers rookie thus far in the early going.\n\nAlthough the Sixers started off slowly, the team has managed to keep their pace in the right direction, and could make a decent case that they would have been better off without Embiid in the lineup.\n\nThe Pelicans are likely to bring in a few players in trades — maybe even acquiring a player from Los Angeles for Jrue Holiday — in the next few days.\n\nThey need to either make a trade offer for Eric Gordon, or be willing to lose Gordon's $7.7m salary in a trade. Gordon is coming off the worst season of his career, averaging 15.0 points and 4.6 assists on 43.6 percent shooting.\n\nThe report from ESPN said the Sixers were planning to offer Gordon a two-year deal worth an average salary of $8.5m over the next two seasons.\n\nNew Orleans seems very uninterested in making any moves. However, the Pelicans would likely like to move Anthony Davis as soon as possible for assets. They are reportedly planning on moving him as soon as they can.\n\nThe Sixers could use Davis in the trade for Embiid, but Davis is already being paid a lot less now than he was when he played for the Sixers. A trade for Davis might be cheaper than a deal for the Pelicans' young talent. However, it is unclear if the Sixers would be willing to give up Davis' contract as part of a trade.\n\nThe Pelicans also don't have very large trade exceptions. They reportedly have $4.45m in exceptions they are not spending at this point. It's expected they will use some of their exceptions in a deal",
      "\"I remember that for 10 years, I had a black belt in karate,\" says James \"Jimmy\" Jones, a retired Army major in the U.S. Army who is a retired black belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ). \"But, I just couldn't get through all of the rolls in one piece. I realized that the only way to develop the control and self-confidence on the mat that I needed was to go to the gym and train like a regular person.\"\n\nWith this realization came a change. Jones, then 39, decided to drop his karate black belt and give martial arts a shot: for 30 days training in BJJ, he lost 70 pounds and got more control over himself and his actions and, subsequently, more self-confidence. He went to the gym and found out that BJJ was becoming more popular and was in demand all over the world, especially in countries with a large population of former military and law enforcement personnel.\n\n\"Since I was a black belt, I could never train in other styles,\" Jones continues. \"I used to go to a school in Tampa [Fla.] that was doing a lot of Brazilian jiu-jitsu training and I didn't like how they just threw out techniques and passed it off as jiu-jitsu. I wanted a class that would teach me the basics so I could truly be on my way to becoming a black belt.\"\n\nAs Jones worked on his BJJ skills he started to take to it more and more.\n\nThe first thing Jones noticed about BJJ as he started training hard was that it is very mentally taxing.\n\n\"It's a very demanding sport. I was always a guy who was competitive and worked extremely hard at certain things so that I could be the best,\" he says \"But doing BJJ made me realize that I was going to have to work harder, too. I started off with a heavy bag or a barbell at the gym but that never made me the toughest fighter in the gym. BJJ taught me to take everything seriously — be willing to work hard at most tasks within your discipline, and not just because those things are a prerequisite of jiu-jitsu.\n\n\"You have to work with your technique no matter if it's to get yourself better. It's very much a technique-based game and there are no shortcuts to it,\" he continues.\n\nJones also found that his confidence soared after he started training in BJJ and not just in the fighting.\n\n\"For the first couple months I was extremely hesitant when it came to going in [to a BJJ class]. You start out trying to look around yourself when you are doing your guard pass. That is when it hit me how intense it was and how much control I had,\" he says. \"After a few days a new energy took over and I wanted to go in every single class. It was amazing to realize that I could do more and better than I had thought.\"\n\nA new fitness level was developed within Jones. \"It was a new level of energy; a new level of awareness and concentration that I had never had before,\" he says. \"I became much more aware of my body and my surroundings, I noticed that I couldn't always be focused on my opponent as much. It was the beginning of a transformation of my training and overall mindset.\"\n\nWith this new attitude he gained from his training in BJJ, he decided to take the plunge and take his old skills all the way to a black belt, and it seems that he hasn't looked back since. Jones is a four-time MMA champion with a record of 15-2, winning all of his fights by knockout. His most recent fight was a first round submission of former world champion and submission grappler, Kazushi Sakuraba.\n\n\"I feel like I could be better than ever in these past few years,\" Jones says. \"It was the best time in my life training BJJ because I realized how strong my mind could be under the right training environment.\"\n\nAt the end of the day, Jones simply found his own way to improve from any type or discipline or sport. No sport was too hard for the black belt to achieve, no style of martial art was too difficult to learn.\n\n\"You see other black belts training in some of these more difficult disciplines and their mind is very different from mine,\" says Jones. \"I realized that I was just an average guy that wasn't meant to be a BJJ competitor. I became a black belt solely so I could learn how to train in the best possible environment.\n\n\"When the time is right, you need to make a decision on which discipline is something you're truly passionate about and want to pursue in your life,\" he concludes. If his passion and dedication and talent can take him anywhere, I'm a happy man.\n\nJames \"Jimmy\" Jones is a black belt under Renzo Gracie and one of the",
      "Grimm is one of the more well-known DC and Marvel franchises and to date every movie has been a critical and financial success. In fact, the last two installments in the franchise grossed over $1.2 billion in the United States. We're excited that Edgar Wright is directing the next installment called \"Baby Driver\" at Netflix, which will be helmed by Wright's frequent collaborator/supervising director of \"Paul Blart: Mall Cop\" and \"Shaun of the Dead.\"\n\nThis is a bit of a spoiler, but I'm going to give you two quotes before I begin explaining the plot. You've been warned:\n\nBaby Driver is a character driven road ride that is set in a world reminiscent of our own (with some major differences). It centers around Baby as he navigates a world in which criminals are on the loose. But before he is pushed off the bridge to his own death, he meets a young kid named Aiden and discovers in his own life-long dreams that they can make things right.\n\nThe second quote is about the fact that we have a character like Baby (a.k.a. Earn) in the first place. He wasn't even in the first movie, and if that's not a strong statement of purpose it's hard to say what is.\n\nWe're not really sure what story Wright's first movie focused on, but we're pretty sure it was very much a \"you either play by the rules or get run over\" tale, because that's essentially what happens to him when he turns down offers by the big boys. You know, like the ones who make that movie.\n\nThere are also some other \"no surprises here\" clues. The main guy who's the protagonist of the first movie and then dies in \"Baby Driver,\" played by Edgar Ramirez, was really cool and we were all like, \"Oh, that's Edgar Ramirez. Right, that's why it sucks that he died.\"\n\nThis sequel will be a bit different. In the first, there was also the problem of making a movie, and also the mystery of what the real reason for doing a movie is, and the other guy is a cop who's part of the movie's plot without showing up, but then, well, that all makes perfect sense.\n\nIn \"Baby Driver\" it sounds like there is only one major problem. That's it. You don't really need to figure out what story Edgar Wright's first film was about. It was basically about the problem of how you make a movie, and it was solved because they had to focus.\n\nAnd we think that's true!\n\nWe don't really need to know why Earn's family came to a certain destination where he was in danger. We know why the first movie took place in the first place. It's not like he's going to go around asking people for information on his life and his life's plot.\n\nAnd that seems to point back to Baby – something that we've heard about before, but for whatever reason we haven't seen a solid explanation for. How does he get there? How does he keep the vehicle moving? What exactly is going on? Does he have an agenda of some kind that he needs to know about (or will he just not care)?\n\nSo we're going to be waiting with bated breath on the following two questions…\n\nQuestion One: What's the point?\n\nThe second movie ended with Aiden leaving him alone, having died, and the car in his possession rolling away. We're waiting to see if Baby is going to turn back into a big, hulking wreck and be left standing in the middle of the road like the driver from the first movie. And we will, I promise. Because we have a very good feeling this will end without him ever being able to see it coming. But this doesn't even have to be a bad thing, though. We could just have Baby in the car the whole time.\n\nThen again, maybe he's going to turn back into a hulk and leave the car at first because he's a hulk!\n\nThe biggest difference from the first movie and the second is the character. The first movie is about the main guy who gets pushed off the bridge because he isn't nice (and we're guessing he's not being nice because he's dying), and then the second movie is about a guy who goes from being kind of annoying to not even being annoying in the beginning, and then he becomes a badass badass, and then he makes an ally in Earn. But the main guy is the driving force in both movies, with both movies ending with the main guy dying, so this one will have to remain a secret.\n\nBut why does Edgar Wright's movie seem to revolve around Aiden? Are they going to get together?\n\nIf we start with the first movie, the story seems to revolve around Aiden getting pulled into",

      "\"I just came up with a little trick I'm proud of. It's so simple I'm surprised it has taken me this long to figure it out.\"\n\nIf people know you can get anything done with a twist of the wrist, then why are they so shocked when they see you do it? We love how this sentence goes, \"We're all about the little tricks.\" We've all done them. Or even better, we've all seen them, and they're so obvious. Here are nine ways your mind can be fooled into thinking you've mastered the art of creativity.\n\n1. Go to the movies and watch all the trailers for your favorite movies.\n\nYou're probably not a movie expert, but you know what they all have in common? They're great movies. You watch a couple and start thinking about them. You know exactly when you're missing something, when they've left you hanging a bit. And you get the feeling that when you see the end credits, it's time to get going. You get the feeling that maybe you should just pick a movie at random and see if it's good. You get the feeling you'll like a movie with this name or these characters.\n\nDon't do this.\n\nDon't sit there looking for the next trailer in the hope you'll have a breakthrough as you watch your favorite movies. Don't think you're an expert at recognizing how movies work. Don't even think it's possible. Why take the chance?\n\n2. Have the entire week of the movies ready to watch.\n\nAs if being able to go in and out of the movie theater doesn't suck, now you have to sit and wait for five minutes for someone to take the curtain off so you can start watching.\n\nThere's nothing worse than a movie theater full of people, just like there's nothing worse than a movie theater with a curtain. What if you could watch the movie for five minutes at any time and instantly know the ending. Or even better, what if you could start watching the movie and, instead of watching, you were doing? As it turns out, movie theaters have something called \"Time Dilation.\" If you sit in a movie for more than about four hours, you start to feel sick just watching something for four hours.\n\nIt's a small, well-known, effect but if you can put it into practice, you'll have the time of your life.\n\n3. Go off work for one day and do nothing.\n\nYou've been told that you could do five things for just one day and you'd be surprised what you could get done. You can put yourself into a really relaxed mindset for this. You can eat whatever you want. You can do the dishes. You can sit for hours in front of a computer and try something that doesn't seem stupid. You just leave work. It's just one day. It's a day you can use to accomplish something.\n\nNow that's not to say you need to do nothing for a full day. There are things you can do when you start to feel like your mind is having trouble processing information when you're on the bus. Start doing anything in an unproductive environment so your mind has extra room to process information but not so much room that you get overwhelmed and can't get anything done. If you can't do anything productive, just remember to be productive. If you do go off work for one day, then plan to come back and do whatever you need to.\n\n4. Set an alarm that sounds like a telephone ringing and goes off a long time after no one rings.\n\nThis works because there's a lot of information flowing through your mind at any given moment. When the alarm hits, it's like the phone is ringing and the information stops flowing through your mind.\n\nHow far in advance could you do this? Try something that will trigger the alarm but doesn't have a definite amount of time. It might be 10 minutes before the alarm goes off. Or it might be an hour before it starts. You could even set the alarm for a week long, but just say 5 days out. That way you don't have to set it every day because it will come back to you.\n\n5. Write an 8,000 word story for your college magazine.\n\nYou can say this is a difficult task because there's no deadline, but think about it. You have about a week between when you do write your story and what your college's student magazine will print. The magazine's deadline is on the third day of publication. If there's no deadline, you could be off the magazine by the end of the week. If you want to put a lot of effort and effort into your publication, then put a lot of effort into your story.

That's a question that people ask when they have a hard time finding a toilet they can use while on your period, is there something wrong with me? Well, no, not at all. However, it is quite important that you know the facts about using the toilet while taking hormones. If someone isn't willing to tell you that you're bleeding or have an infection or they'll say \"it will all break out eventually\" then you may be stuck using the toilet with a bloody or infected toilet-paper roll. Don't worry, though -- there aren't any medical issues that are life threatening. And while it's perfectly normal for a person on hormones to have some vaginal discharge, pain during urination or cramping of the muscles in the bladder, the only things that can be diagnosed as an emergency are infections, an injury that requires immediate medical attention (to avoid infection or injury), and pregnancy. If you're having a hard time finding the feeling that you're bleeding is normal, or if you think you may have an infection or you're feeling pain and cramping, or have the thought that your period is \"too heavy,\" that's usually nothing to worry about. I'll try to answer questions people may have below (if you want to be in touch with me, drop me an email and I'll respond personally). Don't forget to check out the video below!",
      "If it helps and you're looking for the perfect gift for the person living in your city, you may have stumbled across the great blog The Diner.\n\nIn a post about the best places to meet people around town, they mention an online poll to \"define 'best' to you.\"\n\n\"The Diner is not a site that gets an opinion poll,\" says the post.\n\nWhen The Diner got their question on the subject, they ran it again:\n\nWhat did you consider the best place to meet people in 2015? It's the best one that's on my list #TheDiner — The Diner (@TheDinerToronto) January 24, 2016\n\nHere are the winners of the online poll, according to The Diner:\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nRooftop Skydeck at the Toronto Art Gallery\n\nThis is the best spot for the most obvious reason: It's really, really fucking nice. You can have a glass of wine and soak up the views in a really fun way.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nThe Toronto Art Gallery, the Toronto Reference Library\n\nThe TTC is free, so you can easily make it to and from work without having to worry about getting in line for another train. That includes the library, which is definitely the most accessible of all these spots.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nToronto Public Library\n\nIf you want to look at some really cool stuff, this is also the place to go — especially on the weekends. We think.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nThe Canadian Museum of History, the Toronto Reference Library\n\nWhat kind of museum would this be if it didn't have a roof deck?\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nCrowne Plaza Hotel, Waterfront Toronto\n\nYou can stay at this place during the week, and have access to the Toronto Reference Library. The hotel also provides free cable!\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nKensington Market\n\nThis is one of my favourite places to meet people, so of course it won. Plus it has pretty easy access to the TTC and the downtown core (in case you need a break from your normal day job).\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nThe Royal Ontario Museum\n\nIf you're in the neighbourhood around Toronto this winter, this is the first museum you should go to. It's pretty much an indoor museum; if you're a budding artist you can hang out there and work on some of your own projects.\n\nI recommend grabbing a few free museum passes beforehand if you're not familiar with how this works. A short trip to the park is usually all you need!\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nYorkdale Mall\n\nToronto is a great city for people who like shopping, and this mall is a great place to shop! Plus it's close to the subway — which means you don't have a car and can hit the subway any time.\n\nThis is a great spot for meeting people for dinner, too.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nWentworth Market\n\nThis area is known for its eclectic shopping and lots for the family, so a visit here is a great way to meet people in that kind of environment.\n\nIt also has the best public transit you can get downtown, as well as a wide range of restaurants, bars, and cafes for you to enjoy.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nVideogame café at the Arcade\n\nIf you enjoy meeting new people, then this is a good place to start. You won't find a lot of people there who share your tastes. And it's not too crowded either!\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nWendy's\n\nIt's a Wendy's, so it's not too crowded either. There's more than enough space for you to eat, drink, and chill out — and it's right next to the TTC!\n\nThe only drawback here is that it's quite a bit closer to the city centre, so in the evenings you might find a lot less people at places like the arcade.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nCherry Beach\n\nCherry Beach is one of my favourite places to go on a day trip to Toronto. With the ocean on the other side of the island, this place is quite picturesque.\n\nIt might be a bit too much for you if you're a water person, or if you enjoy swimming, but it's one of the least crowded parts of the island, which is definitely a plus.\n\nBest Place To Meet People In Toronto\n\nOld Toronto Church\n\nIf you want to get out of the city and into the countryside (which is what we do, basically), then this is the ideal spot.

      "The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has the power to regulate the safety and efficacy of drugs, but in the past five years, the agency has adopted relatively few of those rules for the use of non-prescription drugs.\n\nThe agency has, instead, focused on regulating prescription drugs like opioids, over-the-counter drugs that can be mixed together with water and used interchangeably. But that has left non-prescription medications vulnerable to abuse.\n\nAs The Hill reports:\n\nIn 2015, the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research issued a draft drug safety communication saying that, in order to ensure that medications do not pose an unreasonable risk to the American public, the agency must \"review and consider\" the risks of medications.

      "Image: Shutterstock\n\nOver the past few years, digital security firm CrowdStrike has emerged as a major player in the field of online data breaches. Its research is sometimes cited by other researchers as the top source for the recent widespread online hacks of high-profile companies. But, its CEO and president have been sharply criticized by some activists for pushing a highly politicized theory about Russian espionage to shore up the presidential campaign of Donald Trump.\n\nCrowdStrike has been named by journalists and others as the top source on the DNC hacks. There have been some accusations that CrowdStrike's work is being used for political reasons by the Trump campaign in a supposed attempt to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders, who had promised to do something about cyberhacking following the DNC attacks. A number of reporters at various outlets have cited evidence that the emails that were stolen in October from DNC staffer John Podesta's account were forged by the Russian government.\n\nSince CrowdStrike emerged as the primary source of the DNC hacking, it has been the subject of significant controversy among many activists.\n\nImage: CrowdStrike\n\nCrowdStrike was first hired by a Democratic senator, who cited the company's research as proof of the Russian breach. It was the other way around that another group of researchers hired by the House Intelligence Committee was named by journalists as the source of the DNC hack. Since CrowdStrike emerged as the primary source of the DNC hacks, it has been the subject of significant controversy among many activists.\n\nBut CrowdStrike's work can be used against it. The organization's founder, Dmitri Alperovitch, is a longtime US government official involved with cybersecurity issues and the military. And one of the people who has hired CrowdStrike to help investigate the DNC hack is Fusion GPS, a pro-Trump political research firm. The firm is currently being investigated by the FBI regarding its involvement in the Trump campaign's digital activities.\n\nAlperovitch has defended his company, and said in a conversation with Motherboard, that Fusion GPS was not consulted on the DNC hack investigation, and that his company is only doing its due diligence work regarding the hack.",
      "On the morning of Nov. 11, 2013, three members of the Delta Tau Delta fraternity at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill were shot in what is known as \"Halloween weekend shootings.\" As a result, two students, one student in the same fraternity and a student in another fraternity were shot and injured, and a third student was shot and killed.\n\nThe first freshman killed in this incident was 22-year-old Kiesha Jenkins, daughter of the Phi Kappa Psi president. She died shortly after the shooting.\n\nFive days later, four students, including a freshman, were shot and injured on the eve of a homecoming football game between UNC-Chapel Hill and Duke University. These two incidents occurred less than three miles away from the fraternity house in which the first shooting took place.\n\nThis is the story of the shootings, the aftermath and the aftermath of Jenkins' death.\n\nTHE SHOOTING ON OCT. 26\n\nPolice say that three brothers entered Kappa Alpha Order's fraternity house, 817-819 Piety St., on the night of Oct. 24 after hours. The two others inside the house were taken to UNC Hospice.\n\nThere were five people home for the night, including three older brothers and two students in the fraternity. According to police, one of the fraternity members came into the house at 7:15 p.m. and started banging on the door. The two older brothers were also upstairs in the house.\n\nOne of the two brothers came downstairs after the other brother returned to the lobby, which he had just exited. He had a handgun in his hand, police said.\n\nAccording to police, the brother who came downstairs opened the door to the brother in the lobby and they began fighting. \"They both went into the bedroom and one of the older brothers then took a shotgun from his room and fired once or twice,\" police said in a statement. Jenkins was shot in the chest.\n\nThe other brother said, \"He was just in there having fun, and he shouldn't get shot.\"\n\nOne of the brothers fired at least five times, a bullet piercing his hand. The other brother then shot Jenkins with another round. Jenkins died in the hospital.\n\nThe younger brother, whose name and age were released by police early this week, was suspended from the fraternity, and the other brother was charged with first-degree murder and two counts of attempted first-degree murder.\n\nAfter the shooting, police searched the fraternity house and found a shotgun in the bedroom. Jenkins wasn't the first student found dead at Kappa Alpha.\n\nON SEPT. 9\n\nThe fraternity brothers returned home soon after midnight, but the students didn't hear any gunshots. The brothers said they went out to dinner at a local restaurant, then came back to their dorms and began checking the other residents' rooms.\n\nAround 2 a.m., the brothers left the residence, only to be told by their roommates that someone had been shot and that someone had been taken to UNC Hospice, according to the statement sent out by UNC police.\n\nThe men returned to the fraternity house, where they found two other people had been shot and that two other people had not been shot. The roommates called 911, and they and a third student went to the hospital to try to save the two students who were shot.\n\nThe roommates said that after their call was made, one of the brothers came to the residence and picked up a handgun, which was in a locked case.\n\nThe third student was found not to be injured and not shot at the scene.\n\nOne of the brothers said he was the person who shot Jenkins because Jenkins was trying to go into the room with a weapon, according to police. Two roommates corroborated this and reported that the younger brother took out the weapon.\n\nThe brothers told police that they couldn't get the gun from the case. However, there were several other people in their room with them at the time, so they believe the weapon was dropped by one of them, the statement says.\n\nOn Nov. 9, police said that a search warrant was issued and that it was located in a storage room of the fraternity house. They said the Glock gun was located there. Another roommate said that at one point, he was hiding under the bed when he heard three shots from inside. No other students were killed by Jenkins during the incident.\n\nTHE SHOOTING ON NOV. 10\n\nIn the afternoon of Nov. 10, four students reported hearing gunshots at approximately 11:30 in the morning while they were standing off campus eating lunch by the pool. One student said that they heard about 10 rounds go off from a distance and one student said that someone yelled \"I'm gonna die.\"\n\nThe first student described their actions as \"absolute chaos,\" but they were not sure what had happened.\n\nThe first witness, one senior, says",
      "I've come to understand that you, too, have questions as to the legitimacy of the Mormon Church. For whatever reason in your life, someone may have told you that your belief is incorrect, but you had trouble proving it. Maybe you can't explain why you left your faith or why it went to bits. What I can suggest, though, is you have several important things to say now that you are well-informed on the matter. First, it's critical that you understand why the Church is correct on certain issues and not on others. Second, it's critical you learn more about the history of the LDS church. This is an important part of your quest. Third, this is important when you decide you are a Mormon, especially if you are not religious.\n\nMormon history, at least in its current, modern form, has a lot of holes in it. The Mormon founder, Joseph Smith, was a good-hearted, but naive man. He had his first vision in about 1820, the same year Adam, the first person, came around the next circle of our tree of life. For years, he spoke many good things in response to his call for the restoration of the gospel. One of the things he spoke was that when he was up on the mountain being transfigured, he saw the heavens open. The Lord told him to ask what he saw and in response, Smith says he saw God the Father and Jesus Christ—two separate people.\n\nAs the years go on, there were more and more revelations and prophecies that Joseph wrote as the church slowly gained traction. These prophecies told of a new creation where all things will be reorganized into a hierarchy. Joseph also prophesied about the \"great and last sacrifice\" and how all men would be resurrected. He talked about the \"restitution of all things\" and said it is near in the future and that the Church and the kingdom of God is soon to come forth. However, what many don't pay attention to is what Joseph taught about eternal families. To Joseph, families have always existed and continue to exist—even for those who will be in the Celestial Kingdom. Joseph taught that God loves his children and that they are to be with him forever. He also taught that if a person is a pure, righteous, and dedicated person, they will be able to enter the Celestial Kingdom when they become an immortal soul. To further this idea, Joseph taught that the \"souls of the parents, and the children, and the grandchildren of each person who has a celestial birth, are eternally united\" (D&C 131:27).\n\nThis doesn't sound very interesting at first glance. But Joseph often said that his purpose in all the words he wrote was to fulfill this plan. In this way, his words were much more meaningful than when he simply recounted the Lord's promises. He believed so strongly in the divine message that he would not write anything less than it was. At the same time, he would take things out of context, but he never misrepresented what Jesus taught. On the other hand, his words were not completely devoid of doctrinal flaws. When he began to describe polygamy, for example, he started out by talking about a man sleeping with his wife. When he said that \"even as the Lord our God lives, whose family are we?\" he was simply referring to Adam; it was not a commandment to all people.\n\nJoseph Smith had a lot of difficulty keeping any commandments, much less being a polygamist, when he was alive. The Lord told him to hide His priesthood power until he was dead. Joseph continued to practice plural marriage even after he had died and was no longer an apostle. He told them to do as he did, even though he felt it was wrong or, perhaps more accurately, foolish. Joseph would simply add verses to the Old Testament. He went against what the Lord told him repeatedly. Yet, even this did not stop him from trying to accomplish many of those things he commanded them to do. In his final years, he was still trying to help people learn about polygamy, the gospel, and the temple. This is where history comes in. In the beginning, there were many conflicting theories regarding Joseph's life and the nature of religion. We have many documents from the day, and from now until eternity, we will not be able to determine whether it was a hoax or a true account of the life of this man. When Joseph found out that a man named Samuel Harrison Smith (of whom he was a great admirer) had stolen a treasure map that had been hidden in the ground with a special seer stone that allowed him to recognize where it was on the earth, he called for his sons, Hyrum and Samuel, to accompany him. After they had completed what seemed to be a very perilous journey, Joseph stopped when they reached the desired spot. He did not know what to do and could only pray. He asked God to guide them in any way they needed. This gave",

I was in Vegas last October for the opening weekend for the World Cup tournament, and when my son and I were away, I was able to catch up on some \"soccer\" – which is now my favorite sport!\n\nOne of my favorite things about the World Cup is the jerseys of each team. In 2011, the U.S. had a brilliant design, with its navy jersey with white trim and red letters.\n\nThis year the U.S. changed their uniforms, so the navy is gone and I'm a little bummed, especially that the country got rid of the red letters, which are some of my favorite words to see on a t-shirt!\n\nAnd then there's the Brazil team. It's hard to beat the blue and white of that team!\n\nYou can see some of the designs for each team below.\n\nThese are all available in the official online shop on team shop.com, and I know you won't be disappointed with what's available.",
      "Pilot\n\nI remember when I first started reading about virtual reality that the phrase \"the holy grail\" popped up. The idea that you could have the best of both worlds, immersion, and interactivity. And I wanted to be able to do that. I wanted to be able to jump right into a game and just play while sitting down in my favorite chair, in my own home. Not just play it, feel it, but feel like I was a part of it. At some point that was just impossible in a regular living room.\n\nIt's still impossible. At least not in the most efficient way possible. In fact, for a long time the ideal way with a VR headset was that it needed to be placed in a space that was too big for the headset to see the room and your entire field of view.\n\nThat's fine when you're using motion control. It's super handy and easy. But when your game asks you to move around a virtual world that's just a little too small for your headset to track, you wind up with a lot of frustration if you're not looking for ways to speed things up.\n\nEnter the holodeck.\n\nIn Star Trek: The Original Series, this technology was known as a holodeck. And it was the first example of \"virtual reality in a living home\", because we were using those screens for a lot more than mere immersion. They had the ability to display the 3D environment around you on the screen, but you were able to manipulate the environment to your own liking. That is to say, you could fly your ship around an asteroid field, shoot your way through a nebula, and even look your enemies in the face and tell them I am not here to play with you. It was fantastic!\n\nHowever, holodeck technology improved over the course of the 50's, 60's, and 70's and really got its big break a little over a decade after The Original Series. Enter Star Trek: Voyager. When we got to Star Trek: Voyager the holodeck concept was completely changed: there were no holograms, just panels of various types which displayed different environments like rooms, corridors, and so on. And then there was the holodeck room itself. You could actually enter the holodeck and go about your usual business.\n\nThis is where what we call VR really took off—it was here that immersive experiences in a living room became both feasible and realistic enough to be considered \"usefull\". And because it's not just a big screen or a giant projection; it can actually work in a room that is small enough to give you what you need to do—to sit down and do something. It became the \"holy grail\" of immersion and I've only talked about the holodeck as a first example—there are hundreds of different ways that you can put VR into your very own living room.\n\nBut all holodeck technology is not created equal. They all give you somewhat of what you need to do your business in a more convenient and convenient way. All of them are based on the same premise. The technology works by placing a screen—called a \"Holographic Imaging Device\" (Hi-D)—into the very center of the room. The goal is to project the exact same 3D environment that you see outside on whatever surface you are looking at into your eye. There are many methods to do this, but at its most basic level, a virtual reality headset (either virtual reality or augmented reality) would project a 3D image onto a small piece of glass or plastic like the holographic display you have on your phone.\n\nBut while most of these holographic displays work by projecting 3D images of what the user sees right in front of them (as a hologram), the next best option is to show the 3D environment on two separate screens, which will allow the user to look down at whatever surface they're looking at (as a virtual) and get some 3D effects which are projected into the user's field of view as a hologram.\n\nFor example, in the picture to the left you see what is known as a stereoscopic display. Basically the user is looking through two different screens which are not aligned with one another. They are simply projected onto one another, giving the illusion of depth. This type of holographic display was the first of its kind. And in the next couple of pictures, you can see stereoscopic displays that have been perfected over the last few years.\n\nAs you can see in this picture, the display on the left features 3D holographic imagery that is projected straight into the user's eye. Because those holographic images are coming from different panels, one panel will show the user a \"straight on\" version of the object they're looking at, the other will show a 3D hologram of the object they're looking at. This is just the basics. The real difference I want to make is",
      "Tens of thousands of young Americans are being drafted to fight in the global war on terror, and a shocking number are being forced to fight for Al Qaeda or radical Islamic groups across the world, a new report reveals tonight on RT.\n\nRT investigates allegations that American soldiers are being recruited and forced into a war against their will:\n\nRT: One of the most alarming things you see in this report is the amount of young Americans fighting on the other side of the world. The numbers, and a lot more are left out of the report, who is the exact number of American soldiers that are serving abroad? What are you finding out about that?\n\n\nJ.M. Berger: Well, it's a little bit more than we know because the Department of Defense and the Department of State are currently keeping a close eye on it, and a little bit is being told to me, but that's about it. We do know, according to a recent report from the Center for Security Policy, that there are now more than 40,000 U.S. troops serving in foreign countries. So we do know about tens of thousands of young Americans that are serving in conflicts on the other side of the world – Iraq, Syria, Libya, Somalia, Afghanistan, Yemen – and the numbers are increasing. There are 20-30,000 veterans of both the Iraq and Afghanistan wars that have gone back to their home states. Now the numbers are still rising and growing. So we do know that there are tens of thousands of young Americans serving in conflicts around the world and we must not forget about young Americans being recruited by the enemies of the United States. We must not forget that in the years since 9/11, we have seen an upsurge in jihadist recruitment across the world and they believe – and this was the report from the Center for Security Policy – that between the two wars that we have now been a part of, approximately 40,000 US soldiers were actually fighting on the other side. The numbers increased from 15,000 in 2002 to about 40,000 in 2012. It has grown very fast. It's not even an increase in numbers – it's upsurge in activities. And it is very concerning that not only do we have upsurges in terrorist activity, but we have tens of thousands Americans serving in this very dangerous wars abroad.\n\nRT: What should the American people and the people in this country be made aware of about this situation?\n\n\nJB: Well, it's a very serious situation because it's an absolute war that has to be fought, and you have to understand that they are not just there to fight wars for some vague ideological cause, it's actually for ideological reasons. And it's not really to fight terrorists in particular, it's to actually take part in an ideological war, and that's what Al-Qaeda, that's what ISIS stands for, is all about. It is very dangerous, it is very dangerous, because now the United States has joined forces with the Islamic State and we know what ISIS does. They're killing Christians, they're killing minorities, they are raping women and young girls, and we must not forget that many of the groups who are now battling ISIS in Syria and Iraq are the very groups that our own government has supported.\n\nRT: Many Americans and US military personnel were involved in that September 11th, 2001 terror attack on the World Trade Center. What about the people that you're talking about? Why should we be concerned by it?\n\n\nJB: Well, first of all, I would not use 9/11 as an excuse to send another 50,000 American soldiers, you know, to go fight in another war overseas. They have never fought in any war before. It is not their military past which makes them the ideal to go fight in another war. Now people have this idea that you're going to go fight in a hot war in the Middle East and you're going to fight for an extreme ideological cause, and this is simply not the case. The truth is, this is a war – and this is what we have just witnessed when ISIS began to launch its offensive in the north of Syria. First of all, they are fighting people that call themselves moderate Sunni forces but in practice are actually the jihadist, Al-Qaeda fighters, who will kill anyone that they see as an infidel. So these American soldiers, they are fighting Al-Qaeda and ISIS and other Jihadist. This war is also for a cause that has been promoted by the US political and financial sector for years and years – which is to overthrow the government of Syria and to remove the President who was elected to lead that country. So as a matter of fact, the whole reason the US and other NATO nations are launching cruise missiles at Syria tonight is in order to topple the country's government. So this is a war that we can't just sweep under the carpet and say 'oh, it was a mistake.\" Because these are young Americans who are already being taken into it and now they are",

      "\n\n\n In the US, there are a lot of tax advantages for owning businesses.  \nFor example, the IRS gives you a tax deduction for the amount of money you spent on your business of work.  In theory, that should result in an income tax lower than what would be given under the standard deduction.  \nAs you work, there is a certain amount of money that is taxable as income, but that would be added to the tax you owe.  Once you add all of that to the tax you got, you want a tax deduction, which is another amount of tax that is not deducted.  \nThe IRS also allows you to deduct expenses for a certain amount of work, and that means your entire tax balance is lower than if you were able to deduct every bit of that amount.  \nOne thing that the IRS considers to be deductible expenses is the cost of supplies for running a business.  That is, if your business were to be paid by checks mailed to you and he owned them for a long time, then his account might also have a deductible amount",

      "IndyCar and Formula One are both types of open-wheel racing, which means the wheels of the car are not covered by the body of the car. Both types of racing feature cars that are designed to be very fast and lightweight, and both types of races take place on tracks that are specifically designed for racing. However, there are some key differences between IndyCar and Formula One racing. One of the main differences is the size and shape of the tracks that the races take place on. IndyCar races typically take place on oval-shaped tracks, while Formula One races take place on tracks that are a mix of straights and turns and can be either oval-shaped or more winding and twisty. Another difference is the rules and regulations that govern the design and construction of the cars. IndyCar and Formula One have different rules about the size and shape of the car's body, the type of engine that can be used, and other technical details. This means that the cars that are used in IndyCar races are generally not the same as the cars that are used in Formula One races. Finally, there is a difference in the level of competition between the two types of racing. Formula One is considered to be the highest level of open-wheel racing, and the teams and drivers that compete in Formula One are generally considered to be the best in the world. IndyCar is also a very competitive and popular form of racing, but it is generally not considered to be at the same level as Formula One.",
      "\nMagnetic stripes are still used on credit and debit cards in the UK because they can be a convenient and reliable way for merchants to process transactions, even if a chip and pin system is available. The magnetic stripe contains information about the card and the cardholder, such as their name and account number, which can be read by a card reader at a store or other point of sale.\n\nEven though chip and pin technology is more secure than using a magnetic stripe, magnetic stripes are still commonly used because they are easy to use and compatible with a wide range of card readers. This means that merchants don't have to upgrade their equipment to accept chip and pin cards, which can be expensive.\n\nIn addition, magnetic stripes are a backup option in case the chip and pin system is not working or the card is not compatible with the chip and pin system. This can be useful in emergency situations or if a card is lost or stolen.\n\nOverall, magnetic stripes are still used on credit and debit cards in the UK because they are a convenient and reliable way for merchants to process transactions and provide a backup option in case the chip and pin system is not working.",
      "\nHoney is indeed the primary food source for bees during the winter months, when they are unable to forage for nectar and pollen from flowers. However, beekeepers do not typically take all of the honey that a hive produces. Instead, they leave enough honey for the bees to eat during the winter.\n\nWhen a beekeeper harvests honey, they remove the honeycomb frames from the hive and use a tool called a honey extractor to spin the frames and remove the honey. The beekeeper then replaces the empty frames back into the hive. The bees can then refill the empty comb with honey that they have produced.\n\nIt's also worth noting that bees are able to produce more honey than they need for their own survival. This surplus honey is what beekeepers typically harvest for human consumption.\n\nSo to answer your question, the bees won't starve in the winter if the beekeeper takes some of their honey. The bees will still have enough honey left to eat and will be able to produce more as the seasons change.",

      "Female infanticide, which is the practice of killing newborn girls or abandoning them because they are female, is not a common practice in China. It is also illegal in China and is condemned by the government and society. However, it is important to note that gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls, including female infanticide, is a problem that occurs in many parts of the world and is not limited to any one country. One reason why female infanticide may still occur in some places is because of cultural and societal beliefs that value males more highly than females. In some cultures, for example, it is believed that males are more capable or more useful than females and that they should be preferred as children. This can lead to a preference for male children and a devaluation of female children. Another reason may be related to economic factors. In some cases, parents may believe that they will be able to provide better opportunities for their male children because they will be able to work and earn an income, while female children may be seen as a burden because they may be expected to marry and leave the family. Overall, it is important to recognize and address gender-based violence and discrimination against women and girls, and to work towards creating a more equal and just society for all.",

      "Historical high tax rates have varied significantly in terms of how they were implemented and what they were intended to achieve. Some high tax rates have been implemented as a means of generating revenue for the government, while others have been used as a way to redistribute wealth or to discourage certain behaviors.One example of high tax rates being used to generate revenue is the high marginal tax rates that were common in the United States during the mid-20th century. These tax rates, which reached as high as 90% for the highest income earners, were implemented as a way to finance the government's expenses during World War II and to support the expansion of the welfare state in the years following the war.Another example of high tax rates being used to redistribute wealth is the progressive taxation systems that are common in many countries today. These systems impose higher tax rates on individuals with higher incomes, with the goal of reducing income inequality and providing a greater degree of financial security for those with lower incomes.High tax rates can also be used to discourage certain behaviors, such as the use of tobacco or alcohol. In these cases, high taxes are typically imposed on these products as a way to reduce their consumption and to generate revenue for the government.Overall, the effectiveness of high tax rates in achieving their intended goals has been a subject of debate among economists and policymakers. Some argue that high tax rates can be effective at raising revenue and reducing income inequality, while others argue that they can discourage work and investment and lead to economic inefficiency.",

      "& The carbon footprint of having a child varies depending on many factors, including the lifestyle and consumption patterns of the parents, the location and economic conditions in which the child is raised, and the child's own consumption and lifestyle choices as they grow and develop. Some studies have estimated that the carbon footprint of raising a child from birth to adulthood can be as high as 180 metric tons of CO2, although this figure can vary significantly depending on the specific circumstances. To reduce the carbon footprint of having a child, there are several things that parents can do : 1. Consider your own carbon footprint and how you can reduce it. This might involve making changes to your lifestyle and consumption patterns, such as reducing your energy use, eating a more plant - based diet, and reducing your reliance on transportation that generates high levels of greenhouse gas emissions. 2. Encourage your child to make environmentally friendly choices. This can involve teaching your child about the importance of reducing their own carbon footprint and encouraging them to adopt sustainable habits, such as turning off lights and electronics when not in use and choosing to walk or bike instead of driving. 3. Support policies and initiatives that promote sustainability and combat climate change. This might involve advocating for policies that support renewable energy, protecting natural habitats, and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It's important to note that having a child is not the only factor that contributes to an individual's carbon footprint. The choices we make throughout our lives, including how we live, work, and consume, all have an impact on the environment. By making conscious choices and taking action to reduce our carbon footprint, we can all play a role in addressing climate change. B "

      "“Are Gen Z More Pragmatic About Love and Sex?” by Klein Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe shifts in attitudes of people towards romantic relationships and, more specifically, marriage are attributes of societal development. From this perspective, the trends common for Gen Z are incredibly informative and, therefore, used for analyzing the situation in this area (Klein, 2022). It is clear that individuals’ mindsets are formed under the influence of external circumstances, which implies the correlation of opinions about love and sex with the presence of threats to personal well-being. Hence, one cannot examine the accompanying phenomena and cause-and-effect relationships while neglecting either the human factor or the conditions of the environment. One of the articles devoted to the subject is “Are Gen Z more pragmatic about love and sex?” and its critical analysis can reveal the elements of effective writing intended for considering complex events.\n\nSummary of the Article\n\nIn the selected piece, Jessica Klein narrates the tendency for representatives of Gen Z to postpone marriage and avoid long-term relationships while prioritizing personal issues. Compared to previous generations, these individuals do not view this area as a natural condition for entering adulthood due to a number of reasons. First, the advantages of single life are more attractive than settling down and help them satisfy their need for introspection (Klein, 2022).\n\nSecond, people in this group adopt a pragmatic approach to the matter because they understand the necessity of gaining stability in life in order to have a family (Klein, 2022). Third, Gen Zers face more problems than their parents due to the pandemic and prefer to reflect on the kind of person they want to be partners with and choose them carefully (Klein, 2022). As a result, the processes in this area slow down significantly, and the primary focus on self, as opposed to interactions with others, justify the changes which happened to this part of human life.\n\nResponse\n\nEvidence\n\nThe examined article is an effective piece of writing due to the inclusion of evidence from numerous sources, both of qualitative and quantitative nature. Thus, Klein (2022) refers to multiple studies related to the subject under consideration, including surveys conducted among the target population and statistical data gathered by official institutions. More importantly, she analyzes the current tendencies in the relationships of Gen Z through the lens of the experience of previous generations (Klein, 2022).\n\nThis approach to the task makes the findings more credible compared to a possible orientation on the information received from the participants and, consequently, confirms the reliability of conclusions for conducting further research. The overall extensiveness of this publication is also supported by the inclusion of personal opinions alongside the studies mentioned above (Klein, 2022). In this way, the selection of appropriate instruments for the purposes of this article is one of its main advantages.\n\nExternal and Internal Factors\n\nAnother aspect that should be emphasized as a benefit of the publication under consideration is the incorporation of both external and internal factors for providing comprehensive results. The former implies the particular attention of the author to the conditions of the environment, which affected the preferences of Gen Z in their romantic relationships and marriage. They include the ongoing pandemic, the increasing risks in terms of financial well-being, and the changing roles within families (Klein, 2022).\n\nAs for the individual circumstances influencing people’s choices, they are the perception of responsibility for one’s happiness, the desire to achieve success before getting married, and the need for stability as a foundation for interactions (Klein, 2022). The scholar’s focus on these two aspects of the matter proves to be effective in presenting a clear picture while also specifying the cause-and-effect relationships between personal attitudes and the rapidly evolving conditions of society. Therefore, this factor is another advantage that allows claiming the publication’s significance.\n\nPsychological Underpinning\n\nFinally, the psychological underpinning of the article demonstrated by individuals’ feedback is a valuable area, and its presence indicates the precision of conclusions from the perspective of one’s understanding. In this piece, Klein (2022) effectively refers to the ideas which were common for people in the past, namely, the perception of marriage as a critical stage in life. They are contrasted by the changing needs of respondents, including the desire for greater flexibility in all areas and the recognition of the failure of the previously existing mechanisms (Klein, 2022). These conditions are explicitly related to citizens’ psychology since they are guided in their decisions solely by comfort, as they see it critical for both being in relationships and staying single. Therefore, the orientation on this aspect is particularly beneficial for determining people’s motives.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the analyzed article is an example of a compelling message concerning the pragmatism of Gen Z in approaching romantic relationships and marriage. This standpoint is primarily conditional upon the inclusion of extensive qualitative and quantitative data as evidence of the trends. They are complemented by the examination of external and internal factors which correlate with the changes in this area and serve as proof of the link between the environment and individual actions. In addition, the author highlights the psychological aspect of the matter, which adds credibility to the findings while being informative in terms of the motivations of people who delay long-term partnerships.\n\nReference\n\nKlein, J.

      "Cybercrime and Cybersecurity as Challenges Essay\n\nIn recent years, the computer technology field has evolved and developed gradually and has contributed to the success of many individuals and organizations. Technology has faced numerous challenges as it continues to grow tremendously. The main challenge is cyber-attack, where criminals have been targeting companies and individuals, creating great harm to the vulnerable users of technology. Some of the incidences that support this claim are information theft, malware, ransomware attack, and hacking of servers which has become a significant challenge to technology users in all parts of the world. Cyber security experts have rescued technology users by detecting and protecting computer systems from these attacks.\n\nIn 2017 shock befell the globe after learning how helpless the world was after the famous wanna-cry ransomware cyber-attack targeted the Microsoft Windows operating system by encrypting the data of its users. The encrypted ransomware demanded some payments in the form of Bitcoins to decrypt the data, an incident that prompted my venture into a career in technology to help in countering these vices affecting technology. Since all technology forms and systems are vulnerable to cyber-attack and it is not always easy to identify the weak link where the cyber attackers would penetrate, relevant studies such as cyber security would solve this problem.\n\nComputer programming sessions were among the best topics back in my school, which drove my desire for this technology path. Being a recent graduate of Electronic Engineering Technology and Computer Engineering Technology from Norfolk State University, getting a chance to pursue a master’s degree in cyber security at Norfolk State University to develop more skills would be highly appreciated. Cyber security is vital to the current growing digital world because it offers confidentiality and security of personal information and financial credentials.\n\nCrucial topics include big data analytics, cloud computing, digital forensics, cyber-psychology, wireless security, and socio-cyber-security. Cyber security knowledge enables an individual to engage in actual-world practice using recent digital security technologies. Top organizations are willing to spend a lot on cyber security experts who can protect their data from being vulnerable, taking a course in cyber security very relevant and marketable with good job security.\n\nThe masters in cyber security will enhance the best ways to secure networks and information systems by intrusion detection and detection of ordinary events. One will also learn the defensive cyber security technologies and techniques used in modern organizations to protect systems data and achieve Knowledge of the maintenance and design of reliable and safe information systems. It will also be possible to identify the human factors that compromise a network and computer security.\n\nThis program will also enlighten on the legal, technical, policy, and dimensional aspects of network security, computer systems security, and information security. Principles of network security design and operation and those of computer networks, including security assessments, design fundamentals, and incident response, will be achieved. It will also involve auditing and testing knowledge and the standard penetration testing methodology, Technical aspects of networks, computer and information system security, and the techniques related to authentication, access control auditing, and secure communication. These skills gained from the cyber security course will make one fit in various careers: security architect, Chief information security officer, security assessor, and security manager. Occupations such as Security director, security engineer, and information security consultant also require cybersecurity expertise and will be very important in the future dynamic digital world.\n",
      "The “Woman with a Parasol” Painting by Claude Monet Essay\n\nWoman with a Parasol – Madame Monet and Her Son is a painting by the French artist Claude Monet, a founder and one of the most outstanding representatives of impressionism. Painted in 1875, this canvas became one of Monet’s most well-known and influential works (Brodskaïa and Kalitina). The two figures in the painting are Monet’s wife Camille and his son Jean.\n\nThe lower third of the painting shows a grassy area, and the other two-thirds contain the figures of a woman and a little boy behind her. Monet’s wife and child are the focal points of the composition. The lower viewpoint allows seeing the blue sky with white clouds behind the figures, which creates a unique lightning effect (Daily Dose of Art). Placed in the distance from the woman, the boy’s figure also gives depth to the painting; this compositional technique guides the eye of the observer diagonally downward, which was common for several other works by Monet.\n\nThe use of colors and light in this painting is truly impressive. The sun is shining on the figures from the background, casting a shadow. The strokes of colors are warm, bright, and vibrant, mixed together with the muted grays of the woman’s dress. It reflects a whole range of colors around her: the blues of the sky, the yellow of the flowers, and light, complementary strokes of purple (Joy of Museums Virtual Tours). Monet uses these colors and careless brush strokes to convey an atmosphere of a breezy summer day.\n\nWoman with a Parasol is a genre painting, which is a type of art that depicts ordinary people and their everyday activities. Thus, the painting gives the impression that the mother and son were interrupted during their daily walk in the field. It can be suggested that the woman’s dress, veil, and parasol symbolize her status, and the grassy slope symbolizes the countryside that Monet preferred to the cities and industry. Overall, the painting creates a unique mood of a fleeting memory captured in the moment.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBrodskaïa, Natalia, and Nina Kalitina. The ultimate book on Claude Monet .

      "Blog Post: Stakeholder Summary Report Essay\n\nStakeholder summary reports are crucial for building relationships with all the parties with a vested interest in a particular business. Such reports help to deliver information about the crucial ideas, plans, and achievements of the company. Stakeholder summary reports are vital instruments for building trust among customers, employees, and investors. The primary purpose of the report is to ensure all the stakeholders that the business has a stable performance, which will improve in the future. When creating a summary report, it is central to have an appropriate template or an example to ensure that all the aspects of business strategy are considered. One suitable example of building a stakeholder summary report is Estée Lauder’s (2021) 2020 Year in Review. This document vividly describes the top products that bring the most income, strategical decisions that were made during the year, and overviews the key performance indicators.\n\nIt is crucial to notice that in order to be trusted, a report needs to be specific and based on accurate data. Estée Lauder (2021) uses data very effectively, as it helps to tell the story of the company’s success. In particular, instead of providing raw numbers, the creators of the report compare the numbers with other appropriate data. For instance, instead of showing the compound average growth rate (CAGR) for 2020, Estée Lauder (2021) compares it with the global average in the sector and S&P500. This is crucial, as 2020 could have been associated with a reduction in growth rates due to the pandemic. Therefore, it is crucial to demonstrate how the results compared to crucial metrics.\n\nIn general, Estée Lauder (2021) put a significant emphasis on data visualization in the “Performance Highlights” section. This implies that the authors of the report know their audience and value their time. Estée Lauder (2021) understands that the report is to be read by the investors, who usually have extensive knowledge in metrics, the ability to read graphs, and understanding of financial terms, and little spare time. Thus, the report uses only graphs with little text to deliver the needed information. Moreover, financial terms are used excessively without explanations. Thus, Estée Lauder (2021) uses all the provided space in the report efficiently.\n\nAs for presentation, the design of the report is minimalistic with pale colors. The entire report is clearly structured to make the information easy to understand. These features of the presentation help the reader to focus on the information without distractions. Ultimately, such an efficient design saves time for the reader. As a result, the presentation helps to achieve the desired goal of building trust with all the stakeholders. It demonstrates that the company knows its audience and values the time all stakeholders and their knowledge, which contributes to creating trustful relationships.\n\nIn summary, Estée Lauder’s 2020 Year in Review is an excellent example of the composition of a stakeholder summary report. On the one hand, the content helps to demonstrate that the company’s performance is stable and will improve in the future. The efficient use of data supports this goal. Presentation, on the other hand, shows that the company leaders value all the stakeholders, which is demonstrated by the effective use of space and minimalistic design.\n\nReference\n\nEstée Lauder.

      "Safety Assessment of Congonhas Airport Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nCongonhas Airport in Sao Paulo, Brazil, is infamous for the deadliest airplane crash in Brazil’s history. On July 17, 2007, TAM Airlines Flight 3054 ran off the runway upon landing and crashed into the nearby warehouse that belonged to TAM (CENIPA 2009). The resulting collision ended in the deaths of all the plane passengers and crew as well as 12 individuals in the warehouse, bringing the total casualty number to 199 fatalities and 13 injuries (CENIPA 2009).\n\nFig. 1. TAM 3054 Crash.\n\nThe investigation performed by the CENIPA (2009), the Brazilian Aeronautical Accidents Investigation and Prevention Centre, lasted for 2 years and had discovered numerous factors that have played the part in the tragedy. It was concluded that the crash happened because of the mistake of the pilots, caused by perception errors, loss of situational awareness, poor cockpit coordination, and insufficient levels of co-pilot training (CENIPA 2009). At the same time, the conditions on the ground played a major role in shaping and motivating the pilots’ actions as well as exacerbating the results of their failures. The catastrophe helped uncover a myriad of safety regulations failures at Congonhas Airport, which resulted in it losing its international airport status, significant decrease of lanes and serviceable flights, as well as a long period of flight restrictions during the night (7 hours). Effectively, Congonhas lost its place as the busiest airport in Brazil. Nevertheless, it remains the second-busiest airport up to date.\n\nThe purpose of this paper is to evaluate the airport conditions during the crash and 13 years after. The differences will highlight the areas of improvement being made, and what else needs to be done. It will conclude with a set of recommendations based on the provided evidence to further increase the safety of planes in the runway.\n\nEvaluation of Airport Conditions on July 17, 2007\n\nRunway Conditions\n\nCongonhas Airport is notorious for being located in the tropical climate zone, which brings about frequent and heavy rainfalls (See Fig. 2). The rain causes the formation of puddles and slippery surfaces on the runway, which may extend the full-stop brake distance for the plane in question by about 20% (CENIPA 2009). It may also cause the effect known as hydroplaning, which causes the plane to lose friction with the wet surface as a result of contact with water. Standard measures performed to reduce or eliminate the effects of excessive water on the runway include grooving and giving it sloped geometry to prevent rainfall from accumulating into puddles (CENIPA 2009). Grooving was being planned to be added to the runways but was not existent when the crash occurred despite the recent renovations done earlier in 2007 during the recent refit (CENIPA 2009). The slopes, while having been made, were erased by extensive rubber friction from planes landing and taking off, and did not perform their jobs adequately. As a result, the pilots were used to the runways being wet and slippery, and usually accounted for it when landing.\n\nFig. 2. Congonhas During Rains.\n\nThe administration of Congonhas Airport had a warning for the tragedy to come, as the day before a PLA flight 4763 suffered a hydroplaning accident, resulting in the plane veering off the runway and damaging itself against a concrete box and a light pole. While the passengers and the crew (25 people in total) remained largely unscathed, the plane was rendered inoperable (CENIPA 2009). The incident was disregarded and hidden under wraps, but demonstrated the likelihood of wet surfaces affecting the landing procedures. Thus, a potential warning was ignored, and operations were continued. Had the airport been closed, TAM Airlines Flight 3054 tragedy would not have happened.\n\nRunway Location and Architecture\n\nCongonhas Airport is notorious for being located in the suburbs of Sao Paulo, surrounded by tall buildings. Being one of the oldest airports in Brazil, the issue was not present at the beginning, when it was just constructed (CENIPA 2009). However, the expansion of the capital outwards created numerous obstacles for planes. Frequent flyers report that landing in Congonhas feels like scraping the rooftops of these buildings (See Fig. 3). This results in a steeper angle of approach and harder potential landings because of it. In addition, due to being surrounded by various structures, the city restricts the space available for expanding the airport. The prices for land are much higher than in most other cities of Brazil, making the extension of the airfield an economically-daunting task (Pacheco et al. 2020).\n\nFig. 3. Congonhas Airport Surrounded by Buildings\n\nThis brings about the second major issue that Congonhas airport had during the crash, that being a notoriously short runway. The 35L runway length was, at the time, at 1945 meters long, whereas the auxiliary 35R was only 1435 meters long (CENIPA 2009). For comparison, the average runway for widebody aircrafts, as per the standards of international airports, is at 2400 meters (CENIPA 2009). Pilots often described Congonhas Airport as being an ‘aircraft carrier’ due to how short and narrow the landing strips were. The shortness of the runway meant there was not enough space for the runway end safety area (RESA), which was not present on either of the runways, in direct violation of Annex 14 ICAO standard (CENIPA 2009).\n\nFinally, there was the issue of vulnerable buildings and structures located in close proximity to the runway (see Fig. 4). This included the TAM warehouse, which the plane collided with, resulting in the death of 12 people on the ground. There was also a Shell filling station, which contained gas, oil, lubricants, and other flammable substances that, had the plane ran into it, would have resulted in an even larger fire and an explosion, potentially increasing the number of fatalities (CENIPA 2009). One of the reasons why the plane managed to reach this far was because the buildings were located below slope of the runway, giving the plane extra movement speed.\n\nFig. 4. TAM Express Warehouse in Close Proximity to the Runway.\n\nManagement Planning and Oversights\n\nPrior to the catastrophe, the operator of the plane had undergone a rapid expansion of its fleet and staff personnel numbers. As a result, they had too many captains and not enough co-pilots, so many planes were flown with elements of the crew having been retrained to fill in the new positions (CENIPA 2009). The minimum regulatory requirements were complied with, but the airport was complacent in letting too many co-pilots with very little actual co-piloting experience to fly and land planes, which may have had an effect in the TAM 3054 tragedy (CENIPA 2009). The airport officials routinely allowed TAM to compose the crew of two captains. The co-pilot had only the Right-Seat Certification training and less than 250 hours of flight experience (CENIPA 2009). The company operating out of Congonhas airport had poor cooperation between sectors in terms of coordination, training, and processes, which resulted in the higher likelihood of error during routine operations. Finally, although the availability of reversers was formalized as a requirement for airport operations and landing procedures as far as of April 2006, these requirements were not implemented at Congonhas airport until only after the tragedy had occurred (CENIPA 2009). Active compliance with such a requirement would have prevented the tragedy or at least increased the chances of stopping the plane before it collided with the building.\n\nChanges Made and Persistent Issues at Congonhas Airport as of 2021\n\nBetween 2007 and 2009, CENIPA (2009) provided the authorities and operators of Congonhas airport with a number of recommendations to improve the safety standards of the airport and ensure that the tragedy of TAM 3054 would never happen again. These recommendations included limitations on operating flights, restrictions to narrow-hull planes with the mass of under 91 tons only, as well as numerous improvements to the quality of the runway. As of 2020, Congonhas airport has put some effort to rectifying the issues spotted by CENIPA. The improvements were as follows (Pacheco et al. 2020):\n\n  * Reduction of operational slots. Prior to the catastrophe, Congonhas was a notoriously busy airport, operating with no set limit and a high margin of 38 slots per hour. That number was reduced to 33 slots, with an average of two movements per hour on the L35 lane and four movements on the R35 lane.\n  * Organization of the routes and flight schedules was drastically improved, as was the operational sight of airlines. As of 2018, Congonhas has been implementing Zebra technologies to track vehicles and personnel on the runway (Dias 2020). In addition, planes with absent or inoperative reversers are prohibited from landing or taking off the airfield.\n  * All lanes now have drainage grooves, which help reduce the amount of water on the surface and improve friction. Also, as of 2021, Congonhas has been implementing an engineered material arresting system (EMAS), which allows for quick de-acceleration of aircraft in case of the landing strip being overrun (Dias 2020).\n  * Quality of training for operators and airport crew has been significantly improved, with the airport having direct responsibility and oversight over the quality and viability of certificates. Safety training and the use of reverse systems is being conducted on a regular basis.\n  * Main runway length was reduced to 1790 meters, and auxiliary one – to 1195 meters, with extra space being dedicated to RESA.\n  * Firefighter preparations and equipping were significantly improved.\n  * Congonhas airport requires its planes to use the EFB (Electronic flight bag), which provides the plane and its pilots with up-to-day information on the state of the runway, navigational charts, take-off, and landing performance calculations (Dias 2020). This technology allowed to significantly reduce the length of the runway required for plane landing, thus making landing safer.\n\nAs it is possible to see, Congonhas airport has implemented plenty of measures to improve safety and quality of the runways and associated airport systems, in accordance to CENIPA (2009) recommendations. Nevertheless, some issues remain. All of them relate to the overall length of the runway as well as RESA. According to Fortes and Correia (2018), the runway strip’s free obstacle area, which is currently at 300 meters of width and 60 meters of length from each threshold, is invaded by the apron and taxiway along its entire length (See Fig. 5). In addition, RESA is not sufficiently allocated for both runways, which may cause a disastrous catastrophe should an aircraft have a problem during its operation (Fortes and Correia 2018). Finally, the distance between the holding position and the runway axis is only 75 meters, meaning that a plane being refueled may become an obstacle during a veering-off incident similar to that of TAM 3054, and a collision will likely result in an explosion. The majority of these issues are systemic in nature, and are attributed to the airfield being old and initially constructed with much smaller planes in mind.\n\nFig. 5. Congonhas Runway Overview\n\nRecommendations\n\nIn terms of recommendations that could currently be made to help Congonhas improve its safety beyond what it has done already, there is not much room for improvement (Di Mascio et al. 2020). The length of the runway and RESA remains a prominent issue, and will likely continue to be such for any foreseeable future. While it is theoretically possible to expand 35L and 35R beyond its current limits, it would require inching into the living quartiles of the city, buying out the land, taking down buildings and communications, as well as potentially moving the road further away from the runway (Fortes and Correia 2018). As such, while it would have been preferable to expand the runway, there is no economically-feasible way to do so. Other recommendations mentioned in CENIPA report have already been made, leaving little to improve in that regard.\n\nNevertheless, Congonhas’ reduction of the actual runway length to extend the RESA was achieved solely through the widespread implementation of the EFB technology combined with the limitation of the airport to receiving narrow-hull planes. EFB, while effective and widespread as an alternative to paper-based information sources, is not without flaws. According to Chandra and Kendra (2019), EFB can be a contributing risk factor to landings and takeoffs, with the most frequently-cited issues being as follows:\n\n  * Spatial deviations – these are navigational errors from planned or scheduled routes;\n  * Runway incursions – obstacles not identified by the navigational computer appearing on the runway;\n  * Incorrect weight and balance computations – these can affect both the liftoff and landing calculations, potentially resulting in complications or even catastrophes;\n  * Expired databases – includes geographical locations, building heights, plane parameters, and more;\n  * Incorrect take-off speeds – may result in the plane hitting the ground with its tail upon rotation.\n\nMost of these issues are caused by system bugs, faulty internet connections, and other factors related to clearance, checking, and maintenance at the airport level. Therefore, it is recommended to put the emphasis on the IT department of maintenance for the airport and operators (Bhardwajand Purdy 2019). All personnel related to EFB should be thoroughly instructed in using the models of EFB serviced on all flights accepted in Congonhas airport (Bhardwajand Purdy 2019). Databases should be frequently updated, and both captains and co-pilots should be familiarized not only in managing them, but also in spotting and overcoming any technical difficulties that could occur during flight.\n\nAside from EFB-based recommendations, Congonhas should keep a close watch and maintenance of the anti-puddle slopes and drainage grooves across the runway (Di Mascio et al. 2020). Part of the reason why the catastrophe happened in 2007 was because the slopes were erased by tires and the grooves were not present (CENIPA 2009). Likewise, without proper supervision and maintenance, the slopes might disappear, and the grooves may become clogged with dirt and litter, thus reducing the effectiveness of their draining functions.\n\nFinally, Congonhas has to service narrow-hull planes with a weight capacity of under 91 tons, as prescribed by CENIPA (2009). If possible, the planes serviced should be as light as possible, with preference given to those with decreased requirements for runway length. It would help improve the safety of the existing runways without having to lengthen or expand them. Wide-hull planes should continue to be prohibited from landing in Congonhas to avoid any incidents similar to the Airbus crash. To further eliminate the chances of extra casualties in an event of a catastrophic failure, all hazardous facilities that could be hit by a plane veering off the runway should be placed away from the airport.\n\nConclusions\n\nThe conditions of Congonhas airport and the oversights in administrations and maintenance played a major role in the catastrophe of TAM Airlines Flight 3054 in 2007. Since then, Congonhas’ role has greatly diminished, but still remains important for regional and domestic travelling. The majority of the issues have since been partially or completely fixed, and the limitation of the number of flights in combination with narrow-hull planes helped significantly increase runway safety. The recommendations for improvement include emphasizing IT security in relation to EFB, frequent scheduled maintenance of drainage facilities, and continued restrictions on the size and weight of the planes received in the airport.\n\nReferences\n\nAeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Center (CENIPA).

      "Assistance to Queens Residents With Substance Abuse Essay\n\nThe problem of substance abuse is a topical one across different demographics and areas of the country. According to the statistics provided by the County Health Rankings & Roadmaps (2020), Queens County in New York had 16% of alcohol-impaired deaths. Moreover, the data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene (2019) demonstrates that in 2019 12.2 per 100,000 people living in Queens died due to a drug overdose. This information shows that the issue of substance abuse poses a serious threat to the health of residents of Queens county.\n\nThere is a variety of institutions which address the problem of substance abuse in Queens county, one of them is Creedmoor Addiction Treatment Center on Winchester Boulevard. This organization primarily provides inpatient drug and alcohol rehabilitation services, which involve a short-term residential addiction program for every patient considering their particular needs (New York State Office of Addiction Services, n.d.). Queens residents struggling with substance abuse can call the hospital and receive help even if they cannot pay for it. The organization is operated by the New York State Office of Addiction Services and Supports (OASAS) and has a multidisciplinary treatment team.\n\nCommunity health nurses have a responsibility to provide care to every resident of the area they serve. Individuals who have serious substance abuse problems can be referred by such nurses to the Creedmoor Addiction Treatment Center to receive more specialized help. Additionally, such medical professionals can provide local residents with brochures of the center which contain important information about the organization. Thus, members of the community will get a chance to learn about treatment options which they can receive in the county.\n\nTweet: Queens residents struggling with substance abuse problems can receive consultations and support from the Creedmoor Addiction Treatment Center . #substanceabuse #Creedmor.\n\nReferences\n\nCounty Health Rankings and Roadmaps.

      "Corporate Social Responsibility: Case of Google Essay\n\nThis semester is coming to an end, and I have benefited a lot from MGMT5050 study. I have realized my weaknesses from my tutor’s feedback and made progress in two aspects based on this semester’s tutorials and lectures and what I have learned throughout the semester. First, the Johari Window makes me aware that everybody must know himself/herself very well. Second, cultural modesty causes me to reflect. Finally, by reading the case of Google, I have understood that as an enterprise, it should have a sense of corporate social responsibility (CSR), which will help to improve the reputation of the company (Neubert and Montañez, 2020). This will be of great importance to me in my future career.\n\nI realized that I should make more exploration in the analysis. The problem is that I didn’t read the five portions of materials given by the tutor, so that I failed to collect sufficient arguments for my point of view. This is because I do not have the patience to read a flood of literature at a time. There are many details and good examples in the essay that I can choose as arguments. If I had read it carefully, taken notes, and made marks, I would not have achieved such unsatisfactory results. In my opinion, I can learn to split every complex task and fulfill part of it seriously every day in the future study or work because it is better to accomplish a task step by step than to complete it peremptorily in one day.\n\nI have understood two important points from the weekly SWD lesson. First, everyone should know himself/herself very well. There are two ways to do so, i.e., “self-reflection” and “evaluation by others”. This is the Johari Window model that Mark mentioned in class. That is, people should expand the open area and reduce the blind, hidden area, and unknown area when encountering a problem. For example, the weekly discussion board is very stressful for me, and I would put off handing in the assignment until the last few minutes before the deadline, but in fact, I had already finished it. On the one hand, I don’t want my assignment posted too early because I always feel that my essay is not good enough. On the other hand, I have problems with grammar and vocabulary and have to spend time correcting them.\n\nSecond, I am not very proactive in responding to others’ questions. I don’t like talking with anybody unfamiliar. To better apply the Johari Window model to me, I’d improve myself psychologically. I will open my mind actively. In other words, I will become more outgoing for better communication with others. This is good for building a harmonious interpersonal relationship. I will search my heart prudently, further understanding myself so that I won’t be conceited at all. Also, I can improve myself based on my classmates’ evaluations. I will dare to have an objective self-assessment to create a healthier self by examining and liberating myself. In the meantime, I will show “what is hidden in my heart” to others, gaining more confidence in my ability to improve communication efficiency.\n\nWhen reading the feedback from my foreign classmates, I always think it unnecessary to liberally have an accolade for others’ points of view. I cannot understand this under my native cultural background. So, by contrast, I often have an antipathetic response to others’ opinions. Since I began to learn about cultural modesty, I have been convinced that respect should be shown for individual differences in interpersonal communication and that one should accommodate others with an open mind.\n\nIn terms of CSR, Google’s AI system has some disadvantages, such as various types of discrimination. Moreover, its home automation seriously violates the privacy of consumers. In addition, it cooperates with the government for military purposes. Despite the cancellation of this program owing to pressure from the employees, Google did not fulfill its social responsibility. CSR means that an enterprise is obligated to take responsibility for the employees, consumers, community, and environment while bearing the legal liability for the shareholders (Neubert and Montañez, 2020). I think that a company should do well with injustice and temperance to fulfill its CSR. In the process of promoting unreliable crowdsource machine learning techniques, it was considered to be an advocate of gender discrimination and racial discrimination, discomforting the consumers.\n\nIn my future career development, I should solve gender and race issues in a fair and just manner. Therefore, I will evaluate the company I may join to see if it has a sense of CSR, fully infiltrating it into its heart and setting it as a corporate development goal rather than taking it as a tool to maximize profits. Such a kind of company can help me to enhance my satisfaction and happiness. Also, I should pay great attention to the importance of diversity to a company. When getting along with colleagues who hold values completely different from mine, I should actively explore a way to achieve impartial management and balance and properly handle the relationship with those who have different cultural backgrounds.\n\nReference List\n\nNeubert, M. and Montañez, G., 2020.

      "Banking: Financial Transaction Risks Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Interest Rate Risk\n 2. Credit Risk\n 3. Foreign Exchange Rate Risk\n 4. Sovereign Risk\n 5. Technology Risk\n 6. Measuring Interest Risks\n 7. References\n\nCentral banks hold significant power over financial institutions and business enterprises. Their decisions, especially the interest rate movements, can influence the value of assets and affect already undertaken liabilities. Usually, the central banks operate from the macroeconomic perspective and take steps to solve problems on the national level. As a result, their decisions might be beneficial for the economy as a whole, but particular entities may suffer severe losses. In addition, financial transactions may be negatively affected by various factors not related to interest rate movements. Those risks should also be taken into account by financial analysts and business owners.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nInterest rate risk comes into consideration when the entities acquire interest-sensitive assets or undertake interest-sensitive liabilities. For instance, the central bank’s movement of the interest rate can affect such assets as municipal or national bonds. A bond dealer who uses their equity to buy Mexican debt risks losing funds if the Bank of Mexico or the Federal Reserve moves the interest rate. Investing in a municipal bond portfolio might pose a risk as well since those bonds would be significantly affected by intervention from the central bank. The central bank’s decisions can also influence mortgage loans, making them a risky investment.\n\nCredit Risk\n\nCredit risk emerges in transactions that involve giving or taking out a loan. There will always be a risk of a commercial loan not being returned in time. For example, entrepreneurs might face difficulties in establishing new businesses and not repay the loan in time. A purchased entity might have financial liabilities which can be risky to undertake for the new owner. The risks related to credit are common, so the banks usually have security departments, which evaluate the client’s financial metrics. The level of scrutinizing depends on the scope of the deal.\n\nForeign Exchange Rate Risk\n\nForeign exchange rate risk becomes a factor in international transactions when the procedure requires the currency exchange. This type of risk is common for companies working on the global markets. For instance, the transaction between a French bank and a British entrepreneur would require an exchange within the EUR/GBP currency pair. However, a deal like that would not create a significant risk since both the euro and the British pound are stable currencies. The risk would be much greater if a Russian-based company decided to purchase German equipment since the Russian ruble is more volatile than the euro. A possible risk mitigation solution would be buying more stable currency at a favorable exchange rate and holding it for the right moment. Another way of avoiding the risk would be adding the possibility of price adjustment in case of severe exchange rate fluctuation.\n\nSovereign Risk\n\nSovereign or country risk manifests in political decisions, affecting the transaction or even nullifying the deal. Force-majeure situations like war or sudden legal changes on the national level can liberate the parties from liabilities and associated risks. However, less drastic situations could be more harmful since they would cause losses without a way of mitigating them. For example, a Japanese bank might lose a chance to acquire an Austrian one if the Austrian government blocks the deal. In that case, even the losses-free termination of the transaction would be a failure since the goal of acquisition would remain unachieved. Dealings with less-developed countries also pose a significant risk of losses due to their governments’ unexpected political or economic decisions.\n\nTechnology Risk\n\nTechnology risk in transactions comes from the technical and IT aspects when the lack of cybersecurity or equipment malfunction leads to eventual losses. For example, contemporary digital financial services create the risks of corporate or personal data theft, account compromising, or file destruction. In addition to that, merging and acquisition might create an overly complicated IT environment, which would cause severe losses (Deloitte, 2018). Therefore, the Japanese bank’s attempt to acquire its Austrian partner for facilitating the clearing operations might fail due to the technological differences. A possible alleviation of technological risks could require a standardization of technological processes before the acquisition and cybersecurity enhancement.\n\nMeasuring Interest Risks\n\nFinancial transactions of significant scope demand careful planning since they are susceptible to various types of risks. While some of those risks are predictable or reliably manageable with common sense, the interest rate risks require conducting a special analysis to reveal them. One of the popular interest risk measurement methods — duration gap analysis-serves to evaluate how long the entity holds the interest-sensitive assets and how quickly it pays the liabilities.\n\nDuration gap is a quantitative technique used for interest risk measurement. Gup et al. (2007) define duration as “the weighted average time (measured in years) to receive all cash flows from a financial instrument” (as cited in Chattha et al., 2020). Therefore, the “duration gap” means the difference between the duration of the assets and liabilities. In simpler terms: the longer the assets or liabilities being held in proportion to the opposite metric — the bigger the gap.\n\nThe duration gap evaluation might reveal the interest rate-related risks and prevent the losses to overly-risky transactions. Kagan (2020) provides three possible general conditions of the gap:\n\n  * zero gap: an ideal situation, in which the company is reliably protected against the interest rate movements;\n  * positive gap: a situation in which interest-sensitive assets exceed interest-sensitive liabilities;\n  * negative gap: an opposite situation, in which interest-sensitive liabilities exceed interest-sensitive assets\n\nThe use of the duration gap analysis technique can improve risk management of business entities. A research of Chinese banks by Ausloos et al. (2020) showed that the joint-stock banks which performed the duration gap analysis showed a better risk control ability under the influence of interest rate liberalization. In that regard, those banks managed to outperform state-owned and local commercial banks (Ausloos et al., 2020). Therefore, the duration gap analysis proved its usefulness for measuring and managing the interest rate risks in the Chinese case.\n\nThe duration gap analysis is also helpful for discovering concerning trends in financial institutions. For instance, Chattha et al. (2020) claimed that a big duration gap of Islamic Commercial Banks (IBCs) makes them vulnerable to a significant loss of net worth and economic value equity. The use of the duration gap technique helped reveal that ICBs constantly allow the mismatch of their assets and liabilities (Chattha et al., 2020). Without a measurement, those problems would have likely remained hidden, leaving the ICBs susceptible to interest rate movements.\n\nOverall, the big or negative duration gap is not necessarily harmful; however, it reflects the entity’s susceptibility to transaction risks associated with the interest rate movements. Therefore, financial analysts should pay attention to the duration gap metric before giving or taking out loans or purchasing bonds. A negative duration gap of a significant amount can send a warning sign, vital for calling off a risky deal and saving the company from the potential losses.\n\nReferences\n\nAusloos, M., Ma, Q., Kaur, P., Syed, B., & Dhesi, G.

      "Epistemology and Metaphysics in Relation to Skepticism, Rationalism, and Materialism Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nEpistemology is a philosophical concept that looks at knowledge and its scope. Generally, epistemology tends to ask what knowledge is all about and how one can get hold of it. Further, it considers how relevant knowledge is to a particular subject. One of the philosophers behind the idea of metaphysics is Plato.\n\nMetaphysics attempts to explain how the world is understood by human beings. It is also concerned with the origin and structure of the universe. Metaphysics thus looks at what is in existence and what it is like. Drawing from s study by Ram-Prasad (2013), metaphysics tends to revolve around the use of language and the ultimate picture that one may have about the world. For Plato, epistemology is regarded as the understanding of what knowledge really is. Apparently, knowledge is about what exists. This is totally different from belief which looks at that which is present as well as that which is not present.\n\nComparison\n\nIn epistemology, skepticism casts doubts about the existence and reality of knowledge. Arguably, the fact that a person believes in something does not necessarily imply that he or she has knowledge about it. In the same way, metaphysics presumes that there is nothing that exists unless it is possible to ascertain its existence.\n\nRationalism in epistemology looks at reason as the main source of knowledge. Consequently, the main criterion that is used to accept knowledge is based on intellectual arguments. Similarly, rationalism in metaphysics is concerned with the provision of sound reasoning to prove the existence of things. Apparently, nothing exists if its existence can not be explained through reasoning.\n\nBoth epistemology and metaphysics give consideration to what is real and not what is imaginary in a material sense. However, while metaphysics focuses on the physical existence of matter, epistemology applies the same reasoning to the existence of knowledge.\n\nIn epistemology, what really counts is the understanding of knowledge about a particular topic of interest. Although this is somehow different from what metaphysics looks at, both are concerned with reality.\n\nEpistemology is concerned with the reality about knowledge while metaphysics is concerned with reality about the existence of material substances. According to Dicker (2002), it is imperative to ensure that a connection exists between epistemology and metaphysics. This is because of the obvious overlaps that are seen to bring the two together.\n\nContrasts between Epistemology and Metaphysics in Relation to Skepticism, Rationalism, and Materialism\n\nGenerally, epistemology looks at skepticism with regard to knowledge. It thus looks at different aspects of knowledge and the way knowledge can be acquired. Apparently, skepticism under epistemology is concerned with clearing any doubts that may exist about the existence of knowledge.\n\nOn the other hand, skepticism under metaphysics focuses on the actual existence. Under metaphysics, it is absolutely necessary to prove beyond any reasonable doubt, that what one claims to be present, does exist in actual sense. Often, doubts arise in the absence of such a proof.\n\nIt is not enough for people to simply be aware that something exists. For recognition purposes, proof must be presented.\n\nAs far as rationalism is concerned, epistemology relies on an intellectual perspective to explain the existence of knowledge. There has to be a reasonable argument that supports the existence of knowledge. In metaphysics, rationalism is with respect to the existence of something. Seemingly, there is nothing that can be presumed to exist without a reasonable argument. Everything that exists must be evidenced by a logical argument.\n\nIn metaphysics, materialism assumes the existence of a world that is completely independent of the human mind. In other words, the existence of the universe has nothing to do with the human mind. In metaphysics, material reality is not possible in the absence of physical matter. Therefore, while metaphysics is concerned with the existence of physical matter, epistemology looks at the notion of reality with respect to knowledge.\n\nMetaphysics is also all about the exact nature of reality while epistemology is about what people believe and the kind of knowledge in their possessions.\n\nExamples of Real Life Applications of Skepticism, Rationalism, and Materialism\n\nRegarding materialism, several logical arguments have been presented concerning the existence of God. To a large extent, the arguments depend on the way human beings reason. According to research findings, this concept of materialism was proposed by Thomas Aquinas and Saint Anselm, two ancient philosophers.\n\nApparently, most people tend to believe that God, being powerful and at the same time good, should be able to avert evil in the society. The fact that evil is ever present in the society makes people wonder whether God is really that powerful. As a matter of fact, there are some people who are convinced that there is another being other than God who in total control of what happens in the universe.\n\nGenerally, skepticism has to do with doubt.\n\nOne example about skepticism is about a common assumption that people like making about life. Oftentimes, people allege that we should eat, drink, and be happy since tomorrow we will be dead. While this may be true, it is surrounded by so much uncertainty. Since it is in God’s hand to determine our fate the next second, minute, hour, or day, it is wrong to make such assumptions. People who live by such a philosophy may end up in a sorry state in the event that they spend all they have and are unable to cater for their needs the following day. It is advisable to be prudent about such allegations.\n\nAnother common example of skepticism concerns the belief that taking a spoonful of sugar is helpful, for making the medicine sink down the throat. Usually, it is presumed while the medicine may taste bad at the moment, it has long term benefits. However, this belief may not apply if the medicine has no benefit in the long run or if the medicine is tasty without the sugar.\n\nTo a large extent, skeptics have very little confidence in anything unless there is solid proof to support any allegation that is made. Nothing is what it is alleged to be until solid evidence is presented to remove any form of doubt. However, according to Hetherington (2013), it is important to have physical matter in place before seeking to prove that it actually exists.\n\nBy and large, rationalists are people who believe that knowledge can only be understood through reasoning (Sharlow, 2007). Consequently, it is impossible to talk about having arrived at knowledge without reasoning. An example of rationalism in real life is where some people have denied religion because of the way they think. However, being rational does in any way overlook the presence of God in our lives. Advocates of rationalism such as René Descartes still believed in the existence of God. This notwithstanding, there is completely nothing to deny the fact that reason leads to the acquisition of knowledge. Rationalism can also be demonstrated by complex equations in mathematics created by René Descartes through reasoning. According to Descartes, this was one way of ensuring that errors are not overlooked when considering important matters.\n\nConclusion\n\nAs discussed in this presentation, epistemology and metaphysics help to explain why people behave or regard things in a certain way.\n\nWhile epistemology looks at different issues with regard to knowledge, metaphysics considers the existence of things.\n\nAs pointed out earlier, epistemology is concerned with knowledge and as well as its reach. It asks what knowledge is all about and how can be accessed by any interested party. It also considers how relevant knowledge is to a given subject.\n\nMetaphysics on the other hand is mainly concerned with providing explanations about the understanding of the world by human beings. To a certain extent, it is also concerned with the origin and structure of the universe. Metaphysics thus looks at what is in existence and what it is like.\n\nWhile there are differences that exist between metaphysics and epistemology, it is equally important to be aware of the fact that there are similarities that bring these two branches of philosophy together with regards to different philosophical theories.\n\nReferences\n\nDicker, G.

      "Hypothesis Testing and Confidence Intervals in Healthcare Essay\n\nHypothesis testing has now been regarded as one of the most widespread means of conducting scholarly research in the sphere of health care. The phenomenon of a hypothesis concerns scholars’ ability to present a verbalized concept they are willing to investigate throughout the research (Shreffler & Huecker, 2021). Later, the hypothesis is either justified or rejected with the help of analyzing empirical sampling data and inference of the sample study results. A similar approach to the data analysis in health care is the notion of a confidence interval. The latter stands for a quantitative range of mean values relevant to an outlined sample (Lock et al., 2021). The most commonly accepted confidence interval (CI) value constitutes 95%, which means that the researchers may be 95% sure that the true value for the population lies within the interval presented.\n\nWhen speaking of the procedures’ application to health care, it is crucial to account for the presence of hypothesized value in the research hypothesis. For example, when evaluating the disease incidence rate based on a single criterion such as reposting cases of a heart attack in the past, medical researchers may use CI as a single means to identify the probability of a certain health complication within the population with previous heart attack experience when compared to the general population (Lock et al., 2021). However, once the outlined hypothesis secures more details to the population parameter, such as age group (sample participants should not be older than 30 years old), hypothesis testing should be conducted.\n\nIn the case of clinicians, it is crucial to combine both CI and hypothesis testing in order to prove the significance of an outlined assumption, as there is currently no vivid indication that one of the two approaches is more empirically significant to the medical practice (Shreffler & Huecker, 2021). When speaking of personal experience and statistical testing, the most common example would concern the evaluation of drug efficacy. Thus, the CI would concern the probability of the drug’s successful intake when compared to other medications of the same group, whereas the hypothesis testing would include the p-values indicating the difference between the successful use among smaller groups with different hypothesized values such as age or gender and social affiliation.\n\nReferences\n\nLock, R.

      "Juvenile Diabetes: Demographics, Statistics and Risk Factors Essay\n\nDemographics & Statistics\n\nJuvenile diabetes, also referred to as Type 2 diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, describes a health condition associated with the pancreas’s limited insulin production (Bimstein et al., 2019). Insulin is a vital hormone the human body needs to facilitate glucose entry into cells to generate energy. The condition is characterized by the destruction of the cells that make insulin in the pancreas.\n\nAccording to latest estimate, 34.2 million Americans have diabetes, representing 10.5% of the country’s population (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC], 2020). About 26.9 million individuals were diagnosed with the condition, including adults. About one in 500 Americans have juvenile diabetes, while approximately 80 people are diagnosed with the disorder each day (CDC, 2020). About 5 percent of individuals who have a family member (parent or sibling) this condition are likely to develop it (CDC, 2020). Eighty-eight million people were prediabetes, representing 1 out of 3 people. Prediabetes is a precursor to full-blown diabetes, but the condition has less severe signs and symptoms.\n\nRisk Factors\n\nThe most common risk factor for juvenile diabetes is age. Juvenile diabetes is a health condition that is more common in children and young people who are under 20 years (Bimstein et al., 2019). Although Type 1 diabetes is usually diagnosed in children and adolescents, the condition can also develop in adults. The common appearance during childhood or adolescence explains why the condition is referred to juvenile diabetes. Furthermore, juvenile diabetes has been described as a hereditary health condition. This point implies that a diabetic person has a parent, sibling, or family members who have juvenile diabetes. The genetic makeup of diabetic patients predisposes their family members to the condition. Other risk factors include having traveling away from the equator and being white (Bimstein et al., 2019).\n\nReferences\n\nBimstein, E., Zangen, D., Abedrahim, W., & Katz, J. (2019).

      "Lifespan Memory Decline, Memory Lapses and Forgetfulness Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nSensory, working, long-term, and short-term memory are basic human cognitive abilities. Yet, their nature is not completely understood beyond the well-recognized fact that human memory consists of various systems depending on several distinct brain regions. Still, the fractionation of these memory systems is grounded in scanty, insufficient research. One of the compelling subject areas that have been gaining traction in the field of psychology and neuroscience is the impact of age on the human memory systems. This report syntheses evidence from three recent scientific papers to demonstrate that lifespan memory decline cannot be ascribed to a unitary cause but rather stems from diverse determinants.\n\nMemory lapses and forgetfulness are some of the most common complaints among senior citizens. Henson et al. (2016) argue against the pre-existing deterministic notion that such decline is linear, pre-programmed, and inevitable regardless of a person’s life choices. The purpose of the research by Henson et al. (2016) was to deepen the understanding of differential aging of the brain on differential patterns of memory loss. According to the scholars, provided the findings are meaningful, they could serve as a valuable contribution to future strategies for age-related memory loss prevention.\n\nFor their study, Henson et al. (2016) recruited 430 participants between the ages of 18 and 88 years old. They were offered memory tests while their brains were undergoing MRI imaging for GMV (gray matter volumes) and WMI (white matter index) measurements. Interestingly enough, the scholars rejected standardized memory tests that do not make a distinction between three types of memory – associative, item, and priming. The findings demonstrated that age negatively affected the former two types, with the latter being the most resilient to aging effects. However, the three memory factors appeared to have differential sensitivity to age insofar as different contributions from gray- and white matter in the investigated brain regions.\n\nDespite the obvious contribution of this paper, it is important to keep in mind the limitations of its design. Henson et al. (2016) admit that the data used for the present research is cross-sectional, in other words, collected at one point in time. Indeed, a longitudinal design might have served the research purposes better as it would be able to capture the changing dynamics and distinguish the true effects of age. Many socioeconomic factors such as nutrition, lifestyle, and culture shape brain health outcomes that persist into old age. To the study’s credit, however, Henson et al. (2016) became the pioneers in memory research that included individuals ages spanning between 18 and 88 years old. This choice is refreshing when contrasted with studies that only focus on comparing younger participants’ (20-30 y.o.) performance to their older counterparts (60-70 y.o.).\n\nThe logical question that the reader might have after becoming familiar with the study by Henson et al. (2016) is what life factors shape memory outcomes in old age, even if at least some decline is seemingly unavoidable. Voluntary lifestyle choices that affect memory in old age are exactly the topic of a paper by Klaming et al. (2017). For their study, the scholars narrow the scope to the impact of lifestyle on episodic memory, defined as an individual’s ability to encode and fetch information in the context of time and place. Episodic memory is crucial to running errands and performing daily tasks, which allows for enhanced autonomy and self-agency in the elderly. The significance of the research lies in its practical implications for memory improvement in old age.\n\nKlaming et al. (2017) retrieved data from Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA), an ongoing prospective population-based study taking place in three geographic locations in the Netherlands. Cognitive function, as well as lifestyle choices information, was collected every three years between 1995 and 2009, making the present study longitudinal. The sample was almost exclusively limited to senior citizens who, at the moment of the first data collection, averaged 74.6 years old. Lifestyle was operationalized as a combination of factors such as smoking and alcohol consumption, sleeping habits, social engagement, and the level of physical activity. Like Henson et al. (2016), Klaming et al. (2017) did not study human memory as a whole but as a system of elements. In the context of this study, the evaluation memory was broken down into memory learning score, memory delayed recall score, and memory retention score.\n\nAs expected, Klaming et al. (2017) discovered a positive association between moderate to high levels of physical exercise and episodic memory function. The participants of the study drank 7.5 alcoholic beverages per week, and yet, alcohol consumption did not affect their memory measurements. In fact, alcohol abstinence was associated with worse results as compared to light drinking. Smoking, on the other hand, was a predictor of worse learning abilities. Normal sleep that is not too short or too long in duration and social engagement were determinants of functioning memory in old age. While these findings can be used for the development of intervention programs, it is important to remember that all data were self-reported, which means a possibility of bias.\n\nThe connection between lifestyle choices and memory in old age is justifiably optimistic. One may wonder what else could be in a person’s power to make sure they retain their cognitive abilities as they grow older. Apparently, self-image and positive thinking may as well be at play. Stephan et al. (2016) conducted a compelling study investigating how an individual’s perception of age may affect their memory. From the literature on the subject matter, it is known that older adults feel younger than they actually are. The question arises as to whether it is self-delusion or a powerful defense mechanism against age-related brain deterioration.\n\nStephan et al. (2016) recruited participants from the HRS, a nationally representative longitudinal study of Americans aged 50 and over. The main variables evaluated by Stephan et al. (2016) were subjective age, physical activity, memory, and depressive symptoms. The study also included covariates such as baseline age at the start of the study, sex, BMI (body-mass index), educational background, and medical history (diabetes, hypertension, and others). Even after controlling for covariates, Stephan et al. (2016) were still able to confirm that the perceived younger age was associated with better memory function and slower cognitive decline. Feeling younger was also related to fewer depressive symptoms. In contrast to the study by Klaming et al. (2017), physical activity had no mediating effect on memory function. The present study makes a contribution to the existing knowledge of memory and its determinants in older adults. However, the positive selection of the longitudinal participants is an inarguable caveat as admitted by the authors themselves.\n\nForgetfulness, confusion, and scatter-mindedness are socially and culturally associated with old age; it is a popular trope and a subject of many anecdotes ranging from entertaining to disheartening. However, the exact mechanisms of such changes have yet to be elucidated. This critical analysis discussed and synthesized evidence on lifespan memory in older adults, changes, and determinants. The existing body of literature confirms the inevitability of age-related cognitive decline. However, it is less linear as previously imagined since memory is far from uniform and regulated by several distinct brain regions. The other two studies challenge the deterministic view on aging and provide practical implications on what interventions can slow down memory decline. There is some debate about specific lifestyle choices and their impact. Yet, the very idea of being in control of one’s brain health can inspire more rigorous, evidence-based memory preservation strategies.\n\nReferences\n\nHenson, R. N., Campbell, K. L., Davis, S.

      "Breastfeeding in Young Mothers Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nNot all new mothers manage to follow the breastfeeding recommendations provided by health authorities. In Australia, compared to the general population of mothers, new mothers younger than twenty-five are significantly more likely to fail in implementing exclusive breastfeeding and, therefore, are listed among the priority populations for the national strategy to promote breastfeeding (COAG Health Council, 2019). This paper explores this demographic group in terms of factors that act as barriers to the continuation and initiation of breastfeeding, promising strategies to promote the practice, and the degree to which the existing strategies address the barriers to breastfeeding affecting young mothers.\n\nSocio-Cultural and Personal Factors Influencing Breastfeeding in Young Mothers\n\nEnough scholarly studies have been conducted to explore the factors affecting breastfeeding choices in women younger than twenty-five, including adolescent mothers, but recent studies that would focus only on this age group in Australia are few. Barriers to breastfeeding are likely to be similar across developed economies, which is why it is possible to use evidence from other English-speaking countries to understand the key factors that might be relevant to young mothers in Australia.\n\nYoung women’s determination to initiate and continue breastfeeding is affected by the degree to which the infrastructure is sustainable for breastfeeding activities. The evidence from a community-based participatory research study conducted in the United States suggests that the prominent socio-cultural factor that affects young mothers is access to places that are supportive of breastfeeding (Chopel et al., 2019). For some young mothers, the absence of places of worship where they could feed infants can become the reason to consider other approaches to infant nutrition (Chopel et al., 2019). Evidence from Australia also highlights the existence of this barrier to breastfeeding, especially in the workplace (Ogbo et al., 2016). Importantly, it is mentioned to be relevant to the entire population of mothers, not only those younger than twenty-five.\n\nAnother socio-cultural factor that is closely interconnected with the absence of breastfeeding-friendly places is the stigma against young mothers. Despite some attempts to destigmatize breastfeeding, the very act of nursing a child in public can still cause different reactions, including requests to leave or other disapproving comments (Chopel et al., 2019). For those becoming mothers relatively early in life, this stigma doubles and starts to include the perceptions of young mothers as irresponsible people that do not have goals in life (Chopel et al., 2019). It happens that young women that have children are automatically perceived as unmarried, which also adds to the stigma, thus encouraging them to avoid breastfeeding in public places (Australian Breastfeeding Association, 2016; Chopel et al., 2019). Although the Australian law considers breastfeeding in public legal and acceptable, the de facto situation is that even security guards and sales assistants happen to ask nursing mothers to leave public places (Ogbo et al., 2016). With that in mind, young mothers’ opportunities for breastfeeding are limited due to stigma, which may lead to suboptimal breastfeeding.\n\nPersonal factors that affect young mothers’ breastfeeding practices are diverse and mainly relate to knowledge about breastfeeding and relationships with others. According to the study by Chopel et al. (2019), support from others, including “peers, family members, and partners” facilitates young women’s adherence to breastfeeding recommendations, whereas its absence has an opposite effect (p. 313). The findings reported by Ogbo et al. (2016) provide further support for this factor and cite intimate partner violence and the lack of support from a woman’s partner as potential contributors to the poor maintenance of exclusive breastfeeding. Apart from receiving help from their partners, young women that have given birth often rely on their mothers and peers as sources of knowledge and advice concerning breastfeeding (ABA, 2016). With that in mind, the presence of informal support networks to compensate for young mothers’ inexperience in breastfeeding is the factor that can encourage more young women to initiate and continue the practice (ABA, 2016; Chopel et al., 2019; Ogbo et al., 2016). Conversely, the absence of such networks can hurt young mothers’ breastfeeding practices.\n\nStrategies to Promote Breastfeeding and Their Links to Factors Affecting Breastfeeding\n\nThe various strategies have been implemented in Australia and worldwide to encourage more young mothers to strictly follow breastfeeding recommendations. One of the key strategies to disseminate information about breastfeeding is the establishment of peer support networks for women, including young mothers. The need for informal support networks for young women became clear as a result of the Younger Mothers Project initiated by ABA volunteers (ABA, 2016). Nowadays, the ABA provides a breastfeeding peer counselor support program for all new mothers (Smith et al., 2018). Importantly, breastfeeding counselors popularize breastfeeding and share their experiences with new mothers instead of providing any medical advice.\n\nPeer support programs are known to be effective in different subgroups of the population, not only mothers younger than twenty-five. The effectiveness of peer support programs, in which trained counselors provide new mothers with information and advice, was demonstrated in a systematic review conducted by Hector in Australia (Smith et al., 2018). As per its results, peer counseling was shown to have strong positive effects on Australian mothers’ breastfeeding practices (Smith et al., 2018). The results of the UK-based time-series study conducted by Scott et al. (2017) demonstrate that peer support services for young mothers increase breastfeeding rates in new mothers younger than twenty-five. However, in their comprehensive review of strategies to support breastfeeding mothers, Smith et al. (2018) report that they did not find any meaningful differences between diverse at-risk groups in terms of the effect that popular strategies have on them. In other words, if the peer support approach is effective, it is probably equally effective for all subgroups of Australian mothers, including younger women.\n\nThe so-called peer support programs may involve different types of communication, including counseling by phone. Interventions that are based on proactive telephone communication between first-time mothers and those who have certain experiences in breastfeeding show positive results in Australian new mothers but are not widely used yet (Forster et al., 2019). Telephone communication, as well as e-mail counseling, are also parts of the peer support program offered by the ABA (2016). Such interventions are not aimed specifically at young mothers that are inexperienced in breastfeeding, but this demographic group benefits from it similarly to the general population. Peer support programs are likely to be implemented by child and family health professionals, as well as different breastfeeding associations.\n\nAnother strategy is the so-called Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative proposed by the World Health Organization. Since 1991, the aforementioned initiative has been implemented in more than one hundred and fifty countries, including Australia (Esbati et al., 2019). Based on a series of national studies, including that by Kramer et al. in 2012, it has been demonstrated that the BFHI has quite pronounced positive effects on breastfeeding duration and increases the percentage of women that initiate breastfeeding, including young mothers (Esbati et al., 2019). The mentioned strategy is likely to be implemented by child and family health professionals in facilities providing postnatal services.\n\nThe BFHI approach consists of ten steps, two of which (staff education and policy/monitoring system development) are defined as “critical management procedures” (Esbati et al., 2019, p. 2). Other steps are defined as the recommended clinical practices and include educating pregnant women on the benefits of breast milk, explaining the risks of bottle-feeding, and supporting breastfeeding women in case of difficulties before discharge (Esbati et al., 2019). Despite the program’s effectiveness, only less than one-quarter of all maternity facilities in Australia have fully implemented these recommendations (Esbati et al., 2019). Thus, the implementation of this strategy involves specific difficulties that still need to be overcome.\n\nBoth strategies are associated with significant positive results in terms of popularizing breastfeeding among new mothers in Australia, including women younger than twenty-five. However, they effectively address only some of the factors affecting young mothers’ breastfeeding decisions. For instance, by initiating the dissemination of knowledge about breastfeeding and teaching new mothers, the BFHI approach addresses young mothers’ lack of knowledge regarding how to breastfeed with minimal risks and discomfort, which is a personal factor. Moreover, it can partially address the factor of partner and family support by informing pregnant young women’s partners about the benefits and peculiarities of breastfeeding – one of the BFHI clinical practices involves providing information about infant feeding to women and their families (Esbati et al., 2019). The factor that involves accessing breastfeeding-friendly places is only partially addressed since the BFHI improves opportunities for breastfeeding in health facilities, not public places. Finally, in terms of the stigma around breastfeeding and young mothers, the strategy does not adequately address this factor since it contains no steps to improve attitudes toward young mothers and destigmatize breastfeeding in public places.\n\nPeer support networks provide young mothers with the opportunity to communicate with more experienced breastfeeders and receive emotional support. Therefore, they address certain personal factors affecting breastfeeding choices in young mothers, including inexperience in breastfeeding and the need for encouragement from others. However, it is unclear whether this strategy addresses the lack of support from women’s partners because breastfeeding counselors do not emphasize educating families. As for structural factors, although counselors can share their experiences with young mothers and give practical recommendations on how to deal with nursing a child in public and avoid conflicts with others, it would be an exaggeration to say that peer support networks destroy the stigma surrounding young mothers or make public places breastfeeding-friendly. It is because organizations and individuals involved in peer support networks do not actually work with people at large or promote positive images of young mothers countrywide. Based on the analysis of the two strategies, it is recommended to emphasize campaigns that would focus on changing society’s attitudes toward young mothers and the normalization of breastfeeding.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, young mothers’ inability to follow the scientific community’s recommendations related to breastfeeding is a well-recognized public health issue. Young mothers in Australia and worldwide face multiple barriers to proper breastfeeding practices, including stigmatization, the lack of breastfeeding-friendly places, inexperience, and the lack of support from partners and peers. The existing strategies, including peer support networks and the BFHI, allow increasing breastfeeding initiation rates and promoting optimal breastfeeding duration in different demographic groups, including young mothers. However, further actions, for instance, campaigns, may be required to address the stigmatization of young mothers and breastfeeding in public places.\n\nReferences\n\nAustralian Breastfeeding Association.

      "Business Entity Formation and Taxable Income Case Study\n\nA partnership form of business has several advantages over a corporation. The first advantage is that a partnership lacks a specific governing structure. A partnership business has the freedom of operating like private arrangements without reporting their activities to any authority. Therefore, they come up with ways of managing their own organization unlike the corporation which have to operate within specific laws. The second advantage is that a partnership form of business is not a separate legal entity. Therefore, there is free flow of assets in and out of the business. For instance, the owners can easily add or withdraw funds, property, goods, and services from the business without any restrictions. On the other hand, a corporation lacks this fluidity because they are separate legal entities. Therefore, it may not be easy to transfer property and funds in and out of a corporation. The third advantage is that a partnership business does not pay taxes unless the partners specifically chose to file tax returns like a corporation. In a partnership, the profits and losses at the end of the year are shared among the partners in the ratio of their capital contribution. The partners then incorporate them into their personal income tax. Therefore, filing tax returns is easy because there is no need for a separate tax return for the business. This eliminates the issue of double taxation that is evident in the case of corporations. The fourth advantage is that a partnership is easy to form, manage and run unlike corporations. They lack the extensive legal formation requirements that are evident in corporations. Finally, a partnership, business allows the owners to share responsibilities in running the business. Therefore, the partners can split responsibilities according to their area of specialization. Finally, a partnership form of business will allow the members to share profits and losses unlike corporations. Bill and Kerry should form a partnership business because it will grant them a lot of flexibility in their operations.\n\nIn this business, one partner (Bill) has contributed $70,000 while the second partner (Kerry) has contributed skills in accounting to the business. Therefore, their contributions will be regarded as equal despite the fact that one partner did not contribute cash. The partners can share profit, losses, liabilities, and management authority in equal proportions. Thus, each of them will have a 50% stake in the business. With the 50% stake for each partner, they should consider forming a general partnership business because each one of them has equal rights and responsibilities. A limited liability partnership would have been suitable if one partner has less liability, and does not participate in management decisions.\n\nBased on the discussion above, it is recommended that they open a general partnership business. Further, they will share the profit and losses in equal proportions. The calculation of profit and loss for each partner is presented below.\n\n                      Memo     Appropriation account\n                      Bill     Kerry                  Dr.      Cr.\nLoss for the year                                     $35,000     \nSalaries              0        0                      0           \nInterest on capital   0        0                      0           \nInterest on drawings  0        0                      0           \n                                                      $35,000     \nResidual loss         $17,500  $17,500                $35,000     \n\n\nIn the calculations above, it can be noted that the partners do not have salaries, interest on capital and drawings. Therefore, the loss of $35,000 will be shared in the ratio of 1:1. Thus, the share of loss for Bill is $17,500 while, for Kerry is $17,500.\n",
      "Mental Health Self-Support Group Coursework\n\nThe issues associated with alcoholism and mental health are among the ones that are the most difficult to cope with, partially due to the social stigma (Noronha, Cui, & Harris, 2014). Experiencing a problem associated with alcoholism and the ensuing mental health problems may become not only exhausting but also embarrassing for many people (Stimmel, 2014). Herein lies the significance of mental health self-support groups, which allow embracing the problem and addressing it accordingly. The mental health self-support group in question became the tool for helping around 100 people manage their alcoholism issues by changing their perception of the issue.\n\nNamed Long Beach Early Risers, the group was scheduled to meet every Saturday at 6.30 a.m. on Long Island Beach, in St. John’s Lutheran Church basement. The reason for choosing the identified group was based on the convenience principle – the meetings were held in the vicinity of my house (particularly, it took a 10-minute walk to get to the venue). Furthermore, the accessibility of the group should be mentioned among the primary reasons for me to attend its meetings. Discussing the topic of gratefulness, the participants shed a lot of light on the issue of alcoholism and the associated mental health problems that they either have been suffering from or may develop in the future.\n\nThe group was rather big, with a total of 100 participants. Although the attendance rates never actually reached 100%, there were still a lot of people to provide support and share their emotional experiences. Furthermore, there was a notable prevalence of male participants (approximately 70% of the total population). Therefore, there was a threat that the needs of women, who were in the minority (30%), might be overlooked. Nevertheless, all issues were addressed during the group meetings, with every category of the target population experiencing a gradual improvement in their attitude toward the problem. The age also varied greatly among the group members, 25 being the youngest group members and 70 being the oldest ones. Only 10% had a diploma, whereas 80% barely managed to graduate from school. All group members were white Caucasians.\n\nThe members of the group seemed to have succeeded in forming a bond with one another. There was a threat that, with the population so big and diverse, creating strong ties will not be a possibility. However, as implausible as the connection was, it, nevertheless, occurred. Sharing their stories and experiences, the participants managed to establish a strong emotional connection with one another.\n\nThe leadership issue played an important role in helping the people create a bond. With the active use of transformational and visionary leadership styles, the person in charge of the meetings created an environment in which change was viewed as not only a necessity but also an inevitable process. Thus, the recognition of the problem was the purpose of the group. The function thereof, in its turn, concerned the development of a coping strategy (Stimmel, 2014). Consequently, the 12-steps program meeting can be viewed as an efficient way of promoting change among the target population (Noronha et al., 2014).\n\nTherefore, it can be assumed that the group managed to meet the set goals rather successfully. Every person attending the meeting recognized the significance of changing their lifestyle and attitude toward drinking. Furthermore, the importance of maintaining positive relationships with the family members was addressed successfully.\n\nThe identified experience was essential for me as a nurse. It helped gain a better insight into the needs of a person struggling with substance abuse issues. Furthermore, the detrimental effects that alcoholism has on mental health have been explored.\n\nHelping the participants define their alcoholism-related issue and develop the framework that would help them suppress the craving, change their lifestyles, and rebuild relationships with their family members, the 12-step program served as the foundation for changing these people’s lives. Therefore, it can be assumed that the mental health self-support group helped the participants not only recognize their issues but also develop a responsible attitude toward the problem and adders it accordingly.\n\nReferences\n\nNoronha, A., Cui, C., & Harris, R.

      "Researching of Mixit development project Report\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThe impacts of the global COVID-19 pandemic, social inequalities, and racism on New Zealand identify the change in needs of young people from refugee and migrant environments. Mixit is a community development project committed to supporting youth affected by the ongoing situation. This report addresses the research funders, Mixit’s external stakeholders within the sector, and the government interested in the current landscape of Mixit’s programs. It provides some insight into the current climate in the youth context and suggests future steps for the Mixit project to better serve young people.\n\nThe research findings are based on the information gathered through in-person interviews, focus groups, Mixit huis, workshops, webinars, digital conferences, and Young People forums. Current societal changes lead to young people’s disruption resulting in a rapid rise of social and economic deprivation and isolation. Moreover, the needs are found outside of Auckland, and support should be provided at the national level. The pandemic aggravates the existing inequalities, and young people are likely to face additional pressure in 2021. At the same time, the current challenges can become an opportunity for Mixit to evolve and expand other organizations’ involvement and for youth to cooperate and contribute to post-disaster recovery. The core program is confirmed relevant to serving young people’s needs; however, there is a need for developing networking activities to contribute to the outreach program.\n\nSix C’s Framework was designed highlighting the six areas for the organization to focus on:\n\n  * Cohort;\n  * Communications;\n  * Connection and Collaboration;\n  * Culture of Confidence;\n  * Consistency;\n  * Contribution\n\nIntroduction\n\nBackground\n\nMixit is a community development project based in Auckland, New Zealand, that supports young people from former refugee and migrant backgrounds. It aims to bring together youth with different experiences and engage them in creative activities. According to Mahony et al. (2017), “the economic, social and cultural rights (ESCR)” in NZ largely depend on volunteers and NGOs due to an insufficient legal framework (p. 5). Mixit was established in 2006 following the initial research into refugee youth’s needs and ways to help them with successful integration into new communities (“About,” n.d.). Founded in 2012, The Mixit Charitable trust assists young people at the community level and guides the project’s vision.\n\nThe new environment where humankind finds itself due to the COVID-19 pandemic, social issues, and racial injustices is significantly affecting young people at psychological, social, economic, and educational levels. The needs of former refugee and migrant youth are changing, which requires assessing the value, impact, and reach of Mixit programs. Currently, refugee quota intake has been on hold due to the COVID-19 response after an increase from 1,000 to 1,500 in July 2020 (Bellamy, 2020). According to Webb et al. (2020), disasters disproportionately affect young people’s developmental stages putting their well-being at risk. A constantly altering environment requires Mixit to adapt and ensure that the needs of young people from refugee and migrant backgrounds are met sustainably.\n\nPurpose\n\nMixit is committed to remaining relevant and supporting the young people affected by the ongoing situation. Hence, the Mixit Research project identifies where refugee and migrant youth requirements are met, indicates the gaps, and outlines how organizations are responding. The program delivery needs to be reviewed and recalibrated in accordance with the altered environment and goals. This report addresses the research funders, Mixit’s external stakeholders within the sector, and the government interested in the current landscape of Mixit’s programs. This report aims to present the findings of the scoping research on the changing needs of refugee and migrant youth in NZ, as well as identify which gaps are filled and which leave much to be desired.\n\nMethodology\n\nA qualitative method was applied to create this report; in particular, interviews with internal and external stakeholders, as well as potential strategic partners, were conducted to collect data relevant to the Mixit Research. The key findings of Mixit huis, workshops, webinars, digital conferences, and Young People forums were synthesized, analyzed, and presented in a comprehensive report.\n\nData Collection & Points for Consideration\n\nIn-person interviews, webinars, forums, and focus groups were used to gather information from individuals involved in resolving issues that youth from refugee backgrounds faces. The contributions of different events are presented in Figure 1. Semi-structured and unstructured interviews and discussions with stakeholders allowed for gathering a snapshot of the current landscape and gaining insights regarding the subject and future outcomes.\n\nFigure 1. Contributions to the Mixit Research Project.\n\nNote. The wide-ranging activities and events provided numerous insights into young people’s needs and associated challenges for Mixit.\n\nFindings\n\nCurrent Landscape\n\nIn 2019 Mixit had commenced developing National Outreach programs and established workshops, consultations, and new partnerships in Hamilton and Christchurch, with plans to expand into other regions where refugee resettlement was identified. As part of this strategic development, it also introduced a new staff position of Outreach Coordinator. However, the global lockdown imposed additional risks on the youth and halted all the planned activities. Mixit recognizes the importance of stability and, thus, has adapted its program delivery in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2020, Mixit continued to run activities online during Alert Level 4 concurrent with the Research, Review, Reset initiative. Furthermore, the national perspective became a part of our research phase, integrating the plans and activities for different regions. The Mixit Research project’s status is depicted in Figure 2.\n\nFigure 2. Current Status Framework.\n\nNote . The framework highlights the Mixit Research project stages, offering an overview of the objectives and the recent progress.\n\nThe overview of the current landscape for Mixit can be presented as follows:\n\n  * it is unclear when the refugee quota will get reinstated;\n  * MIXIT’s reputation is strong;\n  * MIXIT’s programs and approach to using creativity as a vehicle remain relevant and in demand;\n  * lack of alignment is observed between government, community organizations, platforms, and pathways, for young people and their voice;\n  * young people’s needs haven’t changed but are highlighted even more due to the COVID-19 pandemic;\n  * extended consultations and lack of action are observed.\n\nNeeds of Young People\n\nCurrent societal changes lead to young people’s disruption resulting in a rapid rise of social and economic deprivation and isolation. Their health and well-being are at significant risk, identifying the need for analysis of changing needs of youth from refugee and migrant backgrounds. Some old patterns and approaches to sector support are becoming irrelevant. Furthermore, structural changes are observed, and the communities are changing: large multi-ethnic African communities (often of Christian faith) have been replaced with diverse multi-ethnic Middle Eastern communities (often of Islamic faith). Hence, the needs and issues that Mixit faces are now very different.\n\nAs stated by the interview respondents, Mixit’s ability to create strong bonds and build continuing relationships makes it attractive to the target audience. Youth Forum in Auckland showed that young people appreciate Mixit for its positivity, enthusiasm, supportiveness, and new people they meet. As indicated in “Case study: Mixit Project” (n.d.), young adults feel connected, and their creativity not restrained by judgment becomes “a vehicle to empower“ (para. 8). Despite the struggles of 2020, Mixit researched and remained active on social media, maintaining positive engagement.\n\nThrough conversations, interviews, and discussions, several vital needs for youth from former refugee and migrant backgrounds were highlighted:\n\n  * young people are frustrated about being asked for their opinions and not seeing the outcomes of interviewing;\n  * reciprocity is crucial: young adults need to be valued and recognized for their contribution;\n  * the youth requires more creative activities apart from performing and opportunities for growth;\n  * the needs are found outside of Auckland, and support should be provided at the national level;\n  * the youth needs to be enabled to participate in decision-making and take on responsibilities to initiate and lead their projects;\n  * the gap in leadership skills development should be filled in;\n  * young people are willing to add value to other community organizations and their programs.\n\nIn terms of the COVID-19 situation, the following themes and trends can be outlined:\n\n  * the global pandemic exacerbated all the existing inequalities;\n  * significant transitions are required from the face-to-face to online learning;\n  * lack of devices, stable WiFi connection, quiet private space for studying or socializing increase the stress level and anxiety;\n  * online communication leaves out non-verbal social cues that many young people rely on;\n  * for isolated families, providing the information is challenging;\n  * for students doing the National Certificate of Educational Achievement (NCEA) COVID-19 outbreak disrupted their trajectory;\n\nOpportunities and Challenges\n\nThe current situation implies both new opportunities and challenges for Mixit and young people. The main challenges and key opportunities to counter them are presented in Table 1.\n\nTable 1.

                                 \n\n\nNote . The Mixit Youth Forums in Auckland, Christchurch, Hamilton, and Wellington provide insight into the pressing issues that youth from refugee and migrant backgrounds face.\n\nSix C’s Framework\n\nAs a result of a one-day forum with internal stakeholders (board members, staff, and volunteers) and clients (youth), the six areas for the organization to focus on in the future were recommended. Any gaps identified between ‘desired reality’ and ‘current state’ for each area will be explored further to determine what will be required to move forward (milestones and actions).\n\nCohort\n\nThis area of focus involves the Mixit team: Mixers (past and present) and staff. The research identified the need to:\n\n  * locate, connect with, mentor and empower, train and employ, retain a connection with Mixers, Youth Leaders, Young People, Young Adults, Alumni, Facilitators, and Staff;\n  * stay in touch and offer engaging opportunities (Mixit can consider R&D for new ideas and trial them in Auckland before taking them further);\n  * provide additional mentoring and develop some events beyond Saturday Programme;\n  * establish YL-led initiatives like Zoom weeknights;\n  * empower the Cohort by letting them help set the future, come up with new ideas, try them out, and involve them in project teams to support the future strategic plans and initiatives;\n  * grow the Cohort nationally in a deliberate way.\n\nCommunications\n\nThe majority of the forum participants highlighted the question to improve communications: ‘How Can We Be Famous?’ Some ideas include the need to:\n\n  * engage people and keep them connected;\n  * introduce Mixit storytelling: share all the good, the fun, the joy, the opportunities by using the voices of Mixers;\n  * let the Cohort help generate content;\n  * shout about the benefits and possibilities that Mixit offers;\n  * find more channels to communicate with refugees, migrants, their parents, and communities;\n  * follow-through, keep in touch after consultation, connection;\n  * share success stories with funders and government agencies;\n  * Develop a Communications Plan and Strategy that keeps stakeholders informed and connected.\n\nConnection and Collaboration\n\nThis area of focus aims at connecting the dots and implementing an outreach strategy that requires Mixit to:\n\n  * establish a Stakeholder Database to enable effective and regular communications;\n  * ensure contact and communication, and collaborate with the Do’s\n  * including other refugee and migrant agencies, government, councils, funders, schools, ESOL, sports, and organizations;\n  * work together with collaborative partners to secure resources, funds and remove obstacles and barriers to participation;\n  * help to foster cross-sector communications.\n\nCulture of Confidence\n\nThe application of the Mixit values at all times is critical to keep developing and enhancing the core program. There is a need to:\n\n  * ensure Mixit is a welcoming place: the newcomer is the most important person in the room;\n  * build confidence through arts and possibly extend to offer sport and other events;\n  * help the Cohort to grow and develop their confidence through activities, inclusion, empowerment, employment, mentoring, involvement in projects, storytelling, leadership opportunities;\n  * encourage more talking/communications/connection at Saturday sessions – “more than one word.”\n\nConsistency\n\nThis focus area involves applying and adhering to the Mixit model for the core Auckland program and further outreach. It requires the following:\n\n  * a consistent application of values at all times, in all settings;\n  * the need to stretch it across Auckland and take it to a national level;\n  * the implementation of the core Mixit model;\n  * the need to find a way to protect Mixit IP;\n  * audit framework.\n\nContribution\n\nThis aspect refers to measuring Mixit’s contribution to a better Aotearoa, such as:\n\n  * measuring social and emotional impact, as well as economic impact (where possible);\n  * stronger communities;\n  * longitudinal studies.\n\nFuture Steps\n\nMixit recognizes the importance of prioritizing future actions, understanding dependencies and infrastructure requirements, and developing sub-projects and project teams to move some of these initiatives forward. Given the challenges, opportunities, and the need of young people identified by the Mixit Research, the project should focus on:\n\n  * mapping out a proposed blueprint with a set of initiatives and projects:\n  * operational initiatives;\n  * with more strategic oversight and governance (e.g., Mixit model distribution and ensuring an agreed level of consistency, the retention of IP, and so on);\n  * presenting the proposed blueprint to the Board;\n  * assigning resources, activating teams;\n  * To achieve its altered objectives, Mixit developed an outline of future steps (as presented in Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3. Future Steps for Mixit.\n\nNote . Synthesizing the HUI outcomes is the first step toward refining the plan and enhancing Mixit in accordance with the youth’s needs.\n\nConclusions\n\nTo summarize, significant gaps and inconsistent support between the top tiers of advocacy and policy and those working on the ground at the coalface with young people in the communities were identified. At the times of the global pandemic, the importance of mentoring and creating connections for young people and adults becomes even more relevant. Mixit strives to create a more inclusive society through implementing Outreach Programmes aimed at strong collaborations and improved communication nationwide.\n\nIn analyzing the interview and target groups data, two themes emerged which can be considered the crucial Mixit Research findings:\n\n  * the core program is confirmed to be relevant and valuable to serve the young people’s needs well;\n  * the need for developing networking activities to contribute to the outreach program is established.\n\nRecommendations\n\nFuture Mission Statement\n\nMixit will invest and evolve to serve young people and enable social cohesion across Aotearoa.\n\nHigh-Level Strategic Goals\n\n  * implement Outreach Programmes to improve opportunities for young people nationwide;\n  * establish strong collaborations with other organizations and agencies (i.e., DOC, Spirit of Adventure Trust, Outward Bound, RASNZ, Shama, NZRC, Red Cross, ROC, Ara Taiohi, Empower, and others);\n  * continue monitoring the changing needs of young people.\n\nReferences\n\nAbout .

      "Budgeting and Operations Forecast for Marketing Sony Music Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Marketing budget estimates for Sony Corporation\n 3. Discussion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nAs indicated in the marketing plan, Sony Corporation plans to diversify its operations to emerging markets in developing countries such as Brazil. The company has established a new market niche that is comprised of middle aged people that can purchase its music system. The market is large and is characterized by other competitors such as Samsung and LG. In addition, the market is characterized by free entry and exit of firms. In order to maximize on its market niche in Brazil, Sony Corporation should market its music system to its new market. For effective marketing, the firm needs to set aside a large sum of funds that will be used for different marketing functions (Kitchen & De Pelsmacker, 2004). The proposed budget for the marketing department for Sony is indicated in the table below.\n\nMarketing budget estimates for Sony Corporation\n\nItem                                   March  April  June   Marketing Expenditures for first quarter\nWebsite                                750    500    0      1250                                    \nBlog                                   500    500    500    1500                                    \nWebsite Tracking                       750    750    750    2250                                    \nOnline Campaigns                       5000   0      5000   10000                                   \nSMS Campaigns                          0      2500   0      2500                                    \nPrint Magazine Adverts                 2500   0      2500   5000                                    \nTrade shows, Exhibits and conferences  15000  0      15000  30000                                   \ncatalogues and brochures               500    500    750    1750                                    \nSales negotiation training             2000   0      2000   4000                                    \nTotal                                  27000  4750   26500  58250                                   \n\n\nDiscussion\n\nFrom the above table, it is clear that marketing of the music system of Sony will cost the corporation a good amount of money at least for the first quarter of its foreign venture. The allocation of the funds as seen will be on different cost items.\n\nFirst, the firm needs to increase awareness of its music system to online customers. Technology has advanced and many people are increasingly doing business online. The ability of Sony to establish a website is significant because it will enable the firm to tap revenue from its online customers in the emerging market. Online customers may not come from Brazil alone, but other countries as well. A website should be accompanied by a blog on which the music system will be described by the firm while allowing customers to post their feedback on different company features. The cost of website tracking must be incurred because it helps the firm establish the level of customers’ traffic to the website of the company. In addition, out of the total number of visits to the website, tracking will determine the sales conversion. Lastly, online campaigns can be effectively carried on the company’s website besides marketing the music system on other websites such as social sites (Schenk, 2012).\n\nSony will have to incur more costs on SMS where by the firm will be sending potential customers SMSs to convey information on the promotion of music system. Print magazines are a significant way of marketing the firm’s music system. The magazines can be sold at a low price to allow as many potential buyers as possible to access them. Magazines on Sony’s music system are also related to the catalogue of the company’s products. However, the catalogue is more detailed as it indicates all products of the firm and their prices.\n\nRoad shows are other ways that Sony can market its music system. This is one of the items in marketing that consumes much money as it involves moving from one region to another while publicizing the music system of Sony. Last is the sales team that has to be trained on marketing strategies to be applied in marketing the music system of Sony. The team will have to be paid especially at the beginning and at the end of the training. Marketing is a continuous process and it has to continue even when the firm has gained a dominant position. However, the budget for marketing can only be for the first quarter of the financial year that begins from March to May. The road shows and online campaigns are the activities that will consume much of the marketing funds.\n\nReferences\n\nKitchen, P. & De Pelsmacker, P. (2004).

      "A Moral Expert: Is There Such a Thing? Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Initial Position\n 3. Using Credible Evidence to Support Initial Position\n 4. Anticipation of Possible Proponents along with Responses\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to Anderson (2010, p. 7), Plato defines a moral expert as a person who has the knowledge to state and identify what is already known. In this case, a moral expert can take the position of educating, resolving debates, and most importantly improving people’s morality. It should be known that there a lot of definitions that have been augmented towards moral experts whereby they are also referred to as people who have acquired the knowledge that is necessary to understand major ethical values, concepts, and theories (Hoffmaster et al, 1989, p. 13). This means that they are capable of relating these values, concepts and theories to certain situations thereby having the knowledge to usefully apply them in resolving any ethical dilemma.\n\nAs far as all these definitions are concerned, the purpose of this paper is to take a position on whether moral experts exist? In addition, it will also support defense by using credible evidence. Finally, the paper will also anticipate for possible proponents and respond to them.\n\nInitial Position\n\nI believe that there is no such a thing as a moral expert based on two assumptions. First, many of us have controversial moral believes based on cultural and religious backgrounds. The second assumption is based on the idea that we cannot deliberately identify a moral expert because of confusion in the literature that regards to the definition of moral experts. There is no specific check or an independent measurement tool that can possibly be used to identify moral experts.\n\nUsing Credible Evidence to Support Initial Position\n\nMcGrath (2007, p. 45) argues that there is no obvious way that one can find him/herself in the space of a moral expert at the expense of others. This is because there is lack of an independent check that is crucial in ascertaining if one is a moral expert or not. In this case, there is no existing measurement for moral expertise. This is not as simple as an eye exam whereby which we might determine whose moral vision is wrong or right. Therefore, the truth about a given individuals level of moral expertise is mysterious and inexplicable. There are a lot of controversial believes and after considering these ideas, it is difficult to prove that although we all have controversial moral beliefs, they are uncontroversial among moral experts (McGrath, 2007, p. 29).\n\nIt should be known that getting answers to questions regarding the existence of moral experts depends on answering the questions of how to justify moral judgments (Gesang, 2008, p. 34). This speaks of the idea that moral believes are controversial and these controversial believes will not only direct the moral decision but also the justification of choosing it over another. Along the same line, Driver (2006, p. 28) argues that unwillingness to support the existence of moral experts is due to the fact that some possess controversial views about moral judgment.\n\nIn this case, she believes that it is impossible to have a situation where moral judgment is neither true nor false because it is based on emotional responses. I really agree with this idea because what someone reveals as a false moral judgment can be presumed to be true by another person. She believes that a moral expert forms his beliefs under conditions of cognitive consistency and trustworthiness. This therefore means that when we are identifying moral experts, we need to determine these conditions. As much as this might be practical, I argue that it is impossible to determine these conditions which are still mysterious and ambiguous.\n\nAnticipation of Possible Proponents along with Responses\n\nSome possible proponents might claim that moral experts exist and argue that philosophers might be moral experts. However, I believe that philosophers are not moral experts for many reasons that are based on existing literature.\n\nFirst, Archard (2009, p. 29) points out some reasons that might explain why moral philosophers are not moral experts. One of these important reasons is the reality that there are extreme differences in opinion between moral philosophers about moral issues. Additionally, another reason is the difficulty in clearly identifying who is a moral expert. These difficulties can be looked at from two different angles. In this case, expertise cannot be claimed with lack of objectivity, and secondly, an average person does not follow the advice of moral experts.\n\nThe author offers a better reason that strongly doubts why moral philosophers should not be moral experts. In fact, he argues that modern moral philosophers think that their developed theories are related to common-sense morality. This is something that commands ordinary individuals to use such theories to regulate their own lives (Archard, 2009, p. 50). Such believes can guide philosophers to use their theories and apply them in resolving ethical dilemmas. This should be understood as a crucial point because some theories are far from common-sense morality.\n\nAccording to Singer (1972, p. 114), moral judgments are simply controversial. He clarifies the idea that anyone’s moral views can be as good as anyone else’s. Therefore, he claims that there is no such thing as a moral expert which means that moral philosophers are not moral experts. In fact, it should be understood that since there is lack of agreement between philosophers regarding the principles and values of morals, philosophers are not moral experts (Miller et al, 1984, p. 35).\n\nConclusion\n\nPersonally, I lean towards the non-cognitive philosophical view which is based on the idea that if moral expertise involves the possession of particular moral beliefs, and if moral judgments do not express someone’s believes, then there can never be moral experts whose expertise consists of their moral beliefs (Cholbi, 2007, p. 327). I don’t envisage a point where an individual can be able to suppress his or her own moral believes which defiantly guides moral judgments.\n\nReference List\n\nAnderson, R. D. (2010).

      "Tax Treatment of Attorney Fees Case Study\n\nTax Memo\n\nRelevant Facts\n\nSara in her individual capacity has incurred attorney fees and other costs of $ 11,000 in connection with her litigation with the Texas County Board for changes in zoning law so that her three parcels of land comprising of 30 acres could gain in value which was only $ 15,750 per acre before her appeal. During the pendency of her appeal in the court of law, the Texas County changed the zoning law permitting two residences per acre as against the original law of only one residence per every two acres. And as expected, the value of her land increased to $ 25,000 per acre. To recall, the property Sara received from her mother was only worth $ 15,750 attributable to the then prevailing pattern of land zoning. Stagnation in the land value was due to the said zoning that restricted to one residence per every two acres. Hence, she applied to Texas County in 2010 for changes in the zoning which however was rejected. Sara went on an appeal in 2011 as constitutional challenge of the Texas County’s zoning law which was unsuccessful. Then in October 2011, she appealed to Texas County District Court. By November 2011, the County suo moto effected change in the zoning law allowing two residences per every acre from February 2012 onwards.\n\nIssues identified\n\nThe issue now is about the tax treatment of her attorney fees and other costs which she incurred half in 2010 and another half in 2011. Tax treatment means whether expenditure is deductible from one’s income for income tax purposes. In order to decide on deductibility, it should be decided whether the given expenditure is a revenue expenditure or capital expenditure. If former is the case, the expenditure is deductible. If latter, it can only be capitalized. This again depends on whether the expenditure is incurred in the course of business or in individual capacity for personal purposes. Obviously, Sara has incurred attorney fees and other costs in her individual capacity and hence tax law applicable to individual shall be examined in this case.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn Sara’s case, the origin of the claim led her to incur attorney fees and other costs, and hence the expenditure must be capitalized as per Sections 263.\n\nAuthorities & Reasoning\n\nSection two hundred sixty three and 263 “A” provide for capitalization of expenditure incurred for betterment of real estate. Thus, attorney fee and other costs incurred for defending or perfecting title are eligible for capitalization by being added to the value of the property and not by being deducted from the income of the individual for relevant period. If this rule is to be followed, Sara has incurred expenses for litigation which have led to the Texas County making changes in zoning norms thus increasing the value of her property. Hence her attorney fees and other costs of $ 5,500 + 5,500 should be added to the value of land as at the end of each year 2010 & 2011respectively regardless of legal outcome in 2012. (CCH (1), (2), Wolters Kluwer, 2013).\n\nIn Lee D. and Marjorie L. Hustead v. Commissioner (1994), taxpayers’ claim to treat attorney fees and other costs incurred for constitutional challenge as a deductible expenditure was rejected. This was an identical case in which petitioners had challenged zoning norm that allowed only one residential dwelling per acre. Later on, the township changed the zoning norm to permit 4 dwellings per acre. This led to an increase of fair market value of petitioners’ land by 85 %. Although they had capitalized expenditure they incurred for challenging the original zoning, they claimed the said costs in their income tax returns as deductible expenditures which the respondents rejected as per section 263A. However, the court held that section 263 would apply and still the expenditure could only be capitalized. In view of the above position, Sara can only capitalize the fees paid to attorney and other costs as part of expenses incurred for the purpose of increasing the land value as contemplated under Section 263.\n\nReferences\n\nAICPA-Store (2007).

Type of Management Decision and Financial technique\n 5. The impact of the decision to the share price\n 6. Reference List\n\nCompany’s governance structure\n\nThe Board of Directors oversees the operations of Rio Tinto. They delegate the daily management roles to the Executive Committee and the company’s chief executive. The shareholders may nominate an Executive Director to the Board of Directors or the Nominee Committee may pick an Executive Director to join the Board.\n\nThe institution also consists of the Sustainability, Audit, Remuneration, Nominations, and the Chairman’s Committees. The Management plays an administrative role and entails; the Investment, Procedures and Disclosure, and the Executive Committees (Rio Tinto, 2013).\n\nStrategies aligning stakeholders’ interests\n\nA capital of about $5.2 billion is required from investors into the venture and thus a share issue is inevitable. The company plans to maximize output by investing in low-cost mines as well as commitment to optimize available capital by directing resources into projects with highest returns.\n\nRe-opening the Panguna Mine\n\nRio Tinto considered the balance between the ore’s size estimates versus the amount of capital required to restart the project. Feasibility study has pointed towards approximately 16 million ounces of gold and 4.6 million tons of copper. Another consideration is how investors will channel $5.2 billion into the venture. Additionally, the management considers the reception they expect to get in the region considering the uprising that led to a loss of estimated 20,000 lives in 1989. The management also seeks to follow government policy therefore will need an approval from relevant authorities to start its operations.\n\nType of Management Decision and Financial technique\n\nThe type of decision-making involved in the business is non-programmed and strategic. The decision is complex and crucial and important to the business, hence non-programmed. Strategic decisions have a long-term implication for the business and involve enormous sum investment into the business, mainly to expand the business focus. The decision-making process is the role of the senior management of the company.\n\nThe company involves a financial technique based on the external analysis of the business, rather than the internal factors like the cash flow, liquidity and performance of the business. The company’s profitability deteriorated, from 2010 $19.608 billion in operating profits to $2.576 billion in operating losses in 2012. Loss accumulation results in a cash flow deficit in the company. The management does not put these factors into consideration. On the contrary, they incline their decision to external factors like the political dynamics of the region and other environmental factors (Khan, 2013).\n\nThe impact of the decision to the share price\n\nRio Tinto’s share price will decrease as a result of the decision. The decision involved has a high-risk due to previous outcomes of the civil war that led to the shutdown of the company in 1989. Additionally, the deterioration observed in the company’s financial performance is also alarming to the shareholders. The change of equity in the company’s annual report could be indicating continued withdrawal of the shareholders from the company.\n\nThe shareholders’ equity totaled to $64.512 billion in 2010, 59.208 billion in 2011 and 58.021 billion in 2012 (Rio Tinto, 2013). The trade deficit in major economies has also raised a recession alert. The projected economic recession could lead to decrease in the company’s value of shares (Denning, 2013). The company could also receive some hostile reception due to the previous civil wars. Such uncertainties will scare investors, leading to a drop in the share price. However, risk takers are likely to gain a lot when the project succeeds.\n\nReference List\n\nDenning, D. 2013, Recession Alert for the Australian Econom, .

      "Cardiovascular Disorder Overview Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe heart produces two sounds when it beats normally lubb and dub. The former is generated when the valves linking the ventricles and arteries shut. The latter is produced when the valves connecting the ventricles and the main arteries close up. Heart murmurs are a series of vibrating audible sounds created by turbulent blood flowing inside the heart. These audible sounds take a longer time than the usual lubb and dub heart sounds and can be perceived between the usual audible heart sounds.\n\nMurmurs are abnormal audible successive sounds that are created as an effect of turbulent blood pour. When the velocity of moving blood within a tube exceeds a definite value, turbulence build-up and energy are dispersed audible vibrations, which generates as a result. Turbulence comes about as a result of blood passing through a little hole in a platter that partially occludes a tube when the diameter of the tube is adjusted abruptly. A stethoscope is used by the physician to detect a heartbeat\n\nSymptoms\n\nThe signs and symptoms of heart audible sounds vary; with the exact cause of the heart sound. Innocent heart sounds and heart murmurs that don’t impair the task of the heart more often than have no signs and symptoms. Heart Murmurs which result from rigorous abnormalities of the heart valves or other congenital cardiovascular fault may lead to feeding troubles or failure normal growth in infants, dizziness, and shortness of breath, fainting, rapid heartbeats, chest pain, chest pain, lung congestion, and Fatigue with exercise or exertion (Friedman pg 89).\n\nCause of loud Murmurs\n\nPractical systolic ejection heart murmurs comprise pulmonic flow audible sounds in sick individuals with both normal and increased aortic or pulmonary artery flow. The common practical systolic ejection abnormal audible heart sound in adults is perhaps a variation of Still’s sounds, the innocent murmur of infancy . It is a buzzing, short, pure, average-pitched, mid systolic, non-radiating murmur perceived best alongside the upper left sternum border.\n\nIt is considered to be a product of vibrations put in action by the pulmonic valve. A less commonly experienced practical pulmonic flow sound, occurring mostly in adolescents and children, emanating from the pulmonary arteriole root. It is midsystolic ejection in location, but not similar to Still’s murmur. This type of murmur is is high pitch sound, blowing in nature often, and is comparable to the flow of abnormal audible sound perceived in sick individuals with the back syndrome. Practical systolic ejection sounds come about as a result of blood flow over the aortic valve (McCool pg 205).\n\nLoud heart sounds at the second space intercostals, to the left side of the sternum are usually caused by the following defects in blood flowing through the heart. The blood flowing inside the semilunar valves lead to process take place at the start of blood ejection that begins after S1and stops with the ending of the blood flow which is before S2.\n\nConsequently, the beginning of a loud ejection murmur is estranged from S1 by the isovolumic contraction period; the ending of the murmur and the S2 hiatus is the pulmonary or aortic consort time. The consequential design of this murmur is a crescendo-decrescendo type of murmur. This type of murmur is caused by outflow obstruction, increased blood flow in usual semilunar valves, pulmonary trunk, or dilation of the aortic root and semilunar valves structural changes without obstruction.\n\nAortic blood outflow obstruction\n\nAortic blood outflow obstruction may be caused by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy or aortic valve stenosis with a rough and harsh quality. Valves aortic stenosis may generate a musical or harsh murmur , over the right second intercostals space of which it radiates into the neck and spread over the two carotid blood vessel. Aortic stenosis is mostly common caused by calcified valves because of aging followed then by congenital bicuspid valves.apical impulse is usually present in The distinctive trait among the above two cause is for the reason that bicuspid valve aortic stenosis has slight or no radiation. This may be established if aortic ejection sound is present, which is a squat untimely diastolic murmur, and usual carotid pulse. The low sound in valvular aortic stenosis reduces with straining and standing with Valsalva maneuver.\n\nHyper valve stenosis\n\nHyper valve stenosis, which is the loudest at a position to some extent higher than in that of valvular aortic stenosis and May perhaps radiate to the right carotid arteriole more.Subvalvulve aortic stenosis is frequently as a result of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, with the loudest over the left sternum margin or the apex. The audible sound in hypertrophic cardiomyopathy murmurs amplifies in sound intensity with an upright arrangement in addition as straining by Valsalva maneuver.\n\nPulmonic outflow bloods obstruction\n\nPulmonic outflow bloods obstruction which is harsh audible sound usually located on left second intercostals space rising to left neck and convoyed by palpable thrill. It may be differentiated from Ventricular septals fault by pay attention to the S2, which is usual in Ventricular septals fault but it is broadly tear in pulmonary stenosis. Nevertheless Ventricular septals fault is approximately constantly pansystolic where the audible sounds of pulmonary stenosis which is of a diamond- figure and reaches the end clearly prior to S2. Several innocent audible sounds also come about from this area but S2and S1 must split usually.\n\nDilation of pulmonary artery\n\nDilation of pulmonary artery generates an ejection sound, in the company of a short ejection systolic audible sound and a comparatively wider split S2. There is absence of hemodynamic abnormality. This is comparable to pulmonary hypertension with the exception of the final has hemodynamic instabilities.furthermore rise in semi lunar valve blood flow which might be caused by pregnancy, hyperthyroidism and pregnancy.\n\nAortic sclerosis of valve\n\nAortic valve sclerosis is caused by thickening of aortic blood vessels, they don’t cause any hemodynamic instability or obstruction and hence different from aortic stenosis.\n\nConclusion\n\nMidsystolic or Systolic ejections murmurs are caused by turbulent frontward flow crossways the left and right ventricular outflow strip, pulmonary or aortic valve, or through the pulmonary artery or aorta.Turbulences are generated by impediment to blood flow, valves dilation, and rise in the velocity of blood flow or a combination. Systolic heart sounds are classified relating to how loud the heart murmur is, which is based on a range from 1-6 with a ranking six being the loudest( Parker pg 55)\n\nWork cited\n\nFriedman, John.

      "The Lehman Brothers and the Current Economic Crisis in the U.S. Report\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Background\n 2. Legal analysis\n 3. Ethical Analysis\n 4. Contributing factors: Corporate Culture and Corporate Governance\n 5. Ethical Decision Factors to Consider\n 6. Recommended Corrective Action\n 7. References\n\nBackground\n\nThe US economy is clearly under siege. Although many financial analysts trace the current financial meltdown to the housing bubble that was witnessed earlier in the decade, it remains less clear as to how things got out of hand to reach such a terrible state. In the housing debacle, housing prices have been rapidly increasing over time from 1999 at a rate of 6 percent, therefore drawing the attention of many investors interested in real estate.\n\nBut the bubble was formed by 2006 when the housing prices moved out of line with key basics such as household income. The bubble was further inflated by the swift rise of lending to sub-prime borrowers (Bailey, Litan, & Johnson, 2008). Indeed, individuals previously locked out of mortgage trading markets became key targets for lending, often done with absolute disregard to set financial policies, and in full knowledge of industry supervisors and regulators who failed to curtail extreme risk-taking\n\nFinancial, Mortgage, and Investment institutions came up with innovative financial packages to sustain the huge appetite from borrowers who wanted to invest in the housing industry. However, some of these packages failed to observe the standard risk management procedures. With poor forecasting that the real estate business would continue to rise, borrowers were allowed to postpone paying monthly interest rates due to the lenders, notwithstanding the fact that some lenders never requested any down-payment to guarantee property ownership. These unethical practices propelled the already worsening situation to what it is today – a total financial meltdown.\n\nBig conglomerates like the Lehman Brothers, Boston Properties, and Simon Property Group have all drowned in a state of insolvency (International Forecaster, 2008). This paper aims at presenting a case analysis of the Lehman Brothers in the ensuing financial crisis.\n\nThe Lehman Brothers is one of the Wall Street Firms that has been greatly affected by the current economic crisis to a point of filling for bankruptcy under Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection (Shiller, 2008). Headquartered in New York City, its interests included investment management, investment banking, private equity, research, equity, private banking, trading, sales, and fixed income. As a conglomerate, its primary subsidiaries comprised of Lehman Brothers Inc., Eagle Energy Partners, SIB Mortgage Corporation, Neuberger Berman Inc., Lehman Brothers Bank, Aurora Loan Services, Inc., Crossroads Group., and FSB (Lehman, 2007). All this subsidiaries reflect on the point that Lehman was a financial services firm. This sector was the worst hit by the current financial crisis as outlined in the introduction.\n\nThe fourth-largest investment bank in the US dealing with big and complex financial investments, it was anticipated that Lehman would fall victim to the current economic crisis. The conglomerate had invested heavily in securities that were associated with the Sub-prime mortgage market, a key factor in the current economic quagmire. Mortgage investments were seen as high risk thereby knocking off the confidence investors had in Lehman Brothers (Stephenson, 2008).\n\nThe lack of confidence was further Jeopardized by the collapse of Bear Stearns. Lehman was left with no option than to write down huge amounts of toxic bad debt of around $60 billion, and adjust the value of its investments in commercial property and residential mortgages – key areas that brought about the housing bubble (Marcus, 2008). This saw its share price go down by more than 95 % in a period of one year. More painful was that the USA Treasury and investors were adamant to bail out the investment bank. Lehman Brothers had to announce insolvency.\n\nIt can be suspected that poor lending strategies coupled with non-compliance of set traditional financial rules were major contributing factors in the Lehman Brothers debacle. This boils down to sub-prime lending. Some executives in the conglomerate must have slept on their jobs to allow lending to individuals who are heavily indebted, otherwise known as high-risk borrowers. In absolute disregard of ethical practice, the culprits in this debacle were interested in the higher interest rates and fees that are associated with Sub-prime lending. While they chased the profit potential of this type of lending, they failed to instigate sufficient measures to put it under regulation (Hojnacki, White, & Shinck, 2008). This unethical practice coupled with speculation about the US mortgage market can be linked to Lehman Brothers Collapse.\n\nThe key stakeholders in the case are those people who were charged with overseeing the conglomerate’s financial operations and transactions. These are the executives, managers, supervisors, and to a larger extent the regulators of the US financial markets. Financial institutions were given much leeway to depart from traditional banking rules and procedures to a point that borrowers could be allowed to defer paying the monthly interest rates on loans advanced (Hojnacki, White, & Shinck, 2008).\n\nLegal analysis\n\nIn the ever competitive market, governments must protect consumers from unfair business practices. The relationships between individual consumers and firms that provide them with goods and services must be protected from defective products, unethical or fraudulent business practices, and misleading information (AllBusiness. Com, 2009). In the US, the area of public law that regulates such private law relationships goes by the name of consumer protection law. Indeed, this serves as an umbrella law for an assortment of other consumer protection laws put in place by the Congress.\n\nUnder the federal consumer protection law, consumers must be protected from abusive or unfair practices in the collection of debts due to other businesses. Debts must be collected in a fair manner, and consumers provided with an avenue of disputing and checking if the information regarding the debt is accurate. This is provided for under the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act. Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act, the confidentiality of consumer reports is guaranteed. Businesses must not divulge any consumer information filed with them to anyone, including the Consumer Reporting Agencies (Federal Trade Commission, 2008).\n\nConsumers are also protected under the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) when engaging in credit transactions with financial institutions since the lending arrangement and key terms regarding the lending, and including all the costs involved must be disclosed in truth to the consumer. Lastly, the consumers are protected under the consumer protection law from being haphazardly billed while repaying their loans without due regard to established regulations. This is provided for under the Fair Credit Billing Act (FCBA). Failure to comply with the above legal issues automatically leads to prosecution. These laws are implemented by the Federal Law Commission.\n\nLehman Brothers therefore failed to comply with the law since they failed to disclose their lending arrangement and key terms regarding the mortgage industry to their customers in the hope that they would make huge profits out of sub-prime borrowing (Hojnacki, White, & Shinck, 2008). Crucial information regarding the future of the industry was kept out of reach of its consumers despite all available information pointing to the fact that the country was headed for a housing bubble. This is a violation of the TILA Act. Sub-prime borrowing also attracts unfairly high interest rates and fees charged on the borrowers (Hojnacki, White, & Shinck).\n\nThis unfair billing is in contravention to the FCBA Act. The factors that made the conglomerate to flout the rules are purely profit based. The stakeholders wanted to make quick extra money out of this high-risk group of borrowers in total disregard of traditional financial regulations. This was made possible through the existence of a disjointed and weak financial regulation system, weak fiscal policies, and too much leverage that were entrenched by the Clinton administration (Bailey, Litan, & Johnson, 2008).\n\nEthical Analysis\n\nFirst, it would be impossible for anyone to believe that the chief executives of Lehman Brothers, together with industry regulators were inept enough not to know what was going on in the mortgage industry. There must be something that allowed intelligent managers to insist on following unintelligent behavior (Greycourt, 2008).Massive leverage and high risk behaviors were only the symptoms of a much critical ailment – that of complete breakdown of ethical behavior across the management of Lehman’s.\n\nTherefore, one of the ethical consideration observed is that the top executives at Lehman’s went ahead to act and behave in ways that served their own interests in complete disregard to what such self-centered behavior of seeking profit would have on their clients, employees and the broader American economy. Such behavior contravenes the ethical theory of utilitarianism which gains its roots from the ability to forecast the consequences of any particular action (Rainbow, 2002).\n\nThe choice that yields the greatest rewards to most people is the ethically correct one. This was not followed as the executives of the company chose to serve their own interests. The ethically sound behavior would be to carry the interests of your employees and clients at heart; they are the reason that you are in business.\n\nThe second ethical consideration in the Lehman Brothers debacle is that the collapse caused a lot of pain to people who had otherwise banked their faith and hopes on the enterprise. We saw instances of panic across the world after its collapse. People who had bought shares with the investment bank lost massive amount of money due to devaluation of their shares. Banks that had lent money to Lehman’s were left in disarray. This is a serious ethical issue and contravenes the ethical theory of rights.\n\nThe highest priority is accorded to the rights set forth by society (Rainbow, 2002). Lehman Brothers did not exist in a vacuum; it existed in a society governed by rules. Investors only agreed to put their monies in Lehman’s only because they knew they were protected by the rules set by society. To go under with, or devaluate the monies given by the investors is a serious ethical blunder on the part of Lehman Brothers. In this scenario, the only ethically sound behavior is to reimburse in total all the monies due to the investors without factoring in devaluation issues.\n\nThe Third ethical consideration is that the executives at Lehman Brothers saw the crisis coming. The crisis did not happen overnight. Indeed in the 1980’s, there was a similar small-scale economic crisis that hit the US financial sector and bore similar characteristics to the current one (Hojnacki, White, & Shinck, 2008). To say that they didn’t see it coming is a serious ethical issue, and is in direct contravention to the Casuist ethical theory.\n\nIn this theory, present ethical situations are compared with previous similar ethical situations and their outcomes (Rainbow, 2002). If Lehman’s executives and regulators could have compared the occurrences of the current economic crisis on its onset to previous similar economic meltdowns, they could have noticed its severity and act accordingly. However, this was not done, or was largely ignored. The ethically sound behavior is therefore to always compare current trends with previous similar events and draw a line of action.\n\nContributing factors: Corporate Culture and Corporate Governance\n\nAnalysts have pointed an accusing finger regarding Lehman’s failure on its corporate governance. Indeed, Lehman’s corporate culture helped fuel the unethical behaviors discussed above. Lehman had withered many trying moments, including the Great Depression of the 1930’s. For the Financial Services giant to be felled by the financial shakeup of 2008 shows that its corporate culture was deep asleep not to discern and reconnect the happenings of this decade to future situations (Spengler, 2008). This ineptness must have fueled the unethical behavior of overlooking set traditional financial regulations of mortgage lending in search of quick profit. As one financial analyst rightly said, Lehman’s corporate culture is masked in secrecy. Its corporate culture also failed in creating trust between its investors and the conglomerate, effectively deepening its economic woes.\n\nLehman’s corporate culture was seen as an inspiration to the ambitious and the greedy (Spengler, 2008). Indeed, professional and skilled risk managers were sidelined by the executives whose only preoccupation was how they could reap immense profits from the emerging mortgage lending market. This is an unethical behavior. Further, the executives were too preoccupied with how to gain ground on their arch rivals in the industry – Goldman Sachs- and didn’t have time to listen to their own professionals in risk management (Mathiason, Connon, & Wachman, 2009). This shows a disjointed corporate culture. Of course Lehman Brothers had very good risk assessors. But they got their options all wrong due to their appetite to achieve fast growth by using unethical behaviors.\n\nThe corporate governance at Lehman’s also contributed to the unethical behavior that led to its collapse. Its former CEO Dick Fuld ran the investment bank as if it was at war with itself, ignoring any signs of future collapse (Parker, 2008). Industry analysts describe Fuld as a burly CEO who’s only concern was to take risks with investments of other people who had trust in the bank. This reveals how Lehman’s corporate governance fuelled unethical behavior.\n\nAs reported by Parker, there existed a power struggle in the bank’s boardroom between two crucial players. Furthermore, the executive team, charged with the responsibility of steering the investment bank towards growth never engaged in any healthy debate. Indeed, old non-executives who lacked adequate banking experience sat at board meetings and served as the board of directors. This is another unethical behavior that threw Lehman Brothers into disarray as the old individuals were not in touch with the financial realities on the ground. If they were, they could have reorganized themselves after the earlier collapse of Bear Stearns.\n\nEthical Decision Factors to Consider\n\nThis case analysis has numerous factors that must be addressed to amicably solve the legal and ethical issues surrounding this case. One of the most important factors is the flouting of traditional financial laws and practices to chase personal ambitions. It has indeed been proved that the senior executives at Lehman Brothers did just that, thereby bringing an enterprise that was founded in 1850 to its knees.\n\nOther factors that have arisen from this case and need to be addressed includes poor leadership structure, poor forecasting of priorities, weak or ineffective financial regulations on the part of the government, reorganization of corporate culture, engagement in high-risk borrowing and behaviors, refunds of investor’s money, and profitability versus the general good. These are some of the ethical and legal factors that were inarguably responsible for the insolvency of Lehman Brothers. They must be addressed in detail by other financial institutions to prevent a recurrence. Below is a table listing these ethical issues and the factors to be considered in each issue based on the theories of ethical thougt discussed in this case analysis.\n\nEthical Theory                                             Ethical Issue                                                      Factors to be considered                                                                                                     \nUtilitarianism                                             Flouting traditional financial laws to chase personal interest     Class of people getting the loans, arrangement before lending, rate of loan repayment, interest rate payment, rate of default\nLeadership structure                                       Communication channels, board meetings, respect of portfolio     \nReorganization of corporate culture                        Vision and objectives of the institution, adherence to policy    \nProfitability V/s good                                     Rights of clients and employees, current financial condition     \nTheory of rights                                           Refunds of clients’ investments                                    Pain and suffering of clients, effects on other financial institutions                                                       \nToo much levering/ little government financial regulation  Ease of flouting banking rules, unconventional banking laws      \nCasuist ethical theory                                     poor forecasting of priorities                                     Past occurrences and trends, value of transactions at marketplace                                                            \nEngagement in high risk lending                            Past occurrences and trends, value of transactions at marketplace\n\n\nRecommended Corrective Action\n\nVarious suggestions have been made regarding the future of the financial industry in the US in the face of the current global meltdown. Just before the onset of the economic crisis, many US financial institutions were accused of flouting traditional financial laws to chase personal interest. In the fight for customers to lend money just before the housing bubble, banks could defer interest rates, among many other homegrown solutions to keep customers streaming into their counters (Bailey, Litan, & Johnson, 2008). Flouting traditional banking laws was what brought about sub-prime borrowing.\n\nThe corrective measure here is to ensure that executives are well trained on flouting traditional financial laws. The best practice is for the federal government to formulate universally acceptable banking and financial laws to be implemented by all banks operating in US. A regulatory body should be created to keep this unethical behavior under check. Defaulters should be punished. A policy to that effect should be developed and presented to the Congress for ratification into law. This would help check such unethical behaviors that are perpetrated by our financial institutions while shrouded in secrecy.\n\nThe leadership structure of any corporation is its backbone. Productivity will be affected if there are competing interests in the leadership structure like it was the case with Lehman Brothers (Parker, 2008). It is unethical behavior for leaders to compete for personal gains instead of pulling the corporation out of the economic quagmire. Lehman Brothers could have been saved if the executives cared to listen to their professional risk assessors. But the leadership structure and chain of command was compromised. This again is unethical. The corrective action to be taken here is for companies to come up with rigid structures of command that will ensure that employees down the scale have their right to freely express themselves.\n\nThe structure should come up with amendments that will effectively make it illegal for chief executives of listed companies like Lehman to unilaterally make decisions without comprehensive consultations with all stakeholders. Dick Fuld unilaterally operated Lehman Brothers like his personal property, resulting to its insolvency. This should further be developed into a policy in conjunction with the labor office to ensure that it has some legal backing. These recommendations and amendments can also be used in reorganization of corporate culture.\n\nIn the ethical issue of profitability versus universal good, the recommendation is that no corporation must be allowed to trample on the rights of its employees or clients on account of chasing profitability. This is ethically wrong. The rationale behind this assertion is that no entity can exist without the assistance of employees and clients; entities do not operate in a vacuum (Spengler, 2008). A good policy to check such unethical behavior would be to develop frameworks through which corporations are made accountable for their daily activities. An independent employee and clients’ advisory body set at an organizational level whereby all can report their grievances and action taken can also serve to curtail this unethical behavior.\n\nMany clients and investors are left in deep pain and anguish when companies they trusted so much go under with their hard earned investments. It is a demoralizing experience. As a recommendation, federal auditors should be facilitated to carry out impromptu audits on financial institutions, especially those suspected to be involved with underhand dealings (Stephenson, 2008). The best practice would also be to refund any monies owned to the clients within 21 days after the collapse to save them from more anguish.\n\nPoor forecasting of priorities and engagement of high risk borrowing go hand in hand as one must obviously lead to the other. Engagement in high risk lending during the housing rush of the early years of this decade was as a direct result of poor forecasting that house prices would continue to rise (Hojnacki, White, & Shinck, 2008).\n\nThe events that followed are there for everyone to see. On high risk borrowings, otherwise known as sub-prime borrowing, the financial institutions must be made to follow the set down laws and regulations regarding borrowing, and every banking institution must be made to have provisions for bad debts. This can serve to be the industry’s best practice in borrowing. Policies regarding borrowing and lending have already been developed but financial institutions keeps on flouting them. What are therefore needed are tougher rules to ensure compliance.\n\nNo one for sure knows how long the economic crisis will continue to wreck havoc at a world-wide level, or how many more businesses will go under. The harsh reality is that it has been the worst economic crisis ever to be witnessed from the Great Depression (Marcus, 2008). Financial institutions have been worst hit by the wave, with the insolvency of Lehman Brothers sending shockwaves around the world. There is no magic word for survival. But financial institutions may hold on and resist insolvency if they transact their businesses with the ethics and legality they deserve. Any shortcut may spell doom – just like Lehman Brothers.\n\nReferences\n\nAllBusiness. (2009). Consumer protection laws for corporations . Web.\n\nBaily, M.N., Litan, R.E., & Johnson, M.S. (2008).

      "Diglossia in the Arabic Language Program Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Summary\n 2. Critical Review\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Reference\n\nSummary\n\nThe process of learning Arabic represents quite a challenge for English-speaking students due to structural and vocabulary-related differences between the languages. However, the task of learning Arabic can be simplified by introducing what Palmer refers to as diglossia into the curriculum. Namely, apart from learning the formal Arabic language, students should also be exposed to the experience of the spoken Arabic language, thus, integrating into the community. As a result, the process of learning will occur at a much faster pace, as the research results indicate.\n\nCritical Review\n\nThe article under analysis strives to convey an important idea of learning the language by communicating it and observing how it is used in a community of native speakers, while also embracing the academic perspective on it, hence the notion of diglossia. The paper contains quite a number of solid arguments, which reinforce the general positive effect that the article leaves. Palmer (2008) manages to establish a historical context that would serve a vital role in the further assessment of the significance of diglossia for effective learning. The combination of observations made in the context of the present-day learning setting and the overall development of Arabic language learning in the U.S. setting produces a positive effect on the analysis. Therefore, the author should be credited for a thorough and all-encompassing literature review.\n\nThe methodology developed by the author represents another advantage of the paper.\n\nArguably, the methods used in the study also incorporate a minor weakness defined by the limitations of the selected research method. Namely, the development of a questionnaire and, specifically, the integration of the 6-point scale as the main measurement instrument could have contributed to a minor inaccuracy. First and most obvious, the use of a scale on which the participants would place themselves implies the presence of certain subjectivity in the answers (Palmer, 2008). Second, the inclusion of the six-point scale of the Likert type makes it difficult to transform the qualitative data, such as the extent of agreement with a statement, into the quantitative one.\n\nIn addition, the outcomes of the study allow improving the current approach toward teaching Arabic, tailoring it to students’ needs, which is vital for the successful development of language skills. Specifically, the results of the study point to the fact that the vast majority of learners agree on the necessity of including spoken Arabic into the curriculum. Although there are significant discrepancies in students’ opinions concerning whether spoken Arabic should replace the standard one completely in the curriculum or whether the two should be taught in tandem, the general gist of what students presently need is evident (Palmer, 2008). Therefore, the study provides an impetus for a substantial improvement in the learning process on the institutional level, which is a crucial advantage of the study.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe significance of the research is rather high since it provides the grounds for the further update of the present framework for Arabic language learning in the U.S. If applied to the present-day academic context, the outcomes of the study will inform the teaching strategies and the pace at which students will acquire appropriate skills. Thus, the level of mastering the Arabic language is also expected to improve. Finally, with the focus on the practical application of language skills, one could expect the presence of an intuitive understanding of the Arabic language and its use in students. Therefore, the study can be considered a vital tool in addressing the present Arabic language learning challenges.\n\nReference\n\nPalmer, J. (2008).

      "Natural Foods Store Opening in the United States Research Paper\n\nThe natural foods market in the United States is a growing and highly competitive segment, which provides substantial opportunities, but poses significant challenges. Research shows that the consumption of such products has notably increased in recent decades, and they currently account for a considerable part of total food sales (Hwang & Chang, 2019). However, this upward trend attracts the attention of large retail chains with immense financial and human resources. Thus, the success of a company willing to enter this market largely depends on careful planning and implementing all the aspects related to its store opening. Every detail can be a valuable factor in determining new business efficiency and attractiveness to its potential customers. The elements requiring specific attention include selecting the right location, hiring the necessary people, arranging the initial supplies, defining the expected financial indicators, and conducting an efficient promotion campaign.\n\nThe first issue to be solved while planning to open a new store is choosing the optimum spot for it. It is difficult to underestimate the significance of this decision since it is going to shape the customer profile and business performance for years. The first consideration in this regard is to ensure sufficient market potential at a given location. This also includes analyzing the visibility of the future store and street traffic at its place. Then, it is necessary to analyze the existing competition, especially generated by large-scale chains. For this purpose, a spatial accessibility model can be used, which classifies all areas based on the distance from a retailer selling similar products (Wang et al., 2018). It is also reasonable to consider that people with higher-than-average income constitute the majority of potential customers since the price is the primary barrier to purchasing such products (Hwang & Chang, 2019). Besides, good placement relative to suppliers and available infrastructure can substantially reduce future logistical expenses. When all these aspects are taken into account, the selected site becomes a foundation for a successful business.\n\nThe next critical step is to determine the required staff for the store opening and its operation. It is possible to involve temporary workers for some tasks, but most employees should be hired permanently. Sharing the authority with future employees and allowing them to make some decisions within their competence brings them to feel their importance and generates an overall favorable corporate culture (Wah, 2017). The first position to be filled is the store manager, responsible for the general administration of its opening and operation. It is then feasible to think of an accountant to be in charge of the financial aspects and the arrangement of all banking relations. A person specializing in purchasing should be appointed for the initial stockpiling and concluding of the necessary supply contracts. Finally, several merchandisers, sales managers, and cashiers should be hired based on the expected store size. It is also necessary to admit that outsourcing some activities, such as legal services, is a feasible approach for a small or medium enterprise. This will allow creating a dedicated and professional team for the new store.\n\nAfter hiring the required personnel, it is reasonable to define the expected financial characteristics and necessary stock for the store opening. The first task is to calculate permanent expenses, such as rental fees and utility payments. Within their reduction efforts, evaluation of the possible energy saving options, along with the costs of their implementation, should be conducted. Then, it is necessary to calculate labor costs based on the previously selected organizational structure. Various administrative fees and the expenses for initial supplies will constitute the final part defining mandatory spending for a store opening. Based on the known available budget, this will allow determining the spare funds, which can be allocated to the promotion campaign. Besides, evaluating the expected revenues based on the initial market research and newly received store expense data will allow obtaining preliminary profit values. The review of all these financial indicators will both substantiate the previous decisions and serve as a motivator for the necessary adjustments in-store placement and structure.\n\nFinally, a critical step for a new retailer is a targeted and efficient promotion campaign, in which the grand opening occupies a central part. Since the store belongs to an already popular natural foods market, it should be focused not on the overall benefits of this type of product, but the particularities of the given business. It should provide specific data such as “location, merchandise, hours, prices, and special sales” (Lamb et al., 2017, p. 254). For this purpose, it is reasonable to order a short news story in several local newspapers and magazines. Besides, a door hanger campaign dedicated to the grand opening ceremony and distribution of discount coupons can be valuable for increasing retailer popularity (Brown & Fullen, 2017). The main idea to be reflected in the advertisements is the dedication to its quality, which is the principal factor for most natural purchasers in this segment (Hwang & Chang, 2019). This comprehensive promotion campaign will be a crucial tool for the success of a new store in this highly competitive market.\n\nAs the discussion above shows, planning for a grand opening is a complicated task requiring consideration of multiple aspects. The selection of the proper site will define the potential number of customers and the level of competition. Hiring the right personnel and distributing their responsibilities properly is another required prerequisite for successful business operation. A proper promotion campaign will increase brand awareness and make it popular among the locals without imposing an unnecessary financial burden on the company. Although all these activities require significant time and effort, their proper execution will create a foundation for the long and smooth operation of the new store.\n\nReferences\n\nBrown, D., & Fullen, S.

      "Violence Against Women as a Public Health Concern Essay\n\nThe United Nations (UN) states that despite being a developed country, Australia has yet to overcome the social ill that is violence against women. In its annual report, the UN characterizes the phenomenon as “disturbingly common” and calls to action. VicHealth uses the definition of violence put forward in the World Health Organization’s 2002 World Report on Violence and Health. The document highlights the three components of violence: intentionality, the use of physical force or power, and a high likelihood of injury, death, moral damages, deprivation, or maldevelopment as a result of violent actions (1). While violence against women fits the definition of violence against individuals or groups as a whole, it does have some unique characteristics. According to VicHealth, women are more likely to fall victim to sexual violence, be forced into prostitution, and be trafficked (1). Stalking, which encompasses the following, watching, or harassing, is an issue that affects women the most. Another subset of violence against women is harmful cultural practices such as genital mutilation, dowry-related violence, and traditions that humiliate, belittle, or endanger women.\n\nTo put the issue in perspective, one may take a glance at the most recent numbers and figures reflecting the situation with violence against women in Australia. Before the age of 15, one in six women experiences violence, while after the age of 15, the share increases up to two in every five women (41) (1). One-third (34%) of Australian women were victims of physical violence, and every fifth girl or woman (19%) was sexually assaulted (1). When addressing violence against women, it is critical to identify risk groups.\n\nRisk identification was one of the primary goals of the 2018 report by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Institute. According to their findings, there are at least eight vulnerable demographics: children, young women, senior citizens, disabled women, and LGBTQ+ women (2). Socioeconomic determinants are also at play as Australians from minor cultural and linguistic backgrounds, socioeconomically underprivileged people, and people residing in rural Australia also bear a high risk (2). Aside from that, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Institute expresses its concerns regarding the soaring rates of domestic violence among Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations.\n\nIn recent years, the Australian Government has put effort into combating violence against women at the national level. In 2010, the Council of Australian Governments introduced the National Plan to Reduce Violence Against Women and Their Children 2010–2022 (3). The new plan obliged state and territory governments across the country to devise strategic plans to manage and prevent gendered violence (3). Around the same time, researchers observed mobilization within communities and the emergence of health services. These services can be put into three categories: screening for domestic violence, providing responses to incidents, and managing diversity (4).\n\nEach Australian territory has health services and helplines that can be used by women at risk and in immediate danger of violence. For example, in New South Wales, NSW Domestic Violence Line takes calls 24 hours a day/ seven days a week. It provides primary counseling over the telephone as well as gives the callers information on the next steps and refers them to other services (6). Queensland operates an around-the-clock DVConnect Womensline that not only provides telephone counseling to women trying to escape domestic violence but also helps with temporary crisis accommodation for them and their children (6). In South Australia, the lead public health agency responds to calls regarding sexual assault and offers not only counseling but also information regarding law enforcement (6). Aside from helplines, Australia has numerous crisis centers and women’s shelters, many of which adopt a “No wrong door” policy. The policy implies that even if a particular shelter cannot accept a woman, they refer her to another service.\n\nAustralia recognizes that violence against women is a grave public health concern, which is why, from year to year, it increases the funding of related health services and initiatives. In 2019, the Prime Minister announced that as part of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children 2010-2022 , the Government would be investing the record AUS$328 million (6). The Government prioritizes prevention, which is why AUS$68 million are reserved for measures such as free training for health workers to identify abuse and violence. $82 million will go to frontline services designated to keep Australian women safe.\n\nHelplines such as the nationwide 1800RESPECT will also receive large funding of $64 million. Shelters and crisis centers will be able to use $82 million to better provide accommodation to victims (6). Lastly, the Government shows awareness of the standalone gender dynamics in indigenous communities and the unique treatment that they require. Addressing the issues in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities is estimated at $35 million (6). Lastly, some community-based centers use philanthropy, fundraising, and donations as the primary sources of funding. It is difficult not to acknowledge the Government’s commitment to addressing the issue with an adequate funding plan accompanied by residents’ individual efforts.\n\nAt present, there are a number of public health interventions that are being implemented to target violence victims and risk groups. As mentioned before, when it comes to gendered violence and abuse, prevention is a top priority, which is why screening has gained a lot of traction. The Domestic Violence Routine Screening Program is an early identification intervention that allows healthcare professionals to prevent escalation and refer women to other services. The screening strategy is a part of the routine assessment of all women receiving antenatal, child, and family health care as well as women attending mental health and substance abuse services (7). In addition, screening is recommended when women present themselves for presenting for sexual health or HIV testing (8).\n\nAccording to the University of New South Wales, routine screening conducted by a skilled professional is associated with higher rates of disclosure of violent incidents (8). A healthcare worker can be a trusted person as they can guarantee confidentiality. A professional has validated screening tools at their disposal, which allows for effective communication that would not be possible with general questions. On the other hand, the impact of a single screening may be limited and not lead to a follow-up from the potentially vulnerable women.\n\nThe implementation of routine screening requires professional training, which is another public health intervention against gendered violence in Australia. There is a plethora of training programs and workshops available to health professionals. The goals of education include the ability to react to disclosure of violence, screen for violent incidents, provide an initial response (risk assessment and safety planning), and support the victim (8). There is no information about nationwide legislation regarding health worker education, meaning that such interventions are probably community-based and hospital-based. Without additional support, they are likely to yield underwhelming results, mostly due to administrative barriers. Healthcare providers may be under pressure to work within stringent time constraints, which leaves little time for education (9). When putting their knowledge into practice, they may face an unresponsive criminal justice system (9).\n\nThe limitations of the previous two interventions demonstrate the complexity of violence against women as a public health concern. Indeed, efforts need to go beyond the healthcare system and involve other institutions as well. Ideally, there should be a strong health-justice partnership that would offer “joined up solutions to joined-up problems (8, p. 16).” Together with the Women’s Council, the Department for Child Protection and Family Support provides a framework for multi-agency interventions to protect women from violence (10). Their recent report covers successes in building closer ties between institutions such as the Department for Child Protection and Family Support and the Department of Corrective Services, and Western Australia Police (10). The stakeholders advocate for further involvement of agencies such as Domestic Violence Outreach and Safe at Home programs and family violence courts.\n\nMulti-agency interventions may lead to women’s improved access to services. Collaboration would reduce the response time and lead to a more efficient execution of justice. On the flip side, however, uniting efforts always means the investment of additional time and resources. Coordinating two or more agencies is extremely challenging, and a lot of bureaucracy might be involved. There is still a lot of variation in how stakeholders operate individually, which means there might be no universal solution for bringing them together.\n\nPublic health interventions introduced to combat violence against women mean extra workload for healthcare professionals. There is evidence that Australia is experiencing healthcare workforce shortages, which means that the existing cadres have to take up more responsibilities (11). Training, education, and screening may become additional stress for those working at already understaffed facilities. However, it is not only stress from working under time pressure that may be daunting for healthcare providers. Research shows that people working with abuse victims are prone to burnout due to the intensity of emotions involved in the process. For instance, one study shows that caring for victims with severe injuries may impact nurses’ turnover intentions (12). To recapitulate, while the new interventions may bring the quality of health care to a new level, they are likely to take a physical and mental toll on healthcare workers.\n\nReference List\n\nViolence against women in Australia.

      "Internet Function and Potential in a Democratic Society Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main text\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nSince the popularization of the Internet, there has been a public debate on its impact on political life in countries worldwide. Some believe that this is a step towards liberalization; others see digitalization as the end of democracy. This essay argues that the Internet introduces the world to the new quality of liberal democracy degradation. The age of conventional media affected democratic society in a vertical way that is monopolized by the major stakeholders. Nowadays, the Internet is a horizontal platform that yet does not become Habermas’ public forum (Sunstein, 2001). As people limit their sources of information online, one can observe the degradation of discourse and the growth of populism as well as the radicalized population.\n\nMain text\n\nTo begin with, conventional media like television and radio has always been indeed monopolized by the establishment, especially in the U.S. due to technical reasons. This situation is comparable to the Medieval Age before the introduction of printing in the 1440s. The church and the courts monopolized books, and the population had no chance to learn an alternative opinion on the essential matters of life. Television and radio become game-changing technology in legitimizing political decisions, even in democracies (Barstow and Stein, 2005). As Herman and Chomsky (1988) conceptualize it, information translated by the conventional media goes through five filters, which create agendas and messages beneficial for the ones at power. Hence, such media creates private space without the actual debate, which harms democratic principles.\n\nAs for the Internet, in its era population still cannot hear all the voices. The reason for that lies in the fact that people and media create communication universes, bubbles that filter the sources and opinions contradicting users’ believes. It is proved by the research conducted by Iyengar (2006), who examined media preferences of different parties sympathizers. That is why social media produce a reasonable number of online communities, oriented on specific groups with specific political interests like IAFF Union Firefighters for Trump or Black Women for Bernie Sanders on Facebook. Meanwhile, Sunstein (2001) emphasizes the crucial role of shared experience and empathy for a society living in a democracy. In reality, the Internet intensifies solidarity within the group of one’s choice, which makes them more confident about their position.\n\nFurthermore, the Internet seems to attract more users to populist figures who gain their popularity by putting on a show online and articulating simple solutions to structural problems. Probably, the most widespread example is Donald Trump for whose election Twitter is sometimes blamed. His central premise to his voters was building up a wall separating the States from Mexico that presumably could solve the issue of illegal immigration. As a result, the American migration policy has seen several scandals with children separated from their parents and Muslims having no access to the country. However, the problem stays unsolved. This causes the degradation of discourse, which brings a society to less prudent decisions.\n\nAt the same time, the Internet serves as a platform for radicalization instead of the spread of democratic values. For instance, it has become the condition without which the rise of the Islamic State terrorist organization would have hardly ever happened. First, Facebook and Telegram were the critical mediums of jihadi propaganda. What is more, the efficient recruitment of foreign fighters who joined the IS from all over the world was only possible in the era of messengers and social media. Another vital example to draw one’s attention to is the Christchurch shooting that the far-right extremist who organized the attack was broadcasting in real-time on Facebook. The network had no chance to prevent such actions while the violent events happening on the video were seen by a reasonable number of users, spreading the idea behind the former. Social media become the space of glorification of violence and the spread of hatred and extremism. This tendency does not contribute to the flourishing of democracy: on the contrary, people are demonstrated that there are alternative means to act and to articulate their political agendas.\n\nTurning one’s attention to the opposite camp, one could learn that many claims that the Internet is a democratic tool in the way it provides a platform for the ones whose voices could not have been heard without it. It seems that the antiracism movement in the United States would have developed faster if Facebook or Twitter was developed ten or twenty years before it happened. Now, the oppressed groups can find their voices, which leads society to greater transparency. Putin’s Russia is an illustrative example of how the Internet makes the actions of the regime more visible. Informal oppositional leaders like Alexey Navalny or Yegor Zhukov, who are not allowed to speak on TV, can reach their audience online. Police abuse and the violent oppression of the 2019 protests in Moscow are discussed online. In a way, all this pushes the country towards democratization.\n\nWhile this opinion does have a strong foundation, such a scheme functions only when the state does not control the cyber platform. In the case of Russia, the Federal Security Service cannot ban publications on Facebook or even Telegram, at least, if the user does not fall in the definition of an extremist. The recent case of Antifa demonstrates the fact that if the state seeks to take away the voice of an organization, there are still means to do so despite the freedom opportunities the Internet is supposed to give to civil society. Moreover, even if a figure finds an opportunity to speak out online, it does not mean changes towards democracy offline as it is in Russia today. Hence, this argument works just until the state allows the marginalized groups to be seen, and the Internet, in this case, does not have much to do with democratization.\n\nAnother point to be made is that the Internet is claimed to stimulate competition in the political field. Hence, candidates become more electorate-orienteered, and this is indeed the power of the people. Even in Iran, during the presidential elections, candidates communicate with their electorate via social media. Recently, the state has banned Instagram, where the president has about 2 million subscribers. Even fundamentalist and conservative politicians who do not support the idea of social media popularization use them to reach the audience. This controversial example demonstrates that social media push candidates to use them as a political tool to keep or even grow the electorate.\n\nHowever, this idea is also relevant for television. First, there is the classic example of John Kennedy’s victory in the elections of 1960. One of the critical factors of that outcome was his effective performance on TV debates with Richard Nixon. On a black-and-white screen, Kennedy wearing his bright blue costume, attracted the audience’s eyes while Nixon was in grey. Kennedy spoke more confidently even though, according to analysts, substantially, he lost the debates. Nevertheless, his popularity grew (Botehlo, 2016). Another example of nowadays can be found in contemporary Ukraine. In 2019, Vladimir Zelensky came to power as his primary opponent, Petro Poroshenko not only proved his orientation on the local oligarchy – not nation – but also appeared a pale non-charismatic figure in comparison to the present president. On the contrary, Zelensky, being an actor and an excellent speaker, gained popularity during the TV broadcast of the show Servant of the People, where he starred in the role of a down-to-earth, close-to-people president Holoborodko. These cases show that the conventional media are capable of creating the level of competition discussed above apply to the Internet.\n\nFurthermore, some argue that social media enable societies of authoritarian regimes to transit to the democratic state. The Arabic Spring – the wave of uprisings in the Middle East and North Africa that started in 2011 – is a frequent illustration of such a thesis. For instance, the Egyptian Revolution is sometimes called the revolution of Facebook (Gerbaudo, 2016) as the protest and its actions were all coordinated in the community on that social media called after Haled Said, who was killed by the police. That is why during Algerian and Sudanese uprisings, the government cut down the Internet and blocked social media. Hence, it is evident that the introduction of social media in contemporary life contributes to the democratization of the world as the transit from authoritarian regimes becomes easier for protesters applying such means.\n\nOn the one hand, it seems evident that protest movements apply unconventional media to make their actions more efficient. On the other hand, even the classic examples of Facebook or any other social media revolutions do not draw the full picture. First, most of the Arabic Springs uprisings, including the one in Egypt in 2011, did not bring democracy and freedoms to the society, which was the reason for another revolution already in 2013. Secondly, it would be unfair to ignore the role of conventional media in the process. In 2011, the Qatari TV channel Al Jazeera agitated its audience to go out on the Tahrir square in Cairo, intentionally overstating the number of protesters there. To say nothing about the role of mullahs and mosques as the traditional agents and spaces for ideas exchange, including the ones that inspired the uprising in 2011. Therefore, while facilitating protest movements, social media cannot be fully responsible for them. Moreover, an uprising does not always aim for democracy and, in many cases, does not lead to one.\n\nConclusion\n\nTo conclude, it is evident that the Internet and social media popularization does not univocally strengthen institutes of democracy. It changes the nature of media influence on democracy, switching it from the horizontal form – established by the conventional media – to the vertical one. Meanwhile, Internet users are enabled to create information bubbles around themselves, which contradicts democratic principles of the need to consider alternative opinions. The contemporary rise of populism also has a lot to do with the digitalization of the public debate: voters end up choosing the candidates broadcasting their not-so-sophisticated political ideas effectively via social media. Furthermore, such platforms provide more space for the agents of radicalization who seek new followers of their ideas. Though some argue that the Internet changes the nature of political competition and protests and brings new opportunities to find one’s voice, in reality, such claims appear to be not so fair as conventional media were the initially game-changing tools for these tasks. Moreover, they are still successfully used.\n\nReferences\n\nBarstow, D. & Stein, R. (2005). Under Bush, a new age of packaged TV news . The New York Times: Web.\n\nBotehlo, G. (2016).

      "The Significance of GSSs in Increasing Efficiency in Organizational Meetings Proposal\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe concepts of group process and Group Support Systems are not well understood by people. Kim (2006) noted that the group process enables leaders to develop interventional measures that can be applied to change the less desirable attributes showcased by different members of an organization. According to Kilgour (2010), Group Support System (GSSs) is “a set of techniques, software, and technology designed to focus and enhance the communication, deliberations, and decision-making of groups (p. 19)”. Meetings play a pivotal role in all organizations (Hoffman & Parker, 2006). This study will review the advantages and disadvantages of GSSs. This will provide leaders and managers alike with adequate information needed to select the most convenient and appropriate system for their organizations. This knowledge will further assist them to come up with efficient collaborative measures that specify the roadmap to organizational goals, obstacle reduction, prevent members from attaining the set group goals, and increase group and individual satisfaction towards achieving the set goals and objectives.\n\nBackground\n\nAccording to Kilgour (2010), in various field and experimental studies, GSSs have proven to be effective tools to use in ensuring that meetings exhibit efficient, reliable, and quality group decision-making processes. Hoffman and Parker (2006) stated that in most cases, planning and executing meetings often consume too much time. The surveys on group efficiency indicate that most employees are often inattentive\n\nduring meetings and most meetings lack adequate planning regarding the topics to be discussed (Cusella, 2009). Recent studies show that most companies spend more times on meetings than they do on actual work (Hoffman& Parker, 2006). According to Hoffman and Parker (2006), meetings have very little positive effect on productivity and they waste valuable time that could otherwise be channeled to more productive activities.\n\nToday’s businesses lie in the reduction and control of operational costs, global competition, improved quality and customer service and acceleration of the production life-cycle (Kilgour, 2010). Effective and efficient decision-making processes are not only desirable, but also necessary if challenges are to be averted. Policies, operational and budgetary plans among other organizational tasks often involve discussion-based tasks and meetings between different members of the organization.\n\nAccording to Niederman, et al.,( 2008), collaboration between different members and groups within an organization is significant since it promotes knowledge sharing, teamwork and increases productivity. Meetings play a pivotal role in the facilitation of collaborative efforts within different organizations. Recent studies have indicated that in the past few decades, meetings have been the main source of contentions and conflicts in organizational settings (Hoffman & Parker, 2006). As indicated by other secondary studies, the productivity of the firms is highly influenced by the degree of responsiveness and accountability of the directors, managers, and all the leading parties in key decision making role in a firm. Therefore, it is worth noting that meetings are convened to discuss the progress, performance and productivity of the firm. However, notably, the duration spent in such meetings significantly affects the operation and productivity of the organization.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nThe main concern with respect to resource management and maximization is that top management meeting are convened at a very regular interval, a sign of ineffective resource management. In addition, such meetings tend to last longer than stipulated, hence, unproductive. According to Niederman, et al.( 2008), in the information technology domain, and particularly with regard to GSS, it is widely held that technology alone cannot create a predictable, useful, repeatable improvement in meeting and organizational outcomes. Mainly due to ‘process losses’, which refer to communication, teamwork and workgroup inefficiencies that result from variations in status between members of any given meeting (Hoffman & Parker, 2006). While groups form an integral part of an organization’s structure, the impact of individual members of an organization should not be undermined. In some cases Hoffman and Parker (2006), noted that group judgments are inferior in comparison to individual judgments due to complexities in groupthink processes.\n\nThe specific problem is ineffective meetings in an organizational setting contribute to low levels of productivity, job satisfaction and motivation exhibited by members. According to Hoffman and Parker (2006), Yin (2008) and Crowe et al (2011), it was identified that most managers spend more than 60% of their time in meetings, the time used in meetings results in reduced productivity in most companies. In most meetings, members spend a significant amount of time arguing instead of finding solutions to problems (Hopffman & Parker, 2006). Niederman, et al.( 2008) said, “May not force but will perhaps induce group members to create an agenda prior to a meeting and stimulate behaviors consistent with particular norms or rules”. Hoffman and Parker, 2006 noted decisions are made based on employee ranking, rather than applicability and the ineffectiveness levels exhibited in meetings negatively affect productivity, motivation, job satisfaction and trust among individuals and groups. This is because there are organizations that have these systems in place but lack the necessary skills and knowledge required to make them work towards their advantage.\n\nPurpose of the study\n\nThis qualitative case study intends to provide a deeper insight and understanding of the group support systems with respect to productivity and performance of mangers. Besides, this proposed study aims at assessing whether the application of GSSs would prevent the negative effects meetings have on productivity, and to establish how effective is the GSSs in contributing to job satisfaction, motivation and communication among members of an organization. Qualitative case study is an appropriate design for the study because it allows précised and accurate data collection within a restricted short period of time. Besides, quantitative case study approach to research is fundamental in providing a detailed statistical and inferential analysis of the problem under study. Finally, it provides an in-depth and descriptive account for the problem (Yin, 2008). “The case study approach allows, amongst other things, critical events, interventions, policy developments and program-based service reforms to be studied in detail in a real-life context” (Crowe et al 2011, p. 8).\n\nPopulation and Sample\n\nParticipants sampled using the following steps: (i) organizations that are independent of any subsidiaries and other businesses, (ii) subsidiary organizations are eliminate (iii) organizations lacking GSSs and are willing to test its applicability will select (2 companies), (iv) DoD and Federal Agencies with a GSSs considered as ineffective will select (4 organizations); and (v) organizations with an effective GSSs will select (4 organizations).\n\nEight to ten organizations from a similar industry will select using the criteria mentioned above. According to Peloso and Lunetta, (2011, p. 64), this represents a population that lack substantial disparities in regard to sub-population, all selection methods that are provide and having “similar power and appropriate Type 1 error for association.” The organizations selected fully represented this population based on the selection criteria. According to Duncan (2008), proponents of non-random selection of participants argue that it is the best approach. Past researches and experiences show that random-sampling provides better and more accurate results. Mixture of random and non-random sampling to select the participants of this study would be conduct.\n\nImportance of the Study\n\nAccording to Webne-Behrman (2008), the term group process refers to the procedures implemented by closely working member of an organization, in order to come up with viable solutions to common organizational problems. Kim (2006) stated that group processes enables leaders to develop interventional measures that can be applied to change the less desirable attributes showcased by different members of an organization.\n\nOrganization theory views an organization as a group of people who work together to accomplish set goals and objectives (Cusella, 2009). From this description, it can be argued that groups play a pivotal role towards the success of any organization (Hoffman & Parker, 2006). Research will set out to further our understanding of this theory and the applicability of GSSs in an organizational setting.\n\nThe concept of group support systems (GSSs) is relatively new. GSS are a promising vehicle for better managing groups (Wilson, et al., 2010). The study of Group Support Systems (GSS) as an aid to group decision-making in organizations is important to organizational researchers for practical and scientific reasons (DeSanctis and Gallupe, 1987, Huber et al., 1993, Wilson, et al., 2010). Elfvengreen (2008) asserted that GSSs provide an avenue through which meetings can be held without necessarily wasting valuable time and employees’ productivity. A gap exists between the significance of Group Support Systems and their applicability in resolving productivity issues that stem from ineffective meetings (Kilgour, 2010).\n\nMuch of the GSS research published to date does not report the configuration specifics of GSS: the exact instructions given to the group, the guidelines, constraints, and ground rules by which they worked; and the step-by-step mechanics of how their work proceeded (Briggs, Vreede, and Nunamaker, 2003, Santanen, 2005, Niederman, 2008). There is a lot of documented literature regarding teamwork and group dynamics, but little information is available on the effects of GSSs in improving meetings and group efficiency, as well as in many sources, meetings have been cited as tools to enhance teamwork and productivity of an organization.\n\nLeader in the same field of study care about solving the problem because the result of the research will enable leaders in organizational settings understand that: (i) the objective of Group Support Systems, (ii) meetings should be designed to support the organizational strategic objectives, (iii) ineffective meetings increases an organization’s chance to incur losses and reduced productivity, and (iv) important to have a comprehensive Group Support System that promotes teamwork, commitment and motivation among employees, all the while enabling managers to make decisive decisions regarding the operational activities of the organization.\n\nAnnotated Bibliography\n\nNiederman, Fred; Briggs, Robert O.; de Vreede, Gert-Jan; Kolfschoten, Gwendolyn L. . Journal of the Association for Information Systems , Oct2008, Vol. 9 Issue 10, p633-652, 21p, 2 Diagrams, 1 Chart\n\nThis paper explains and described how effort to boost meeting productivity and success, managers may employ trained group facilitators. They may also implement group support systems (GSS) for the same reason. The two approaches can be taken separately or together. In this study, in-depth interviews with 37 practicing facilitators provided their perspectives on critical factors that influence meeting success and potential benefits and concerns with the use of GSS. Respondents focused on a core of communication and group process skills as critical for facilitator success. Overall, the respondents observed or anticipated more efficient and effective task performance as benefits of GSS technology. Their concerns focused on technology-related issues: participant anxiety, systems inflexibility, and systems reliability. Views of facilitators with high and low levels of GSS experience are largely consistent. High-experience GSS facilitators viewed technical issues as more central to meeting success, while low-experience GSS facilitators focused more heavily on attributes of the group. The paper concludes by offering suggestions for identifying and training GSS facilitators and comments on key issues of importance to GSS designers, based on the facilitator’s perspective. However, there is a gap in addressing corporate governance and meeting ethics with respect to the nature systematic arrangement and group efficient.\n\nWilson, J. L.; Griffin, Thomas E.; Jessup, Leonard M. . Academy of Information & Management Sciences Journal , 2010, Vol. 13 Issue 2, p41-57, 17p, 4 Charts\n\nIn this study included professionals and managers participated in a field experiment to determine the effects of Group Support System (GSS) anonymity and status on group productivity and satisfaction. The book further asserts that managers and corporate governance body have not elaborately addressed the gap in productivity and resource management, hence, the concern for inefficiency in production and potential capacity of the firms. In GSS sessions, they discussed ways to solve the problem of insurance fraud within their industry. Groups of four and five members interacted either with or without anonymity, and either with equal status or unequal status. Anonymous groups generated more total comments, more unique ideas, and more ideas of higher rarity than did identified groups. Equal status group members were more satisfied than unequal status members.\n\nKilgour, D. M. (2010). Handbook of Group Decision and Negotiation. New York: Springer.\n\nThis study described Group Decision and Negotiation as the empirical, formal, computational, and strategic analysis of group decision-making and negotiation, especially from the points of view of Management Science and Operations Research. Group Decision and Negotiation crosses many traditional disciplinary boundaries, and has connections to business administration and business strategy, management science, systems engineering, computer science, mathematics, and law, as well as economics, psychology, and other social sciences. The Handbook of Group Decision and Negotiation is intended to become the major reference in the field. The only current references are the highly successful journal Group Decision and Negotiation, as well as the books of the Advances in Group Decision and Negotiation series, and a few other journals. Researchers, students, and practitioners in this growing field sorely need a good general reference.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe research design will consist of surveys and qualitative case studies. Using surveys as research design will enable to collect large amounts of data regarding different situations, practices and views using interviews and questionnaires. The survey approach supports the research design. “The case study approach allows, amongst other things, critical events, interventions, policy developments and program-based service reforms to be studied in detail in a real-life context” (Crowe et al., 2011, p. 8). By combining these research designs, the results derived from this study will be more accurate and comprehensive. This is because these designs allow a researcher to gather data that reflect real-life situations (Surveys) and compare current findings to results collected in previous studies that focused on the same issue (Case studies).\n\nParticipants were sampled using the following steps: (i) organizations that are independent of subsidiaries and other businesses, (ii) subsidiary organizations were eliminated (iii) organizations lacking GSSs and were willing to test its applicability were selected (2 companies), (iv) organizations with a GSS consider as ineffective will select (4 organizations); and (v) organizations with an effective GSS will select(4 organizations). In measuring the effectiveness of GSSs in facilitating effective and efficient business and professional meetings, ratios and intervals will be use. Kemp and Grace (2010) stated that ratios and interval scales “allow more precise and interesting relationships between variables to be discovered (P. 399).” This is especially important since the study will compare data from past studies as well as financial trends of the participating companies before and after using GSSs.\n\nReview of the Literature\n\nPrimary data will be collected from interviews and surveys. An informed consent form will be signed by all participants to ensure that the research is done in an ethical manner. Secondary data will be collected from the university library, credible journal articles, books and internet sites that shed some light on this topic. Data collected will be analyzed and the results used to answer the designed research questions.\n\nThe study includes some group process and development concepts. Tuckman’s model of team development seeks to explain how teams are developed over time (Parker, 2011). The model suggests that there are five stages that all groups follow before they become a unified decision-making and problem-solving unit (Parker, 2011). Using a GSS in meetings ensures that meetings follow these stages with little to no complications. This ensures that the meetings are less time consuming, more productive and foster participation from majority of members.\n\nOrganization theory (OT): the theory views an organization as a group of people who are connected by common goals and objectives (Cusella, 2009). Organization theory be described as the study of organizations so as to identify common patterns that promote effective problem-solving and decision-making processes, efficient execution of organizational tasks, productivity and satisfaction of clients’ and stakeholders’ needs. That involves the study of individual, group and organizational processes (Cusella, 2009).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nThis study is:\n\n 1. to understand the group support systems and group/individual productivity,\n 2. if application of GSSs would prevent the negative effects meetings have on productivity and;\n 3. how GSSs contribute to better levels of job satisfaction, motivation and communication among members of an organization.\n\nAnswering the following questions will be the primary focus of this study:\n\n 1. How effective should the GSS be applied in order to improve business and professional meeting processes in an organizational setting?\n 2. What role does GSSs play in enhancing job satisfaction, motivation and productivity in a business setting?\n\nData analysis will include analysis of data studies and survey results will be conducted so as to measure the strengths and weaknesses of the methodologies used.\n\nReferences\n\nCrowe, S., Cresswell, K., Robertson, A., Huby, G., Avery, A., & Sheikh, A.

      "The Use of Agent Orange in the Vietnam War Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nAgent Orange used during the US war in Vietnam has sparked off interest from various stakeholders because of various reasons. These reasons have been expressed through questions such as ‘Did the government know short and long term effects of dioxin use and why did it continue to use it if it did?’, ‘Why did the government respond differently to the problem?’, ‘Were veterans’ litigations justified?’, ‘Was the justice system impartial to claims?’ and ‘Were veterans just as susceptible as Vietnamese citizens?’ the paper shall attempt to shed some light on these matters and many more surrounding the Agent Orange debate.\n\nBackground information\n\nAgent Orange is a code for the chemical mixture of 2-4-5 trichlorophenoxyacetic acid and 2-4 dichlorophenoxyacetic acid in equal measure. During the manufacturing process, these chemicals produce a residue known as TCDD or dioxin and the latter is a highly toxic substance. The US military utilized herbicides such as Agent Orange to eliminate plant coverage (through defoliation or forcefully making leaves fall) in enemy territory to expose adversaries. Although some other toxic substances were used, Agent Orange by far has generated the most controversy because of both the long and short-term effects of its component chemical – dioxin. (Tuyet and Johnson, 156) In the lab, dioxin has been shown to affect the reproductive system and internal organs of animals. In Sweden, research has demonstrated that these lab findings can be generalized to cancerous and skin-related complications in humans.\n\nThe Vietnam scenario is quite different from earlier researches on the latter herbicide because, at that time, the US military had requested large amounts of it. To meet this rising demand, chemical industries had to speed up the manufacturing process thus resulting in higher concentrations of the by-product dioxin. Reports assert that the concentration of dioxin that the Vietnamese and American veterans may have been exposed to was twenty-seven times more than usual agricultural uses. Consequently, the effects brought on by the sprays may have been more than had been anticipated. In fact, concerns raised by the Environmental protection agency in the 1970s assert certain mammals could be killed by moderate concentrations of dioxin such as mice. These concerns have now been accepted by the scientific community as factual. Furthermore, dioxin could get into the human body through inhalation, skin contact, or oral consumption. This implies that their penetration levels are very high.\n\nThe controversy\n\nGovernment assertions and reactions\n\nAs stated earlier, the late nineteen sixties witnessed unprecedented spraying of the toxic substance in Vietnam and these actions did not go unnoticed by the scientific community in the US. The Association of American Advancement of science prompted the US government to allow investigations into the effects of Agent Orange in Vietnam in 1968. In response, the US secretary of state and the US embassy in Vietnam hand-picked a scientist from the Department of Agriculture in that same year to carry out those investigations. Upon coming back, he reported that there were no long-term effects of the chemicals and that warm-blooded animals could not be affected by Agent Orange adversely. His report can be found in a 1969 science magazine issue. (Sutton, 10) Several stakeholders following this story affirmed that this scientist’s report was done to avoid friction between the Government and chemical companies. The government combined these findings with what had been done earlier by a research firm known as Midwest Institute which exonerated any blame on the government.\n\nGiven such strong assertions, one would wonder whether the government was aware of the problems associated with the use of such a chemical. In a letter to Congress by one military scientist – Dr. Clary, it was asserted that he (together with other military colleagues) was well aware of the excessive concentration of the toxin and the dangers to human life that it would cause. However, he asserted that little attention was given to this since the parties who would be affected were Vietnamese citizens and that in case any American veteran was exposed, then chances are that the government would act to mitigate these effects. (Sutton, 22)\n\nIn 1984, another report was released by the US health and human services. They were experimenting to determine whether the lives of their veterans were in danger because of exposure to this chemical. The findings were similar to earlier government assertions that Operation Ranch soldiers were not in any danger. In other words, the Government’s stance on this matter is that Agent Orange posed no serious health implications and that those who purported so were just using propaganda against the nation. However, the controversial element about these assertions is that the government appeared to be using double standards on the matter. Back in the US, war veterans have received compensation in the past thus denoting that higher authorities do see some elements of truth in their cases. Critics assert that if the government is responding to their needs, then it is acknowledging that dioxin does affect the human body.\n\nReported effects and damages\n\nSince Vietnam has minimal resources, its government has not sponsored scientists to investigate the effects of Agent Orange. However, international organizations have carried out their researches there in this decade. For instance, a Canadian institute called Hatfield Consultants has demonstrated that there are still substantial amounts of dioxin in the food chain and that these could pose serious threats to the lives of Vietnamese soldiers. (Denselow, 5) Therefore, approximately two decades and a half after the US war in Vietnam, it has been found necessary to safeguard the public’s health by removing people from areas that have been deemed highly toxic in this country. Other Vietnamese scientists have asserted that without even carrying out thorough investigations, one can deduce the harm caused by dioxin by the high cases of deformities noted in areas that were intensely sprayed by Agent Orange.\n\nPilot studies carried out by local doctors such as Nguyen Nhan have found that children born in areas that were sprayed by this herbicide have a three times higher than normal chance of having: cleft palates, extra toes and fingers, hernias and mental retardation. In response to these excessive cases of deformities, the Vietnamese government had to create over ten special schools to take care of children born with those disabilities (Denselow, 8). Another pilot study carried out in Vietnam by Tuyet and Johnson (156) among 200 women through semi-structured interviews found that those participants who had undergone high levels of exposure to Agent Orange had higher chances of undergoing miscarriages or bearing handicapped children. On top of the latter, seemingly normal children would develop disabilities in their first years of life. This imposed huge emotional and psychological challenges to the participants of the research as caring for such children necessitates financial resources which are not readily available in these Vietnamese homes.\n\nAs much as the US has tried to downplay these effects, what it did not know was that its military personnel in Vietnam would be just in as much danger as ordinary Vietnam citizens. During the war, some US soldiers in the latter country would store fruits in Agent Orange drums, store petroleum products which would then be placed in cars and inhaled, others would place water in the drums for bathing and the like – thus making them highly exposed to the chemicals. This was witnessed as soon as the latter Veterans’ settled back in America. Most of them reported liver, stomach, lung and skin disease. Others reported birth defects in their children while others had emotional complications. All these cases were prevalent among individuals exposed to this controversial herbicide.\n\nReactions of veterans to the problem\n\nIn 1993, the National Academy of Sciences NAS (5) released a report linking several diseases among US veterans in the Vietnam War and exposure to Agent Orange. The latter group asserted that out of the two hundred and thirty studies carried out by the latter group, there were sufficient links to soft sarcoma, Hodgkin’s diseases, lymphoma, liver disorder and chloracne. Consequently, the Department of Veteran Affairs was advised to compensate former US soldiers who had these diseases. Nonetheless, it ruled out other possibilities such as cancer, reproductive and neurological effects citing either inadequate evidence or no association with these kinds of disease. Therefore, the latter cases were not eligible for compensation.\n\nHowever, the latter findings did not stop US veterans from taking action against chemical manufacturing companies responsible for producing Agent Orange for the US military at the time of their serving. Thousands of cases have been launched against these groups with most veterans asserting that the birth defects they are experiencing or other health complications like cancer have been caused by this very problem. Most of them were well aware of the political implications of their cases but chose to proceed with litigations anyway. Analysts (Marcus, 104) assert that different Veterans were motivated by different reasons. Some were sincerely suffering and needed a way out of their predicaments; others were bitterly disillusioned by the war and wanted some justice while others may have been idealists who believe that the government should be involved in addressing the damage done by their actions in war.\n\nHow the legal system has responded to the controversy\n\nIn most cases, excessive amounts of money were involved; consequently, some lawyers took up these litigations out of a financial need. On the other hand, some plaintiff lawyers knew the publicity that these cases have and the exposure that it would create for their careers or their futures. Consequently, a lot of bickering and jockeying was witnessed in these trials amongst lawyers who were more interested in meeting their needs rather than fighting for justice on behalf of their clients. (Marcus, 78) often paints a picture of a very naïve group of US army veterans in these legal tussles. These individuals thought that they could fight it out with huge chemical companies and win. What they had missed was that most of these firms were well connected and therefore untouchable. Additionally, the judges involved in these cases could not just carry out rulings without considering the ramifications of their actions to the larger political society.\n\nIt should be noted that there has been a different pattern of response to the plight of affected US veterans in the judicial system over the past two and half decades. In 1984, a range of Agent Orange manufacturers like Diamond Shamrock, Uniroyal, Monsanto and Dow Chemical were directed by the Supreme Court to pay one hundred and eighty million dollars as compensation to affected parties between 1988 and 1996. Therefore, the Supreme court asserted that any Veterans who had been diagnosed from 1996 onwards were eligible to sue manufacturers afresh.\n\nHowever, Chemical companies soon gained an upper hand after a hearing in 2005 by the second circuit court of appeals. The latter found that based on military contractor’s doctrine, then chemical companies were not liable to pay Veterans any compensation. This had been set out by Judge Weinstein in the Agent Orange litigation case no 381. The latter assertions by the Supreme Court were made in 2007 after concluding the 2005 case. In 2008, some Veterans also made claims i.e., Stephenson and Isaacson. The Second Court of Appeals dismissed these civil cases. (Lamb, 2)In 2009, appeals launched by Stephenson and Isaacson cases were denied with no viable explanations on the why Supreme Court judged opted to do that. Consequently, Agent Orange lawsuits have hit a deadlock as Veterans cannot rely on the legal system to air out their complaints.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe controversy surrounding Agent Orange use stems from some issues. First, government-sponsored reports are contradictory on the effects as some claim that only selected diseases are linked to chemical orange while others claim that there is no linkage at all. Independent reports carried out by international organizations like Canadian and Swedish-based institutes have found strong correlations between this herbicide and several diseases including those that were overruled by government scientists. Additionally, how victims have been treated has also generated controversy as some veterans before 1996 have been compensated while others in recent times have been denied this opportunity. No satisfactory actions have been given on this discontinuation thus prompting observers to think that there may be something that higher authorities are trying to hide.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nTuyet Le Thi Nham & Johansson Annika. “Impact of Chemical Warfare with Agent Orange on Women’s Reproductive Lives in Vietnam: A Pilot Study.” Reproductive Health Matters , 9.18(2001): 156.

      "American Society for Dermatologic Surgery Case Study\n\nThe first change that Norman implemented was aimed at modifying the managerial structure. This is the introduction of a structure through which the heads of departments are directly answerable to the top manager. This has lead to the downsizing of the number of employees and has eliminated work duplication. From there, a mid-long term plan that covers three years was developed. The first year included redefining the brand and hiring of a new team. Second year included changing the trading style, expansion of business and innovation of new trading ways. The third year plan was of price reductions which positioned Asda as a store which had quality products. It included the finalization of the expansion program (Weber, 1998).\n\nA new strategy has been developed which includes the display of food in the stores for the customer’s eyes strategically. Commodity prices have been reduced leading to customer attraction. This has brought an upswing of sales, raising hopes that there would be even more price reductions in the near future. The use of Information Technology, design of a different store layout, and innovation are amongst the changes envisioned for the business (Weber, 1998). The next change dimension is through the development a different working system for Asda. In this, the manager and the staff at the stores get to be aware of the store goals and their roles in achieving the same. Great emphasis is directed towards team cohesiveness and setting up of personal goals that are aimed at improving the staff quality. The staff will be trained to develop good relations with the customers. This system is to be known as the Asda way of working.\n\nCompany values that has been developed emphasize on respect amongst the staff members, they place more responsibilities on everyone, caution against resource wastage and highlight the need for everyone to better the business. Finally, the introduction of notice boards greatly improved on the store communication. They contain information that help the staff be up to date with the store’s past and future goals. Other communication methods like face to face have been slotted in on the new changes that are to be adopted (Weber, 1998).\n\nThe program addresses issues regarding the scope and staff awareness of the need for change. The style of change management and the roles of everyone in the changed environment are highly emphasized. The program fits perfectly well with other literature models in regards to the shared values (Hailey & Balogun, 2002).\n\nLeadership is required to tap into the staff diversity of skills and talents. Communication development is a key role that the leadership plays in change. By ensuring face to face interaction as a communication strategy and use of notice boards, the leader develops effective communication. The leaders are responsible for the supervision of the implementation of Asda’s best way of working. This means that they have to treat the staff with respect as well as provide them with regular updates. Leaders also have to propose staff training mechanisms and lead by demanding staff performance. Leaders are in charge of the long term goals implementation (Kaufman, 2003).\n\nChange program is effective in turning around a business entity’s profit status. It has brough about a leaner system of management and staff thereby reducing on the amount of money that goes to recurrent expense. Change has developed a sense of security for the business. This is important to the financial institutions as loans are easier to secure. The staff members feel like they are part of the store due to the regular communication (Hailey & Balogun, 2002). Business plans for the future and sets up the entity for any upcoming competition and improvement of it’s market share. What remains to be done is the introduction of a system that collects data in every store. The data will be important in redefining future goals as well as managing resource wastage. Finally, there is need to develop a system that preserves the gains that will be achieved by change (Weber, 1998).\n\nReferences\n\n 1.

      "Immigration: The Ethical Side Essay\n\nSince the immigration has always been a matter of concern within the legislators, the main topic that is going to be touched upon in this paper is immigration’s pros and cons. The two vitally important issues this paper will be devoted to are why the immigrants choose the US as their ultimate home, and what the emigrants actually face when coming legally to the US. So, in order to make it clear, the essay will touch upon ethical advantages and disadvantages of immigration for the countries of origin and for the US.\n\nThe first ethical concept should sound like ‘the US is an ultimate opportunity for those seeking an advanced life level’. America is truly full of legal and illegal immigrants constantly attracting those as an implementation of the American dream. Taken closely, immigrants are people looking for a better standard of life, tired of unemployment and autocracy. As a result they settle in America, though sometimes illegally, in order to have at least a ‘low skilled job’ and real estate for bringing up children in the better society and better state system. Therefore, helping employers use those foreign human resources and help economy grow.\n\nThe positive side of legal immigration is having completely law-abiding citizens come to the country. When adhering to the laws of the US legal migrants accept the democratically powered society; which also serves a wonderful lesson of Americans’ power to the rest of the world. Foreigners assimilate into the society well. Moreover, they bring their own cultural experience into Americans’ one; which is by all means very beneficial for both sides. Americans are now used to accept multiple religions within a country and foreign communities due to legal migration.\n\nThe bad thing about legal immigration is being somewhat unequal in rights in comparison to native citizens. Therefore, the entire world’s economic inequality rises up since this is a prior reason for the inequality of the nations all over the world. Ethically would be spending a huge amount of money to leveling the global economy or opening the borders to immigrants. However, so far the immigrants cannot acquire some rights citizens do, like voting. So, being an immigrant in a socially and economically developed country does not necessarily mean being absolutely equal and happy.\n\nThe second disadvantage in terms of ethics would be the brain drain. Every year the developing countries lose the highly skilled workers once those immigrate to the US, for the immigration is an attractive solution for the college graduates and skilled personnel. Hence, immigration affects the social and economical politics of countries of origin: immigrants pay sales taxes, for example, not to their native country and, besides, Americanization is a great ethical loss for their home countries. However, this also spurs the economy’s growth in the developing countries. Overall, the country cannot function well without sufficient manpower. Retaining the most valuable assets would be the best thing to do for the developing countries.\n\nConcluding the rights-based approaches to the issue of immigration, it must be said that giving an opportunity to personnel of other nations to work in a developed country is very ethical and gracious. Besides, the permission to stay in the country helps develop its power and reputation all over the world, though emigrants are strictly limited in some civil rights. Moreover, the brain drain affecting the developing countries is a total disaster for the world economy.\n\nReferences\n\nAnthony, W. (2001).

      "Judgment and Social Interaction in “The Lady Justice” Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. About artist/artworks\n 2. General description of the art\n 3. Its beauty\n 4. Its meaning/concept/ Style\n 5. Is it art?\n 6. Why I liked this piece of art?\n 7. The way I made sense of this art form\n 8. Changes my judgments after the class\n\nAbout artist/artworks\n\nThe artistic picture I have chosen for analyzing and judgment is ‘The lady justice’ who is taking revenge on the cruel dragon. The picture shown for the viewers is the end of one good story. A woman has been projected in the picture. She resembles two types of actions one is of motherhood and the other is of god-like actions in which she is ready to take some actions. There is no bewilderment in saying that the work is a creative one.\n\nGeneral description of the art\n\nThe picture has got its own beauty and it is eye-catching. I like this artwork very much as this resembles beauty, meaning, and style. The picture has got a very good story in it that has been taken place a long time ago. The story is like this. There lived a beautiful girl in the village. She is so beautiful that her beauty can be described as a moon present in the sky without any clouds or just as the sun comes up on a rainy day. Also, she could find the truth in everyone’s eyes. The girl was underage and her beauty is so attractive for everyone and everyone living in the village wants her to be their own wife. But there lived a dragon in the village that needs to destroy everything. Twice this dragon presented in front of the beautiful girl. Dragon made beautiful girl blind by becoming angry without knowing she is the daughter of the greatest goddess. The goddess told her daughter to take revenge on the dragon, which made her blind.\n\nIts beauty\n\nTelling about this picture, this work of art or painting has got its own beauty whose beauty never ends in explaining. The girl presented in the picture is aged in her early twenties. She is very tall in a standing position. Her waist presented in the picture is slightly tilted to the right side. Her left legs are positioned on the top of the Chinese dragon. Her skin is shown as in normal brown color. Part of her skin is covered with protective metal, which is of silver color, which can be called armor. The bust of armor protects her breast and armor is presented to her waist. An angelic being is sleeping in the middle of her armor, which gives some extra beauty to her armor. A chemise which is of silky silver has been shown underneath the armor. This chemise covers her shoulders also. It seems to be a ribbon presented on top of the shoulders. Her legs are covered with a long skirt, which is of silver color. But her left leg is shown as exposed which is placed on the Chinese dragon. She has got long curly hair. In the middle of her forehead, curly bangs are presented which adds extra beauty to the picture. Another feature of this picture is her eyes are covered with a bronze blindfold. Her facial expression is shown as very peaceful full and she smiles very slightly. Two weighing scales are carried own her right which is of perfectly balanced. At the same time, she carries sword in her left hand. The tip of sword is pointed downwards. The sword, which is carried in left hand, is made up of bronze. Other than sword and scales no other jewelry has been there in her body. Another extraordinary feature of this picture is there is no hesitation has been presented in her face.\n\nIts meaning/concept/ Style\n\nThis picture has got very good meaning, concept and style in it. What the picture tells us about the audience is that no one should harm any one without any reason. Here in this dragon being one of the cruelest is wanted to attack beautiful lady of the village unknowing the fact that she is the daughter of the goddess and she is having numerous talent in built in her. Dragon made her blind so goddess became angry and told her to finish of the dragon. This is the real meaning, concept and style of the picture.\n\nIs it art?\n\nThere is no doubt that it is an art. It resembles meaning in this art work. Also it gives some information regarding beauty of young woman and the Chinese dragon. The meaning of art work will change with the location, place and characteristics of the viewer. By looking at the picture, it is not necessary that everyone will think about the picture with the same imagination. If one really knows the story well beauty of the picture will increases.\n\nWhy I liked this piece of art?\n\nI liked this piece of art very much because it has got very good meaning in it. That is a young lady taking revenge on the dragon. It is because dragon has done so many difficulties to the young lady and even dragon makes her blind. So story tells us a lesson that evil deeds must be punished.\n\nThe way I made sense of this art form\n\nThis is very nice art form as young lady described in this has been shown in a splendid form. Many different colors have been used to illustrate the young lady. The posture of the lady shown to take revenge on dragon has been very good from top to bottom. Artist has given each part of the picture their own importance. The armor, chemise, skirt, hair, blindfold added something extra to the art form. The facial expression of the young lady without having any kind of hesitation in her face of the daunting task is one of the best parts of the picture.\n\nChanges my judgments after the class\n\nI could find different kinds of elements used by the artist to bring his view about the world and human race. But, painting as an art form needs good study of its certain techniques and other old and new works to analyze systematically. The classes about the art of painting have changed many of my views towards this work.\n",
      "Examination of Relativism and Objectivism on Western and Eastern Culture Essay\n\nTo kick off the discussion, it is important to understand the meaning of cultural relativism and objectivism which are the two main philosophical terms used. In a nut shell, cultural relativisms refer to sameness or equality in cultures. It requires that cultures are evaluated with regard to their standards and focuses more on beliefs. Objectivism on the other hand is a philosophy that centers more on rational individualism. It essentially focuses more on an individual attaining the moral goal of happiness with more emphasis on individual rights and liberties. Since societies have different beliefs and cultures, this essay seeks to examine relativism and objectivism in western and Eastern cultures. It will highlight the cultural differences that exist in terms of; lifestyle, thought, and history of their cultures.\n\nFirst and foremost, there is sharp contrast in lifestyles adopted by western and eastern cultures. Notably, life in the western cultures revolves around individual’s wants, aspirations, and choices. People here extend respect to those who show respect, no consideration is given to parents or elders. In addition, decision making is an individualized affair hence no approvals are needed. Life in eastern culture on the other hand is characterized by tight and strong family bonds. To them, family is the most important thing above anything else. People in Eastern cultures spent most of their time with their families and often visit each other. Moreover, they congregate over meals and music. In the eastern culture, family plays a vital role in major decisions of each family member. Children in this culture uphold respect for both parents and elders. In addition, lifestyle in the Western culture is different from the east in terms of food. In western culture, processed and fact foods which are unhealthy dominate menus, while eastern cultures stick to traditional healthy foods. Learning in western cultures is through logical schools while in eastern cultures it is acquired from the elders and parents.\n\nSecond, there is a difference between the western and eastern philosophical thought. Western philosophers were mainly influenced by Christianity while Eastern philosophers were influenced by Buddhism, Confucianism, Hinduism, Integral Yoga, Islam, Taoism and Zen. In light of this, western thought was that; oneself is an element of the divine, life is a service to God, the universe and life are in a linear fashion, life depends on the outer world and that, people ought to dedicate themselves to achieving success and happiness. The eastern thought on the other hand was on; cosmological unity, life a journey toward eternal realities, the world being circular due to eternal recurrence, life being dependant upon the inner world, and emphasis on behavioral ethics.\n\nThird, the beliefs and values held by the two cultures are significantly different. In Western culture, the main values are success and happiness which can be achieved by having lots of money, faith and popularity attained through outside intervention. Eastern cultures on the other hand value what is on the inner world of a human being.\n\nThe fourth distinction between the western and eastern cultures is on their history. Western culture for instance started from exploration, by virtue of this, western people are more creative in many aspects because of their past experience. Eastern culture was developed right from their area, what this means in essence is that, the people here are more conservative because they have not interacted much with other cultures.\n\nFrom this discussion, it is apparent that, objectivism is rife in the western culture rather than the eastern culture. Life in western culture is centralized on an individual while in eastern culture it is built around the society. Furthermore, people in western culture get personal freedoms but are denied of strong bonds including family. People on eastern cultures on the other hand lead a socially rich life. Obtaining cultural relativism between these two diverse cultures is therefore challenging and hard.\n",
      "Rock and Roll Development Since 1992 Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Discussion\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe history of music has seen several musical styles which gained incredible popularity and even after their almost complete disappearance still managed to retained loyal fans. One of such musical styles was Rock and Roll that originated and evolved in the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Everybody knows that Rock and Roll in the history of music was something like a bomb that changed the minds of millions of people. Rock and roll have been made up by gifted and intelligent people, who have become renowned for this. Of course, the first names which come to mind when discussing this musical style are Elvis Presley and the real guru of Rock and Roll, “The Rolling Stones”, who continue their rolling even today. For more than forty years they have been getting their fans and admirers who did not stop loving this music even with its becoming unpopular. Since 1992 the Rock and Roll music has undergone certain changes; the greatest contributions to this musical style were made by Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen with the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame becoming the place where this music will always be alive.\n\nDiscussion\n\nSpeaking particularly about the development of Rock and Roll, it is necessary to mention, that Rolling Stones is the music band whose work has been part and parcel throughout the whole period of the development of this musical style. Highlighting the development of Rock and Roll since 1992, it is of paramount importance to state that the whole success of this band lasted till the 1990s as the Rolling Stones ended the 1990s with their album Bridges to Babylon , released in 1997 to mixed reviews. The greatest contribution of the Rolling Stones into the Rock and Roll development in the 1990s was that they sustained the popularity of this musical style. They made Rock and Roll attractive for the listeners despite the emergence of new popular music trends. Rolling Stones keep Rock and Roll alive even today when the youth is mostly focused on minimalism expressed through techno and drum-and-bass. Therefore, the Stones’ Bridges to Babylon is the brightest example of Rock and Roll music since 1992.\n\nOf no less contribution to the development of Rock and Roll after 1992 was Bruce Springsteen’s musical performance. This singer became especially active in releasing new musical compositions in 1993. Springsteen is remarkable not only for his songs, but for contributing them to the Hollywood films, “including “Streets of Philadelphia” for Philadelphia in 1993, “Dead Man Walking” for the movie of the same name in 1995, and in 1996 “Missing” for the Crossing Guard and “Secret Garden” for Jerry MacGuire ” (Cavicchi 190). After releasing several albums, Springsteen united with E Street Band in 1999 and continued his Rock and Roll career together with this group. Springsteen had a gift for Rock and Roll music: “Songs sprang out of him by the dozen … and his music was focused in styles that endured, which allowed him to be obvious to fashion in ways that almost no other rock performer could afford” (Marsh 294). This is why Bruce Springsteen can be named a star of Rock and Roll music in the late 1990s.\n\nThe year 1995 was especially remarkable for Rock and Roll. This year the concert for the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame took place bringing together the once-famous stars of this style and those who managed to retain their popularity at present. The hall of fame opened “with a downtown parade, fireworks, and an all-star concert with more than 20 acts, including Chuck Berry, James Brown, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, John Fogerty, Little Richard, Snoop Doggy Dogg, Soul Asylum, and Bruce Springsteen” (Danilov 180). The concert was witnessed by 250,000 people. Since then the concerts in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame take place regularly. They gather the fans of this musical style and the rock stars that will always be exemplary of this trend of music. Thus, the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame serves as the supporter of this music’s popularity which gave the rock stars a possibility to prove that the music they play is eternal.\n\nConclusion\n\nTaking into consideration everything mentioned above, it can be concluded that Rock and Roll as a musical style can hardly ever disappear for there will always be people who will value this music. Even though contemporary young people consider it archaic and it does not attract their attention much, it continues developing even today. This music can be duly appreciated by real musical gourmets who can feel the self-expression of the singer in the trade of playing guitar and the unique rhythm and melody. Though Rock and Roll experienced the peak of its development in the 1950s, such performers as Rolling Stones and Bruce Springsteen will never let this style disappear and will always attract the attention of their fans. This is why the expression “Rock and Roll will never die” and the corresponding song titled like this can be perceived as literal.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCavicchi, Daniel.

      "Plato`s and Socrates`s Views on the Immortality of the Soul Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction of the Phaedo’s doctrine\n 2. Cyclical Argument\n 3. Argument from Recollection\n 4. Affinity Argument\n 5. References\n\nIntroduction of the Phaedo’s doctrine\n\nThe understanding of rationalism of Plato’s Socrates, no doubt provide reasons to believe in the assertive character of Socratic doctrine. But there exists a gap that further requires a bridgeable chasm between the intelligible order and the corporeal, contingent world of our experience, the world which was supposed to be explained by Plato logically. Since some leftover philosophical understandings witness and even raise questions about the immortality of the soul, our aim in this paper is to analyze those issues that still need an explanation about the immortality of the soul.\n\nImmortality is mainly concerned with the issue of birth and death, such a construction of mortality in terms of an antagonistic struggle as a dialogue conflicts with biblical and classical antecedents. Immortality can be understood as a process that starts and can be imagined after death as if it were the opposite of life, as dark is thought of as the opposite of light when it is simply the other’s absence. That indicates to us that life and death are opposites of each other and the argument of whether a soul is immortal or not, cannot be further taken into consideration without considering the true meaning of mortality.\n\nMortality from a religious perspective applies to God’s existence. Though the human is indeed moral and immortality is the characteristic only associated with God, philosophers like Plato see it as a component of human existence. Therefore, Plato believes that human bodies are mortal as they taste death but their souls are divine. This view is incorrect from the very first hypothesis that souls are immortal. Since human is the creation of God and we know that God is the creator, how can the creation be equal to a creator? This doctrine is evident from the conception of the soul that remains dominant in Phaedo because it differs from Christian belief (Gallop, 1999, p. xviii).\n\nPlatonic dialogues in Phaedo suggest that true recollection is limited to philosophers. This can be true because only a philosopher dares to provide a logical ground for accepting a theory grounded in the knowledge of the human situation. Socrates provides adequate reasoning for such limitations by stating that the knowledge we gain through the recognition of our views requires logical reasoning.\n\nWithout this reasoning, it lacks the perfect wisdom necessary to ascend toward such a comprehensive view of self-understanding knowledge of ourselves and our relation to nature as a whole (Stern, 1993, p. 5). Plato does it correctly but literature reveals to us that as a philosopher, Plato is unable to receive any critical comment on his theories. For example, Plato thinks dogmatically about the divinity of the soul and is unable to face any critics rejecting his notion.\n\nThis might be the way how a philosopher acquires that ‘perfect’ wisdom that answers all of his questions that reside in his inner consciousness, and that can substantiate philosophy as a way of life. Such wisdom is useless to a common man who is limited to materialism and lacks the wisdom to see his inner self-understanding that constitutes and provides the ground of Socratic rationalism in the sense of serving as a criterion for knowledge.\n\nSocratic interpretation does not rest on some implausible cosmic meaning that a common man finds difficult to accept. Nor does it point towards those difficulties, which a common man is unable to resolve by abandoning rationalism. It begins with self-understanding and proves that many aspects of humanity need to be explored and rationally exemplified by the questions surrounding our mortality, that seem to resist rational scrutiny.\n\nConfronting challenges while criticizing a philosophy is an act that requires temperament to understand why one dialogue that directs the primary effort of interpretation toward explaining the coherency rejects the other? For example, the defects a common man perceives in the face of what are widely agreed to be the Phaedo’s defective arguments for immortality, are not defects to a philosopher. Similarly, when it comes to dialogue initiation between two philosophers, critics suggest that they plausibly interpret each other.\n\nHowever, any interpretation throughout Phaedo must have also explained why Plato chooses to convey his understanding through such roundabout means. Such roundabouts do not conform to the logical grounds of a philosopher like Plato to argue insufficiently on the immortality of the human soul.\n\nIn order to judge Plato’s development, we can differentiate Plato’s arguments from what we think about immortality, based on the cyclical argument, an argument from recollection, and the affinity argument. Finally, interpreting and thereafter proving Plato as a product of his developmental context is to let our minds open to grasp the philosophical knowledge, which is beyond understanding for a common man. Such understanding or knowledge requires from us the evidence either to support or to contravene such interpretations by proving interpretive principles that would otherwise deny the ultimate significance of Plato’s work from the start..\n\nCyclical Argument\n\nThe cyclical argument is the character of opposites which is presented in Socrates’ first speech and runs throughout the Phaedo. Though a good effort by Plato proves the notion of opposition along with the thought of how our life is governed by a series of opposites, then what about the states that incur in between the opposites? This is not clearly proven by Plato that what about the cyclical argument that does not provoke two opposite states, instead it only provokes the mediocre.\n\nThat means, the loophole exists there in the argument that only perceives superior or inferior things or we can say, it only considers two extremes of the same situation, what about if the situation is not extreme at all? Or it does not involve the extremities that according to Plato prove to be equal from opposite sides. Such visible things follow a particular standard of equality, and by no means are identical except for the opposites (Gallop, 1999, p. xiii).\n\nBostock (1986) states that the main problem with this dialogue accepts the definition of dying as the separating of opposites as soul and body, but asks to be shown that when the soul does separate from the body it is not destroyed but continues to exist with some ‘power and wisdom’ (Bostock, 1986, p. 42). We can also suggest one more condition that when a man is dying, what logically proves that his soul has entered divinity?\n\nThe argument reflects a cyclical theme that is based on the notion that reverse and inverse are the two characteristics of the human body and soul. These characteristics are depicted by our existence both here and in the afterlife. Further, they are cast in terms of life versus death, body versus soul, corporeal things versus incorporeal ideas (Stern, 1993, p. 19). What Phaedo actually supports is the view expressed by thinkers as Nietzsche and Heidegger that the Platonic world revolves around a mortal and immortal school of thought. Socrates’ first argument manifests that these oppositions of being mortal and immortal exist also within human beings.\n\nIf we consider for a while what constitutes death, we get a clear answer that since man performs his role in context with different age groups, he gets old. This is the divisible identity that in the form of bodily counterparts is suggested by Gerson (2004) by stating that as the divisible identity and bodily differences are reflected in a human body, the soul’s immortality must also have been visible to note changes possessed by fundamental data of a theory of form (Gerson, 2004).\n\nA rational explanation of such a unified account concerning human existence can be proved by some of the basic concepts that are not unusual to a common man. As we all know everything in this world has an opposite, and as the proof continues, we can consider the following examples – man and woman, beautiful and ugly, wealth and poverty, sleep and awake, and so on. Now, if we perceive invisible things, they also have opposites like in the case of emotions, love and hatred, trust and mistrust, fair and unfair. Such contraries mentioned by Socrates also hold certain characteristics within them that the denial of one does not necessarily entail the other.\n\nFor example, take something that is not beautiful, it does necessarily have to demonstrate the characteristics of being ugly. Opposites that incur in between two extremities are not necessarily fulfilled the view that opposites always translate into one another and are called comparatives. So, the most obvious loophole that has remained in the cyclical argument asks us to verify those two extents, that are not opposites, like neither beautiful nor ugly, neither love nor hatred – just friendship and so on.\n\nHowever, in many cases, opposites translate into one another, and with this refinement of the principle established, we can perceive that Socrates is correct in bringing the principle to bear on the relevant opposites, life and death, sleeping and being awake, along with the reciprocal processes of going to sleep and waking up as analogous to the opposites life and death (Stern, 1993, p. 54). We can say that oppositions are within human beings that do compete and strive for a good that transcends them and thereby mediate and preserve resistance among themselves as well as between themselves and the divine (Michelini, 2003, p. 41).\n\nThe good or bad that remains within human beings also follow a process of opposition, like at the same time man can think and act. That means he has two dimensions, the invisible or the inner consciousness that is responsible for his good or bad deeds, and the physical actions that depict his evil or good nature. When a body dies, the soul remains, as a reaction to fulfill the nature of the opposition, thereafter the soul remains to be immortal. However, a rationalistic school of thought opposes such a notion because nothing remains as everything in the world is mortal.\n\nArgument from Recollection\n\nRecollection is the most complex argument because it aims to present before us the notion that we existed before birth, and this could be elaborated from the fact that if we know something, it is not because it is learned after birth, rather it is due to the reason that we knew it before birth. The knowledge that is recollected after birth is proof that the soul was in existence before it took its shape in the body. Again, such a perspective from Plato lacks appropriate reasoning to prove this happens. For example, rational thinking does not allow us to accept theories in a void, they must have a logical background to make the audience understand.\n\nThe theory of recollection in Phaedo serves as a principle for ‘learning’ or ‘gaining’ knowledge of prenatal existence that already contains deep insights into the cognitive powers of the mind (Gallop, 1999, xviii). One can also deny that real cognitive influence of mind allows or disallows learning or it denies the coincidence of ‘already knowing’ in vain. Many critics suggest that Socrates has presented the concept of recollection by pulling it in one direction by creating the need to show that philosophers alone have access to truth and the Forms.\n\nThe other direction that is not discussed by Socrates is the need to confirm immortality as a basic property of every human soul (Michelini, 2003, p. 12). I disagree with what critics claim because of a basic rule of thumb to prove recollection is a characteristic of the human soul. If we are capable of grasping a particular concept say X, and we acquire it at time Y, that indicates that we already knew X (Phaedo, 2009). This can also be illustrated by the fact that when X senses Y, he has equated Y because he already knew that Y cannot be unequated.\n\nThis illustration does not highlight that if we knew something before birth, we simply recollect it after being born because when we were not in the world, our souls were there. Such negation is due to the fact that since the human mind is in a continuous process of learning, it does so throughout his life, i.e., from birth till death it only acquires, therefore there is no use of claiming recollection, except for a genuine reason which the philosophy lacks.\n\nPlato belittles writing as a means for philosophical thinking and interprets the process of recollection on the domain of virtue (Morgan, 1998). Morgan (1998) proves it by categorizing humanity into good and bad. Good people prefer to do virtuous deeds while on the contrary bad people can’t help doing evil acts. This is no doubt a valid argument supporting recollection, but what if good changes and decides to turn into evil or vice versa. This is so because human nature is unpredictable to turn over a new leaf and does not allow a single state of mind. That means a human being is changeable and modifiable according to the situation and circumstances.\n\nBad people are reluctant to understand ‘new’ concepts easily, but once they decide to transform themselves, no power on earth can stop them. Similarly, those who possess philosophical and sensible minds are able to distinguish between good and evil easily and so they succumb to utilizing their inner consciousness for recollection. Parry (2007) states that Plato’s dualism of mind or inner consciousness and body is reflected in being intelligent and wise enough to grasp new philosophies easily (Parry, 2007).\n\nAffinity Argument\n\nThis argument directly escorts us to believe in the pre-existing nature of the soul, and by itself, it gives us no particular reason to suppose that the soul will go on existing after its present life. The main problem with the argument from recollection is that even if for a while we accept that the soul existed before worldly life, it still does not prove that it will continue to live after physical death, and since man is physically mortal, how can he claim to survive after death?\n\nBut in order to attempt to prove once again the soul’s immortality, we consider Plato’s view to argue that the soul is not the kind of thing that would be expected to dissolve after death, which means we have to somehow prove that the soul is immortal.\n\nWhen Socrates draws a distinction between material and immaterial objects, he initiates the argument of affinity that states that non-composite things and forms are permanent. Things that seem to remain the same or follow the same state are most often non-composite whereas sensible or visible things never remain in the same state. So is the human body that passes through many critical stages to end up or dissolve, these include infancy, childhood, youth and old age. Since the human body is a visible thing that is sensible to take cause and effect of other things, it reacts to all-natural phenomenon making it subject to becoming perishable. On the other hand, being that the soul is invisible, we can assume that it is also indissoluble and it remains immortal among other immaterial objects.\n\nThough we can assume that the soul is invisible, we cannot claim that the soul never changes or remains in the same form. The dialogue conducted between Ahrensdorf and Socrates in Phaedo reflects how and why Socrates’ carries the view that the human soul is immortal and that our embodied human existence is the place where the philosophical life is lived out, not some transcendent reality in which perfect wisdom exists (Gordon, 1998).\n\nVallega (2006) writes that Plato refers to the knowledge of the intuited world which possesses the ability to be turned to knowledge of the purely structural, and in this sense, human life through critical conceptual knowledge may be a passage toward the eternal (Vallega, 2006). This might be true as far as intuition is concerned because it is this intuition that Plato refers to prove as recollection, that we logically explain. These arguments indicate the primary difference between the school of thought of an ordinary man and a philosopher.\n\nReferences\n\nBostock David, (1986) Plato’s Phaedo: Clarendon Press: Oxford.\n\nGallop David, (1999) Phaedo: Plato: Oxford World’s Classics.\n\nGerson P.

      "“American Slavery an American Freedom” by Edmund S. Morgan Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nAmerican history always symbolizes the controversy of viewpoints and diversity of religion movements. The brightest written argument is the book “American slavery, American freedom: The Ordeal of colonial Virginia” by Edmund S. Morgan. The book witnesses the close alliance between the establishment of freedom rights in Virginia and the rise of slavery movement which is considered to be the greatest contradiction in American history. That crucial statement was consistently grounded by Morgan’s numerous arguments.\n\nIn Morgan’s opinion, Virginia colony could be compared with Utopia place where slavery was considered to be a mere labor work of people that were addicted to “Protestant Ethics” of Max Webber. Consequently, the government refused to acknowledge the fact of suppression of human inherent rights and freedoms. Instead, they compare slavery with an honorable service to the welfare of the upper levels of the society. Moreover, people were consciously working since they considered it to be their duty to cultivate Virginia’s land. Further on, the inhabitants of the Brutish colony did not express a burning desire to change their ways of life and slaves were considered to be a profitable and beneficial property. Later, servitude was officially accepted.\n\nMorgan’s argument concerning the existence of slavery is proved by the idea the acknowledgment of racism of Virginia of that time. In other words, racism was the trigger point that facilitated the official introduction of slavery. In addition, Morgan makes a tangible accent of an enormous interest of Virginia’s colonists to gain high profits by means of slaves. According to Morgan’s strong belief, the rise of liberty and freedom and the existence of slavery was “central paradox of American history” from seventeenth to nineteenth century. To support the idea, the author examines different levels of society and illustrates the inevitable union.\n\nViewing generally the book, it is hard to omit the fact that Morgan’s study of that paradox is mostly connected with the history of Virginia where he simply describes Virginia colonial experience. Here, he shows that the recognition of slavery did not necessarily have to be an inherent part of English colonization. Thus, the writer brightly portrays how American history was shaped relying on the event taken place in Virginia. More grave conflict arises in Morgan’s failure to explain the slave-base welfare of Jefferson and Washington defending freedom and owning slaves simultaneously (Kevin R. Hardwick & Warren R. Hofstra, 2003, p. 52). To my mind, the strong point in depicting the facts lies in its transparency where they are identified as rather persuasive and provoking but still too generalized and judgmental.\n\nConsidering arguments mentioned above, it is hard to distinguish the actual relations between these two incompatible phenomena. Nonetheless, Morgan’s attempt to assign the history of the British colony to American history was quite successful. It explains by the fact that slavery and oppression prevailed and considered to be the dominant features of American history. That perpetuated topic has grounded its traces in the history of Virginia. In general, Morgan’s interpretation of the history of the United States is rather provoking and disputable and has many points left for further discussion. A thorough examination needs the point that concerns the actual attitude of Americans to the slavery problem. However, the drawbacks of ideas are mostly focused on Morgan’s prejudiced attitude to the colonists and to the problem of slavery.\n",
      "Abortions and Birth Control Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nThe subject of abortion and birth control was a delicate theme for ages, it was a source for debates for determining the validity of the mentioned topics. The difference in the religious and cultural background for the debaters through the history made the outcome of this debate, taking in consideration the technological progress in the modern world interesting to examine. This article mainly focuses on some of the questions surrounding the abortion and the birth control such as: Is abortion moral; Are there benefits for legalizing abortions; the contraceptive in its various forms as a birth control; Sexual education. When using different sources it is not necessarily that the article supports and agrees with their statements, as the goal of the article to give an idea of the general points of view and to discuss them.\n\nThe morality of the abortion was and still is a sensitive issue in the world today as the world is divided into separate groups of opposing parties. In the article “Is there Life After Roe Wade?” (Mahowald, 1989), the author talks about the morality and legality of the abortion and what was changed since the case of Roe V.Wade.\n\nThe author neither takes the side of the supporters of the legality of abortions nor their antagonists in their debates. In his article the role of church is not mentioned as the religious point of view for morality.\n\nThe position to abortion though it is in general would be a matter of eternal accusation of immorality by some people and justification by the other. The procedure of the abortion could not be taken as an absolute definition which not relevant to other issues.\n\nSuch as issues as the health conditions of the pregnant woman, the circumstances that surround her pregnancy, the social conditions for the newborn baby, and the age of the mother. In addition it should be taken in consideration that most of the debates go through the differences between abortion as a termination of the unwanted pregnancy and the abortion as a termination of fetus.\n\nThese debates will not clear the subject of the abortion and its moral or immoral value. The circumstances surrounding the abortions are sometimes more immoral than the abortion itself. Showing practical solutions that could make the moral decisions about pregnancy easier but will not totally make it acceptable definitely show that the issue would still have its share of controversy in the future. (Mahowald, 1989).\n\nIn spite of the delicate matter of the abortions and the battle that surround them for the legal and the moral side of this case, there are some evident benefits of making abortions legal in some countries. In countries in which abortion has been legalized , there are a decrease in the quantity of incompetent abortions that involves risking the life of the women.\n\nIn countries where abortions has become available the women of certain categories such as the older women or the women with diseases has the right to stop the unwanted risky pregnancy, and as a result the women who decide to take responsibility of giving birth are healthier and more able to the cope with the difficulties of childbirth. As a result the overall mortality of women increases in the countries where legal abortions take place. The other benefit is the rising welfare of the society as a result of the decreasing number of unwanted children. Children who most likely to be neglected, abused and rejected from their families and as a result get a mental or neurotic illness who most likely if not healed may commit a crime in the future.\n\n“Medical abortions on request and good quality care in this area are a tremendous advance not only toward individual health and the dignity of women, but also toward a more loving, caring, and more responsible society, a society where cooperation rather than violence will prevail”. (Morgentaler, 1996).\n\nThe general point of view in decreasing the number of abortions is the use of contraceptives as a birth control.\n\nIt is evident that the countries that there a connection between the wide availability of the contraceptives and the abortion rates.\n\n“It’s no accident that the world’s lowest abortion rates are found in Belgium and the Netherlands, where contraception is widely available, or that the highest rates are in Cuba and Vietnam, where access is limited “.(“Abortion Prevention,” 2007, p. 5).The second vital issue in birth control is the use of education and the family planning as a strategy for birth control.\n\nThe involvement of the government role in the social programs of reducing unwanted abortions is vital. These programs should focus on teaching the teens the family values along with providing them with the sexual education about contraception. The focus only on the delay of initiation of sex among teens by focusing on abstinence programs is a good way but it proved effective when in addition to proper sexual education. The birth control has been a subject of discussions in the US, but it focused on abstinence-only programs that encourage sexual abstinence and don’t refer to contraceptive methods except to indicate their relative failure rates, where reports of National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy that educational programs that focuses both on the contraceptives and the abstinence were positively more effective.\n\nThe value of sex education in a modern world countries rises along with the serious problems that teenage pregnancy represents. If the unwanted pregnancy for an adult grownup women that thinks of solving this problem is an issue of legality and morality she is capable of taking responsibility of. The children under eighteen of age are not adults, so in terms of legal and financial issues still the responsibility of their parents and the community in general. The teenagers despite of their sense of rejection in the years of puberty share values of life with their parents. According to that the responsibility of educating the kids about the risks that can face them fully lies on the shoulder of their parents and the government. “Within a year, a sexually active teenage girl who does not use contraception has a 90% chance of becoming pregnant.” (Rosoff, 1996). The majority of teenagers when faced with the unwanted pregnancy usually have an abortion or choose to raise the baby.Much of the outcome depends on education and financial status of the family she lives in. The dilemma of the abortions was discussed, but the pregnancy as fact that can end in the teen girl raising her child alone also a factor that need consideration. The role of the society in protecting the teenagers the full and practical knowledge they need to cope with, as the intensity of the sex in the media along with the attraction to opposite sex that becomes maximal in the years of puberty, can put a lot of pressure the youngsters need to know how to deal with. A better sex education and wide access to contraceptive are first steps in teaching the teenagers how to better cope with their future responsibilities.\n\nThe topic of abortions and birth control would not end no matter how many discussions take place or how many groups of supporters or haters occur. The issue of morality can only be limited by legality which might be different from country to country within its jurisdiction. The issue of morality will stay individual and will represent a different point of view, as for every person there are going to be a new opinion that justifies a situation that another opinion rejects. Talking about benefits or harms of legalizing abortions is not as useful as providing better sexual education for teenagers and better birth control conditions for grownups.\n\nIn any case this topic with its relevant sensitivity is the subject of debates that is not going to stop unless it is completely clear whether the termination of unwanted pregnancy is a necessity or not. If it is a necessity what are the conditions that distinguish between whether It is an issue of privacy or a woman health risk , whether it is irresponsibility or it is a solution. One thing for sure is that it will not be a pleasant matter to neither to discuss nor to go through.\n\nWorks cited\n\nMahowald, M. B. (1989). Is There Life after Roe V. Wade?.

      "Benjamin Franklin and the American Revolution Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Main body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nAmerican culture played a crucial role in American Revolution and its causes. This culture took its roots in traditions and values of colonizers, their unique beliefs and religious principles shaped by hardship and deficiencies faced in America. Many Americans opposed intrusion of the government in human rights issues and freedoms. Such notion as “American provincialism” means that American nation felt self-identification and distinctive features in contrast to European culture.\n\nThe Stamp Act (1865) was a starting point in self-identification of the nation. American provincialism was closely connected with equality seen as the counterpart of liberty, but here the radicals found themselves on more difficult ground, especially when they tried to relate theoretical concepts to the practical problems of reform politics.\n\nRadical interpretations of the Revolution were refracted through a unique understanding of American society and its location in the imperial community. If their general principles logically directed Commonwealth men to an interest in the colonial dispute, the warmth of their understanding gave it a distinctive coloring (Ellis 2000).\n\nMain body\n\nFranklin perceived American Revolution as a product of unique cultural values and traditions created by colonists. These values involved ideas of liberty and freedom, equal rights and independent from Britain. In one form it was expressed in the ethical basis of political morality and behavior, and much of the radicals’ response to issues raised by the Revolution was grounded ultimately on what can be conveniently described as political theology.\n\nIn another respect it was manifested through the differential political status accorded to various religious denominations, and particularly through the alliance between the state and an established church. Refusal to conform to the established church was deemed to be evidence of seditious intent.\n\nThe state acted on the premise that a gift of entrenched privileges to the dominant sect would conduce to greater social and political stability and made such a grant to the Anglican church while denying it to the dissenting sects. In return the state received substantial moral and political support from all levels of the Anglican church. This association invaded most areas of public life and was deeply insulting to many loyal citizens; its power was formidable (Ellis 2000).\n\nFranklin protected American policies and supported independence from Britain. As evidenced by this brief survey, the bonds of blood, common culture, and economic interest as well as political institutions linked the Atlantic communities of the first British Empire. America was independent of the mother country, Franklin declared in effect, for the colonies and England were “distinct and separate States,” connected only by the same “head, or Sovereign, the King….” (Ellis 2000).\n\nMoreover, the several American “States” had “equal Rights and Liberties… being connected as England and Scotland were before the Union” of Great Britain. The imperial government soon became aware of Franklin’s doctrine when the Massachusetts legislature adopted his theory in a constitutional dispute with the royal governor in 1772-1773 (Ellis 2000). Governor Thomas Hutchinson fully appreciated the implication in the claim of the assembly when it contended, as Franklin had, that the colonial charters had created American states separate from Great Britain, and that the provincial assemblies, not the British Parliament, had exclusive jurisdiction in the New World.\n\nAs far as Franklin and the Massachusetts Whigs were concerned the Declaration of Independence three and a half years later merely proclaimed the separate “kingdom” of Massachusetts a republic. “Franklin himself acknowledged Washington’s supremacy” (Ellis 2000, p. 102).\n\nConclusion\n\nFranklin’s doctrine of independence was soon known in England. Moreover, it was directly involved in the dispute over the appointment of the provincial agent when Hutchinson refused to recognize a sole agent for the lower house and successfully solicited an instruction from the Privy Council prohibiting the governor from approving such an agent.\n\nReferences\n\nEllis, J.

      "Personality Disorders: Client-Centered Therapy Term Paper\n\nHaving worked as a counselor I have found out that personality is normally referred to as the thoughts, emotions and behavior pattern that every person has. Personality trait can have immense variations between individuals. Many research hypotheses concur that personality has aspects that are prominent. Therefore personality disorder is regarded as a debilitating condition which results to inability of an individual affected to perform the usual routine practices for example household matters effectively and efficiently. In this case we find that this affected individual carry a number of signs of the personality disorders and include extreme anxiety and being anxious that occurs to an individual for a period up to around twenty four weeks. The key symptoms of anxiety and worry which are the main cause of psychological disorders may comprise getting easy exhaustion, restlessness, poor concentration, being temperamental and sleep disorders. As a counselor I can say that such worries and anxiety causes major stress and may cause bad image in the societal aspect as well as in the work-related environment contexts and other significant parts of operation in an individual’s daily life. We can also deduce that such turbulences caused by psychological disorders are not related however to other psychological causes such as drug abuse or medical conditions that might be related to this kind of anxiety.\n\nOn the other hand I consider counseling to be very essential especially to people who have stress or depression in their lives. In counseling, there is helping of persons that are psychologically healthy to resolve problems or issues that are affecting them. In most cases this takes place on a short term basis. Counseling is a very important aspect in the society today. The reason for this is I can say that people nowadays go through complex issues that are not easy to solve. These issues range from work, education, marriage, relatives name it-they all affect individuals and families and they can really stress someone. All these issues need a person who has been professionally trained to handle them. In this case of handling an individual who has personality disorder we find that the counseling professionals normally indulge in a type of therapy referred to as Client-Centered Therapy.\n\nAs a clinical practitioner I have been defining the client-centered therapy as an approach that is meant to treat a variety of disorders which may include depression anxiety, domestic violence, and drug addiction among others. We also find that this theory is also applied in the treatment of the individuals who are reported to be having a number of disabilities, such as mental and developmental disabilities. In this theory I therefore find that counseling is applied with an aim of reducing the pain associated with various disabilities and in the process dealing with the feelings of despairs that go along with this disorder. (Gask and Usherwood 1997)\n\nClient-Centered therapy is a type of counseling that specializes in the creation of changes in the individuals’ personal life whereby the person is always found to be at a risk of being attacked with psychological disorders, thus it involves the therapist to centre his focus on the client. This method works hand in hand with behavioral therapy which brings an establishment of the skills that may be applied in the solving of a number of problems. Research indicates that the counselors, prefer this method and the reason for this is that it creates a distinction between external problems and internal changes to be made by an individual, the internal changes are meant to help in the assessment of the problems the child is facing, this is usually done by self-evaluation, including the evaluation of other people surrounding the affected person and his the life expectations. External changes are applied in the handling of the present situations by the use of management skills which include communication, life management and the skills required to develop a better relationship with environment of the client. (Basch, 1986)\n\nThe goal of this therapy is to allow the individual to have an opportunity to be optimistic and create reality in his prospects and thus reduction of depression. It therefore enables the dejected individual to be acquainted with life troubles which are decisive and those that are of no importance which help him to come up with positive life objectives that is to be optimistic. I also find that in this theory the problem solving therapy technique is applied whereby the therapist is put in a position of identifying the causative of the disorder and finding the solution to avoid further damage to the client. (Chopra and Kulhara, 1996)\n\nThe therapist is found to be using the following methods in order to resolve such issues; Therapeutic relationship; under this I can mention that a better relationship between the client and the counselor is established. The client is therefore required to build trust and safety on the counselor although sometimes I argue that the client finds it hard to build trust on the counselor thus they end up not giving full information about the causative factor of their illness. According to the counseling practices safety is considered as a leading factor to a safety therapeutic trauma work. In this case the patient may be found to be having a number of characteristics that may hinder him from building trust and safety on the therapist. (Corey, 2005)\n\nCounseling has always been regarded as the best method used by this client centered therapy which is believed to be dealing with clients suffering from various disorders, thus it helps the client in handling a number of issues which are found to be causing the disorders. In rare cases this practice requires skilled professionals to deal with issues ranging from education, marriage, individuals and families. As a professional I am therefore required to have acquired the following in my practices in order to understand the client’s problem. I should develop good listening skills, empathy, and also should be genuine since I am always required to tell the truth even if the subject matter is not that good to the patient. Therefore my responsibility is to bring out the truth in a way that the client will be able to handle and understand his situation; being a therapist I should give unconditional positive regard and also have concreteness in providing any information about the psychological disorder the client is subjected to. (Gask and Usherwood 1997)\n\nThis therapy indicates that individuals are always found to be responding to the emotional stimulation not normally; this may come up as a result of biological factors and also the way the individual was brought up. It is usually carried out in two forms; that is the weekly psychotherapist that involves the addressing issues that are said to have affected the individual during the week and also coming up with the best resolutions for such factors leading to psychological disorders. The second form is the group therapy which is directed towards the handling of the interpersonal skills, the regulation of emotions and also enabling the individual to accept and also tolerate the disorder. The importance of the Client Centered Therapy is that it helps the individuals found to be suffering from the personality disorders to response to such conditions positively and also bringing up a number of characteristics including that of self-esteem, having and looking for more goals in life and also learning of new methods of behaving. (Eysenck, 1997)\n\nEye movement desensitization and reprocessing; this is also one of the methods that i usually offer as a client centered therapists in ensuring that the traumatic and psychological experiences are remembered by the patient. In this case I do this by asking the patient to follow the my finger in the left right eye movements that is usually done in a rhythmic manner, and by doing this the individual suffering from the personality disorder is therefore asked to be thinking of the traumatic experience undertaken in the process of being attacked by the disorder. I find this therapy to be leading to reduced cases of the appearance of the traumatizing images to the client. Many argue that this therapy method provides no control, pre and post treatment assessments (Chopra and Kulhara, 1996)\n\nI regard this therapy as the best method used in helping people who suffer from personality problems. This is because many dysfunctions such as traumas resulting form drug abuse, child abuse and other family matters are easily handled by using the patients’ family members who produce a number of information such as personal characteristics that may help the counselor in handling the person affected by the disorders. This is a treatment that may be used by many counselors and that they are advised to per take this therapy with regards to carrying a number of methods used in counseling. One of them is the supportive method of counseling which is applied in the counseling with an objective of relieving pain caused by depression on the individual and also by doing this the patient is also allowed to recognize himself as an important member of the society. Most of the disorders make individual face loneliness and discriminated from the rest of the people in the society thus such technique is important. (Gask and Usherwood1997)\n\nAs a therapist I prefer this method since it creates a distinction between external problems and internal changes to be made by the person, the internal changes are meant to help in the assessment of the problems the person is facing, this is usually done by self-evaluation, including the evaluation of other people surrounding the sick person and the expectations of the person in his life. External changes are usually used in the handling of the existing problems by the use of various management skills including, communication, life management and those required to develop a better relationship with those who are not affected by the disorders.\n\nI therefore find that exposure in counseling plays a major role in helping the people with personality disorders; it is usually identified in two forms, one being exposure to the feared solutions which is a method that involves tackling repeatedly a situation that is said to be causing a particular disorder every time it indicates its reappearing. I find it to be making the person suffering to get used to such a problem until it doesn’t cause more traumas.\n\nThe second form is the exposure role plays which is said to be a bit similar to that of the exposure to feared situations. The only difference is that this practice is done on a simulative basis; that is one can repeatedly do the activity which is similar to what is causing the disorder. A good example of this is that when an individual suffering from anxiety always finds it difficult to communicate with his employer, he can therefore try to avoid this problem by trying to talk to someone who is senior to him in the working place and after sometime we find that he will be able to overcome this fear of facing his employer. (Basch, 1986)\n\nI can therefore conclude that counseling plays a key role in treatment of psychological disorders and patients with such disorders should be subjected to such programs in order to aid them to recover slowly from such attacks which may affect their lives by applying both the gestalt therapy and the client-centered therapy. Under the two therapies we find that counseling programs designed should be well formulated to address all the problems that the patients with such disorders are facing in the society in order to avoid the repeat of the attacks. These therapies should be made easier in terms of getting access to it for example building counseling centers in all parts of the county. The relevant authorities should also chip in and offer the counseling services for free or at affordable rates to the members of the society. (Basch, 1986)\n\nReferences\n\n 1. Basch, M.

      "Organizational Psychology: Innovation and Creativity Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Innovative and Creative Team\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Refences\n\nIntroduction\n\nA team is a group of individuals working together to achieve common objectives and goals in an organization. For a team to be effective and productive, members usually share certain common characteristics that allow sharing of leadership roles and accountability and shifting the roles from one individual to several individuals within a team in a work environment. And Team building is a process whereby teams are selected, developed, and collectively motivated with the aim of improving the effectiveness and productivity of a team in a business organization.\n\nInnovative and Creative Team\n\nIn today’s competitive world requires the organization to institutionalize the practice of creating a room for creativity and innovation that could utterly change a team in an organizational scenario. Innovation and creativity necessarily involve the generation of new ideas that lead to the destruction of old ways of doing things and result in perfection in doing business. For an organization willing to achieve this, leaders must be committed to building innovative and creative cultures, and the first necessity is to understand the innovative and creative process, and the second is to consign to policies that hold the innovative and creative process in an organization.\n\nThe process of building a team of innovative and creative thinkers is essential to meeting the load of today’s business market objectives and goals. Leaders in a team need to develop captivity that results in innovation and creativity, which focuses on the employing of experience and key business objectives and goals which are the mission of today’s business organization. Being successful and effective in a business organization begins with a view that a productive and innovative, and creative team methodology relies on the strength and commitment of the whole team rather than the strength and commitment of one individual. One of the methods involves the combination of an innovative and creative team that becomes a linked team which is then more equipped to succeed and to generate ideas that result in creativity and innovation hence promoting productivity in an organization (Dugs, 1995).\n\nAligning the right talent with the correct project opportunity proves to be valuable to your organization’s business end solutions. Innovative and Creative teams require counselors and support from their leaders and managers. The process of closely pulling together the efforts of team members as a method of promoting creativity and innovation can result in a mix of influences that result in a crossbreed of generation of ideas that are original and competitive in today’s world of business.\n\nSelection of most promising, creative, and innovative individual in an organization, and provision of resources that will promote their creativity and innovation, and creation of room for generating new ideas that would transform the entire organization into achieving the best performance in business is another method for developing a team that is creative and innovative and hence being effective and efficient in their daily duties and roles.\n\nTeam leaders should encourage team members to come up with incremental solutions and recommendations that will be used to modify the technological process and improve organizational performance. Building a culture that truly encourages creativity and innovation in a team, hence resulting in getting immediate results that will yield incremental improvements, and the need for team members to meet deadlines can sometimes kill the innovative and creative process before the implementation stage. Good communication with innovative and creative individuals working on a project in an organization can help managers and leaders to create more understanding in a team (Bernard, 2000).\n\nLeaders should create room for the implementation of new ideas by encouraging team members to bring the new idea into reality. This is significant, not only to harvest the rewards of creativity and innovation in practice but to encourage other team members that their best achievement and efforts will be adopted in your business organization (George, 2002).\n\nConclusion\n\nFor a team to meet its expectation, objectives, and goals, one must emphasize teamwork, which is working together with the same aspiration and coordinated efforts in striving for a common objective and goal. Team leaders should attempt to get individuals to work as a team relatively than as individuals. For teams to be more effective in their day-to-day performance hence meeting set end results, they have to hold meetings that involve active problem-solving and strategies that go beyond discussions, decision-making processes, and delegation of duties and roles.\n\nRefences\n\nDugs, B.

      "Analysis of the Movie ‘Everyone’s’ Child’ Essay\n\nPoverty as a dreadful specter looms large on the African Continent. The movie “Everyone’s Child”, in 1996, elaborately called for immediate action against the growing number of millions of African parentless and homeless children as a fallout phenomenon of HIV Aids. The movie appealed to the conscience of the people of the world and explained how poverty broke human relations, created vulnerabilities, and seriously affected human society.\n\nEveryone’s Child explicitly narrated the story of the destruction of relationships between the main characters of the story and based on a household of four siblings named, Itai, Tamari, Norah, and Nhamo. Both parents had already died of Aids. The villagers criminally ignored them after the traditional funerals of their parents, died with the stigma of Aids. They were left to the custody of one of their uncles “Ozias”, who was himself a small businessman, And he sold out all the leftover, small assets of the helpless family. The family, with all the relations, unfortunately, disintegrated due to the sheer pressure of abject poverty. That’s exactly how the family’s relationship evaporated in the first instance.\n\nItai, the eldest brother, running after empty promises of high-paying jobs, went to Harare where he was alone and penniless and eventually he inevitably joined a gang of homeless boys. That gang in all manifestations presented a picture of homeless children. Tamari, Itai’s sister who was, unfortunately, left to care for her younger brother and sister, was trapped into prostitution. Her younger brother Nhamo died in a burnt house with the remnants of toys. His unfortunate death eventually realized Uncle Ozias and fellow villagers about responsibility to help the three helpless children reconstruct their lives.\n\nPoverty and sheer poverty made the wretched family vulnerable to all sorts of dangers. Everyone’s Child provided the viewers with no direct answers to the problems of the victim’s family. That was evident in the response of an official of an NGO who refused the villagers to help them out with the problems of that hapless family on the pretext that the problem of orphans was so rampant that local people couldn’t look to outside agencies or government for help rather they must become self-reliant. That was the absolute poverty that disintegrated family relationships and exposed him or her to all sorts of vulnerabilities.\n\nA predator shopkeeper also trapped sister Tamari, for sexual abuse and she becomes a victim of HIV Aids. Her younger brothers were left home. While in her absence, the home got ablaze and her younger brother Nehamo was burnt to ashes. So, the family was made vulnerable due to the sheer ravages of poverty.\n\nIt can be concluded that poverty, not only creates vulnerability but it also exacerbates the vulnerability of helpless people. Poverty is a pain. Poverty is reckless. It makes people vulnerable to death, destruction, and abuse. Had the parents of these four orphans not died of HIV Aids, the children might have not separated from each other. The sister may not have been trapped in the club and become susceptible to HIV Aids.\n\nThe younger brother might have not died of fire and the whole family may have not broken up. That was the poverty that made them vulnerable and people took advantage of the situation instead of helping them out. The family might have not become so brutally vulnerable, that they got some other valuable assets other than a plow and oxen, which their uncle Oziaz had immediately sold out.\n\nThe main point of concern is that poverty badly affects society. Poverty tears off the human conscience. It takes away morality, respect, and security from human society. Poverty is a curse. Everyone’s Child, as acclaimed earlier has proved that there are more than 10 million Aids orphans on the African Continent. There are millions of homeless abandoned and displaced people in Asia and Africa due to the civil wars. The floods and droughts have made millions of people homeless and vulnerable to crimes like prostitution, murders, and dacoities. Poverty certainly affects people in all its manifestations.\n\nPoverty is the name of a situation and process. This is a situation when an individual, family, or a community can not provide for bare minimum needs of food, clothing, shelter, and heath. It is the process when this situation causes, hunger, disease, and death. Historically poverty and affluence have coexisted in human society. The solutions to poverty always existed in human morality. The lenses of the camera have seen many times the feeding children on the breasts of dying mothers in sub-Saharan Africa.\n",
      "Affordable Care Act: A Transparent Set of Available Coverage Choices Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nOver the past several decades prior to the Affordable Care Act (ACA), America had disproportionately increased health care spending, although there had been no tangible reasons in terms of improved quality of services. The cost of insurance per employee had almost doubled, and a significant part of the population remained uninsured. The insurance market provided by employers had been extremely monopolized, which impeded labor mobility and created an environment where discrimination is possible. To address all these issues, ACA was passed, which provided a transparent set of available coverage choices. There are various levels of coverage defined by the ACA, including Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Platinum. There is also a catastrophic plan for specific circumstances and certain age group.\n\nA Bronze plan is targeted at people who are generally healthy because it is the cheapest of metal plans and features high deductibles and copays. Bronze level coverage will pay for 60 percent of the full cost of medical services (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010). A Silver plan is suitable for those who want to pay a little more because there is more routine care needed. Seventy percent of all costs will be covered under this plan (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010).\n\nGold level plans have high monthly premiums but low deductibles. It is suitable for those who visit health care facilities more often. All Gold level plans must pay for 80 percent of the total cost (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010). A Platinum plan provides benefits equivalent to 90 percent of the full price (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010). It has the highest monthly premium but the lowest deductibles. A Catastrophic plan covers all preventive services and additional three primary care visits per year before requiring the first deductible to be met (Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, 2010). It is cheaper than the previous four coverage levels, but not everybody can qualify for this plan.\n\nHealth Care Reform Challenges\n\nThere are firm distinctions in how people approach health care reform. These differences in views have been fueling both political and informal debates for many years, posing a hindrance to prospective laws and acts. Among the specific factors making health care reform difficult are the lack of clear vision, prioritization between costs and access, debates over whether the government should take full control, political partisanship, and economic self-interest of critical stakeholders.\n\nThe lack of a national vision on health care will always result in contradicting proposals. While many politicians would support a system where everybody would benefit, the discussion will still have no uniform shape because there is no enforced national idea that would hold all propositions consistent (Giaimo, 2016). There are also endless debates on whether the country must care for every individual despite the costs, whether it must leverage the expenses and the number and quality of services, or whether it should prioritize money savings (Giaimo, 2016). The country must be able to choose between access and costs. The ones concerned with budgets may object to reforms that require excessive amounts of expenditures.\n\nThe third reason is concerned with the debate over the government’s involvement in health care. The reality embodies the cooperation between private firms and lawmakers. The dominance of the free market, however, is evident because the lack of responsibility on the government’s behalf led to the system’s failure to serve the population (Giaimo, 2016). Political initiatives are in stagnation due to government passiveness. Political partisanship is another reason because the parties tend to focus on competing ideologies rather than concentrating on shared values and goals (Giaimo, 2016). This competition results in debates that never conclude with reasonable decisions.\n\nThe last reason is about the financial interests of various people that have a voice in the discussions. Health care reform is expensive, and someone will have to pay for it, be it the government or private companies. People that may potentially lose profit because of reforms will always oppose them and use Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to promote their interests in the political arena.\n\nReferences\n\nGiaimo, S.

      "Infection Control Practice Change Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Professional Practice Description\n 2. Key Stakeholders\n 3. Evidence Critique Table\n 4. Evidence Summary\n 5. Evidence-Based Practice Recommendation\n 6. Practice Change Model\n 7. Potential Barriers\n 8. Ethical Considerations\n 9. References\n\nProfessional Practice Description\n\nVarious nursing practices, such as assessment of pain, nurse-to-nurse shifts, effective patient care, improving patients’ satisfaction, and infection control, occupy an important place within the healthcare industry. Nurses must perform at their best level and seek to deliver excellent service and care. Careful analysis and evaluation of nursing practices are essential in developing clear instructions and objectives, as well as in achieving great results through the implication of those practices. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the infection control or prevention nursing practice and observe the necessity of change and possible alternatives based on prior researches.\n\nWithin the analyzed facility, infection control is an integral concept that implies dangers and problematic issues. The primary point in infection prevention lies in the extensive existence of healthcare-associated infections (HAI) that can be caught by the patients while getting their treatment. The WHO defines infection prevention and control (IPC) as “a specific approach and practical solution designed to prevent harm caused by infection to patients and healthcare workers” (“Infection prevention and control,” 2017, para. 1).\n\nDifferent infectious diseases, social sciences, epidemiology, and the enhancement of the health practices lie in the foundation of infection control practice (“Infection prevention and control,” 2017). Besides, infection control practice has a unique position, because each encounter of the health professional and a patient has a threat of infection development (“Infection prevention and control,” 2017). Consequently, one can see the significance of proper techniques to prevent possible infections within the healthcare organization and not to expose anyone to unfavorable outcomes.\n\nThe analyzed healthcare facility possesses weaknesses in infection control practice. Firstly, there is a lack of handwashing dispensers, which creates burdens to the timely access to the infection prevention procedures for the professionals. Besides, the chosen organization does not have enough cleaning personnel and environmental safety employees, which decreases the effectiveness of the current ICP practice. The analyzed facility also lacks in the strength of the organizational culture, which creates limitations for successful infection control. The chosen healthcare organization has a limited budget, while the ICP practice improvements require investments. Thus, it is crucial to find practical implementations and emphasize the advantages of the change to the board.\n\nWithin the last decades, more hospitals have become aware of infection control and aim to strengthen their position in this field. Healthcare-associated diseases represent a severe complication of modern medicine internationally. Several reasons, such as the utilization of the devices, older population, or incorrect use of antimicrobial practices, contribute to the emergence of this problem (Al-Tawfiq & Tambyah, 2014). Today, medicine is full of new complicated procedures that might put the immune system at risk (Nelson & Williams, 2014).\n\nThe wide use of invasive devices and the complexity of the treatment techniques can compromise the health of the patients and increase the possibility of infection. Nelson and Williams (2014) claim that within the nearest future, the number of HAIs will increase due to the reasons described above. Moreover, weak ICP methods imply high costs for a healthcare organization. Therefore, infection control practices require a change to keep up with the developments of healthcare procedures and to be able to provide an appropriate level of safety for the patients and workers.\n\nKey Stakeholders\n\nIt is essential to identify the stakeholders, the parties who are influenced by infection control and prevention practice, and its change. Firstly, the patients are at a higher risk and, therefore, the members of the society, where every single individual can become a patient, are the integral stakeholders in this field. Invasive devices are used during clinical procedures and treatment, which has a chance to cause infection directly for the patient.\n\nConsequently, it is within the interests of the community to pursue effective ICP practices because they play the primary role within the possible impact of healthcare techniques and methods. As an influential stakeholder group, the patients can contribute to the change by providing feedbacks on their experiences within the facility. Besides, the recommendations and expectations for the services from the community can be beneficial to the strengthening of the current ICP practice.\n\nAnother essential group to consider is the healthcare industry professionals. Infections can have a rapid spread in a wide area within a short period. HAIs occur in various health organizations that are full of patients, but also doctors, nurses, and medical assistants. Interesting, that healthcare professionals have two different roles within the investigated concept. From one perspective, they, just like patients, can catch an infection after specific procedures.\n\nIn this way, they represent a group that is at risk of being infected. From another perspective, doctors and nurses can compromise themselves by being the ones who performed the procedures on a patient who got the infection later. Due to the diversity of reasons for the HAIs, it is difficult to determine the causes of related diseases. However, the professionals performing operations or having contact before the infection period, are at stake of carrying the blame and having legal and social consequences.\n\nThe healthcare professionals must take the ICP practice change seriously because it directly involves their awareness and participation. The medical workers will be responsible for the specific stages of change implementation. Besides, it is fundamental for them to follow all the guidelines carefully, evaluate their performance, stick to the regulations, and maintain the proposed company’s culture. Encouragement among colleagues will also be an advantage for successful change integration.\n\nBesides the stakeholders described in this section, patients’ relatives and friends, non-medical healthcare employees and visitors, and a specific health organization’s board of directors can be influenced by ICP practices. Healthcare-associated infections might be spread to people, with whom the infected ones interact before the detention of the disease. Also, HAIs imply costs for the healthcare facility, which puts the board of directors at stake.\n\nThe role of this stakeholder group with the ICP practice change process is to conduct the objective analysis of the proposed strategies and ensure the participation of all the parties involved. Raising awareness among the visitors, conducting continuous checks on the new implementations, and offering incentives to the other stakeholder groups is essential. Changes to improve infection control practices require significant investments, making more influence on the private hospitals’ shareholders or the chefs of the organizations. However, to make a positive impact on the stakeholders and increase the level of their satisfaction, it is essential to undertake specific measures.\n\nEvidence Critique Table\n\nFull APA citation for 5 sources.

Level IV, Non-experimental   \n\n\nEvidence Summary\n\nThe concept of nurses’ behavior plays a role when it comes to infection control practice. Jackson, Lowton, and Griffiths (2014) claim that healthcare professionals often present self-defensive behaviors in case of inappropriate HAIs prevention. The primary goal of their analysis was to understand the fundamental reason for the complex behaviors of the nurses in response to infections among their patients (Jackson et al., 2014).\n\nThe findings revealed that despite the focus on the rules for compliance with the existing ICP practices, different factors like individual perception, motivation, or pressure might influence professional’s behavior (Jackson et al., 2014). Thus, the integration of “reflective sessions or clinical supervision programs” can become a useful change for the existing infection control practices (Jackson et al., 2014, p. 407). From this article, one can withdraw the problematic issues and proposed strategies to implement a change.\n\nHand hygiene is another crucial aspect of ICP practice, which is directly connected to the emergence of HAIs. The researchers suggest that hand-rub dispensers and hand-hygiene facilities play an essential role in the effectiveness of infection prevention (Zingg et al., 2015). The systematic review concluded that several critical components make ICP practice effective. Among them, there are availability and access to the materials, use of guidelines, bed occupancy, and auditing and feedback (Zingg et al., 2015).\n\nAccording to Zing et al., positive OC also favorably contributes to the success of infection control (2015). Besides, limited access to the hand-hygiene equipment within specific hospitals becomes “a source of frustration” for the professionals, which harms various levels of the organization, including behaviors and satisfaction (Zing et al., 2015, p. 214). Consequently, this study shows the connection among the elements of the healthcare facilities, highlights the importance of hand hygiene and the necessity in creating easy access to the related equipment.\n\nThe organizational culture occupies a significant spot within healthcare facilities. The researchers argue that organizational culture (OC) is a mirror of the professionals, services, activities, and patients (De Bono, Heling, & Borg, 2014). Throughout time, the essence of the company’s culture transformed into the norms of behavior and expectations (De Bono et al., 2014). Today, positive organizational beliefs and thinking can portray the legitimacy and desirable attitudes towards the patients. In such a way, focusing on modifying organization culture “appears to be promising, albeit challenging target for IPC improvement campaigns” (De Bono et al., 2014, p. 1). Thus, another study emphasized that alterations in OC can have a positive impact on the effectiveness of ICP performance.\n\nIt is crucial to take a look at the effectiveness of ICP practices. Mitchell, Hall, MacBeth, Gardner, and Halton (2015) conducted a cross-sectional study among Australian hospitals. The findings have revealed that private hospitals possessed lower levels of infection control, in comparison with the publicly funded healthcare facilities (Mitchell et al., 2015). Moreover, the analysis showed that in smaller hospitals, the professionals had identified the need for “increased access to infectious diseases or microbiology support” (Mitchell et al., 2015, p. 612).\n\nBesides, the researchers have concluded that the most significant change would be implementing information technology within the practice (Mitchell et al., 2015). Therefore, one can see that this research portrays the lack of ICP in small and private healthcare institutions and emphasized the usefulness of the further integration of improved technologies.\n\nOne more study focused on investigating the cost-effectiveness of the investments in fighting HAIs within intensive care units. Dick et al. (2015) have examined five years of data and concluded that current ICP strategies proved themselves to be cost-effective. However, besides the analysis of the financial side of infection control, the researches emphasized that HAIs remain to be a severe issue and impose high social costs (Dick et al., 2015). Consequently, although changes in ICP will require higher investments, “efforts to develop new prevention strategies” are integral for the healthcare industry (Dick et al., 2015, p. 9). Thus, this article highlights the importance of integrating the change to reduce the problems and costs associated with HAIs.\n\nEvidence-Based Practice Recommendation\n\nFrom the summary of various studies in the previous section, one can claim that the focus of change in ICP practice lies within the organizational culture, employees’ behaviors’ evaluation, and hygiene equipment access. OC improvement implies investing in education and knowledge of the professionals, as well as maintaining positive relationships among the leaders and their subordinates. Also, the behavioral concept goes deep into infection control performance.\n\nAs the studies indicate, despite knowledge in ICP regulations, nursing professionals often portray inappropriate behaviors, which is also the issue in the analyzed healthcare facility. Thus, integrating more self-assessment tools, implementing audit and feedback from both nurses and patients, and emphasizing the individual’s value among all the parties involved can have a positive impact on the organization.\n\nAnother crucial recommendation, based on the evidence summary, is the investments in hand-rub dispensers, hand-hygiene facilities, and related information technology. For instance, automatic reminders of the system for the professionals to perform infection prevention procedures can make the practice more efficient. Hence, the change in ICP practice requires careful attention to various levels within the healthcare organization, including OC, and investments into physical equipment and technologies.\n\nPractice Change Model\n\nHavelock’s theory of change is a great model for the implementation of changes in infection control and prevention practice within the analyzed healthcare facility. Integrating a specific model aims to create a planned and positive change within the organization, which is crucial in improving nursing practices. Havelock’s theory developed from Lewin’s initial change model that included unfreezing, moving, and refreezing stages (Kearney-Nunnery, 2016). Havelock’s approach broadens the three phases and offers detailed steps for the implementation of modifications. This model fits the chosen recommendations for the ICP because it “reflects the empirical-rational nature of humans” (Kearney-Nunnery, 2016, p. 185). The list below represents Havelock’s theory’s stages and provides details for the ICP changes within the analyzed organization:\n\n 1. Perception of need: despite proper knowledge and education, as well as investments in ICP, HAIs keep occurring within the organization, which requires change.\n 2. Problem’s diagnosis and identification: careful analysis of the current ICP practice reveals that it needs to be more effective to maintain a positive image, meet the patients’ expectations, and respond to desired safety levels.\n 3. Devising a plan of action: the company will emphasize the major recommendations, as well as specific details on the change plan. The first integral part is investing in new technologies and establishing more hand-hygiene facilities within the organization. The next step is integrating proper auditing and evaluation techniques for the professionals and focusing on creating positive OC through teambuilding, special seminars, and educational sessions.\n 4. Gaining acceptance of the plan: communicating the need for change for ICP practice among nursing professionals, discussing the planned actions with them, and earning their approval through emphasizing advantages that the moves will bring.\n 5. Stabilization: implementing the action plan and working on stabilizing the new approach to ICP practice within the organization.\n 6. Self-renewal: maintaining the improved ICP practice within the facility by sustaining the implemented measures and techniques.\n\nPotential Barriers\n\nEvery change strategy implies the presence of possible barriers either for its full realization or the burdens for sustaining the improvements. In the case of the proposed recommendations through Havelock’s model of change, a potential obstacle can be the reaction and misunderstanding of the employees. Modifications in the OC involve active interactions with the professional and their aspiration for positive change and development. As far as ICP practice change implicates the evaluation of behaviors, it might generate discontent or unwillingness to participate. Another potential barrier is the financial cost of the change.\n\nAs far as the new strategy means investing in new equipment, new technology, seminars, and education, the analyzed healthcare facility should carefully design an action plan considering the current budget. Consequently, the perception of the transformation, its communication to the organization, and financial implications represent possible obstacles for the ICP change.\n\nEthical Considerations\n\nEthics is in the core of nursing practices and plays a significant role in ICP in particular. The Code of Ethics was developed by the American Nurses Association to highlight the importance of integrity and morality when it comes to healthcare activities (Haddad & Geiger, 2019). This code includes nine provisions that serve as guidance for the professional nurses to perform at their best levels (Haddad & Geiger, 2019). One of the parts related to the suggested changes in ICP practice is the fact that the patient represents a primary concern and commitment for the professionals (Haddad & Geiger, 2019).\n\nAnother integral one is that the nurse “has authority, accountability, and responsibility for nursing practice” (Haddad & Geiger, 2019, para. 10). Those points require thorough consideration for the chosen recommendations for ICP change. Thus, one can claim that throughout the implementation of change within the analyzed healthcare facility, it is crucial to remember the Code of Ethics and carefully examine each action.\n\nIn conclusion, the chosen healthcare organization needs to integrate changes into the current infection control and prevention practice to enhance its operations, improve patients’ experience, and minimize the chance of HAIs’ occurrence. Careful analysis of various researches provides the foundation for the recommendations. Working towards positive organizational culture, conducting professionals’ evaluations, and investing in new equipment and techniques based on Havelock’s model of change can have a positive impact.\n\nReferences\n\nAl-Tawfiq, J.

      "The Jewish National Claim to the Land of Israel/Palestine in View of Other Nationalisms Research Paper\n\nIsrael and Palestine form two opposing sides of an armed conflict whose beginning reaches back to the 19th century when Jews who were suffering constant persecution first considered creating a separate state. The end of the First World War raised the question of people whose ancestors once lived in Palestine returning, an idea referred to as Zionism (“Everything You Need to Know About Israel-Palestine”). However, the Palestinian Arabs who lived there did not want to recognize the rights of Jews in these lands.\n\nBoth Palestine and Israel consider Jerusalem their capital and make their own demands concerning it. The problem is the coexistence of the Jewish and Arab states in Palestine, which has been the center of a long-lasting Arab-Israeli confrontation. The European Union, Turkey, Saudi Arabia, and some other Muslim countries are against making Jerusalem the capital of the country (Sheikh et al. 15). In East Jerusalem, there are shrines and places of pilgrimage for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, and the city holds religious, economic, and financial significance for both Israel and Palestine.\n\nFrom the beginning, the Arab-Jewish conflict in Palestine reflected not only a struggle over territory, but also over history, traditions, and religion. With regard to the legitimacy of the Jewish national claim to these lands, it is important to note that their intention to return there is justifiable (Tov 44). A relatively small territory has become a marker of national identity among both Jews and Palestinian Arabs. Neither one people nor the other thinks of themselves as a historical phenomenon primarily outside of Palestine, a land that formed both their national identities over many centuries. In this regard, the arguments of the Arab side also seem to be legitimate.\n\nBoth sides are actively involved in hostilities: radical Zionists refused to accept the independence of the Arab part of Palestine, while many Muslim countries did not admit that the state of Israel should exist. Currently, most of the territory is occupied by Israel, while many Arabs moved to other Muslim countries.\n\nIn 2017, after the escalation of the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis, the Palestinian Islamic movement Hamas renewed its armed confrontation, the third Intifada. Recently, the US President, Donald Trump, declared that Jerusalem is the capital of Israel and emphasized his decision by transferring the American embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv (Landler). Thus, it seems that Trump intends to show his conviction that this step will put an end to the two-state solution of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.\n\nTrump took such a risky step due to his campaign promises and Israeli-American interests (Landler). From the perspective of other nationalisms, the world community responded ambiguously to Trump’s decision. In particular, President Erdogan of Turkey argued that announcing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel is a meaningless step from Turkey’s point of view. Speaking as a representative of the leaders of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation (OIC), Erdogan emphasized that the Israeli decision will be difficult to implement.\n\nThe resolution of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is a global task since it affects the relationships between many countries. Such international mediators as the US, the European Union, and the United Nations are involved in the peace process (Melamed). All the proposed solutions have not been implemented due to the fact that both the Palestinians and the Israelis have put forward conditions that are unacceptable to the other side. A new series of negotiations was interrupted by terrorist attacks, explosions, and provocations.\n\nIt should be stressed that Jerusalem must remain open to representatives of the three religions. Unilateral action to revise the agreements that were enshrined in the decisions of the international community will not be able to achieve a lasting and fair peace (Tov 135). To respect the rights of Jews and Palestinians, it is critical to come to a common decision that will satisfy both sides.\n\nWhen it comes to the conflicting claims of Palestinians and Jews, countries should target seemingly unsolvable problems and recognize that each of the parties has a historically determined position (Melamed). In recent Israeli legislative initiatives, laws have prohibited Palestinians from celebrating Nakba, which has a meaning similar to the Holocaust for Jews. Two million Palestinians now live in Israel, and without allowing them to celebrate important dates, they cannot become loyal members of society (“Everything You Need to Know About Israel-Palestine”). By adopting such laws, Jews are attempting delegitimize the point of view of the other side (Sheikh et al. 19).\n\nThe same can be said about the Palestinian leaders. When the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, declared that there had been no Holocaust, that was also an example of treating historical memory destructively. In order to make progress in ending the conflict, the first step should be a step back— accepting the fact that the other side has another point of view.\n\nThus a critical review of the Arab-Israeli conflict shows that the claims of both sides have religious and historical importance. Indeed, the claim of the Jewish nation to occupy Palestine is justified, yet its way of confronting Arab demands has been quite violent. In turn, the Arab world considers the actions of Jews illegal and does not recognize the state of Israel. To resolve this complicated conflict, it is important to discuss it in cooperation with both sides and with other countries that are involved in the confrontation and emphasize the rights of both parties.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n“ Everything You Need to Know About Israel-Palestine .” Vox , 2018.

      "Barnes & Noble Store’s Customer Visits and Spending Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. In-store Interviews\n 3. Focus Group\n 4. Online Survey\n 5. Conclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nWe did research on customer visit frequency, spending, and experiences at one of Barnes & Noble’s (B&N) stores using a mixed-modes approach to collect data. The modes were in-store interviews, a focus group, and an online survey. In each approach, a convenient sample of B&N customers was recruited to explore specific research questions, as described in the following sections.\n\nIn-store Interviews\n\nThe purpose of conducting the interviews was to explore the preliminary opinions of B&N customers. Through open-ended questions, we were able to experience their emotions and listen to their perspectives on the bookstore’s products and services. Their responses helped formulate focus group topics and survey items. Interviewing was the first step in the data collection process.\n\nFocus Group\n\nWe recruited consenting individuals from among the target customers of B&N. One of the researchers served as the facilitator of the focus group discussion. The group’s composition was balanced in terms of demographic variables, which allowed honest and free expression of views. The specific topics explored included customer experience at B&N, the possibility of the firm launching a bar at the retail store, and critical success factors for the bookstore chain. First, open-ended questions were asked and members expressed their views freely during the session. Through the focus group, diverse perspectives and experiences were explored further using follow-up questions to give insights into what customers think about B&N’s customer service and products. Many of the participants shared their personal experiences at the bookstore.\n\nSecond, members were asked about the prospect of B&N introducing a bar at its retail stores. From their responses, a majority of them liked the idea of having an in-store pub where they can enjoy refreshments as they are being served. Some participants revealed that the other stores they frequent have bars within the establishment. Third, focus group members asked about the factors critical to B&N’s success. Most of them listed the introduction of an in-store café, store design, and bookstore size as the priority areas.\n\nOnline Survey\n\nWe used a designed web-based questionnaire to investigate the variables further. The purpose of the online survey was to obtain a larger dataset from which meaningful conclusions could be drawn. The instrument was distributed to many B&N customers via email. They were required to complete and send the online questionnaire anonymously. However, despite the large sample size, only 57 were returned. Thus, so far, we have only managed to obtain a small amount of data, which presents a challenge to this study. We would require sufficient data to make valid inferences about the relationships between the variables we are investigating.\n\nThe items we included in our survey were developed from the focus group discussion. Respondents were asked about what they think of the possibility of B&N setting up a bar within the store. They gave varied responses to this question, ranging from approval to strong disapproval. Through the online survey, we were able to understand the relationship between dependent variables (DVs) and independent variables (IV) relevant to B&N. A tentative correlation was seen between customer experiences (IV) and visit frequency and spending (DVs). Another significant finding from the online survey is that customer visits and spending is dependent on multiple drivers. The respondents’ opinions indicated that other organizational factors influence how often they shop at B&N and the amount of money they spend.\n\nConclusion\n\nOur research used a multi-modal approach to collect qualitative and quantitative data on customer visits, spending, and experiences at B&N. Through in-store interviews, we explored the interviewees’ opinions and emotions towards the retail bookstore. The focus group expanded these perspectives and helped obtain in-depth participant views on having a bar within the store and success factors critical to B&N. From the online survey data, we determined the relationships between variables (IV and DVs) and other drivers that affect customer visits and spending at the bookstore.\n",
      "Sexuality Education for Adolescents and Adults Report (Assessment)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe study of human sexuality and its manifestations in modern society is a fascinating and vital topic not only from the standpoint of social sciences but also psychology. The appropriate training of adolescents in relation to the basics of relationships between two genders can be of great importance for their developing psyche and may help them better adapt to the outside world. In this regard, the concept of comprehensive sexuality education is an essential approach that can be considered a principle of socially oriented work from the position of people’s differences and rights. Haberland and Rogow (2015) analyze this concept and come to a conclusion that this term promoted in a special educational environment contributes to the well-being of adolescents by reviewing the issues of responsibility, inequality, and health. For instance, the problem of sexually transmitted infections is one of the pressing contemporary topics, and appropriate training is aimed at reducing the number of these diseases through timely discussion and prevention. Therefore, the concept of sexuality education is a valuable practice and may be applied to not only adolescents but also adults.\n\nThe Concept\n\nThe knowledge that individuals receive due to this training may help improve the life of society as a whole. As Haberland and Rogow (2015) remark, those challenges that some young people face at the stage of their personality maturation are often caused by the ignorance of issues about genders’ interaction. At the same time, the importance of this topic is significant because communication is regular, and building the right behavioral patterns helps eliminate any negative nuances. With the help of special training, one can eradicate bias, reduce the level of misunderstanding and conflicts between two genders, convey the importance of responsibility for sexual relations, and achieve other valuable outcomes. Therefore, the concept of comprehensive sexuality education is a term that is relevant to the whole world but not just for a single location.\n\nReference\n\nHaberland, N., & Rogow, D. (2015).

      "Genetic Testing and Related Health Issues Essay\n\nStructural elements of a functional eukaryotic chromosome and their functions\n\nThe basic structural elements of a functional eukaryotic chromosome are centromere, telomere, and a replication origin. They serve different functions. The centromere joins two chromatids together using cohesins before mitosis is initiated (Nussbaum, McInnes, & Willard, 2007). It also binds microtubules to the mitotic spindle during division. Telomeres are protective caps at the extremities of a chromosome that comprise tandem sequence repeats (Tzanetakou, Nzietchueng, Perrea, & Benetos, 2014). They safeguard sticky chromosomal ends from deterioration or binding to other chromatids. A replication origin is a specific site in a chromosome where the copying of DNA starts.\n\nTelomeres are linked to the lifespan potential in eukaryotes. Their length at birth and in adulthood shows significant variability. Telomeric loss is inversely correlated with late-onset disorders (Tzanetakou et al., 2014). Ongoing research in premature aging focuses on heightened oxidative stress and degradation of telomeres as potential triggers of these diseases (Tzanetakou et al., 2014). The aim is to reverse telomere loss to increase longevity.\n\nThe difference among replication, transcription, and translation for both DNA and RNA\n\nAccording to the central dogma model, replication is the synthesis of two daughter DNA or RNA molecules using a parental unzipped DNA strand or RNA primer as a template (Nussbaum et al., 2007). This semi-conservative process is catalyzed by DNA polymerase and occurs in the 5’ to 3’ direction. In DNA replication, complementary nucleotide bases are paired together (Adenine with Thiamine and Guanine with Cytosine) to form a double-stranded molecule (Seibert, 2014). Thiamine is replaced by Uracil in RNA copying.\n\nTranscription is the biosynthesis of RNA from a DNA template in a process catalyzed by RNA polymerase (Nussbaum et al., 2007). The product (transcript) is usually a single-stranded molecule (mRNA). In contrast, translation entails protein synthesis from an RNA template. A transfer RNA reads the transcript copied from DNA and joins an amino acid to a primer based on a three-nucleotide sequence (codon) to form a peptide chain (Nussbaum et al., 2007). The proteins produced serve different functions in the cell.\n\nFactors associated with a complex inheritance health issue\n\nDisorders with complex inheritance are often multifactorial. A number of factors are associated with their causation. First, multiple genes are involved, resulting in different disease severity and susceptibility to complex disorders (Nussbaum et al., 2007). The allelic heterogeneity means that their inheritance does not follow the Mendelian model. Second, environmental factors interact with genes to cause autosomal disorders with complex genetics. According to Nussbaum et al. (2007), relatives sharing disease-predisposing alleles may all not suffer from the same condition due to gene-environment interaction effects. Thus, these individuals may not exhibit the Mendelian pattern of inheritance for the disease.\n\nThird, familial aggregation is frequent in disease associated with complex genetics. In this case, the probability that a close relative will suffer from a disorder affecting a family member is higher than that of an unrelated person (Seibert, 2014). Heritable disease-predisposing alleles increase the risk of disease in related individuals. Fourth, genetic concordance for a complex disorder is more common in identical twins than in fraternal ones (Nussbaum et al., 2007). The reason for this scenario is that shared alleles in monozygotic twins predispose them to disease.\n\nGenomic tests for screening, diagnosis, and management of a disease\n\nDifferent types of genomic tests exist for screening, diagnosis, and management of diseases. One of such methods is single-gene testing where a gene of interest is compared to a reference sequence to identify disease-predisposing single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) or copy number variants (CNVs) (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine [NASEM], 2017). It is used in the diagnosis of disorders where phenotypic traits (symptoms) are associated with particular polymorphisms.\n\nIn contrast, whole-exome sequencing (WES) is used to screen for variants localized in exomes. The aim is to identify SNVs or CNVs implicated in Mendelian diseases. WES utilizes “capture kits that are based on hybridization methods” to separate the exome from the genome (NASEM, 2017, p. 22). Unlike single-gene tests, WES uses the NGS method only to obtain the sequence, which is then screened for variants associated with a specific pathology. Current estimates show that the sensitivity of the hybridization step in the WES method is 85-90%; thus, this test has a significant clinical utility if the targeted sequence is small (Nussbaum et al., 2007). Outcome data for single-gene tests is unavailable.\n\nModels for multigenerational family health histories\n\nTwo models can be used to assess family health history: pedigree chart and family tree (Stefansdottir, Johannson, Skirton, & Jonsson, 2016). These methods can help identify the risk of heritable disorders with a genetic basis for patient counseling. In a pedigree chart, an individual’s direct ancestors are identified, which makes it less comprehensive or informative than a family tree that lists all relatives (Seibert, 2014). The two models are useful for risk assessment to inform disease diagnosis and management.\n\nI would prefer a pedigree chart because it gives a snapshot of family-related risk factors and it is a more cost-effective tool to complete than a family tree. It also shows patterns of direct inheritance of predisposing alleles, and thus, it can be used in genetic counseling. Clinicians can also use a pedigree chart as a visual tool to demonstrate the age of disease onset based on family dynamics.\n\nThe importance of a comprehensive health and physical assessment\n\nThe rationale for gathering patient data is to evaluate risk. A comprehensive health and physical exam give insights into a person’s health condition and helps identify at-risk individuals. By considering genomic and environmental influences, a nurse practitioner (ARNP) can estimate “risks for Mendelian and multifactorial disorders” for personalized care – screening and genetic counseling (Seibert, 2014, p. 20). In particular, a family health history (FHH) can reveal genetic red flags, such as ethnic predisposition, early disease onset, and family members with related disorders.\n\nA pedigree chart spanning three generations can give adequate FHH information for an ARPN to estimate the risk of genetic disorders (Stefansdottir et al., 2016). An electronic version of this tool can ease data retrieval and updates. Inbuilt electronic health records of relatives can give information about family dynamics – genetics, diet, and physical activity – for optimal care.\n\nGenetic test and its impact on health, prevention, screening, diagnostics, treatment selection and effectiveness\n\nCancer initiation is linked to sporadic mutations in the oncogenes that cause uncontrolled cell proliferation (Nussbaum et al., 2007). Genetic testing for these tumors screens for predisposing mutant BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes. Although the test is critical for managing breast cancer, insurers may use the genetic information to deny patients life insurance because of increased disease risk that reduces age-specific survival rates.\n\nOne genetic test for cancer is gene expression profiling to characterize tumors. This approach has been used in the screening and diagnosis of Burkitt lymphoma based on expressed surface proteins (Nussbaum et al., 2007). If the expression levels are significant, therapy can be recommended to prevent tumor development. The test helps distinguish this cancer from a more severe subtype, B-cell lymphoma, which requires aggressive interventions (chemotherapy) (Seibert, 2014).\n\nPharmacological agent with a protocol/clinical guideline that may not take into consideration genetic variations\n\nGenetic risk information has been utilized to tailor treatments according to genetically determined individual responses to medication to avoid toxicity and optimize drug efficacy. One such pharmacological agent is isoniazid that is used for latent tuberculosis treatment (Nussbaum et al., 2007). The protocol for isoniazid entails a 3-month regimen that is administered once weekly (Amlabu et al., 2014). However, polymorphisms in the N-acetyltransferase gene have created two phenotypes: slow and rapid users.\n\nPatients who inactivate isoniazid slowly are at a higher risk of developing neuropathy than those who metabolize it rapidly (Nussbaum et al., 2007). On the other hand, fast acetylators may not maintain adequate drug levels throughout the week. Thus, the protocol for isoniazid therapy may not consider these genetic variations.\n\nHow nutrition can impact this health issue positively and negatively\n\nProper nutrition is critical in the management of diabetes, a metabolic disorder that is diagnosed when fasting plasma glucose (FPG) level is ≥ 7.0 mmol/L (Evert et al., 2013). Specialized nutritional therapy is required for better glycemic control. Evert et al. (2017) further note that “vegetables, fruits, and whole grains” are recommended over sugars as carbohydrate sources for improved health (p. 3822). Additionally, self-monitoring starch intake has a positive impact on glycemic control by lowering caloric consumption. The use of nonnutritive sweeteners (NNSs) also has the same effect.\n\nOn the other hand, an intake of sweetened beverages, including fructose- or sucrose-loaded drinks can impact negatively on one’s cardiometabolic profile (Franz, 2016). High fructose consumption increases the risk of weight gain and insulin resistance (Franz, 2016). Therefore, adherence to the recommended nutritional regimen is critical in diabetes control.\n\nThe genetic and environmental influences on the malnutrition disorder\n\nObesity is a prevalent disorder of malnutrition. It is characterized by an elevated body mass index (BMI). Various risk factors are implicated in its causation. The main causes are a high intake of calorie- and fat-rich food and reduced physical activity (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017). These factors are environmental in nature. Syndromic obesity is known to have a genetic basis. Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS) is associated with heritable chromosomal defects that affect the loci involved in food intake regulation (Seibert, 2014).\n\nObesity poses a significant threat to the public health system. According to recent WHO (2017) estimates, the global prevalence rate of this condition is 13%. The criteria for testing or diagnosing obesity involve a body mass index of ≥ 30 kg/m2 (WHO, 2017). Treatment options include weight-loss strategies (diet and exercise), pharmacotherapy, and bariatric surgery. The prognosis of obesity entails an increasing waistline and health complications, including cardiovascular diseases and diabetes.\n\nHow genetic and genomics can play a role in a demand for new health services and how it may impact health care expenditures in the aging population\n\nGenetics and genomics are changing the healthcare landscape. The demand for personalized medicine in disease diagnosis and management following the conclusion of the human genome project is growing due to the realization that most conditions have a genetic basis (Seibert, 2014). Diagnosis will increasingly focus on identifying disease genes. Genetic testing and counseling will improve early detection and prevention of chronic conditions, such as cancers and birth defects.\n\nGenetics and genomics could also increase healthcare expenditures, especially in the aging population. Insurance premiums that are based on age-specific survival are likely to rise if adults test positive for predisposing alleles (Nussbaum et al., 2007). For example, people with BRCA1 mutations that are associated with a high breast cancer risk may be required to pay more for individual health plans.\n\nThe method that uses evidence-based data to support a new or innovative way to care for the aging\n\nOptimal care for the aging baby boomer generation requires improved care coordination to meet its complex health needs. One innovative way to support the elderly is remote monitoring combined with community-based facilities (Choi, Blumberg, & Williams, 2015). Community health nurses can visit patients in their homes for specific tests to ensure a timely management of exacerbations.\n\nEvidence-based data shows that this model of care will improve the management of chronic conditions associated with old age (Clarke, Bourn, Skoufalos, Beck, & Castillo, 2017). Routine tests, patient education on diet and exercise, and referral to specialized care are some of the benefits of at-home patient monitoring. Anticipated outcomes include better management of chronic diseases, reduced hospitalizations, and decreased healthcare spending, among others.\n\nHow genetic and genomics can play a role in a demand for new health services and how it may impact health care expenditures in the chronic disease population\n\nGenetics and genomics have been integrated into chronic disease screening and prevention. Genetic tests are becoming a public health priority for rare and single-gene disorders to provide optimal preventive therapy and reduce disease risk in relatives (Burton, Jackson, & Abubakar, 2014). Thus, genetics and genomics will lead to cost-effective management of preventable chronic conditions.\n\nGenetics and genomics will ensure cost-effective preventive and personalized treatment of common conditions. Disease prevention via antenatal and population-level screening and microbial sequencing can help reduce the cost burden of chronic illnesses (Nussbaum et al., 2007). For example, genetics and genomics have been used to develop inexpensive and effective drugs for resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strains.\n\nThe method that uses evidence-based data to support a new or innovative way to care for those with chronic disease\n\nCaring for patients with chronic diseases requires accessible, safe, and quality care to avoid preventable hospitalizations. One innovative approach used with this population is mobile integrated healthcare (MIH) – a 24-hour inter-professional care coordinated from a command center (Clarke et al., 2017). This model uses diverse community resources and healthcare workers – nurses, physicians, and community health workers – to meet the complex needs of patients (Choi et al., 2015). It ensures adequate, physician-led integrated care to manage chronic disease symptoms in community settings.\n\nThe anticipated outcomes of the MIH approach include timely, high quality, and safe care to patients with complex needs. The model will also improve healthcare coordination to advance population health and contain medical costs. It will reduce hospitalizations and length of hospital stay that increase healthcare spending.\n\nNews story about genetic or genomic technology\n\nGenome editing is an emerging genetic technology that modifies DNA through the introduction of corrective mutations (Rodriguez, 2016). One such method is the CRISPR/Cas9 technique. Genome editing can be applied in treating disorders by reversing the effects of disease-predisposing genes. New allelic variants can be introduced in the genome to treat chronic conditions, including cancers.\n\nGenome editing raises serious ethical, cultural, religious, legal, fiscal, and societal issues. Ethically, the potential for off-target mutations poses a serious safety risk to patients and the environment (Nussbaum et al., 2007). People may also refuse genome editing for cultural and religious reasons. The technology also raises legal issues related to patenting of human genes for therapeutic application (Nussbaum et al., 2007). From a fiscal perspective, intellectual property rights may make the technology expensive due to an emphasis on profits. The societal implication may include its use in improving athletic performance or intellectual capacity.\n\nIssues that undermine the rights of clients in genetic- and genomic-related decision making and action\n\nThe key issues that undermine the rights of clients in genomic-related decision-making are the privacy of medical information and barriers to informed consent. Genomic data may be shared with family members who are at risk of a particular condition, overriding a patient’s decision to have them kept confidential (Nussbaum et al., 2007). Obtaining informed consent from patients in need of gene therapy raises ethical issues.\n\nThe potential solution for this issue is assessing family/cultural factors that may affect the utilization of genomic services (Rodriguez, 2016). As a patient advocate, I would recommend health education programs targeting at-risk populations to help address the barriers to informed consent. Such measures will that health beliefs are integrated into genomic services.\n\nReferences\n\nAmlabu, V., Mulligan, C., Jele, N., Evans, A., Gray, D., Zar, H. J., … Smith, P. (2014).

      "Process Consultation in Building Relationships Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nProcess Consultation (PC) is an organization development strategy that aims at building relationships. It supports clients by increasing awareness and understanding to empower them to apply skills to improve their performance (Cummings & Worley, 2009). PC ensures that the people receiving the help own their weaknesses or problems, gain knowledge, skills, and expertise to diagnose them, and then solve their issues by themselves (Waclawski & Church, 2002). This paper explains how I can use this approach to help a manager to communicate effectively with subordinates. It also discusses the potential obstacles that I might face while helping the manager.\n\nHow I would use a process consultation approach to help a manager with problems communicating effectively with her subordinates?\n\nFirst, I will inform the manager that, even though great speakers are born, most of them learn to communicate well on the job. Therefore, she should not feel shame about consulting professionals. Communication is a core competency for employers or managers and hence the need for her to acknowledge the idea (Gupta & Chin, 1994). I will convince the manager to develop those skills because this can help her to communicate effectively.\n\nThe manager should create a culture that enhances the cooperation of employees and effective communication (Adair, 2009). Using process consultation, I will advise the manager to spare at least 15 minutes with the employees daily, and share with them about their social lives. The manager should help them to understand the goals of the company. She should be approachable. This is a good start in communication. In this case, with the knowledge of the business and understanding their manager, she cannot have problems communicating with them. The manager can organize to meet with them in groups or one-on-one. Employees feel good when they are updated about any changes or plans of the company.\n\nI will help the manager to ensure that her message is heard to avoid communication problems with employees. I will inform her that the way she communicates is as important. In this case, the message of her communication will provide the way forward. Therefore, to communicate, she should evaluate her abilities, sharpen her message, and recognize the good work that employees do. She should also prepare for meetings, understand the unspoken signals, and do a follow-up among other strategies.\n\nShe should not be bossy to her employees to the extent that she makes decisions that are against the will of the employees. She should also listen to them and show by gestures such as nodding, eye to eye contact, or even say that she agrees with what they say. I will advise the manager to allow them to suggest any changes necessary because she cannot be perfect in everything. It is wise for her to take personal assessments to know her weaknesses and strengths. Thus, she should meet with them and develop strategies to improve the performance of the organization together.\n\nWhile communicating to her employees, she can sharpen her message by keeping it short and sharp. When the meeting is long, she can keep the employees engaged with compelling moments. I will also inform the manager that, if her messages are always negative, employees may have a bad attitude towards her, and hence the need of complimenting them for the good work done.\n\nThe manager should prepare herself for meetings. She should plan what she is to say, and how she will say it. I will encourage her to understand the unspoken signals. This can be achieved by meeting some of the employees and inquiring about the wrong things she might have said during the meeting. Every message needs reinforcement, and she should do a follow-up by using a note or memo to examine whether the message was understood.\n\nI will also advise the manager to adopt programs that are designed to improve the process of exchanging information. The computer alternatives, such as the email accounts, can save the manager from hearing excuses about how the messages have not been received. She can distribute her messages electronically using different channels. This will help save time by avoiding employees coming to her office for clarifications regularly. All these aspects can improve her communication with employees and hence can solve her problems by herself without difficulties.\n\nThe potential obstacles that I might face while helping the manager to assist her help herself\n\nThere are several potential obstacles that I might face while helping the manager to achieve the goals of process consultation. First, I may lack an understanding of the workplace environment. This can make her employ skills and knowledge that do not fit the workplace. The second obstacle is that the manager may lack the time for consultation (Gupta & Chin, 1994). This can affect her learning process and hence she will continue experiencing the same communication problems. Another obstacle may be the attitudinal problems of the manager. If the manager gets bored or lacks the interest in seeking a process consultant, then her problems cannot be solved.\n\nConclusion\n\nProcess consultant supports clients to help themselves. This is achieved by increasing their awareness and understanding. They learn skills and knowledge from consultants and then apply them in their organizations by themselves. There are many ways of helping a manager to develop skills of communication. Applying these skills in the workplace can help managers avoid communication problems with their employees. However, there are challenges one can face while offering process consultation. These may include attitudinal problems of managers, lack of time, and lack of understanding of the workplace.\n\nReferences\n\nAdair, J. E. (2009).

      "Information Technology and Security Essay\n\nPhysical security is a complex of tools and methods that are used to guarantee the safety of particular facilities that contain confidential information (Forte & Power, 2007). Technical security is a range of activities that are focused on the safety of modern technologies with a use of such methods and encryption, authentication, and others (Azuwa, 2015). Data redundancy is the availability of confidential information at more than one place at a time (Huang, Chen, Lin, You, & Peng, 2015).\n\nIt is imperative to consider the fact that it is quite important in case an emergency happens. However, it should be minimized most of the time because it dramatically increased the risks, and it should be addressed. Overall, physical security is the most important and should be focused on because it is not possible for third parties to try and hack data if they are not able to get access to it in the first place, and it is hard to argue with importance of such measures. Currently, some laws are focused on the privacy of health care information and are regulated by The Office for Civil Rights (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2015).\n\nIt needs to be said that they are quite reasonable because there is a possibility that it can be used for a range of criminal activities. It is also paramount to make sure that such information stays confidential because it may cause issues in personal life. However, it needs to be said that current system is in need of improvement because data is not as secure as it should be, and it is evident that numerous issues are present.\n\nIdentifiable patient information is a kind of data that can be used to locate an individual (U.S. Department of Health & Human Services, 2015). It should be said that health care institutions are mostly in compliance with the rules. However, some issues are present. Private practices are especially hard to regulate, and this fact should be considered. It is interesting that there may have been numerous instances of information disclosure, and most patients do not know about it. Also, it is imperative that various scientists pay attention to current issues and try to develop tools and methods that would help to resolve such problems (Prada et al., 2011).\n\nIt is especially dangerous if criminals are able to access such information because it can be used in various ways. The government makes sure that such instances are limited. However, it needs to be said that it is still possible, and the information is not as confidential as one may expect. New technologies make it easier to protect data, but there numerous complications may occur. Also, attorneys may have access to the information about the patients if they make a request, and there is a severe responsibility for the disclosure (Miller & Schlatter, 2011).\n\nOverall, it is necessary to collect and process such data but the fact that it may lead to some consequences should be addressed. It is especially problematic because the breach of information may cause numerous problems, and the safety of citizens may be in danger. There is a need of for improvement of the system, but the effectiveness of some methods is still being researched, and it may not be an easy task to implement such systems.\n\nReferences\n\nAzuwa, M.

      "Linguistics of Sports Articles: Scholarly or Not? Report (Assessment)\n\n“Causes and Consequences of Sports Concussion” by Edwards and Bodle\n\nThis article is a scholarly one. There are several reasons for making this statement. First of all, the authors are experts in the area of the given research, as there are author affiliations found on the first page of the paper. They include short biographies of authors, their credentials, and affiliations with influential research institutions, thus pointing to their expertise. That said, both authors are MDs. While Edwards is a professor at the Medical University of South Carolina, Bodle is a neurohospitalist at Carolinas Medical Center.\n\nEven though there is no abstract included, the format of the paper meets the requirements of scholarly articles because the paper is well organized, the language is clear and short, and no pictures, bright photos, or advertisements are included. When reading the article, it is evident that the authors have a professional background in the area of investigation as they include specific vocabulary and point to the practical applicability of the represented materials. Some examples of specialized terms are abrupt neuronal depolarization, ionic shifts, post-concussive syndrome, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, gross anatomic changes, etc.\n\nIn addition, all citations are accurately mentioned, and a reference list is included so that a reader might verify them or consult other sources of information for more details if necessary. The purpose of this article is to discuss the causes and consequences of concussions and to inform other scholars of the severity of the problem. Even though no original research was conducted, this paper is still a scholarly one because of the focused specialization of the authors and clinical applicability of the findings. Finally, it is published in a peer-reviewed journal (Journal of Law, Medicine, and Ethics), and that is one more argument for believing that it is a scholarly article.\n\n“‘It Didn’t Cross My Mind That I Wouldn’t See Him Come Off That Field’ (Cover Story)” by Gregory\n\nThis article is a non-scholarly one. This statement can be justified by some evident arguments. First of all, there are no author’s credentials mentioned. A reader can find only a few details about the author: his name mentioned on the first page and his affiliation with Time magazine found from the context. Furthermore, the article includes numerous photos, such as the pictures of a football field, Chad’s jacket, his room, and a family portrait.\n\nEven though there are some pictures explaining brain traumas and representing statistics of traumatic brain injuries, they cannot be considered scholarly materials. Also, there is no abstract or summary, and the writing style is non-academic. Instead, it is a narration of Chad Stover’s life and sports achievements. Moreover, the language is simple, and no specialized terms are mentioned. Instead, the focus is made on appealing to readers’ emotions.\n\nThe purpose of this article is to share the story of Chad Stover, who died because of a brain injury obtained during a game. It is written to draw attention to this problem and avoid similar incidents in the future by decreasing the rates of deaths caused by traumatic brain injuries. Another argument for calling it a non-scholarly article is a fact that even though there are some citations in the texts, no footnotes or bibliography are included. So if a reader wants to verify the information or find more details, they will have to conduct additional research and locate the mentioned sources themselves. Finally, because the article is published in Time magazine, it cannot be considered a scholarly one because it is a periodical, not a peer-reviewed journal.\n",
      "School Counselor Job for People With Disabilities Essay\n\nSchool Counseling and Diabetes\n\nThe consumer completed a self-administered assessment including the O*Net Profiler. The results of the test indicate that artistic, social, and enterprising interests are the most prominent. If to choose an occupation based on these interests, school counseling is the profession that seems the most fitting. School counseling requires a professional to be proactive, imaginative, and socially adaptive. Nevertheless, if a professional has a health issue such as diabetes, his or her operations can be severely limited. According to the Office of Disability Employment Policy (2013), diabetes is a disease in which the levels of glucose in blood are above normal; this can cause further complications such as heart disease or kidney failure. Among the ways in which diabetes could limit a school counselor’s practice, fatigue, weakness, nerve damage, vision impairment, and cognitive limitations are the most challenging. Moreover, the need for regular insulin injections can severely limit the counselor’s practice due to the lack of time during work hours to dedicate to one’s health.\n\nNevertheless, there are some accommodations that could help a school counselor with diabetes overcome the fundamental challenges. Allowing frequent rests and eliminating strenuous activities are effective accommodations that will enable a school counselor with diabetes to have more time for taking medicine, relaxing after stressful interactions, and developing a steady routine that will facilitate active practice instead of limiting it. Since cognitive limitation can go hand-in-hand with diabetes, it can be beneficial to provide flexible work hours and incorporate more planning activities that could help a school counselor to structure his or her practice and have more control over the work situation.\n\nStroke and School Counseling\n\nCardiovascular incident (stroke) is the third most common cause of death in the US. Among the warning signs of stroke, sudden numbness in the face, arm, or leg (especially on one side of the body), mental confusion, difficulty seeing, balance and walking difficulties are identified as the most prominent (Job Accommodation Network, 2010). A school counselor that faces the risk of having a cardiovascular incident is challenged by the possible implications of the disease that could have an adverse impact on the overall practice and well being. For example, the post-stoke patient can have a paralysis of some side of the body, experience pain and numbness, be more prone to fatigue, and experience overall weakness. Therefore, the practice of a school counselor post-stoke can be nearly impossible without the incorporation of appropriate accommodations.\n\nThe accommodations that can fit into the practice of post-stroke (or at risk) school counselor include specialized equipment (mobility products, aids for eating, communication aids, etc.), typing and writing accommodations such as tutorials, sitting accommodations such as ergonomic chairs, and much more. Any accommodations targeted at making the daily processes associated with the counseling practice easier can significantly lift the burden of heart-related disabilities should be integrated into the workplace. It is important to mention that a school counselor experiences a lot of stress during the daily interactions with troubling students, so there is a need in addressing the high levels of tension and fatigue to accommodate for the difficulties a professional may experience. Overall, any disease can limit a professional’s daily activities in the workplace, so employers should pay attention to job accommodation and provide employees with the available resources for enhancing their practice.\n\nReferences\n\nJob Accommodation Network.

      "“The Development of Mental-Physical Comorbidity” by Scott Essay (Article)\n\nThe given article, titled “The Development of Mental-Physical Comorbidity,” is written by Kate M. Scott. This article was included in one of the publications of Cambridge University Press, titled “Global Perspectives on Mental-Physical Comorbidity in the WHO World Mental Health Surveys” in the year 2009. As is evident from the title, the author tries to establish the reasons for the co-occurrence of mental and physical disorders.\n\nTalking about the ‘antecedent model,’ the author suggests that mental and physical disorders act as risk factors for each other. But mental disorders are more likely to occur due to physical disorders rather than the other way round. Referring to the ‘consequence model,’ the author suggests that diseases like brain disorders and asthma can give rise to depression. So, it might be understood that mental disorders are a consequence of physical disorders.\n\nBut this does not undermine the role of mental disorders; as catalysts for physical disorders. The author illustrates the cases of obesity and smoking and suggests that a person can become obese or resort to smoking as a result of his/her prevailing mental stress. But the fact remains that such situations can be ‘bidirectional’ as well. This means, for example, that an obese person can be prone to mental stress as well; so, it works both ways.\n\nThe author also relates the ‘latency effects’ to mental disorders among some people. The author attributes various reasons to the mental and physical disorders that some people experience. In instances where pregnant mothers have poor nutrition and stress, the newborns are prone to physical disorders that might result in mental disorders at a later stage.\n\nIn addition to the ‘latency effects,’ the prevailing environment and circumstances during childhood also act as key factors in shaping the mental condition at later stages of life. Factors such as the ‘socio-economic circumstances,’ also referred to as ‘pathways,’ have a great influence on the future life of children. This and various other factors, when combined, act as a cumulative disadvantage at various stages of life. The author further suggests that the ‘allostatic load’ refers to the combined effect of the latency effects and the pathways on a person’s life.\n\nPersonal Reflection\n\nThe childhood environment has a great impact on the lives and performance of children. The most important among the childhood environments is probably the family situation. Children, who are part of families where there are continuous brawls, are expected to have mental stress during their adulthood. Children from financially unsound families are also prone to unsound future. Education plays a crucial role in shaping a child’s future.\n\nHaving appropriate education facilitates better prospects, but children who are unable to acquire proper education (due to various reasons) might end up accepting small-time jobs, and such circumstances might result in mental stress. It is quite possible that when the ambitions of a person are not achieved, he/she may come under depression.\n\nConsidering the mental and physical comorbidity, it is understood that both disorders have a direct impact on each other. Physical disorders such as disabilities are a reason for mental stress and depression. Most physically disabled people are not able to compete with normal people in physical activities, and as such, they are ought to have an inferiority complex, which ultimately results in hypertension. The reverse effect (mental to physical) is evident in cases where people having stress and depression (due to various reasons) might harm themselves physically or develop diseases such as obesity or become addict to smoking (that ultimately results in health problems).\n",
      "A Source of Motivation, and Motivational Theories Essay\n\nA source of motivation is a vital prerequisite for achieving dreams and visions of an individual. It is a valuable thing to take time and understand the character of the motivator. This can only be achieved through shedding light on the issue of motivation and how it relates to the motivational theories.\n\nMy uncle, a firstborn in a family of three, has been the source of my motivation. He is a man who is focused on achieving his goals regardless of the hustle and the time taken to reach his real actualization. About Maslow’s theory of the hierarchy of needs, he settles for nothing less but tangible results. During his early schooling period, he managed to secure himself a part-time job that not only financed most of his studies but also provided for some of his greater needs.\n\nAt the time of getting a part-time job, his parents could not afford to cater to the academic necessities of all his siblings, which profoundly motivated him to work extra hard to fill the missing gaps. To his benefit, his undying spirit has enabled him to establish a prosperous security firm that is among the best in the current economy.\n\nDuring his tenure at his first job, he was concerned with the improvement of service delivery to his dear clients, regarding the needs of customers to be paramount in urgency to any of the other matters. Thus, with regards to Herzberg’s theory of motivation, better working conditions and exemplary interpersonal relations had to be established. Believing in spearheading the revolution of seeing the company grow to a giant, he was tasked with the responsibility of making its dreams become realized in the shortest time possible. With his past achievements and increased responsibilities, he tactfully enacted a policy that not only increased the company’s sales but also its customers.\n\nThe need for job independence and the pursuit of passion, which is direct to expectancy theory of motivation, was one of the pillars towards the creation of the security firm in which he currently holds the position of Chief Executive Officer. The amount of effort he had been inputting in the realization of his goals required a satisfactory level of performance. Regardless of whether the choices he had taken were realistic, achievable, or not, he aimed at being the best by getting the approval of the people and working towards nothing less than achieving the vision of the firm.\n\nAccording to Porters and Lawler’s models, his achievements, passion, and the rewards that awaited him superseded the losses and the embarrassment he was to get if his firm failed. Motivated by realistic goals and moved by job independence, he was always focused on achieving the firm’s goals. Thus by him and his staff putting the correct amount of effort in the daily service delivery to clients, and also conducting surveys on the acceptability of the firm in society, they built a strong pillar towards the achievement of his dreams as an individual.\n\nIn a greater sense majorly focusing on my uncle’s achievements about the motivational theories, which were and are still realistic, I will always find him to be the spring of all my motivation. Regarding him as a mentor, and I as the protégé, my success in life will always be coined around his hard work.\n",
      "Championing Academic Integrity in Community Colleges Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Body\n 3. Conclusion\n 4. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nI believe that academic integrity is one of the most important virtues that institutions of higher learning should practice. It is a requirement for institutions that are committed to truth and intellectualism. Academic integrity is defined as being responsible and honest when doing scholarly work (Umuc 4). I believe that students and academicians in general should adhere to rules of honesty in their scholarly work which implies that their scholarly work must be original.\n\nAny contribution that comes from another source other than the efforts of a student should be acknowledged in the right manner. Institutions of higher learning are important in provision of knowledge and skills hence there must be policies that guide academic integrity. I believe that academic integrity is enhanced by high quality measures that enable students to learn in a challenging environment.\n\nBody\n\nSocieties rely on trust for their continuation and as their level of complexity increases, more trust becomes essential. For instance, when patients go to the hospital for treatment, they are not aware of the academic backgrounds of the doctors since they were not with them in their medical schools. The patients were not there to witness when the doctors were learning surgery and other medical procedures.\n\nWhat they do is only to trust that the doctors are well trained and equipped with the right knowledge to help them recover from their illnesses. They trust that the medical schools the doctors attended had policies that ensured that the students maintained academic integrity in their studies. I believe that this is a good example of how important academic integrity is in building trust in human societies. If there is no academic integrity, the patients would not trust the doctors to restore their health.\n\nI believe that academic integrity can be promoted and facilitated in institutions of higher learning. In these institutions, it is important to build trust by encouraging students to earn it rather than waiting for it to given to them. I believe that students should be well informed of what is required of them and the risks they face if they lack academic integrity. I believe that academic integrity is very important and should be encouraged because lack of it may lead to undesirable results.\n\nThere are various academic issues that are perceived as lack of academic integrity. One of the academic issues perceived as lack of academic integrity is plagiarism. Plagiarism means copying the ideas and information of another person without properly acknowledging the source. I believe that plagiarism is a serious academic offence since it may lead to severe penalties.\n\nThe first penalty that may arise from plagiarism is expulsion from the learning institution. Students who are accused of plagiarism are exposed to the risk of being expelled from the learning institutions (York University 5). I believe that expulsion is a severe punishment arising from lack of academic integrity and learners should avoid it at all cost. Professors may also be involved in plagiarism by cutting and pasting information from other people without acknowledging its source properly. This may cause the professors to lose their jobs. I believe that plagiarism should be discouraged because it is also a source of ethical humiliation. Individuals who are caught having stolen ideas and information are viewed as dishonest by the society and this is very humiliating (Bleeker 80).\n\nConclusion\n\nI believe that academic integrity is an important aspect that should be exercised by institutions of higher learning. Students and all those involved in academics should be informed of the importance of academic integrity in building trust. I believe that learners should be honest and responsible for their scholarly work because they are expected to exercise what they learned after school. If there is lack of academic integrity which involves incidents such as plagiarism, the implication is that the competence of intellectuals produced by institutions of higher learning will be questionable.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBleeker, Karen.

      "Consumerism in the 1960s in “A&;P“ by John Updike Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nJohn Updike touched on a very important issue in his short story “A&P.” The story was written in 1961 when the American economy was booming, and the consumerist society was in its blossom. The author uses a very conspicuous setting, an average store, for his story. He also shows the way people responded to the opportunities and challenges of the new times. Updike depicts different generations to show the way new trends affected people. It is possible to trace different attitudes towards consumerism when observing the reactions of Sammy, Queenie, Lengel, and Stokesie.\n\nConsumerism in the 1960s\n\nIn the 1960s, the USA was living through significant economic development. The war, as well as international treaties after WWII, enabled the US economy to boom. Americans did not want to think about wars or the horrors of economic constraints of the 1930s. They focused on the abundance of products and associated advertising. Americans enjoyed a wide range of products they could buy at affordable prices.\n\nUpdike reveals this trend by depicting the store with its arrays of products. The author stresses that everything could be found in a small American store, as there were plenty of “the cat-and-dog-food-breakfast-cereal-macaroni-rice-raisins-seasonings-spreads-spaghetti-soft-drinks-crackers-and-cookies” aisles (Updike 94). It is also important to note that the products were not the focus of the people around even though they were shopping. At least, the author does not give any reactions to the shoppers concerning the goods. It seems people simply choose the necessary products, but it is also clear that they take this abundance for granted. They do not think that availability of products may have any negative effect on them. Nonetheless, it did have a negative impact on people, as they became slaves of the system.\n\nRebel Against the System\n\nRebel of Girls Who Are a Part of the Consumerist Society\n\nAs has been mentioned above, different people or rather generations responded differently to conventions of the new time. Thus, Lengel is representative of the older generation. Sammy thinks he is a prisoner of the system as he is concerned with authority, rules, and sales. However, Lengel appears to be the least dependent on the abundance of products, as he simply manages a store, and sales are salary for him. He is rather a part of the system, one of those who are its guards. He is ready to protect some rules created by society and makes girls ashamed of their looks. The way he acts at the counter suggests that he likes the system, as he feels comfortable. Stokesie is also the one who supports the system, and he is glad to be its part.\n\nThere are also rebels, of course. The girls seem to rebel against the system and conventions of the society, as they dare come into the store in their swimsuits. Their appearance is shocking as they are young, attractive and they are in the city center where all respectable people go shopping. However, this rebel is quite artificial. Girls (especially Queenie) are deceiving themselves. For instance, Queenie seems to be ignorant of the existence of the rest of the world, paying no attention to the shoppers. However, in reality, she follows people’s reactions, and she acknowledges the power she has over men. She loves this power, and it is clear that she is also a part of the system. It is clear that she feels comfortable among aisles, and she prefers buying certain products for some occasions.\n\nThe author may use the girl as a personification of advertising as the girl shows off her body as she wants to ‘sell’ her looks as expensive as possible. The price is astonished glances of men and their fascination with her. Men buy that and are ready to show their fascination. More so, Sammy is ready to do unreasonable things in order to impress the girl and buy a bit of her attention. Likewise, advertisers show off the best features of the product to sell them at the best price. Hence, it is possible to note that Queenie is not simply a part of the system, she is a symbolic representation of its features (such as advertising, showing off, seducing, selling, buying).\n\nRebel of Sammy Who is at the Crossroads\n\nNonetheless, one of the biggest surprises is the narrator, Sammy. He seems to be the greatest rebel as he mocks at the aisles of products. He thinks it is quite ridiculous to strive for a career within the system. He thinks that the manager is too strict and does not understand what freedom really is. He thinks that the girls are rebels of the system as they dare break some conventions. He also stands up to the manager and tries to seem a hero for the girls. These facts suggest that he is a real rebel against the system of consumerism. However, he is one of the brightest representatives of the consumerist society. One episode proves that. Sammy imagines the life of the girl when he sees the product she is buying. Hence, he judges the girl and her family by herring she buys. Clearly, products play an important role for him. He does not think they are simply used to satisfy basic needs, but he thinks that certain products reveal people’s status, habits, and so on. Sammy is one of the most conspicuous slaves of the system.\n\nAt the end of the story, he quits his job. He leaves the store and covertly hopes girls are there to applaud and call him a hero. However, he is alone in the street with the store behind him. The author gives him a chance to get out of the system and to focus on really meaningful things. Sammy finds himself at the crossroads. Nevertheless, he is likely to remain a prisoner of the system as he felt “how hard the world was going to be… hereafter” (Updike 97). He does not see any options, and his future is rather obscure and sad.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn balance, it is possible to note that Updike unveiled some of the wrongs of the consumerist society. The author showed that people were starting to take an abundance of goods for granted, and they started judging people buy things they had or bought. Interestingly, contemporary society is highly consumerist, and the trends that were only developing in the 1960s are now in their bloom. Many people have become obsessed with products and pay less attention to really meaningful things. Younger generations should read the story and speculate on it to be aware of the hazards of the consumerist society. Young people will learn that, first, everything seems a harmless desire to meet one’s needs, and within a second, people see nothing but products and feel nothing but the desire to buy and consume more.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nUpdike, John. “A&P.” Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing .

      "“It Doesn’t Have to Be PowerPoint” by Tim Macer Essay (Article)\n\nArticle Summary\n\nThis article is an analysis of the usefulness of PowerPoint presentations to today’s research. The author of the article is a senior research fellow at Southampton University. The article begins by noting the current close connection between research presentations and PowerPoint. The article also reflects on how things used to be done before the advent of PowerPoint. Before Microsoft introduced PowerPoint, the process of making presentations was tedious and time-consuming. Therefore, the article notes that no one is nostalgic about the past way of making presentations. According to the article, PowerPoint has been the presentation tool of choice since its introduction two decades ago (Macer, 2010). This is according to recent statistics that indicate that PowerPoint is used in more than fifty percent of all presentations done by research companies today.\n\nIt is noted that this number is even higher in larger companies. The article continues by noting some drawbacks that are associated with the use of PowerPoint. The first of these is that PowerPoint tends to prioritize some information. Another example is that this tool is likely to dilute the meaning of certain data. The author of this article also notes that PowerPoint is no longer just a presentation tool. It is also a means of storing data. The problem with market researchers using Powerpoint as a tool of data publishing is also noted. The article then lists viable alternatives to PowerPoint. These alternatives include a list of six software programs and their uses in research presentations. Examples of these tools include Info Tools, Dapresy Pro, Q, and Gapminder. The article concludes by stating that the assumption that PowerPoint is the only research tool out there has to be challenged. This is because there are various other tools that can perform the tasks of PowerPoint even better.\n\nReflective Summary\n\nThe author of this article addresses a very important subject matter. This is because, as noted in the article, the world of market research is synonymous with PowerPoint (Macer, 2010). Currently, it is widely believed that a research presentation is never complete without a PowerPoint presentation. However, the author seems to discredit the effectiveness of PowerPoint on account of its popularity. The argument forwarded on why researchers should consider switching to another tool is somehow unsatisfactory. This is in spite of the fact that this is a well-informed and researched argument.\n\nThe reason why this article failed to convince me of the ineptitudes of PowerPoint is that the author failed to address the reasons why PowerPoint is so popular. The article only seems to try to convince researchers to explore other options. One of the reasons why PowerPoint is so popular is because it is simple to use. This article touts the migration from simple tools to complex ones. Not many researchers would be convinced to do so. Most of them agree that “if it is not broken, do not fix it.”\n\nThis article can be of help to my future research. This is because the author discusses software programs that seem very helpful. The article specifically mentions Dapresy Pro, a software program that makes it possible to make multi-user presentations (Macer, 2010). This is usually a challenge when using PowerPoint. The possibility of such a presentation is enough motivation to make me try this tool.\n\nAlthough this article did not convince me to migrate from PowerPoint, I would recommend it to fellow researchers. The author inputs some very important information on software programs that can be an alternative to PowerPoint. Most of these are hitherto unknown to researchers today.\n\nReference\n\nMacer, T.

      "Jay Cohen’s Gambling Company and American Laws Case Study\n\nWas Jay Cohen’s conviction justified?\n\nEven though a huge chunk of humankind shares sheer disapproval of gambling, no matter in what form the latter comes, no one can actually help feeling slight ambiguity concerning the notorious Jay Cohen’s case. According to what the existing records say, Jay Cohen was accused of managing a gambling company in Antigua and Barbuda by the government of the United States according to the U.S. laws on gambling. Disregarding the controversy concerning the harmful effects of gambling, one might want to ask the question concerning whether the USA had the right to question the policies of other states, even on such a dubious issue as gambling.\n\nTherefore, Jay Cohen’s fault should be considered on the merits of its harmful effect on gamblers. From the given point of view, Cohen must be found guilty. Even taking the Antigua and Barbuda law on gambling, since the game was being held online, it should be regarded as an international event, in which case it must be in line with all existing laws on gambling. That being said, Cohen’s crime is obvious.\n\nDo you concur with the dispute settlement decisions in the World Trade Organization in this case? The panel report? The appellate decision? The arbitration ruling?\n\nI believe that in the case in point, the settlement decisions in the WTO seem excessively liberationist. While it is necessary to admit some freedom to private entrepreneurship, introducing ethics to their business practices is crucial as well. The Panel Report seems to fall into another extreme by supporting any initiative of private enterprises, which does not seem right either. The appellate decision concerning the USA government’s infringement of entrepreneurs’ rights seems legit in the given case, which, together with the arbitration’s ruling, made Cohen a victim of overly strict laws. The given outcome seems wrong, however. It is important to give freedom to private companies, yet it is essential to make sure that they do not abuse the freedoms.\n\nShould Antigua And Barbuda have the right to retaliate against the United States by exporting copyrighted entertainment material? Is that a bad precedent?\n\nThe issue in question is, doubtlessly, a bad precedent, since no crime should be answered by another crime.\n\nShould the United States have abrogated its commitment to gambling services under the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)? Did it have better alternatives?\n\nIn the given case, abrogating its commitment to gambling services under the GATS would have made the U.S. admit that the policy on allowing gambling must be launched, which would be rather undesirable. The U.S. might have taken much pressure off, yet it would have lost much of its reputation.\n\nHow can the dispute between the United States and Antigua and Barbuda be resolved now?\n\nSince in the given argument, the USA represents a more radical and much harsher point of view on the issue, while Antigua and Barbuda regulators do not see the reasons for concerns about gambling, whether it is online or offline, the two states clearly represent two extremes concerning the gambling issue. At present, there are two possible avenues for the problem in question. The first solution would be to ban gambling as an activity. Another idea that can be used to approach the issue is to search for the compromise, i.e., impose even harsher restrictions on the gambling industry, such as raising the age at which a person can enter a game from the supposed eighteen to full twenty-one, as well as creating a series of PSAs concerning gambling and its effects.\n\nDo you Support the proposed Internet Gambling Regulation, Consumer Protection, and Enforcement Act? Why or why not?\n\nI believe that allowing gambling is a regressive step that can be viewed on par with allowing online pirating. However, since at present, there is no alternative for the provided solution, the Internet Gambling Regulation can be viewed as a temporary solution.\n\nAre current state and federal laws on gambling optimal? Should the nation move in the direction of stricter prohibition? Or should it move to more permissive laws, including those to legalize online gambling?\n\nDesigning the gambling laws, one must take into account the reasons that make people gambling, since blindly prohibiting or allowing gambling will result only in having even more casinos and online sites open, either as a protest or as a result of being allowed statewide. Therefore, it must be admitted that the current laws on gambling leave much to be desired. While it is a wise move to allow gambling, it is still required to control it, making sure that gambling will not sweep the entire nation.\n\nWhile to provide democracy, one must make the laws on gambling more permissive, it is required to spread the word concerning its harmful effects, therefore, stressing that gambling, much like smoking, is a matter of one’s own choice depending on how one view his/her own personal development.\n",
      "Labor Law Case: Clark v. Missouri Proposal\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Undisputed facts\n 2. Analysis of the Plaintiff’s position\n 3. Analysis of the Defendant’s position\n 4. History of the court’s resolution\n 5. Works Cited\n\nUndisputed facts\n\nThe plaintiff, Clark, was employed as a section hand by the defendant, Missouri, Kansas, and Texas Railway Company (M.K &T). He had worked for the defendant in this position for about four years. During this time, he had been called to assist in clearing wreckage and taking care of the property in the carriage on several occasions. He had not been called to bring back Texas steer before. The accident that is the subject of the suit happened in Warren County, near Marthasville. At the time of the accident, the plaintiff was under the control of the defendant. It was on the morning of May 10, 1897. It was around 6 AM, and still dark as the sun had not come up. It was a cold morning and foggy. As a result of the fog, visibility was poor, and it was difficult to see very far (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nThe defendant was in the business of transportation and frequently transported cattle from points in Missouri to other parts of the country. On this morning, the train was transporting a consignment of Texas cattle, of a class known as the Texas Steer. This was not the first time that the defendant was transporting Texas steers, and had done this before on innumerable occasions over the years (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nThere was a wreck involving the defendant’s train, and one of the cars containing the Steers was broken. The steers contained in that car escaped. Some of them did not go very far, they remained near the wreck. However, many of them escaped and ran in different directions, with most of the steers running towards the East. One of the steers was seen running to the West. The plaintiff was one of the gang members of the section gang that had been put in charge of this section of the rail by the defendant. Other members of the section gang were; Otto Housman, who was the gang’s foreman, and George and Jim, who were his two sons (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nMost of the steers were successfully put back into the station without incident, but one of them remained out. This is the steer that had run off to the West. The steer that had run off the West belonged to the class of cattle known as the Texas Steer. The Texas Steer has had a reputation for being vicious and dangerous. They belonged to the class of animals known as ferae naturae. Their viciousness is aggravated by excitement, injury, or an attack, and in this state, they became more dangerous and vicious than usual. These facts were common knowledge, and people often talked about the Texas Steer in these terms (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nThe train’s conductor went to Otto Housman’s house and woke him up. He told him about the steer and that he should be careful, so they don’t hurt him. The section gang was called to assist in bringing back the steers which had escaped and put them back into the defendant’s station. Otto Housman called the plaintiff and his two sons and told them that one of the steers had gone off towards the West. He then ordered them to go after it, and they complied with this order. The plaintiff armed himself with a club about seven feet long and went off after the steer in the company of Jim and George. The three set off on foot, and they followed tracks along the railway. Along the way, they met two German girls and told them about the steer. They did not seem to understand what they were being told, and the plaintiff told them to be careful (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nAfter walking for about two miles, the three-section guards saw the steer grazing in a field that was approximately two yards from the track along which they were walking. The search party went into the field after the steer, and it seemed to act wild. It ran onto the track, and they followed it towards Marthasville. Jim was in front, and George followed him. The last in line was the plaintiff. As they moved along, Jim suddenly shouted a warning that the steer was coming and jumped off the track onto the Northside. Clark heard this shout from Jim and saw him jumping off the track. George also jumped off, but when the plaintiff saw the steer, it was very near him. Its head was tucked down, and it was moving as fast as it could (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nWhen the plaintiff moved to the north, the beast also moved towards that direction. When he moved to the south, it did the same, and he hit it with the club. After hitting the steer, it ran past him towards North, and he ran down the railroad embankment. Its side was so steep that he could not stop himself, and neither could he change his course. He jumped into a muddy pit about seven feet down at the bed of the embankment. He got stuck in the mud, and his knee was injured as a result (Clark V M.K & T).\n\nAnalysis of the Plaintiff’s position\n\nMr. Clark (the Plaintiff) sought to prove that the negligence of the defendant caused his injury and that he took due care that is expected of him as a reasonable human being to avoid the injury. The success or failure of the plaintiff’s rested on proof of whether the defendant knew that the Texas steer was vicious and failed to warn him of that danger.\n\nThe position of the law is that if the defendant knew the Texas steer was a class of dangerous and vicious animals and failed to warn the plaintiff, then it is liable in negligence for the defendant’s injuries. However, this liability is also hinged on the ignorance of the plaintiff about this fact. Mr. Clark should not have knowledge of the steers’ viciousness, for this would remove the requirement on the defendant to issue a warning to him.\n\nTo prove the defendant’s knowledge about the nature of the Texas steers, the plaintiff drew on its experience in transporting the animals and also on information that he considered to be common knowledge. This piece of information was extracted from the defendant’s abandoned answer. The claim that the viciousness of the Texas steer was common= knowledge imputed knowledge of the same on the plaintiff. Proof of knowledge by the plaintiff about this would prevent him from succeeding against the defendant. He, therefore, sought to use only parts of the defendant’s answer that suited him and denied that he had ever heard of the nature of Texas steer before. Another strategy used to avoid this difficulty was to separate the steer that attacked him from the rest of the steers of the same class. The plaintiff pleaded that the defendant had knowledge about this specific steer, and he did not.\n\nSeparating the steer from the rest implied that this particular steer was different, and therefore, even if it was proved that he had knowledge about Texas steers generally, he did not know about the one that attacked him. This contention was based on the fact that the other steers had been peaceful, and only this one had behaved wildly when approached. The defendant, therefore, should have warned him about the danger involved in going after this steer. To prove that he received no warning, Clark denied hearing the foreman’s warning to be careful. He also denied warning the German girls about the nature of the steer in the fields. The plaintiff agreed that he heard Jim’s warning but denied being warned by George.\n\nThe principle of assumption of risk acted against the plaintiff. It states that if one knows of the risk involved in certain types of work but, nevertheless, takes it up, he should not recover if that risk causes injury to him. Clark’s case was faced with many difficulties. First, if he conceded that rounding up steers was part of his duties as a section hand, then the law presumes that he took the risk associated with it upon himself. To overcome this, Clark’s attorneys pleaded that this was not one of his tasks as a section hand. They argued that this was out of the ordinary and involved extra risks, which the employer should have warned him about.\n\nThe problem with this argument is that if the task that Clark performed was proved not to be part of his duties as a section guard, then the law prevented him from succeeding against his employer. If the order given to him by the foreman was something that he did not have the authority to give, then Clark cannot claim the defendant was responsible for his injuries. The only way Clark could succeed was by showing that though this was part of his job, the risk involved was not ordinary to the tasks he was ordered to perform. This danger was also unknown to him, but it was known to the defendant. In addition to this, the defendant, with this knowledge, negligently and carelessly sent him to undertake the dangerous task. This, he tried to do by separating the steer that attacked him from the others. He sought to prove that this particular steer was more wild and vicious than the others and that it posed an extraordinary danger to him.\n\nIn addition to the above, if the said warnings were actually given, they could not have changed anything. These warnings did not prepare Clark adequately for the danger that lay ahead of him. It was still dark and foggy. This made it difficult for Clark to see the approaching beast, and he did not have enough time to jump off the track before it reached him. The warnings did not allow him to prepare for the muddy pit into which he fell and injured his knee.\n\nAnalysis of the Defendant’s position\n\nThe defendant, in its case, tried to prove the absence of negligence on its part. It also sought to show that the plaintiff assumed a risk known to him and that his conduct contributed to the injury. To prove that it was not negligent in its conduct, the defendant brought evidence to show that it warned the plaintiff about the danger involved in pursuing the steer that had runoff. The foreman told the three men to be careful as they went after the steer. Whether they heard this warning or not was in contention. The plaintiff also received warnings from Jim, and George is also reported to have repeated this warning.\n\nThese contentions show that the defendant knew of the risk involved, but they also show that Clark received warnings of the danger before he encountered it. These should have enabled him to know that the steer was likely to charge if approached. If the defendant shows that the plaintiff knew of the risk that he voluntarily assumed it, then the law discharged it from the alleged liability for the plaintiff’s injuries.\n\nThe law does not allow a litigant to use parts of his adversary’s statement that benefit him and leave those that are prejudicial to him. The law demands everything to be considered as a whole. Against this backdrop, the defendant argued that if the plaintiff claimed the defendant knew about the viciousness of the steer because that knowledge was common to everyone, then this knowledge must also be imputed on him.\n\nThis argument advanced the position that the plaintiff must have been aware of the dangerous nature of the steers and was, therefore, not allowed to recover from his employer for his injuries. He had taken up the task of going after the steer, well knowing the danger to which he exposed himself. Clark’s knowledge was also exhibited by his conduct. The fact that he carried a club with him and the warnings he issued to the German girls show that he was well aware of the dangerous nature of the beast he was going after. It is strange that the courts below were not persuaded by this evidence.\n\nThe defendant’s argument that the plaintiff contributed to the injury by his conduct is backed by sound evidence. Even though the plaintiff denies having prior knowledge of the nature of the Texas steer, his demeanor in court and actions on that day show that he was lying. He knew that he was going after a dangerous animal, which would turn vicious if provoked. In spite of knowing this, Clark waited until the steer was very close to him and hit it. His companions were closer to the animal than he was and managed to jump off the track, yet he claimed not to have had enough time to do the same. In addition to this, he only jumped off after the animal had run past m=him, and the danger was gone. The acts of the plaintiff were not consistent with those of a reasonable man under the same circumstances. He, therefore, contributed to the injuries he sustained and cannot recover from his employers.\n\nHistory of the court’s resolution\n\nThe court that heard the case as a court of the first instance was the circuit court, which decided in favor of Mr. Clark. The rail company appealed, and the St. Louis Court of Appeal also made a decision in favor of Mr. Clark. It affirmed the decision of the circuit court, but one of the justices opined that the decision contradicted some decisions of the Supreme Court. The Missouri Supreme Court is the highest court in the state (Supreme Court, 1), and the case was certified to it for re-hearing and determination.\n\nAfter re-hearing the case, the Supreme Court overturned the decisions of the courts below and found in favor of the rail company. The court found that the giving or failure to give a warning to the plaintiff would not have affected the outcome in any way. It was Clark’s own conduct that caused the injury and not the defendant’s failure to give a warning. He failed to move away when the steer approached him and only jumped when the danger was gone. It also found that none of the parties had any prior knowledge about the steer that attacked Clark. In consequence, the plaintiff did not have a claim against the railway company. Another finding that the court made was that a carrier of goods is not required to know the nature of the goods that it carries. In this grain, even if the defendant, by the nature and experience of its business, knew the nature of Texas steers, it could not have had knowledge about that one steer that attacked the plaintiff.\n\nThe Supreme Court held that the Supreme Court of Missouri is under a duty to re-hear and make decisions on causes whose jurisdiction arises out of the ordinary process of appeal. The other holding was that all persons have notice of the propensity of dangerous animals to cause harm. Therefore, whoever keeps them is responsible for the damage they cause, without the requirement to expressly prove knowledge of such facts. Proof of scienter is required in the case of domestic animals. The court also held that a person who seeks to rely on an admission by the opposite party must do so in totality and not in parts. It further held that when a person is faced with imminent danger, his/her conduct is not judged as harshly as when such danger was not present.\n\nThe Supreme Court, in my opinion, correctly analyzed the evidence before it and came to the correct findings in accordance with the law. Upon close examination of the plaintiff’s conduct, one can only come to the conclusion that it was contrary to that of a reasonable person faced with the same conditions. He clearly contributed to the injury that he suffered. In addition to this, the defendant transported thousands of steers in its course of duty. It could not reasonably be expected to have intimate knowledge about the nature of each steer that it carried in its freight. For this reason, the court was correct in concluding that neither of the parties had knowledge as to the nature of that particular steer. The law of the day prohibited recovery of the plaintiff under the circumstances, and consequently, the court was correct in rejecting his claims.\n\nWould the Court’s decision prevail today?\n\nThe Law has changed since this case was decided. This decision would, therefore, not hold in modern times. Under the Federal Employers Liability Act (1), contributory negligence does not prevent a claimant from succeeding against the defendant. The percentage of contribution reduces the plaintiff’s claim proportionately. If the case was decided under the Act, Clark would have recovered in proportion to his contribution. He would not have been absolutely barred from recovering. The fellow-servant rule would also not apply under FELA, and even if fellow employees had caused the injury, Clark would still recover damages from his employers.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nClark V Missouri, Kansas & Texas Railway Company (M.K & T), 179 Mo. 66; 77 S.W. 882, 1903.

      "Risk and Internal Data Management Essay\n\nIncident Management\n\nHaving a well-developed incident response capacity is very important for any entity because it enables it to detect a risk at its earliest stages and manage it before it becomes a disaster. According to Virshup, Oppenberg and Coleman (1999), incident response capacity ensures that an organization can effectively respond to emergencies fast enough and with the required efficiency necessary to avert possible negative outcomes. This means that an entity will always be ready to respond to incidents and accidents in a way that would minimize the adverse effects as much as possible.\n\nThe case study about TSF presents one incident that the top management ignored. This firm has been using TSF-ONE in internal data management. It is reported that due to the emerging new trends and the amount of data this firm has to deal with on a regular basis, TSF-ONE has become obsolete. This has slowed data management capacity, sometimes threatening to erode critical data of this organization. The disappearance of TSF’s back-up data due to the insolvency of the service provider is a disaster to this firm. This will cripple its operations unless urgent measures are taken.\n\nBased on the incident and disaster mentioned above, TSF needs to enact a disaster response and communication system that will help in rapid communications of events such as those mentioned above. This system will ensure that the response to the disaster or incident and that communication of the information to the relevant stakeholders is done simultaneously. The stakeholders will be informed that the incident or accident occurred and that relevant agencies are making efforts to respond to the issue. The stakeholders in this case will be the donors, employees, and the focus groups benefiting from the services of this firm.\n\nIn incident management, incident triage plays a very critical role. This assessment tool helps in determining if there is an actual security incident. This eliminates cases where an organization responds to mere threats other than security incidents. It then prioritizes the incidents to enable the organization determine the best ways to respond to multiple incidents in cases where an organization faces multiple threats. Finally, the tool helps the response team to know if there is a need for escalation. This way, the response will be well-calculated, accurate, and fast enough in addressing the issue at hand.\n\nThe excerpt brings out very important aspects about building contingency plans and capacity. According to Jordan and Silcock (2005), it is almost impossible to eliminate risks. The best that an organization can do is to have measures that can help in managing the risks when they occur. This is the message brought out in this excerpt. When an organization is hit by a disruptive event, in some cases this may exceed its capacity to work under normal routine. The ability of such an organization to overcome such disruptions wholly depends on the contingency measures that it has put in place to deal with the problem. The excerpt clearly describes how such contingency plans work. It explains that when the disruption occurs, an organization is able to shift from the normal operational systems to a contingency system as the risk management team works to normalize the affected system. This means that the contingency plan offers an organization a unique capacity to continue with its operations even after its system has been hit by a disruptive event, but using a contingency platform. It also insists on taking advantage of the opportunities presented by such occurrences to be in a better position to manage risks in future.\n\nArgumentative Essay\n\nHaving gone through the lecture notes, it is now clear to me that risk cannot be eliminated in an organizational setting. Firms face different forms of risks almost on a daily basis. Some risks target normal operational systems of an organization. Risks may affect finances of an organization, or even the strategic objectives set by the top management unit. According to Jordan and Silcock (2005), it is not easy to determine the section or systems within an organization that a risk factor will hit next. However, it is possible and very important that one plans for the risks before they occur. In a broad way, Das and Teng (1999) note that risks can be categorized as incidents or disasters. Incidents are disruptive events that cause minor impacts on the normal running of an organization. They are events that can be rectified easily and in many cases the stakeholders involved in daily operations of the organization may not realize they had occurred. These events have minor or sometimes no impact at all on finances of an organization. On the other hand, disasters are events that affect major operations of an organization. Incidents like that may paralyze operations of an organization (Standards Australia 2010). They have the capacity to force an organization out of its operations.\n\nRisk management is something that organizations can no longer ignore. According to Alberts and Dorofee (2004), some firms are using insurance as a strategy of managing risks (Virshup, Oppenberg & Coleman 1999). This is one of the oldest strategies that firms have been using to protect them from such disruptive events. However, it is not possible to insure all the possible risks that an organization may face. For instance, a bank may face a risk of system breakdown, forcing it to stop offering their services to their clients. The bank can insure the loss that may occur due to such incidents, but it may not insure the dissatisfaction of the customers due to such unfortunate occurrences. If fact, Das and Teng (1999) say that excessive insurance reduces the profitability of an organization. This makes it necessary to come up with internal measures that will help in managing risks as they occur in a way that will ensure continuity in the operations. Coming up with an enterprise wide management framework is very critical when developing a risk management plan. This is so because it enables risk management teams to develop a holistic approach on risk management that looks at all the systems and structures within an organization.\n\nIt is important to note that I was absent in the first lectures. This means that I have a lot to catch up with. However, I have learnt much about risk and risk management from the lecture notes. My conceptualisation has changed because I have taken initiatives of reading the relevant articles and books that address this topic. I am interested to find out how to develop risk management plans that can help organizations respond to various forms of risk.\n\nIt is clear that developing a contingency plan is very important when it comes to risk management. I have noted that the use of information technology helps in risk identification, especially in detecting vulnerabilities and threats. This makes it easy to develop risk mitigation plans that can respond to the threats as soon as they occur. From my personal readings, I have noticed that different people have different perspectives of how technology should be used in developing contingency plans and risk response systems. I would like to know the probable approaches that an organization can use the emerging technologies to develop contingency plans taking into account the fact that these technologies may at times be disruptive in nature. A major question that I would want an answer for is how an organization can use an approach that can at times be disruptive to respond to a disruptive situation. In case the emerging technology used becomes disruptive when addressing a disruption within the system, how should an organization react, especially when the affected process or system is of critical importance? In such cases, an organization may not afford to take chances when the stakes are so high because further mistakes made in addressing the current problems may cripple an organization. These are fundamental questions that I was not able to ask due to my absence from the lectures.\n\nLegal and ethical concerns are also very important when it comes to management of information security. I now know that when developing a contingency plan, this is an issue that cannot be ignored. However, I need further knowledge on how this can be incorporated when developing a contingency plan. As Alberts and Dorofee (2004) says, there are incidences where the law is silent on issues relating to security management. It is important that I understand how one is supposed to act in such situations where the existing laws are either contradictory or silent over some issues.\n\nList of References\n\nAlberts, C & Dorofee, A 2004, Managing information security risks: The Octave approach , Addison-Wesley, Boston.\n\nDas, T & Teng, B 1999, Managing Risks in Strategic Alliances, Academy of Management Executives , vol. 13, no. 4, pp. 50-61.\n\nJordan, E & Silcock, L 2005, Beating IT Risks , John Wiley & Sons, Chichester.\n\nVirshup, B, Oppenberg, A & Coleman, M 1999, Strategic Risk Management: Reducing Malpractice Claims through More Effective Patient-Doctor Communication, American Journal of Medical Quality, vol. 14, no. 4, pp. 153-159.\n\nStandards Australia 2010, Business continuity, Managing disruption-related risk: AS/NZS 5050: 2010 , Standards Australia, Sydney.\n",
      "Gaps in Work Schedules and Their Benefits Essay\n\nI like the author’s description of the impact of the Internet in his life. It is truly the end of absence (Harris, 2014). I believe that Harris was talking about the absence of gaps. Before the Internet came to enrich, and at the same time to mess up our lives, there were many gaps. These gaps are not problems or weaknesses. These gaps are like spices that enhances the flavor of life. I remember a quote about the silence or rests in a musical piece. Musicians say that these rests or stops are the things that made music beautiful. The entry of the Internet in our lives creates bittersweet experiences, because people are enjoying the benefits it brings, and lamenting the end of absence.\n\nThe gaps are important in providing rest. It allows us to enjoy the moment. Consider the joy of birthday parties, and consider the delight of spending time with friends. The feeling of happiness that people experience during these special occasions are made possible by the gaps in the schedule. It is a different story when the body is physically present, but the mind dwells on something else. The availability of the Internet through mobile phones allows people to open up the sacred areas of their lives. These sacred areas are off-limits to others. However, the Internet provides easy access to these sacred places. As a result, it allows less sensitive people to impose their needs and desires on us.\n\nIt is impossible to add gaps into time schedules. Even the prudent leader who values the importance of rest and recreation, he finds it hard to sustain this mindset. Gaps in schedules seems to evaporate, even if you make the deliberate effort to disengage from social media and instant messaging tools.\n\nThe absence of gaps forces people to work without rest. The author shares this view when he quotes Dr. Small: “In the short run, these stress hormones boost energy levels and augment memory, but over time they actually impair cognition, lead to depression, and alter the neural circuitry in the brain” (Harris, 2014, p.3). It is difficult to compare the work rate of 21 st century people, and those who did not have access to the Internet. The unnecessary workload piles up, because we do not know how to stop. The additional workload creeps in, because we do not have the ability to comprehend the amount of time that is needed to sustain the deadly habit. According to Harris, “We rationalize the interruptions that our phones and tablets demand – each checking of email or scanning of YouTube is, after all, just a momentary concession” (Harris, 2014, p.7). This is the justification that serves as the currency to indulge people’s desire for greater interconnections. However, there is a price to pay for increasing the efficiency rate, and the ability to speed up the process of doing things.\n\nThe gaps ensures enough time for rest. The gaps also ensures enough time to reflect. Deep learning is the consequence of allowing gaps to develop in our schedules. I wonder if this is the reason why there were so many discoveries before the invention of the Internet. I wonder if this is the root cause, and if it helps explain the proliferation of ideas in the time period before the Digital Age.\n\nIt is not wise to continue on this path, especially if you know the things that awaits those who insist that these sacrifices are momentary concessions. In truth, they are momentary compromises, that promises the same level of consequences. It is prudent to heed the warnings made by doctors regarding the effect of stress. It is a phenomenon that is hard to detect. As a result, people continue to ignore the warning signs. They thought that they can handle the poisonous fruits that comes from an evil tree. It is therefore high time to preach about the impact of the end of absence.\n\nThe possible ill-effects to our bodies is a cause for major concern. However, the crushing blow will come later, when we realize the consequences of our behavior. If it is hard for us to distinguish good from evil, then, one can argue that they will have a harder time in perceiving the difference. Those who are born in the year 2015 will have no recollection of the era before the Internet. They will have no idea that gaps in schedules is a wonderful thing.\n\nTechnological advancements like the Internet are always seen as double-edged swords. On one side it is perceived as a wonderful gift to humanity. However, on the other side, it has the potential to ruin lives. The main reason is the inability to handle the gaps in schedules. Even wise people are having a hard time in creating gaps in their schedules. Great leaders are often unable to deal with the pressure of work. They have no power to say not to other commitments. As a result, there is no time for rest. These momentary concessions will soon become major compromises. It compromises the health of people, and it compromises the health of their relationships. Another important drawback is the inability to find time for greater pursuits.\n\nReference\n\nHarris, M. (2014). The end of absence: Reclaiming what we’ve lost in a world of constant connections .

      "Childhood Obesity and Food Culture in Schools Essay\n\nThe article investigated childhood obesity and its causes, such as unhealthy eating habits. When the article was written, almost a third of the children in the United States were overweight and only one in ten met fruit and vegetable consumption recommendations [1]. At the same time, family farming was facing difficulties due to the unpopularity of the trade, particularly among younger generations.\n\nThe author proposed a farm-to-school food program, wherein the former would supply products to the latter directly, obtaining a market while providing children with healthy food. The children would benefit from additional educational opportunities afforded by regular contact with food producers and potentially further engagement. Besides, the nutrition lessons would be reinforced by the prevalence of healthy options in cafeterias, a scenario that contrasted the typical menu selections at the time [1]. The farmers, on the other hand, would sell more products while obtaining higher profit margins than they would by selling to retailers in bulk.\n\nThere were also potential environmental and economic benefits from savings in fuel, packaging, and refrigeration costs as well as the associated emissions and waste generation. However, organizational difficulties would be a significant detriment to the introduction of such enterprises. Most farm-to-school programs had to be proposed and supervised by a third party such as a nonprofit organization or a parent or community group [1].\n\nWhile the existing programs had displayed a broad variety of traits, the examples gathered by the author led her to suggest a set of general guidelines. These included consulting the food service director, collaborating, starting slowly and expanding, assisting with the search for farmers, organizing the volume and supply, incorporating the program in education, and taking advantage of seasonality [1]. The author concludes that discovering that natural foods taste good would help children to adopt healthy eating habits naturally and pass them on.\n\nReference\n\n 1. Kalb M.

Desired Outcome, Goals, and Objectives: Solution\n 5. Mission, Vision, and Values: Culture and Climate\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nMedical facilities should hire competent practitioners to deliver high-quality services to different patients. Such institutions can be conceptualized as open systems that have throughput, input, output, negative feedback, and cycle of events factors. This paper describes how a given pediatric clinic is unable to meet children’s health needs due to the problem of nursing shortage. This issue is examined and analyzed using Open Systems theory in order to propose appropriate solutions.\n\nDescription of the Selected Unit\n\nThe targeted pediatric clinic’s mission is to offer quality medical services to children aged between one and ten years. The facility has competent managers and practitioners to address the diverse needs of the targeted patients. Its vision is to become a leading provider of superior health care in the region. The current mission to continue meeting the changing demands of every child. The values supporting this institution’s performance include integrity, beneficence, autonomy, and justice (Matthias, 2015). These attributes resonate with the expectations of young children and their parents or guardians.\n\nA positive culture has emerged whereby individuals liaise to deliver positive results. Decisions are made efficiently. Proper leadership is implemented to guide different practitioners and other staff members (MacLean et al., 2014). Unfortunately, the existing climate is unfavorable since many nurses and physicians are overwhelmed by the increasing number of patients. Although the environment is appropriate, issues such as staffing shortage and lack of adequate resources have affected the performance of different teams.\n\nProblem Description\n\nThe current problem is that many practitioners are unable to meet the health needs of different children due to the problem of nursing shortage. This challenge is affecting the institution’s image and performance. The Open Systems model can be used to describe the nature of this predicament. The first aspect of this theory is input (MacLean et al., 2014). This attribute reveals how the clinic’s leaders have failed to implement an effective staffing policy to empower the targeted patients. Additionally, adequate resources are unavailable in the selected facility. The absence of inputs (human resources and equipment) has led to this predicament. Due to these gaps, the institution is unable to improve its care delivery systems (throughput).\n\nThe absence of skilled practitioners and resources has resulted in poor patients’ outcomes (output). Consequently, the institution has not achieved its organizational goals. In terms of revenues, the facility has been performing poorly (MacLean et al., 2014). Additionally, it has been unable to attain specific recognitions such as the magnet status (cycle of events). Its image in the region has also been affected (negative feedback).\n\nDesired Outcome, Goals, and Objectives: Solution\n\nSeveral goals and objectives must be considered to deal with this challenge. The main goal is to transform the operations and processes in this clinic in order to meet the diverse needs of different people. The intended strategic focus will ensure that the right strategies and incentives are put in place to deliver positive results. The second goal is transforming the existing culture using superior approaches such as teamwork (Pyone, Smith, & van den Broek, 2017). The main objective is to ensure that the facility attains the “magnet status” recognition within two years. This aspect will act as a benchmark for introducing superior ideas that can address existing predicaments and eventually improve performance.\n\nThe problem affecting the targeted clinic can be addressed using an evidence-based approach. The leaders should identify the current needs and hire more practitioners to deliver high-quality services. They should go further to acquire the right resources and equipment to empower their nurses. The targeted workers must be skilled and conversant with emerging health needs in pediatrics. Practices such as teamwork, empowerment, and communication will be introduced (MacLean et al., 2014). Practitioners can also be encouraged to form multidisciplinary teams in order to offer high-quality services.\n\nAttributes such as integrity, code of ethics, and leadership should be embraced in this clinic. The strategy will encourage different workers and nurses to focus on the needs of different children. Emerging technologies and concepts such as “meaningful use” can be introduced to make a significant change in this facility. Adequate resources will empower newly-recruited practitioners and make it easier to deliver desirable medical services. The institution will implement a powerful framework to monitor the effectiveness of different professionals. The major indicators of improved performance will include the number of satisfied customers, complaints raised within a specified period, and revenues (Pyone et al., 2017). The concept of continuous improvement should also be taken into consideration.\n\nAdditionally, the targeted goals and objectives will be translated into policies. For example, the outlined solution will become a part of the institution’s staffing policy. The concept of “meaningful use” will be considered to improve patients’ outcomes (Matthias, 2015). The “magnet status” recognition will be pursued as a policy in order to transform the behaviors, performance, and practices of different nurses.\n\nThe first professional standard that will be considered to address the current problem is the Nurse Reinvestment Act of 2002 (Ratnapalan & Uleryk, 2014). This law will give an opportunity to retain and hire more practitioners in an attempt to deal with the current shortage. The second one is that of meaningful use. The concept will be aimed at introducing superior technologies and equipment that can result in high-quality pediatric services.\n\nMission, Vision, and Values: Culture and Climate\n\nThe proposed solution seeks to increase the current workforce and introduce new resources in the targeted clinic. The initiative will address the needs of more patients and make the institution a leading provider of desirable services. This is in accordance with the current mission. The achievement will eventually support the organization’s vision as it intends to become a leader in the region. The solution is in accordance with the clinic’s core values such as integrity, justice, and equality (Matthias, 2015). All employees and practitioners will use such attributes as guiding principles to deliver positive results.\n\nThe above solution has the potential to create a powerful culture characterized by a shared vision, teamwork, collaboration, and critical thinking. The level of burnout will reduce significantly. The new culture will eventually take the institution to the next level. The emerging working environment or climate will be positive since nurses and physicians will collaborate to deliver quality services (Ratnapalan & Uleryk, 2014). Continuous improvement will become a powerful concept for empowering different practitioners. Processes should be updated depending on every emerging need. Consequently, the clinic will become a leading provider of high-quality pediatric services.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe above discussion has revealed that the targeted pediatric clinic intends to become a leader in its region. Unfortunately, the problem of workforce shortage is affecting its goals. The decision to hire more practitioners and introduce superior equipment or resources will deal with this challenge. The proposed initiative will support the clinic’s goals, mission, vision, and values. Professional standards such as meaningful use will make the clinic successful.\n\nReferences\n\nMacLean, L., Hassmiller, S., Shaffer, F., Rohrbaugh, K., Collier, T., & Fairman, J. (2014).

Footnotes\n\nIntroduction\n\nVoting powers play a crucial role, especially where directors also happen to own a majority of the shares. Such shareholders can easily implement some decisions against the interests of minority partners. This situation reflects a case where a wrongdoer also possesses the power to support his or her mistaken opinions to the detriment of minority shareholders. Consequently, minority shareholders have their interests substantially reduced, yet they have no course of action, especially when courts fail to intervene.\n\nCourts intervention involves the use of laws to resolve cases before them. Through a detailed discussion of legal recourses for minority shareholders and providing evidence from various courts cases involving the breach of duties owed to companies by directors in violation of minority shareholders’ interests, this essay argues that Company Law currently strikes the right balance between management efficiency and minority shareholder protection.\n\nThe Main Argument\n\nDeakin and Pistor observe that Company Law in different jurisdictions establishes a balance between the need for effective management of organisations and the protection of minority shareholders through various cases, legislation, and statues. 1\n\nThis goal is achieved through the existence of laws and regulations that protect not only the role of directors and managers but also the rights of minority shareholders. The protection of minority shareholders is crucial, especially in situations where they are unable to control the decisions of a company through voting. Their challenges are manifested in situations where company directors not only take charge of running the daily affairs of an organisation but also constitute the majority of shareholders.\n\nIn the UK, Common Law protects minority shareholders while maintaining a balance of the need to manage an organisation. This law mitigates superfluous litigations brought against directors. In fact, the UK’s case of Hutton v West Cork Railway Co limits the level of a director’s freedom to expend an organisation’s finances to serve the interest of non-shareholders. 2\n\nDirectors have the authority to execute a company’s activities as prescribed in the Articles of Association. Indeed, they are required to act in good faith and in a manner that satisfies the interest of companies’ stakeholders, especially the owners (shareholders). Shareholders are the critical decision-makers, as evidenced by their voting powers in passing the most important resolutions. However, according to Guillén and Laurence Capron, challenges arise in situations where people bestowed with the power of controlling companies utilise their positions in a manner that benefits themselves to the detriment of minority shareholders. 3\n\nIn such scenarios, Howson and Clarke reveal mechanisms that protect various minority shareholders 4 . The strategies include derivative claims, statutory remedies, appealing following an unfair prejudice, and a petition for equitable and justifiable winding-up of an organisation or a company.\n\nThe primary route provided by the UK law to guarantee the ardent protection of minority shareholders entails bringing an action involving unfair prejudice in the form of a petition to a court of law. In fact, in situations where minority shareholders feel that a company’s directors have acted in a manner, which violates their interests, they need to regard this option as a priority. 5 In a petition, several claims that seek a particular remedy may be launched.\n\nHowever, obtaining a proper value of shares should constitute the dominant theme in all such claims. For example, according to Guillén and Capron, petitioners may seek a court to issue an order compelling majority shareholders with buying their (minority) shares at a price decided by a court. 6 Nevertheless, such a claim is only suitable if the business has a solvent status and/or if claimants’ (minority shareholders) shares have a substantial value.\n\nAs a statutory remedy, petitioning for unfair prejudice as provided for in the UK law under Section 994 of the 2006 Company’s Act. 7 The claim is brought to the court on the basis that directors run the affairs of an organisation or a company in a manner that disadvantages shareholders, including petitioners. If supplicants convince the jury of the prejudicial conducts on behalf of shareholders or at least petitioners, the discretion for remedies remains with the court. Nevertheless, the most likely order is for the majority shareholder to buy minority shareholders’ share at a proportional value or based on the current market worth of the shares. In some cases, courts may issue an order for the derivative action to commence. However, they hardly issue orders for winding up a company.\n\nThe UK law provides room for one to petition for a justified winding-up of a company as a statutory remedy under the Insolvency Act of 1986 Section 125. Amid the availability of this option, Kraakman et al. reveal how a supplicant needs to demonstrate the possibility of a considerable surplus in case the winding-up plan is adopted. 8\n\nCourts can issue orders for reasonably winding-up a company under the circumstances similar to those that led to the orders of relief on unfair prejudice petition. However, in full consideration of the associated disadvantages, a court should be convinced that a winding-up plan constitutes the only available option. Nevertheless, the circumstances that judges should consider this alternative compared to an unfair prejudice petition are limited. The main mechanism provided for in the UK law, which minority shareholders can exploit to secure protection from majority shareholders’ actions, especially when they (majority shareholders) are the directors, entails the derivative action. 9\n\nConsidering the importance of the derivative action in protecting minority shareholders, the UK law also limits its (derivative action) application to safeguard the balance between the need for protecting minority shareholders and the efficient management of a company.\n\nCourts have maintained a tradition that it is not within their mandates to review or interfere with a company’s administration processes. As stipulated in the case of Automatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co v Cunninghame , company administrators should not be viewed as shareholders’ mediators who can freely execute any decisions on their (shareholders) behalf. 10 While most of the scholarly discussions on the protection of minority shareholders dwell on how the existing legal provisions, including legislation, court cases, and statues, can protect shareholders, the UK recognises the need for mitigating the capacity of minority shareholders to take action against directors.\n\nIn the UK, statutory derivative claims permit shareholders to sue directors and organisational managers under some particular circumstances with the goal of ensuring that directors do not operate or make decisions at the sympathy of shareholders.\n\nAccording to Section 168 of the UK Company Act of 2006, shareholders’ resolution forms the basis for removing directors from office through a simple majority vote. 11 However, this situation creates a difficult scenario where directors are also the majority of shareholders. For example, consider a case where a company has three directors owning 75% of the total shares. When two of the directors come together, they can easily influence the simple majority vote by passing a resolution to remove the third director.\n\nHowever, Bushell v. Faith protects such a director. 12 The UK Company Law also provides room for shareholders to engage in arrangements that aim at protecting directors. For example, the law permits shareholders’ agreements as a contractual mechanism for ensuring that shareholders only use their voting powers and rights for some prescribed purposes as agreed with directors.\n\nAccording to Davies, Company Law protects minority shareholders from losses arising from undue actions by managers or directors while ensuring an efficient company’s management. 13 For example, the statutory derivative guarantees the flexibility, effectiveness, and efficiency of law in maintaining the balance. One major concern is that creating laws that give minority shareholders the power to sue directors who are the company managers under any circumstances will open room for raising vexatious claims. 14\n\nConsequently, many people refuse to take appointments to serve in positions of organisational management in fear of the associated liabilities. This concern led to a recommendation by the Law Commission and Scottish Law Commission (no. 267) that any legal proceedings against company managers initiated by shareholders should be permitted under exceptional and rare circumstances. 15 Hence, without any substantive cause, shareholders should not have the freedom to engage a company in any form of legal litigation.\n\nThe 2006 Company Law Act not only provided strict leaves but also gave courts additional powers for case management. Here, according to Davies and Worthington, the objective was to protect organisations and companies from various disruptive litigations that had inimical consequences to their interests. 16 Hence, the law should uphold the principle of majority rule. As presented in the case of Regal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver , company managers and staff members are barred from taking advantage of business prospects to breach their duty of allegiance. 17 Nevertheless, deviating from the case, the law guarantees adequate protection of minority shareholders from actual or potential abuse emanating from majority stakeholders as a mechanism for striking a balance to all competing interests.\n\nUnder statutory derivative claims, shareholders can only take action against the management in case of any omissions due to negligence, breaching a duty, defaults, and/or where directors breach trust endowed to them by an organisation. According to Kershaw, such an action can be initiated against a director, any other person, or both. 18 As Davies asserts, third parties are introduced followings their efforts to offer dishonest assistance coupled with engaging knowingly in deceptive receipts. 19\n\nHowever, the case of Iesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd of 2010 confirms that any action against third parties can be annulled in case directors have shortcomings that are wholly attributable to them. 20 As a mechanism for guaranteeing the protection of minority shareholders, a court may not envision circumstances under which the majority of shareholders can be allowed to continue with a derivative legal action.\n\nSupporting the Main Argument\n\nIn case companies suffer losses when directors breach their duty, shareholders equally experience the hitch. According to Howson and Clarke, this situation occurs since their shares deprecate contrary to what would have been expected if the company’s duty owed by the directors was not breached. 21 The term reflective loss describes this situation since the loss suffered by shareholders is manifested in the company’s losses. This situation presents a scenario where shareholders should consider a legal remedy. However, as Kraakman et al. assert, Company Law does not permit shareholders to sue for the breach of duties owed to an organisation or a company. 22\n\nEven in a scenario where wrongdoers may owe shareholders an additional but separate duty, they may not have any remedy by way of suing to recover from the losses. This situation helps to avoid the liability of the wrongdoer having to compensate reflective losses to more than one party (the company and other shareholders) for the sued loss. Nevertheless, as McVea asserts, although this case is a public policy issue, shareholders also have some limited circumstances under which they can recover from reflective losses. 23 For example, in an individual capacity, they can assert individual rights consistent with limited chances of the recovery of the suffered reflective loss.\n\nThe statutory derivative claims provide avenues under which minority shareholders can instigate legal proceedings against majority shareholding directors. However, the claims permit them to sue on behalf of an organisation. The Company Law Act of 2006 amplified circumstances under which derivative claims may be applied. However, according to Davies, to guarantee the balance between protecting minority shareholders and the need for efficient management, courts should permit the continuation of such claims. 24\n\nCounter-Argument\n\nThe main argument section maintained that Company Law in the UK protects minority shareholders from potential damages that may arise from weak decision-making, where directors are the majority shareholders. The law also establishes a balance concerning the need to have effective organisational management. However, one can counter-argue that the UK’s tradition involves analysing various remedies available to minority shareholders in the degree to which legal mechanisms help in securing them from losses accruing from self-interested directors who also form part of the majority shareholders.\n\nAccording to Ireland, where insufficient behaviours or actions by directors cause or contribute to organisational losses, the organisation has the power to sue for damages that involve the recovery of losses following the breach of duty. 25 Arguably, only companies can sue directors for the breach of duty. Hannigan supports this assertion by noting that the UK’s Company Law only recognises directors as owing duties to companies 26 as established under the Companies Act of 2006 Section 170. 27 How then does Company Law sufficiently protect minority shareholders from self-interested directors who are also the majority shareholders if minority shareholders cannot sue in an individual capacity?\n\nIn situations where directors are the wrongdoers by way of poor management and inappropriate decisions, the high chances of overlooking the wrongs erode any possibility of remedies. According to Gatti, this challenge may be overcome by ensuring that shareholders are the ultimate decision-makers. 28 Thus, shareholders can initiate legal actions against directors. However, the problem is difficult to resolve where directors constitute the majority owners (shareholders) by way of owning the vast majority of a company’s shares.\n\nIn the UK, Hannigan asserts that a company’s decisions are made based on the majority rule. 29 Hence, minority shareholders lack the ability to dissent decisions made by majority shareholders or directors. However, this counterargument can be proved false.\n\nRefuting the Counter-Argument\n\nCompany Law recognises the probability of directors constituting the majority shareholders. Indeed, the derivative claim protects minority shareholders who may experience such situations as evidenced by the case of Cook v Deeks of 1916. 30 In the case, three directors breached their fiduciary duty as set out now in s175 by securing a contract under their name while excluding that of the company. Considering they had a share of 75 percent of the total shares, they passed a resolution indicating that the company was not interested in the secured contract.\n\nSection 168 of the Companies Act of 2006 provides room for removing any victimised manager from office to safeguard shareholders’ interest. 31 According to Dignam and Lowry, the court held that the company owed the contract as a matter of equity. 32 Consequently, the directors had no legal capacity to use powers vested to them as a matter of being the majority shareholders to pass resolutions for securing the contract under their name while excluding that of the company. The case of Cook v Deeks evidences that in circumstances where majority shareholder directors and company boards are unwilling to initiate a legal action, minority shareholders can sue on behalf of an organisation or a company. 33\n\nThe case of Edwards v Halliwell , settled in 1950, also exemplifies the protection of minority shareholders by Company Law from potential detriments arising from majority shareholders who are also the directors. 34 The court heard that a trade union’s constitution prohibited the alteration of any contributions unless members engage in a secret ballot vote with two-thirds of majority voting in favour of the changes.\n\nContrary to this provision, a resolution by the simple majority passed a decision to change the contributions. Two members of the union decided to sue asking the court to make a declaration that the resolution was invalid. The union challenged the two members’ capability of suing quoting the case of Foss v Harbottle. 35 However, it ruled that the case did not prevent a member of the company to sue in a situation where the matter called for sanctioning through a special majority as opposed to the simple majority.\n\nSummation and Conclusion\n\nDirectors are obliged to respect faithfully the trust bestowed upon them by shareholders in the management of a company on their behalf. Therefore, they should not engage in acts of omission, default, and negligence when making decisions that may have negative implications for a company and by extension on their share value. Such an act is against the shareholders’ interest. Under these circumstances, statutory derivative claims allow minority shareholders to initiate legal actions against such directors.\n\nWhere they (directors) are not the shareholders, or are the minority shareholders, legal redress is readily available since the board and other directors are willing to initiate a legal action for the breach of duties owed to an organisation. However, where directors are the majority shareholders, the possibility of a legal action is slim upon considering their unwillingness to sue. Hence, shareholders’ interests remain violated and unaddressed.\n\nResolving the situation calls for allowing minority shareholders to sue the directors on behalf of a company since the UK’s Company Law does not permit them to take legal action on their behalf to avoid a situation where wrongdoers will have to compensate more than one party. Such a judicial precedence implies that directors will make any decisions irrespective of whether or not they negatively impair the efficiency of a company’s management. Rather, under the Company Law, they will only focus on ensuring that all decisions satisfy the minority shareholders. Hence, it suffices to argue that the UK’s Company Law strikes a good balance between management efficiency and minority shareholder protection.\n\nBibliography\n\nDavies, Paul, and Sarah Worthington, Gower and Davies: Principles of Modern Company Law (9th edn, Sweet & Maxwell 2012).\n\nDavies, Paul, Introduction to Company Law (2nd edn, OUP 2010).\n\nDeakin, Simon and Katharina Pistor (eds), Legal Origin Theory: Economic Approaches to Law Series (Cheltenham 2012).\n\nDignam, Alan, and John Lowry, Company Law (9th edn, OUP 2016).\n\nGatti, Matteo, ‘The Power to Decide On Takeovers: Directors or Shareholders, What Difference Does It Make?’ (2014) 20 Fordham Journal of Corporate and Financial Law 73.\n\nGuillén , Mauro, and Laurence Capron, ‘State Capacity, Minority Shareholder Protections, and Stock Market Development’ (2015) 61 Administrative Science Quarterly 125.\n\nHannigan, Brenda, Company Law (4th edn, OUP 2015).\n\nHowson, Nicholas, and Donald Clarke, Pathway to Minority Shareholder Protection: Derivative Actions in the People’s Republic of China (Cambridge University Press 2012).\n\nIreland, Paddy, ‘ Company Law and the Myth of Shareholder Ownership’ (1999) 62 MLR 32.\n\nKershaw, David, Company Law in Context: Text and Materials (2nd edn, OUP 2012).\n\nKraakman, Reinier et al., The Anatomy of Corporate Law (2nd edn, OUP 2009).\n\nLaw Commission and Scottish Law Commission, Company Directors: Regulating Conflicts of Interest and Formulating a Statement of Duties (No 261) 1999.\n\nMcVea, Harry, ‘Section 994 of the Companies Act 2006 and the Primacy of Contract’ (2012) 75 MLR 1123.\n\nAutomatic Self-Cleansing Filter Syndicate Co v Cunninghame [1906] 2 Ch 34.\n\nBushell v Faith [1970] AC 1099.\n\nCompanies Act 2006, s168, 33.\n\nCompanies Act 2006, ss170-178.\n\nCompanies Act 2006, s994.\n\nCook v Deeks [1916] 1 AC 554 UKPC 10.\n\nEdwards v Halliwell [ 1950 ] 2 All ER 1064.\n\nFoss v Harbottle [1843] 67 ER 189.\n\nHutton v West Cork Railway Co [1883] 23 Ch D 254.\n\nIesini v Westrip Holdings Ltd [ 2010 ] All ER D 108.\n\nRegal (Hastings) Ltd v Gulliver [1942] 1 All ER 378 [1967] 2 AC 134.\n\nFootnotes\n\n 1.

      "Li-Fi as the Future of Wireless Technology Proposal\n\nIntroduction\n\nCurrently, the successful wireless communication and exchange of data and messages are possible with the help of Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) technology that is actively used in social and business life (Gupta, 2015). However, today, it is possible to speak about the development of the more recent technology that is appropriate to exchange information, and it is known as Li-Fi (Light Fidelity) technology (Jadhav, Patil, Singh, & Patel, 2015).\n\nThe idea of developing Li-Fi technology was introduced by Harald Haas, the German expert in communications, in 2011. Haas accentuated the innovativeness and efficiency of Li-Fi because of using light to transmit a signal (Jaiswal & Chopade, 2013). Therefore, much attention should be paid to examining the features of this recent communication technology in contrast to Wi-Fi. It is important to discuss the problem associated with the use of wireless communication technologies, accentuate the goals and significance of this study, present research questions, and review the recent literature on the topic of using Li-Fi.\n\nProblem Formulation\n\nThe problem is in the fact that modern organizations require high-speed and widely available communication technologies that should also be secure and efficient in terms of the used resources (Rawat, Aggarwal, & Passi, 2014). The speed of the Internet communicated with the help of Wi-Fi is comparably low, costs are high, and security is limited (Gupta, 2015). Therefore, organizations are interested in using new technologies instead of Wi-Fi. Still, even though Li-Fi is regarded as one of the most recent and high-speed communication technologies, its advantages need to be examined in detail (Bhosale & Vijaykumar, 2016). Furthermore, it is important to pay attention to exploring limitations of this technology to conclude regarding its appropriateness to be used in organizations.\n\nGoals and Significance of the Study\n\nThis study aims at identifying the advantages and disadvantages of Li-Fi in comparison to Wi-Fi and analyzing possible benefits available to organizations that use Li-Fi. The study is significant because it will provide answers to the questions on the appropriateness of using Li-Fi technology in modern organizational environments. After all, this tendency has become popular in the world (Rawat et al., 2014). Furthermore, the study is significant to provide a complex overview of areas where the technology can be used with the focus on associated advantages and disadvantages to influence the decision of organizations regarding the use of Li-Fi (Bhosale & Vijaykumar, 2016).\n\nResearch Questions\n\nTo address the study’s goal, it is necessary to find answers to the following research questions:\n\n  * Research Question # 1 (RQ1): What are the advantages and disadvantages of Li-Fi technology in comparison to Wi-Fi technology?\n\nThere are a few studies that discuss features of Li-Fi. More attention should be paid to examining specific qualities of Li-Fi. Therefore, this question is important to contribute to the debates.\n\n  * Research Question # 2 (RQ2): What benefits can organizations have while using Li-Fi technology?\n\nThe interest in Li-Fi is explained concerning the users’ demand for high-speed and secure Internet. Currently, the main focus is on accentuating the unique benefits of using Li-Fi for the social sector. As a result, to conclude the use of Li-Fi, it is necessary to answer the question regarding its potential benefits for the business sector and organizations as users.\n\nLiterature Review\n\nOverview\n\nLi-Fi technology was developed by Haas as a high-speed alternative to Wi-Fi technology, and today, many researchers concentrate on studying this specific communication system. Therefore, it is important to examine the previous research in the field to identify trends and possible gaps in the existing literature on Li-Fi technology and its application. In this literature review, it is necessary to determine researchers’ ideas and positions regarding the principles of working predicted advantages and disadvantages of Li-Fi, the comparison of Li-Fi and Wi-Fi, and the application of this new technology.\n\nVisible Light Communication and Principles of Working\n\nThe principles of the Li-Fi technology’s work depend on the transmission of data with the help of LED (light-emitting diodes) lamps that include chips. The reason is that it is possible to use the visible light spectrum to receive a signal and transmit data (Jaiswal & Chopade, 2013; Sodhi & Johnson, 2015). From this point, researchers focus on using Visible Light Communication (VLC) as a medium that applies visible light (Bao, Yu, Dai, & Zhu, 2015).\n\nTo transmit data, it is necessary to use light that is between 400 THz (780 nm) and 800 THz (375 nm) (Jaiswal & Chopade, 2013). VLC guarantees switching bulbs quickly to make them transmit a signal that is received by a Li-Fi chip (Bao et al., 2015; Sodhi & Johnson, 2015). As a result of using VLC, it is possible to develop Li-Fi as a 5G communication system based on visible light (Jaiswal & Chopade, 2013).\n\nIn their study, Sodhi and Johnson (2015) have focused on describing the basic principles of Li-Fi technology’s functioning. The main components of the communication system are LED lamps that need to be turned on, a photo-detector to receive signals, and a server to respond to signals and requests. Still, the focus is also on a light driver that needs to include a baseband modulator, a digital-to-analog converter, and a transconductance amplifier to transmit signals (Sharma & Sanganal, 2014). LED technologies in lamps to transmit a signal to the photo-detector which is converted to spread data for different types of devices (Sodhi & Johnson, 2015).\n\nAdvantages and Disadvantages of Li-Fi Technology\n\nResearchers identify many advantages associated with using Li-Fi technology. Jaiswal and Chopade (2013) note that the key advantage of this technology is the possibility to transmit data almost everywhere because of the use of LED lamps not only in offices but also in the streets. According to Sodhi and Johnson (2015), the main advantage is capacity because the visible light spectrum is larger than the radio frequency spectrum used in Wi-Fi. Also, the use of LED lamps guarantees efficiency and the parallel transmission of data at high speed. Furthermore, the focus is on security because the light for transmitting signals can be controlled in contrast to radio waves. This advantage is also accentuated by Gupta (2015) and Jadhav et al. (2015).\n\nHowever, researchers also identify the disadvantages of this new technology while stating that there are limitations caused by the necessity of using direct lines of light to guarantee the connection between LED lamps and receivers (Bhosale & Vijaykumar, 2016).\n\nTo work in different rooms, the source of light should be in each room (Rawat et al., 2014). Jaiswal and Chopade (2013) also emphasize the inability of such signals to overcome obstacles. Even though the advantages and disadvantages of Li-Fi technology are actively discussed by investigators, they are inclined to mention the same features, and more research is necessary for this field.\n\nComparison of Li-Fi and Wi-Fi\n\nThe comparison of Li-Fi and Wi-Fi technologies is the main focus of many studies because of the necessity to provide evidence that explains the advantages of Li-Fi in contrast to Wi-Fi. Virk (2015) notes that Wi-Fi is appropriate for providing the Internet for all users in large offices. However, Li-Fi is more efficient to work with the high-density data, as it is noted by Jaiswal and Chopade (2013).\n\nSharma and Sanganal (2014) also pay attention to the fact that Wi-Fi can transmit large volumes of data, but the speed can be reduced because of the system’s weaknesses. Currently, the Wi-Fi spectrum can guarantee the use of only 3G and 4G systems when the use of a 5G system is possible with the focus on Li-Fi (Sodhi & Johnson, 2015). Furthermore, the availability of signals for Li-Fi and Wi-Fi is a matter of debate because there are both advantages and disadvantages typical of both systems. Also, Wi-Fi is viewed as less secure than Li-Fi (Gupta, 2015).\n\nApplication of Li-Fi Technology\n\nResearchers identify a variety of areas where it is possible to apply Li-Fi technology. Sodhi and Johnson (2015) accentuate the appropriateness of Li-Fi for using in streets because of the availability of traffic and street lights. Much attention is also paid to using Li-Fi not only in offices but also in healthcare facilities. It is possible to organize navigation in hospitals and the use of Li-Fi in operating rooms where the focus on Wi-Fi is impossible because of radio waves’ effects (Jaiswal & Chopade, 2013).\n\nThe use of mobile phones and Wi-Fi is also prohibited at oil and gas stations and different types of plants, including chemical ones, as well as aboard during flights. This problem can be resolved with the help of Li-Fi (Jadhav et al., 2015). Furthermore, the use of Wi-Fi is impossible underwater, and this problem can be addressed while using powerful lamps for transmitting signals.\n\nSummary\n\nLi-Fi technology is based on the application of a VLC system that enables users to receive and share data in any location where the LED lamp is visible, and there are no obstacles for light to transmit signals. As a result, it is possible to speak about technology’s high efficiency, capacity, and security while comparing it to Wi-Fi technology. Still, many advantages of Li-Fi have not been determined or accentuated yet, and it is important to focus more on the real effectiveness of Li-Fi in comparison to Wi-Fi. Furthermore, researchers are inclined to concentrate on such opportunities for the technology’s application as the use at plants, underwater use, and the use in healthcare organizations among other options. However, it is also important to focus on utilizing Li-Fi in offices of different organizations because the principles of Li-Fi technology’s work differ from the principles of Wi-Fi technology significantly.\n\nReferences\n\nBao, X., Yu, G., Dai, J., & Zhu, X.

      "Medicine Wheel Pedagogy Approach Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. East\n 2. South\n 3. West\n 4. North\n 5. References\n\nEast\n\nThe Medicine Wheel Could be considered an essential modern tool that provides open-minded and seeking diverse knowledge individuals with numerous opportunities to delve into the peculiarities of a certain issue and conduct its in-depth analysis (“Aboriginal pedagogy,” n.d.). Therefore, it could also be a pedagogical tool for teaching, learning, and understanding of human journeys at different levels. Moreover, it helps to consider the most important questions related to a particular sphere. For instance, applying the Medicine Wheel approach to reconciliation issues, we could benefit from enhanced results because of the methods ability to suggest a particular structure needed for the investigation. The Medicine Wheel pedagogy ascends to indigenous practices that tried to encompass all essential aspects of a certain phenomenon and elaborate the most appropriate approach.\n\nTherefore, the Medicine Wheel pedagogy is closely related to reconciliation. It could be defined as attempts to restore mutual respect between people who have different cultures and mentalities (“Reconciliation,” n.d.). It includes all aspects of these individuals relations: political, cultural, economic, etc. The term could also be used to describe a complex and long term process aimed at the improvement of indigenous peoples position through a specific set of measures. In this regard, the Medicine Wheel pedagogy becomes a critical aspect of reconciliation as it helps to perform a comprehensive investigation of relations between Aboriginal people and other individuals who want to establish trustful relations and engage in beneficial cooperation. In modern society, reconciliation becomes a very important issue that should be cultivated among members of society.\n\nSouth\n\nRevolving around reconciliation, I could share my personal experience to demonstrate the increased importance of this aspect and outline feelings that appear during the process. As everyone knows, Canada used to be a land inhabited by ingenious people who had their unique culture and traditions. Unfortunately, due to the unwise policy that was used by colonists and cruelty, relations with these people were spoiled, and they were moved from their traditional areas. Nowadays, we could see them only in reservations that are created with the idea to help them to preserve their culture and the way of life. I believe that regarding these facts, reconciliation means cooperation with these people to understand their unique culture and share feelings and emotions related to a certain issue. Moreover, I think we should try to establish trustful relations with them. For this reason, I reached the closest reservation to communicate with aboriginal people and discover their culture.\n\nIn general, it was a great success of mine. I visited my new friends many times and obtained important information about their way of living, culture, and mentalities. Moreover, they outlined their claims to people living in Canada.\n\nI should say that this attempt helped me to realize that reconciliation is fundamental nowadays and could be pleasant. I managed to understand people and their problems, which is critical for modern society. This experience feels unusual as it is something new. It provides me with firmness, and I think that reconciliation is possible regarding the current state of society.\n\nWest\n\nTherefore, everyone understands reconciliation in his/her own way. For instance, cogitating about the issue, Winona La Duke determines it as a long journey towards the enhanced mutual understanding and redemption (St. Thomas Newsroom, 2001). She is sure that it is a complex and challenging issue which demands a specific approach to consider the most doubtful aspects and make a compromise. At the same time, she thinks that the restoration of relations and improvement of ingenious peoples position is possible if reconciliation has not stopped.\n\nMoreover, indigenous scholars share this point of view as they are confident that it is high time to act and start reconciliation. They outline several crucial points that should be touched upon to attain success and enhance cooperation. For instance, scholars emphasize a need for new relations in which both parties will act as intellectual partners and elaborate common approaches to problem-solving (“Current reconciliation initiatives,” n.d.). Additionally, they outline a need to integrate aboriginal students into the university community for them to participate in the Canadian discourse and acquire a better understanding of current processes (“Current reconciliation initiatives,” n.d.). There is also a significant need for training programs for aboriginal people.\n\nIn general, these ideas have a significant impact on my own concept of reconciliation. The thought of the improved and long-term cooperation with ingenious people becomes crucial for the Canadian discourse and attempts to create a unified society. At the moment, I realize that it seizes all spheres of our activity.\n\nNorth\n\nHaving investigated the most important aspects of reconciliation by using the Medicine Wheel pedagogy approach, we could now formulate several steps that should be made to reconcile particular spheres and attain success. First of all, regarding the most important health issues, we should say that ingenious people should be involved in specific education to become active members of all processes that occur in the healthcare sphere (Monkman, 2016). Moreover, responding to aboriginal individuals initiatives, it is critical to ensure that their youth will be able to study at medical schools or universities. First, it will help to reconcile by promoting improved cooperation between representatives of all cultures who live in Canada.\n\nSecond, representatives of this category will be able to acquire knowledge, which is important for their communities further development (“Winona Laduke: Reconciling our relationship,” n.d.). Moreover, the improved reconciliation could be attained due to the introduction of policies that facilitate access to health services and stimulate people to participate in healthcare activities introduced by authorities to attain enhanced outcomes and improve the health of the nation (Monkman, 2016). Finally, the reconciliation strategy might also include current health problems assessment procedures to acquire an improved understanding of various communities states and actions that should be performed to guarantee gradual alteration of the situation.\n\nAltogether, reconciliation is one of the most important tasks the modern society faces today. It will help to attain improved understanding between individuals and create a homogeneous society characterized by enhanced cooperation.\n\nReferences\n\nAboriginal pedagogy and the Medicine Wheel approach .

      "The Common Good: Justice and Entitlement Research Paper\n\nOne of the guiding principles in the quest to promote human welfare in the world is the need to achieve the common good. To achieve this feat, it is important to acknowledge the importance of creating an inclusive society that promotes the values of equality, justice, responsibility, and entitlement (Wolff 12). These values should form the basis of governance across all forms of jurisdictions. A just and equal society embraces the rule of law, as well as the need to promote responsible and accountable leadership. Everyone is entitled to enjoy basic human rights, as well as the privilege to exercise one’s freedom of speech, ownership, worship, and association among others. Over the years, the concept of justice and entitlement has been the subject of major debates across the world as more people seek to understand the value of distributive justice (Foley 38). This debate gained a lot of momentum over the last several centuries owing to the emergence of the creative industry where the issue of intellectual property rights remains a divisive issue. However, this issue has been widely analyzed and demystified by the entitlement theory. The theory created by Robert Nozick explains the way the principle of justice applies when determining the rights granted by law to an individual who owns a property.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe entitlement theory has three main guiding principles. The first one is the principle of justice in acquisition, which focuses on guiding the process of acquiring a property for the first time. This is very important, especially in situations where the acquisition is being done by a registered group or by more than one person. Its focus is ensuring that all the involved parties have all the information necessary in ensuring they make the right decisions. The second one is the principle of justice in a transfer that focuses on guiding the process of transferring property from one owner to another (Wolff 23).\n\nIt is important to ensure that any form of transfers happen in an open and just manner to avoid the new owner inheriting risks or burdens that they do not involve them. All parties are entitled to getting all the necessary information such as the history of the property before agreeing to any transfer. The third one is the principle of rectification of injustice, which focuses on guiding the process of addressing cases involving property acquired or transferred through unlawful means. In such situations, it is important to acknowledge the plight of the victims and the need for them to be compensated in case there are any losses incurred (Foley 50). Also, this principle advocate for engaging the people affected by injustice in establishing the elements that might have influenced the phenomenon. This plays a crucial role in ensuring that such injustices do not happen again in the future.\n\nIn line with the three crucial principles, Nozick argued that the third principle who be of no use if the world embraces the need to achieve the common good by promoting justice. Also, he believed that the concept of justice in the ownership and transfer of property is an entitlement (Hevia 99). Everyone who owns a property should have entitlement over all the decisions regarding its transfer, changes, or development. The same case applies to all the property that someone acquires through a transfer made through a legal process. This means that property owned by a group or more than one individual should exercise distributive entitlement whereby all the individuals have equal access to benefits and influence in making decisions (Cairns 129). However, society is filled with different personalities and these principles are not applied accordingly. Many people tend to violate them in a bid to defraud others of their rightful properties without showing any regard to the law or the principle of the common good. Just as Nozick argued, embracing justice is the only way in which people can enjoy full entitlement to their holdings (Wolff 31). This will eliminate the need to engage the third principle of justice where the law has to intervene in restoring the entitlement rights of a property to the rightful owner.\n\nThe effectiveness of the concept of a free-market economy is highly dependent on the principle of justice and entitlement. In a governance setting, taxation is one of the common ways through which governments raise revenue for running its operations. Taxation often applies the pay as you earn strategy, which means that people on the high-income bracket pay more taxes compared to those on the lower levels. Most governments use the tax revenue to support programs geared towards eradicating poverty and improving the quality of life. Proponents of the principle of justice believe that is unjust to subject rich people to high taxes in a bid to get money to support the poor (Lieberman 119). Their argument is based on the notion that all people should be entitled to their full pay regardless of their economic status. Instead, the government should devise alternative strategies for generating money to support the empowerment programs as part of fulfilling their responsibility to the citizens.\n\nIn a society where justice and the principle of entitlement are fully embraced, an activity like taxation should be done voluntarily. However, this cannot be applicable because all citizens have a responsibility to support their respective governments in improving the quality of life and eventually achieving the common good. The main reasoning behind this argument is the fact that all human beings can attain a certain level of welfare in life depending on their abilities and accessible opportunities (Lieberman 131). Since the level of income cannot be equal across all people, then it makes sense if people pay their taxes depending on their economic status. This means that the higher the income the higher the taxation and vice versa. It is the responsibility of the government to ensure equal distribution of resources to empower all its citizens with reliable income-generating activities.\n\nOver the years, the concept of justice and entitlement has come under serious criticism due to its inability to promote the spirit of competitiveness. Most of its critics argue that embracing justice in the entitlement rights over properties can lead to the majority of resources in a country being controlled by very few people (Foley 116). For example, in a situation where a property is passed through successive generations as inheritance can lead to major inequalities because those that assume the entitlement for the holdings do not know the real source of resources used in developing it. Also, this can lead to unsustainable development due to a lack of healthy competition (Lerner and Mikula 108). However, this situation can be rectified through taxation, whereby people that receive property in the form of inheritance are required to pay some tax to the government as a means of bequeathing their value. Taxation plays a very crucial role in the growth and development of any government. However, it is important to ensure that it is done in a just manner, putting into consideration the different levels of income and the need to promote the principle of entitlement. Apart from Nozick, other legal philosophers such as Rawls and Aristotle also emphasized these sentiments by arguing that the concept of justice and entitlement is applied similarly to utilitarianism (Cairns 146). Also, they believe that justice is a relative concept whose meaning and application vary from one jurisdiction to another.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe entitlement theory of justice is one of the oldest and widely applied concepts in societies across the world. Over the years, it has been used to promote the need to create an inclusive society where equality, human welfare, and the common good are the defining elements. People have the right to enjoy various freedoms and rights provided by the constitutions that govern their respective countries. Some of the most controversial entitlements that people believe have been violated by many legal systems include taxation, as well as ownership, and transfer of property. All people have the responsibility of paying taxes to their respective authorities as a way of promoting development. It is not possible to exempt anyone from taxation simply because of the feeling of being entitled to choose whatever they want to do with their money. It is the responsibility of the government to promote justice through equal distribution of resources, empowerment programs, and regulating the ability of people to have full control over properties transferred to them as an inheritance.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCairns, James.

References\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn the 21 st century, humans have seen an increasing development in a number of areas in their lives. These developments have constantly affected their lives, their relationship with each other, how they communicate, and perform their duties. The development of computers is a major breakthrough in the history of humanity which has drastically changed the way humans live nowdays. The entire world has become a global village owing to the change in interaction influenced by computers. In the first few years when computers were developed, they were not widely used in order to perform human functions. In those days, people were still uninformed technologically; most of the human activities were handled manually. In the 21 st century, that situation has changed and computers have become part and parcel of the human nature. As a result, computers influence the way we live, the way we communicate, the way we interact with each other touching almost every aspect of the human nature.\n\nThe scope of computers in the human life\n\nHumans are rapidly changing and becoming inclined to the use of computers more than any other electronic gadget in the world today. The scope of computer usage is expanding every single day ranging from health to education, security to communicate and so on (Kizza, 2010). Computers are vital in hospitals as they are being used to monitor patients, make diagnosis among many other medical functions. Actually, a hospital can hardly deliver its services to patients without the use of computers. It is not, however, the only critical function of computers in a hospital (Kizza, 2010). There are other scopes, for example, the record keeping system, which requires the use of computers to run effectively.\n\nSecurity dependency on Computer\n\nSecurity, on the other hand, is a major concern in the world today. Security agencies face greater challenges in the current world than in the past centuries. This has prompted the agencies to consider other alternatives in managing and curbing crimes other than the manually patrols around towns and areas of great insecurities (Kizza, 2010). Computers have come in handy to solve this issue and currently the results are proving to be good. In major cities in the developed world, the streets and highways are monitored using CCTVs which transmit their images to computers. Security agencies of the 21 st century depend greatly on the use of computers to maintain peace and order more than they do with physical patrols.\n\nEducation dependence on computers\n\nEducation is another area where computers have infiltrated and have become virtually detachable. It is impossible to picture a student without his or her computer being an impossible endeavour. To show how the use of computers has become important at schools, administrators in the majority of schools, especially in the developed countries make it a priority to embrace and have an ICT department for computer studies (Grieco, 2009). It has become a requirement for all students especially in colleges and universities to have basic knowledge on how to work with a computer. Although not necessarily through policies, rules and regulation, this requirement is necessitated by other factors within the education system. For instance, in institutions of higher education, students are required to hand in their homework and assignments in the form of soft copies. That means they have to type in their work and submit it using computers. Even when a hardcopy is required, handwritten material is of less preference. In addition to that, a lot of research work requires the use of the Internet, hence making computers a necessity (Grieco, 2009).\n\nEmployment\n\nEmployment is one of the most important aspects of human life. In most companies today, the use of computer is widely spread creating problems for people who have skills in using computer. Lowposts, such as secretariat positions are today requiring one to have at least the basics of computer. Such requirements have, consequently, kept some people off the job bracket. The need for computer skills as a factor of production in the majority of companies has made the entire world depend on the computer (Grieco, 2009). This has enhanced our computer dependency since it determines our livelihood through employment. Computers today have controlled every business activity, be it service oriented or production of goods. Financial and money markets exist due to the appearence of computers, further enhancing human decency on this gadget. The impact of computers in such important areas of our lives has made us as humans greatly rely and depend on them for our livelihood (Grieco, 2009).\n\nIn business\n\nIn the business world today, there has developed a lot of dynamics that has facilitated and enhanced the use of computers. Financial records and the assignment of salaries have been simplified and made effective by the use of computers. This has made employers resort to the use of computers to minimize the cost of such tedious activities (Wagman, 2003). Such developments have undermined the use of the old procedures hence replacing them. A number of manual activities have been abandoned in favour of new computer technology. Setting up the systems that facilitate the use of computers makes it very difficult for a company to abandon its use in the future. This is another factor that has tied individual, companies and other entities, for intsnace, the government to the use of computers.\n\nGlobalization\n\nThe current mobilization of the world’s countries to unite and form one huge village has helped in enhancing the use of computers. Due to the structure of communication and other infrastructure, the world has become a village whereby a lot of activities are happening with less mobility. A large number of business opportunities are arising through the internet which requires one to have a computer. This means that if an individual lacks the skills on how to use a computer, he or she is locked out from accessing such opportunities. The Global village has come with great demands that can only be met by the use of computers. Governments need to keep in touch with fellow governments as the new demand for information is rising at an alarming speed.\n\nConclusion\n\nComputers have had a direct impact on the human existence, and although we can directly attach its impact to individuals, it has a major role in the activities and roles of our livelihood. The high dependency on computers is influenced by its efficiency and competence capturing most of the functions and roles performed by humans. This is even worsened by the fact that in many ways computers work and perform better than humans, hence creating a demand for them. In other words, every essential area of our lives is now dependent on the use of computers making the entire human race depend on them.\n\nReferences\n\nGrieco, J., M, (2009).

      "United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia in the 90-00s Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe civilians of Colombia have been caught between fights and engagements between right-wing paramilitary groups and leftist guerrilla groups. This battle for supremacy has persisted over a decade, with the local people suffering from these engagements. In 2003, however, Alvaro Uribe, the President of Colombia, took the initiative to stop the violence associated with either of the actors (Hanson 2008).\n\nThus, he signed a peace treaty with the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, also known as the AUC, as this was one of the largest paramilitary groups in the country. Hanson (2008) reports that after the peace talks initiation, at least thirty thousand AUC members have since left the group, with the top members relinquishing their positions. Despite all these efforts, a myriad of political scandals shows the depth in which the people have been engaged in paramilitary scandals and the infiltration and participation by the Colombian security forces.\n\nMoreover, the country is facing infiltration by new criminal insurgents whose mode of operation is similar to that of the AUC. For a long period, Colombia has received funding from the government of the United States. This was meant to propel the government in their fight against the illegal trade of narcotics. However, the country’s rate was involved in paramilitary scandals meant that the United States could no longer extend funding to the country. It further chose to retract its promise of free trade.\n\nReasons for Establishment\n\nThe origin of various paramilitary organizations dates back to the 1980s. It is assumed that these groups were doing drug traffickers who were tired of being harassed by guerrillas. In effect, they sought to establish death squads they termed as Death to Kidnappers (Muerte a Secuestradores – MAS). The main reason why the paramilitary groups were established was to oversee that the guerilla units no longer harassed drug traffickers.\n\nThus, the proposed actions against these persons were to kill anyone associated with them without considering whether they were close associates or sympathizers. In the end, even innocent people lost their lives as they were unjustly indicted (Rabasa & Chalk 2001). Eventually, many other self-defense factions under the Colombian army or the directives of key politicians in the country were enacted, with the premise that they would offer protection to the local villagers.\n\nMost of these self- defense units were legally recognized. However, other than offer security to innocent populations, most of the groups worked for drug traffickers. When the groups retracted from their original aim of establishment and started to associate with drug traffickers, they benefited from gaining access to top military weapons, cars, and communication gadgets to aid in their activities. Indeed, the rise of drug lords’ economic power has become the country’s new conflict. For instance, powerful members involved with the Medellin cartel heavily invested in land ownership. In an attempt to protect their investment, they, in turn, sought to finance paramilitary groups to gain protection from guerrilla groups. Over time, these groups were now protecting the drug warlords other than the civilian groups.\n\nIn the late 19 th century, the Las Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarios de Colombia (FARC) and el Ejército de Liberación Nacional (ELN) sought to create many other self-defense units. Thus, Vincente, Carlos, and Fidel Castaño decided to form such a unit in 1982, naming it Las Tangas, or popularly known as Los Dangerous. The aim of forming the unit was to fight the FARC group’s activities and seek vengeance for the death of their father, who had been killed by the latter group. In 1994, to become a paramilitary group, the Las Tangas colluded with the Colombian military and carried out its activities in the Antioquia and Urabá regions.\n\nHowever, there later arose the need to form one unique group that would consolidate all the regional and local activities of other paramilitary groups. It is this need that led to the formation of the AUC.\n\nSpecifically, the AUC paramilitary group was established in 1997 through a move that sought to bring all the right-wing militia groups together. The AUC, also known as the United Self-Defense Forces of Colombia, was one of the right-wing umbrella’s, operating as a paramilitary body in Colombia (‘Profiles: Colombia’s Armed Groups’ 2013). The top leaders of the group were prominent drug lords of the 1980s who sought to protect rebels.\n\nDrug traffickers and elites were the group’s key supporters as they knew they would be able to gain protection against existing guerilla groups (Rabasa & Chalk 2001). This process was overseen by the heads of the ACCU militia group. Over time, several AUC militia groups were formed and regionally dispersed, with each group established to protect their local social, economic, and political interests. An achievement that would only be attained through engaging the local left-wing insurgents in combats.\n\nThe group’s popularity arose from their horrific actions ranging from murders and attacks meant to instill fear among guerilla groups. The group engaged in the ruthless killings of about 19,000 people assumed to associate or sympathize with guerilla groups between 1997 and 1999. For the first ten months of 2000, the group’s activities ranged from kidnappings, murders, and assassinations estimated at 203, 804, and 507, respectively.\n\nAt times when the AUC would get a hint of peace talks between the government and guerilla factions, they would seek to obscure further progress. One such example was in 2000 when the AUC hindered the peace talks between the government and guerilla groups. In opposition, they seized a sizable portion of the ELN territory. As a result, the ongoing peace talks were forced to come to an abrupt halt.\n\nGoals and Objectives\n\nWhen the Castaño brothers formed the AUC, their main goal was to limit guerrilla units’ operations, among them the FARC and the ELN. Other goals that led to the group’s establishment were to protect sponsor economic interests and protect the local communities and the elites (InSight Crime n.d.). Their protection activities later included drug traffickers when they became the key sponsors of the organization. Other members of the group, like Carlos Castaño, also viewed the AUC as a suitable political platform and an avenue through which he would become a reputable political actor. However, this plan conflicted with the group’s main political goal of violent conflict, which was highly popular with most AUC members and co-leaders like Vicente Castaño.\n\nMeans\n\nThe operations of the AUC would not have been possible without funding. An analysis of the reason why it was established offers crucial information on its funding. They would be paid for the protection they accorded drug traffickers. All this offered to ensure protection from local guerrilla units (InSight Crime n.d.). For instance, cocoa farmers directly supported the activities of the group in return for protection.\n\nAlso, this was easy as AUC was directly linked with the production and exportation of cocaine. The leaders of the group were very vocal about their receiving funds from dealing with the drug trade. In effect, the leader of the group, in March 2000, blatantly declared that trafficking, drug trade, taxation, and the production of coca, attributed 70% of the total revenues that the organization earned. He also added that the rest, which is 30%, was earned through extortion (InSight Crime n.d.). In 2003, a peace commission working in the country maintained that around 80% of the AUC’S finances were attributed to drugs.\n\nIn March 2007, one organization, the international fruit corporation, Chiquita, declared that it had financed the organization’s activities from 1997 to 2004. One prominent annual expenditure that the Chiquita group incurred was a payment of US$1.7 million that would be done to the AUC to ensure the protection of the company’s employees and activities in Urabá and Santa Marta (InSight Crime n.d.). At least US$825,000 of the monies remitted to the AUC after 2001 was done after the US state department had already termed the organization as a Foreign Terrorist Organization. To avoid suspicion and allegations of supporting a terrorist organization, most of the group’s finances were channeled through the Convivir network—the government-sponsored this rural security cooperative program.\n\nAccomplishments\n\nThe AUC has both positive and negative accomplishments. One positive accomplishment was collaborating with the military to fight against FARC. During this period, the AUC was still a legally recognized group to protect civilians. FARC’s activities were a threat to peace in the community as they extort people, kidnap innocent civilians, among others. It is only after the establishment of the AUC that the guerrilla group retracted its operations.\n\nOn the other hand, the AUC managed to engage in the most violations of human rights. The primary goal of establishing the group was to offer protection to the local communities. However, this goal was obscured by the love for money and infiltration by drug traffickers. In return, the group pledged their loyalty to protecting their key financiers, detracting from their primary goal. As a result, they murdered innocent civilians, raped women and children, and asserted their power through intimidation tactics.\n\nOperations\n\nAmong the key regions that the AUC conducted their operations are the northwest of Antioquia, Bolivar, Cordoba, and Sucre. However, most of the southern and the northern departments grew rapidly from 1999. When clashes between the group and FARC insurgents ensued, the latter thought it wise to dominate all the country (The Guerrilla Groups in Colombia n.d.). The two main enemies of the AUC were FARC and ELN.\n\nHow the AUC conducted its operations led it to acquire a terrorist organization (The Guerrilla Groups in Colombia n.d.). Terrorism was the only better title to award the organization in light of their mass affliction to human rights like torture and massacres. Statistics from the National Colombian Police have shown that the AUC indeed carried out mass violations of human rights in 2000. Not only did they engage in murder, assassinations, and rape, but they also left behind victims from their activities (Trent 2012). A key example of these violations was the 3 rd October incident when the militias attacked the Viajes town.\n\nSince the incident, it is evident that the group delighted in the killing of innocent civilians. They first proceed to the homestead of Victor Rubio, a local farmer. They shoot and kill him, after which they take his Toyota pickup van. This move is highly calculated as the pickup is meant to ease their logistical struggles and make it possible for them to navigate the village easily. They then head to the home of the former inspector of police, killing him mercilessly. They then proceed to murder Rosendo Guzman, killing him as his wife watched on. As if that is not enough, they then proceed to the Ocache district and brutally kill five family members (Trent 2012).\n\nThey were a father, his three sons, and his son in law. Luckily, the children and women that had been locked in the rooms escaped through the windows. Otherwise, they too would have ended up dead. To prove that they were indeed responsible for the killings, they went on to paint the group’s initials on the roofs of all the homes they had visited (InSight Crime n.d.). Overall the group operated by using combat tactics to fight the forces and guerrilla units. Thus, they were in constant fights with the police and military.\n\nAs evidence of the group’s violation of human rights, one report submitted in 2005 to the human rights commission ascertained that, in 2004 alone, the AUC was liable for 342 counts of hostilities (InSight Crime n.d.). The various violations of human rights that the group was accused of are forcefully displacing people from their homes, recruiting demobilized people to the group, senseless killing of people, raping of innocent women and children, threats, kidnapping, looting wealth and intimidating innocent people through their actions to ascertain their power. Due to their defenseless nature, the group’s core target was indigenous communities.\n\nThey also constantly attacked and killed trade unionists, who, to them, were interference with people at work. Despite these crimes, the human rights watch has noted that there are people within the police and the Columbian military army who continually collaborate and support these insurgents (Arnson 2004). A specific example is how the organization developed a close relationship with Calabrian ‘Ndrangheta when it was under the leadership of Salvatore Mancuso.\n\nDissolution\n\nThe AUC first dissolved in 2002, which was informed by the need to eliminate its association with drug traffickers. Carlos, who was the group leader at the time, openly declared in 2003 that he was considering peaceful negotiations with the government, after which the group would be disbanded. However, most of the group members were against the idea of peace talks and dissolution of the group. Despite the resistance, Carlos proceeded with the talks with the promise of disbanding the group and acting in collaboration with the government towards a unilateral cease-fire (Trent 2012). However, the desired results were not accomplished as the government, and the AUC were not open. Thus, the demobilization process did not take place.\n\nFurthermore, it was not on the government’s plan to offer the AUC extradition immunity members or to completely write off their crimes. Thus, the militant group was discouraged; they felt short-changed and resorted to their prior activities a year after the peace talks. Other attempts to hold a peaceful talk were erased when Vincent, the vice-leader, ordered his brother Carlos’s assassination. Thus, the group had engaged in killing 2,000 innocent civilians by the beginning of the peace talks (Layús 2010). In response, the United States Government started pressuring the Colombian government to take up the same tough stance it had taken when combating the activities of the FARC to curb the group’s illegal activities.\n\nIn 2005, the AUC and the Colombian government were able to reach an agreement. One of the initiatives that were agreed on was incorporating the Justice and Peace Law (The Guerrilla Groups in Colombia n.d.). The justice and peace law is a mechanism of transitional justice that was keen on the conviction of paramilitary members, sentencing offenders, and minimizing the jail terms of convicted offenders and other high ranking officials when they confessed their crimes and returned what they had stolen. Vincente finally ran away because the government was taking a no-compromise approach with the remaining group members. However, most human rights organizations condemned the government for giving the organization a very lenient deal.\n\nNevertheless, the peace talks between the group and the government were concluded in 2006, with the AUC completing the demobilization process (Layús 2010). However, there is no accurate figure on the number that is demobilized. Some reports state that about 4,000 members were demobilized by 2006, while others state that all the 30,000 members of the group were demobilized by 2006 (InSight Crime n.d.).\n\nThe majority of the AUC leaders were later extradited to the United States in 2008 (AUC – Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia 2011). Nonetheless, local groups that succeeded in the organization is still existing. An existing de-facto group is the Black Eagles, whose operations are carried out under the AUC name. An example of their radical behavior was evidenced by the various sanctions and threats issued to the Sarare FM Stereo, stating that the reporters should desist from engaging in discussing matters that were out of the radio station’s mandate. The threats further asserted that, should this warning be ignored, then the station’s reporters and their family members would be at risk (Arnson 2004).\n\nThe next day, the initials, A.U.C were drawn at their office front. The de-facto group was likely angered by the radio station’s participation in human rights matters as they had earlier attended a public meeting on the same, on 27 September 2007. The key agenda of the meeting was to denounce the AUC violations of human rights.\n\nHowever, there has been selective acceptance concerning the continuity of the group. Most reports continue to deny the AUC’s existence even after these threats were issued to Sartre FM (United Self-Defense Forces/Group of Colombia (AUC – Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia 2011). Nonetheless, there is a considerable level of acceptance on the group’s re-emergence, stating that the group’s actions are now towards private business in Ecuador and Colombia.\n\nStill, the government continues to deny that any paramilitary group in the country, despite some people claiming that they were indeed active group members of the AUC, post its demobilization in 2006. On the other hand, former AUC members who willingly demobilized from the group were paroled in 2013 just as had been agreed with Justice and Peace law (Arnson 2004). Also, there has been a re-emergence of several successor groups linked with the group assumed to have been formed by mid-level commanders of the paramilitary organization that is assumed to have been left out of the justice program were not demobilized.\n\nContinuity (Existence and Operation)\n\nEven though the demobilization and disbarment process has been completed, it is not clear whether the influence of AUC still lives on. One report from the northern part of the country has espoused that the group’s activities are still in continuity, though in a small capacity (International Crisis Group 2007). The existing small units continue to engage in the group’s former activities, such as killing innocent people, extortion, and abduction. In effect, the government has commanded the security organizations to increase their efforts to ensure better citizen protection and zero reoccurrences of insurgent activities.\n\nFurther, the AUC three founders’ whereabouts are also unknown as it is alleged that they are either dead or have disappeared. While it is assumed that Vincente’s killing took place in 2007, his death, just like his brother’s Fidel, has never been ascertained. Vincente is also alleged to have killed his brother Carlos due to the conflict they had over the peace talk deal. However, none of this can be ascertained. Therefore, the whereabouts of these three brothers remain a mystery to be unveiled.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe activities of guerrilla groups necessitated the formation of paramilitary groups. One such group was the AUC, whose initial motive was to offer protection for the local communities. However, as drug traffickers gained more economic power and began financing the group’s activities, their operation motives evolved. In turn, they offered protection for drug lords, attacking guerrilla groups and any sympathizers, including civilians. They also engaged in terrorist acts like kidnapping, rape, killings, extortion, among others. With President Uribe’s election, however, there was the containment of the groups as he sought to establish peace talks with them.\n\nSlowly, the group was dissolved, and operations ceased. It is believed that the group members have since died, though there is limited evidence to back the claim. Despite reports of the group’s non-existence, other small units have since been formed, and their mode of operation is similar to that of the AUC. Thus, it is quite hard to substantiate whether the group still exists or not.\n\nReference List\n\nArnson, CJ 2004, ‘The peace process in Colombia with the Autodefensas Unidas de Colombia – AUC,’ The Wilson Centre.

      "Henry Ford, American Industrialist and Inventor Essay (Biography)\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Early Life\n 2. Early Career\n 3. Ford Motor Company\n 4. The Person and The Achievements\n 5. Works Cited\n\nHenry Ford was born in 1863 in Michigan to become one of the greatest men in the history of America and the entire world (Gelderman par. 1-2). His visionary approach to the automobile industry promoted the innovations of cars and assembly lines and contributed greatly to the modern concepts of mass production and personal transport.\n\nEarly Life\n\nFord was the son of farmers, but he did not want to follow his father’s steps; instead, he demonstrated talents for other things. When telling his story, the Henry Ford museum emphasizes that Henry showed interest in building and engineering since childhood. For example, he constructed “rudimentary” water wheels and steam engines (“Henry Ford” par. 2).\n\nMoreover, Ford engaged other youngsters in these activities and managed to organize their work. Apart from that, he learned to fix watches himself. In fact, it might be more accurate to state that he taught himself to do it, and it was another talent of Henry Ford: he wanted knowledge, and he learned to find it by exploring, investigating, making mistakes, and fixing them. Watches became his “textbook,” and he learned about the “rudiments of machine design” with their help (“Henry Ford” par. 2).\n\nEarly Career\n\nIn 1879, young Ford went to work as an apprentice at the Michigan Car Company in Detroit, which started his quest for jobs that could provide him with more knowledge of mechanics. He always sought for the jobs that offered the opportunity to learn something new (“Henry Ford” par. 4). In 1882, he came back to his family farm but kept working with machinery: the steam engines that the farmers used or odd jobs at Detroit factories took up his time. However, it was also clear that he did not really enjoy working for someone else.\n\nIn 1888, he got married and moved to Detroit. Ford chose to work for the Edison Electric Illuminating Company because he needed to know more about electricity (“Henry Ford” par. 5). In five years, he was taking the post of the chief engineer in the Company, but Ford also worked in another direction: he was among those 19th-century people who were trying to build the “horseless carriage”. His first model, the Quadricycle, appeared in 1896. It had heavy wheels that reminded one of bicycles but no reverse. His second car was created in 1898, and Ford grew ambitious enough to create his own company that would manufacture his carriages.\n\nFord Motor Company\n\nWhen Ford first started to take up business, it turned out that he needed to learn about this sphere of human activities as well. He did it in the same way as before: started two companies and learned through errors that the ventures did not survive. Ford, however, did not give up, and his visionary leadership skills together with the rising popularity of racing cars provided him with the investing that helped him create the Ford Motor Company in 1903.\n\nThe Company was geared by Ford’s vision of a “motorcar for the great multitude” that would be constructed of highest-quality materials with the help of the simplest of designs and sold at the smallest price possible (Ford 106). What Ford wanted is an affordable but a quality car, and for that, he attracted the most talented people to his company. These people, who he picked himself for his team, created the famous Model T, and in 1908, the wide public could get acquainted with it (“Henry Ford” par. 8).\n\nThe recipe for the success of the Model T corresponded to Ford’s vision: it was indeed high-quality and relatively cheap, but what is more, it was easy to operate even on a rough road. The success, however, prompted the next greatest achievement of Ford: his employment of assembly line. According to Ford himself, “it is better to sell a large number of cars at a reasonably small margin than to sell fewer cars at a large margin of profit” (p. 232). To reach the economies of scale that he wanted, he made several steps (Watts 279).\n\nFirst, he moved to a bigger factory at the Highland Park that provided him with the opportunity to produce more cars. Then he tried to decrease their cost with the help of his own, customized assembly line. This line concept was based on the ideas from watch, gun, and bicycle makes as well as meat packers; apart from that, Ford and the team introduced their own ideas, and the final technique was developed by the end of 1913. When the workers complained about the repetitive work, Ford raised their wage, which led to two positive outcomes: the turnover rates at the factory dropped, and the employees received the opportunity to become the consumers as well. By 1922, every second car in the US was the Model T (“Henry Ford” par. 10).\n\nUnfortunately, these figures made Ford overconfident. He bought out the enterprise, which gave him the complete control over its operations. He was certain that Model T was the perfect car, so he tried to deny the declining sales until it was impossible. After that, new Ford models did appear, but none of them repeated the Model T success. Because of the competition, Ford Motor Company soon became the third in the US market. During the Great Depression, the wages of the workers dropped, and many layoffs followed. Ford also did not want to deal with the Workers Union, but eventually was forced to sign a contract with them. Ford remained influential, of course, and his Company contributed greatly to the victory over the Nazism in the World War II by supplying the US military with vehicles. Still, the glorious success of Model T was over, and in 1945, Henry Ford officially retired.\n\nThe Person and The Achievements\n\nHenry Ford died in 1947 (Gelderman par. 1). He was not a man without a flaw. He never tried to receive formal education and stayed distrustful to things he did not know. He was an idealist, but it somehow combined this trait with a mean-spirited attitude to the people who surrounded him (Watts xiii). He had a bright personality that always attracted the attention of the media, but the headlines about him could both praise and condemn him (Gelderman par. 2). Still, his complex personality fueled the change that he brought upon our world.\n\nIt is noteworthy that Ford did not invent the automobile as such, and the assembly line was not created by him (“Henry Ford” par. 1). However, his methods of using the assembly line for factory production have been termed as “revolutionary” (Gelderman par. 1). He acted as an innovator by promoting the ideas that might have stayed unnoticed and turned them into an important part of our everyday life. He was visionary and creative, ingenious and hard-working, and very ambitious. These ambitions helped him make his visions come true. They also have determined the American society and industry to an extent that few other people can be as commended or blamed for our modern lifestyle, and he will always be remembered for that (Watts xv).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFord, Henry.

      "Mirror Neurons and Social Functioning Essay\n\nHow Mirror neurons are Involved in Social Functioning?\n\nA wide range of studies assigns mirror neurons a crucial role in the process of complex social functioning. In particular, scholars emphasize the role of active participation of mirror neurons in socio-cognitive activities. Kilner and Lemon (2013) claim that social cognitive functions include obtaining information, interpreting it, and forming a response to the intentions, opinions, and behavior of other people that underlie social interaction.\n\nIn other words, social functioning determines how people think about themselves and others in a social context (Cook, Bird, Catmur, Press, & Heyes, 2014; Kilner & Lemon, 2013). The core difference between social cognitive functions and non-social ones is in their content associated with social interaction.\n\nThe discovery of mirror neurons is considered one of the most remarkable and essential ones among the latest achievements in neuroscience. Hamilton (2013) defines mirror neuron system (MNS) as “the set of brain regions which are active both when participants perform an action and when they observe another person performing the same action” (p. 95). These neurons reflect the actions of others by transferring them from the observed one to the observer and activating the motor skills of the latter that assumes the use of his or her experience to recognize or discern the observed action. The significance of mirror neurons lays in the fact that they opened access to neural mechanisms that allow understanding other people (Borg, 2013).\n\nWith the exploration of mirror neurons, it becomes clear that the brain can understand the actions of others through the implementation of others’ actions or, in other words, feeling what they experience while executing the same action.\n\nOne of the arguments in favor of MNS is the theory of mind that is inherent only to a man and refers to the ability to understand the consciousness of another person and/or conclude his or her intentions. The term encompasses a wide range of skills and includes an understanding of false beliefs, hints, intentions, deceptions, metaphors, ironies, mistakes, etc. (Bohl & van den Bos, 2012; Simonetti, 2014). Such comprehension can be carried out using motor mechanisms, and mirror neurons can be involved in the theory of mind. There are at least three arguments that support the role of mirror neurons.\n\nFirst, it is possible to compare the regions of the brain involved in the social functioning, the activity, and the system of mirror neurons (Gallese, 2013). If the theory of mind relies on the activity of mirror neurons, then it is expected to observe their activity in practice. For example, studies regarding the theory of mind with the use of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) give similar results to the activation of brain structures that are obtained in studies of a system of mirror neurons, as stated by Mehta, Thirthalli, Basavaraju, Gangadhar, and Pascual-Leone (2013). It is possible to suggest then that the medial prefrontal cortex, posterior temporal, and temporal poles participate in the formation of the theory of mind (Mike et al., 2013). Secondly, some studies were developed specifically aimed at assessing the understanding of the intentions behind an action. Thirdly, the social function of mirror neurons in people with disorders of the theory of mind can be studied to understand such phenomena as autism or aphasia.\n\nEmpathy presents one more argument that can be explained as a consequence of mirror neurons. It is determined by the ability of a person to put himself or herself in the place of another, thus attributing thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. As noted in the study by Lamm and Majdandžić (2015), the recent experimental evidence strongly supports the view that one can understand other people’s intentions, beliefs, or feelings, imitating them inside, as if he or she is experiencing similar mental states, emotions, or sensations.\n\nThis phenomenon is called the chameleon effect: the more people tend to imitate others, the more they tend to be empathetic (Oosterhof, Tipper, & Downing, 2013). One of the ways to empathize is to imitate the facial expressions and postures of other people. Thus, taking into account the role of mirror neurons in imitation, it is also rational to assume their role in empathy.\n\nSocial interactions also play an integral role in social functioning and are caused by mirror neurons, predicting the actions of the observer. In particular, they create a link between the behavior of social partners. This relationship is mutual. During most social interactions, there is not one observable or one observer, since both partners act as the source and as the goal of the social situation. Therefore, it is rather important to study the nature of mutual influence in social relations within the framework of a system of mirror neurons. Kasai, Fukuda, Yahata, Morita, and Fujii (2015) conducted a study, recording the activity of the brain simultaneously in two interacting monkeys and demonstrated how this system of mirror neurons acts with the help of modern analysis techniques. Whenever monkeys cooperate to achieve the goal together, an important element of social interaction goes beyond the action itself: both partners need to keep the goals and rules in mind.\n\nAnother argument that specifies the role of mirror neurons in social functioning refers to emotions. Many experiments indicate that brain regions, especially those coding for specific sensory modalities or emotions that one feels, also become active, when one looks at other persons and feels the same sensations or emotions. It is assumed that the mirror mechanism takes effect not only when one evaluates others’ actions, but also when he or she as if experiences other people’s feelings.\n\nSo, observation of photos or videos with different facial expressions that convey emotions, be it discomfort, happiness, pain, or a combination of different emotions, activates the regions of the anterior islet (central lobe) that is also activated as a result of various emotional states provoked by olfactory, taste, or nociceptive stimuli (Maranesi et al., 2013). For example, the appearance of wounded body parts implying pain can indirectly cause activation of mirror neurons. Thus, these data suggest that the concept of emotional states can be triggered by various sources of information that signal that another individual experience similar emotional states.\n\nArguments Against the Role of Mirror neurons in Social Functioning\n\nDespite the evidence that supports the role of mirror neurons in social functioning, some studies argue that it is not clear and completely correct. For example, it is debatable how important the language is with regards to them (Kana, Libero, Hu, Deshpande, & Colburn, 2012). The above work demonstrates that the areas that are involved in the language process, also provide the theory of mind. Some approaches indicate that the language is not required for the mentioned concept. For instance, children with certain language disorders and even patients with severe aphasias do not experience difficulties with the theory of mind, as noted by Perlovsky and Ilin (2013). This probably means that the language is not a mandatory requirement in this case.\n\nSpeaking of MRI studies, it should be noted that skeptics argue that magnetic stimulation causes involuntary twitching of the facial muscles, and this can greatly distract a person from thinking about the actions of another, which means that the result of those experiments is difficult to unambiguously interpret. Mirror neurons help scholars to interpret someone else’s behavior. However, for example, and Hauser (2014) working at the University of California at Irvine, the US believes that the effect observed in the experiment is too small to be able to speak of a disturbing interpretation. According to them, “motor actions alone are insufficient to explain\n\naction understanding, that animals comprehend many actions that they cannot execute, and that sensorimotor learning can transform the mirror system ” (Hickok & Hauser, 2014, p. 594). The authors of the work respond to this that the magnetic effect only suppresses, but does not completely disable the work of neurons, so it would be inappropriate to expect a full effect in this case.\n\nIn their turn, Enticott et al. (2013) reckon that the major problem is that mirror neuron are responsible only for observation and execution. They are activated only in cognitive processes, although nothing indicates a causal mechanism. All available evidence indicates that they are only the result of imitation, intersubjectivity, language, and involvement, but not their cause (Spaulding, 2013). It should also be stressed that the attributes of participation and imitations arise in the brain of a thinking person, and not actually in the information that shows only the co-activation of these neurons in the performance of execution and observation functions.\n\nSpaulding (2012) also warns that it is necessary to carefully perceive the conclusions obtained based on neural images as scholars merely beginning to understand the coherence of the work of the brain. The fact of activation of one of the brain areas in itself does not provide much information about the processes taking place at this time. One more purely observation can be noted: although this has not yet been fully clarified, the activation observed in functional magnetic resonance seems to simultaneously excite and inhibit the activity of brain neurons (Mier et al., 2012). As a result, people are most likely tend to assume that when one of the brain areas is activated, it is a unitary process, even though it can be different or caused by the opposite processes.\n\nConsidering the arguments for and against mirror neurons’ role in social functioning, it seems critical to emphasize that such studies still help to better understand how people understand others, even if it does not depend on the mirror neurons. The desire of people to understand their brain and how it acts is one of the most fascinating tasks that humanity has set to accomplish. However, despite the considerable achievements, its solution is only at the very beginning of the path, and every study is essential.\n\nReferences\n\nBohl, V., & van den Bos, W. (2012).

      "US Corporate Taxes Improvement and Alternatives Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nMany proposals have been put forward in the United States to reform the corporate tax system into a better and adaptable system as the current system hinders the American companies’ competitiveness. These proposals are aimed at reducing the country corporate income tax rate, which is very high as compared to those of other countries. Some of these include Dave Camps (R_MI) proposal of reducing the corporate tax rate to 25 percent, Sen Rob (R-OH) proposal to overhaul corporate tax, president’s commission of lowering the corporate tax rate to 28 percent and Sen Ron and Dans proposal to lower the corporate tax rate to 24%.\n\nAttractive proposal for U.S. corporate taxpayers\n\nDave Camps the chairperson of the House ways and means committee proposal of lowering the corporate tax rate from 39.2 % to 25 % is the most appropriate to the U.S. corporate taxpayers (Ernst & Young 2011). His proposal is aimed at exempting foreign income obtained from controlled corporations and minimizes shifting investment income abroad. His proposal would retain a few elements of the present international system like the anti-deferral rules with some modification of making them attractive to the US corporate taxpayers. This proposal is not only going to attract investors but also enables the US multinational companies to increase their competitiveness in the global economy (Anderson, K. E., Pope, T. R., & Kramer, J. L. 2013). Camp proposes that this will be achieved through, developing a new group of subpart F ‘’foreign base company excess intangible income’’ developing another group “low tax cross border income and finally group three for the foreign intangible tax income. All these will minimize the foreign income exempted.\n\nImpact to corporations and the US economy\n\nRepatriation of the foreign profits will have a great impact on both the US economy and the corporations; first, reduction of unemployment. There will be a favorable business environment encouraging investments. There are high chances of an increase in research and developments in the country mainly because many companies will operate in the United States and will hire skilled and unskilled personnel from the country.\n\nThe repatriation process will also increase the total US income; since many companies will relocate, back home and their tax revenues will benefit the country. Also, it will encourage companies to repatriate most of the foreign income that could have been invested overseas, this results to increase revenue income in the short term. This income can be spent in the country development programs and hence boost the country development goals.\n\nRepatriation also increases the amount of share revenues earned by the shareholders; this income will be spent in the United States and thus will result in shareholders satisfaction and the country benefits from money circulation.\n\nCorporate taxes I would propose to be eliminated\n\nI would eliminate the corporate income tax and increase the capital gains tax rate. This will make the US tax system fairer, simple and rational. Eliminating the corporate income tax, avoidance and evasion will reduce. The elimination of the corporate income tax will also encourage the repatriation of income to overseas holding which done to avoid the high taxations. This is harmful in that it hinders growth by affecting the wage level negatively since an increase in the corporate rate will result to increase in the corporate tax resulting in companies devoting resources to avoid or minimize it and thus increasing the cost of its collection. Thus, it will not reduce the amount of income received by the United States as argued in some studies, instead, it will attract many investors and they are very many positive impacts associated with this investment.\n\nThe elimination of corporate income tax will cause divided income will also cease because cooperate tax is charged together with dividend tax and this will make the US most favorable country for both local and foreign investors. This is mainly because most companies will be able to maximize their profits and increase the shareholder’s returns. I would also eliminate the double taxation policy as it hinders many investors from investing in a country. This will guarantee high investor attraction and the growth of the country development. Double taxation hurts foreign companies since they have to pay tax at the home and the foreign country, this reduces the shareholder’s fund, and to avoid these most companies tend to invest in countries where double taxation does no longer exists to maximize their profits.\n\nConsumption tax should also be abolished as it is costly to collect and the income obtained from it is insignificant. The elimination of this tax will result in increased economic growth. Though it does not have a direct impact on companies its elimination will make investing cheaper to the companies and this will be profitable to the economy.\n\nPositive and negative impacts of the proposed elimination of tax\n\nThe positive impact of eliminating the corporate income tax includes the huge income that will result from investor attraction and the income repatriation. Also, there will be job creation as many companies invest in the country. The wage level will also increase since there will be no more increase in wages as a result of an increase in the rate of corporate – income tax ( Toder, Eric & Joseph Rosenberg 2010). The abolition of double taxation will promote the competitiveness of the home companies as they will not have to pay tax twice, also it will make the US an attractive foreign investment.\n\nPresident’s Advisory Panel on Federal Tax Reform, (2005) stated that the elimination of the above costs would also result in long-term US economic growth, increase the US companies’ competitiveness in the market, lead to better living standards, increase entrepreneurship /productivity and encourage foreign direct investment.\n\nAlternative tax method for corporations\n\nThe following is an alternative proposal to the current corporate tax in the US together with the benefits that will result if it is applied.\n\nI will reduce the corporate tax rate to 23 %. This will make the US companies competitive as the rate is not too high nor low as compared to the rest of the countries this will also minimize the number of companies that prefer investing in foreign countries and increase the country’s employment/ wage level. I will also abolish the double taxation tax as it hinders companies from investing due to double taxation.\n\nApply a 90% deduction on foreign dividend income received from Controlled Foreign Companies. This will minimize the total divided tax and help the states be competitive globally.\n\nI would also subject 10 percent of the divided received to taxation. In addition to these, I would treat the United States company foreign branches as controlled foreign corporations.\n\nThese would encourage most companies to invest at home especially the reduction of the corporate income tax rate; it would also have a positive impact on the research and development.\n\nReferences\n\nAnderson, K.

      "Human Resource Services and Their Users Report\n\nOne of the principal users of HR services is a line manager. The key demands that a line manager addresses to HR service reside in an adequate evaluation of the employees’ needs and their sustainable training. From this perspective, it is expected that HR service performs an organizational function trying to create an environment that would be favorable for employees’ effective working. This includes maintaining good relationships within the workforce and resolving the conflict situations that essentially appear between colleagues. The second demand made on HR services on the part of a manager resides in assuring constant development of the professional capacity within the personnel. Another need of a more personal character that a line manager is likely to experience is the desire to receive a reward for his team.\n\nAnother user of HR services is an employee. This type of user has numerous needs, among which the dominant requests reside in being timely paid and objectively rewarded. These users are less interested in the team appraisals and more focused on the individual results and the prospects they might bring.\n\nFinally, the last user of HR services is a potential employee. In other words, it is a person that is currently undergoing a probation period. These types of users are the most demanding as they expect HR service to provide them with challenging tasks and, at the same time, they require that every single achievement is essentially noticed and rewarded. In the meantime, these types of users might be more concerned about team rewards than official employees.\n\nOn the whole, all the users of the HR services expect timely service delivery.\n\nFrom this perspective, HR services have to perform a large scope of functions simultaneously. To address the needs of a line manager and satisfy them, the service representatives have to maintain a stress-free atmosphere within a team and provide it with essential development facilities if necessary.\n\nIn the meantime, the situation is much more complicated in terms of assigning rewards. That is one of the key demands that each of the enlisted users makes on the HR service. From this point, HR professionals deal with a conflict of needs that are highly problematic to prioritize. Thus, for instance, the needs of a line manager should be considered more significant than those of a potential employee. Nevertheless, it might turn out that the achievements of the latter are more considerable in terms of a company’s prosperity.\n\nIdeally, the HR service should find an alternative solution so that each interested party assumes that its interests are given the highest priority. Though, in practice, finding such a solution is sometimes literary impossible. Then, it is most reasonable for HR professionals to set priorities by corporate benefit and organizational profit. In other words, the rewards should be assigned to those users who perform the largest contribution to the company’s development without a reference to the hierarchical positions. One of the first steps that an HR professional should make is to study the key behavior patterns of all the users and find the most effective approach to fulfilling their requests. Otherwise, it would be hard to identify what motives underpin each user’s need.\n\nTo fulfill the needs of each user, the HR service has to search for alternative ways and effective communication methods. A large scope of variants exists in the relevant context. Thus, for example, the simplest and yet, one of the most beneficial ways of communication is a face to face dialogue. The relevant method might be employed to resolve urgent problems at any level.\n\nThe key advantage of a face to face dialogue resides in the fact that it allows receiving an immediate response from one of the parties that is often critical in dealing with urgent problems. It is essential to note, that, in a broader sense, a face to face communication does not only imply a dialogue but might comprise group meetings as well. Therefore, it turns out that this type of communication is appropriate for addressing all types of users.\n\nIn the meantime, the method has some disadvantages. Thus, in case a manager needs his collocutor to remember the details of some important case or order, he or she will essentially have to repeat this information in a written form so that a supplementary communication method will be required.\n\nAnother communication method that should be mentioned is a written communication that includes sending reports and letters directly to the service user. This method is particularly beneficial in terms of significant documents and in the course of discussing some crucial decisions. From this perspective, its principal advantage resides in the fact that both parties have printed evidence of the agreement or refusal to do something. However, it should be admitted that this method is considered old-dated due to the widespread of electronic resources that surpass the efficiency of this method by any definition.\n\nLastly, the third method of communication available to HR service for addressing its users is electronic communication – in particular, the employment of electronic mail. This communication method is almost similar to the one described above except for the fact that it is much more efficient and productive in terms of time-consuming. Thus, within a single click, an addressee receives all the necessary information that can be safely stored for the intended period. Meanwhile, large amounts of data circling through electronic resources create certain risks to information security.\n\nAs it has been already mentioned above, the main request set for the HR service resides ineffective service delivery. However, a closer examination of this demand shows that to fulfill it, the HR service needs to carry out a series of related activities. Hence, they, first and foremost, are supposed to maintain stable and good relationships not only with their external clients but within the internal users of the service as well.\n\nWhatever paradoxical it might seem, but it is not only clients that the epithet “difficult” might be applied to – the resolutions of inner conflicts, as well as handling the complaints of managers and employees, require a lot of time and effort on the part of the HR service. Moreover, the service professionals are also responsible for ensuring timely service delivery that is directly connected with increasing the company’s profit. Thence, the service’s activity is, to a certain extent, associated with budget management as well. Finally, the last element of effective service delivery is the assurance of continuous improvement. From this perspective, the work of the HR service is critical for the company’s prosperity as it helps to increase its competitive advantage.\n",
      "Immigration Pros and Cons for the United States Essay\n\nImmigration in the United States is the source of both advantages and disadvantages for the nation’s economy. It is an extremely complicated subject as in many cases foreign labor and resources are the foundations of the financial success of the American businesses. At the same time, the number of undocumented illegal immigrants in the country is truly enormous and this creates a serious pressure on the economy of the United States as many of the immigrants obtain financial help from the government and bring no significant profit to the economy. Besides, the growing rates of immigration result in the presence of large numbers of criminal elements in the country which is dangerous to the national security (“USA Immigration Problems” par. 1).\n\nCurrently, the leaders of the United States have developed and enforced a variety of programs and reform in order to minimize the rates of the illegal immigration. Among the problems facilitated by the illegal immigration there are failed allocation of the tax-payer money, reduction of the number of the available jobs for the citizens, decrease of wages, growing rates of crime within the country, as well as domestic terrorism (“Problems with Illegal Immigration” par. 2).\n\nThere is a growing dissatisfaction with the decisions of President Obama who is recognized as a supporter of illegal immigration and the provider of various freedoms and benefits designed to protect the illegal dwellers. These actions are seen as the ones directed against the freedoms of the American citizens. That way, an appropriate solution for the immigration problem in the United States remains unknown. Among the main options, there are the deportation of all the individuals dwelling in the US without legal permission, or the opposite measure – the assignment of citizenship for them all. The first option seems quite impossible because to keep the illegal immigrants from Mexico alone the United States would have to build a massive wall along the border (that is extremely long), and invest in constant and careful supervision of the border by the military personnel. Besides, the illegal immigrants from all the other countries will still remain unaddressed. As for the second option, it is likely to attract even more immigrants and aggravate the issues of job loss and decreasing wages as well as domestic crime and terrorism.\n\nThe provision of citizenship to all the undocumented individuals living in the United States is the humane way to approach the problem of illegal immigration. That way, these individuals will be required to find a job in order to obtain benefits from healthcare and education. Besides, their labor will finally make them contribute to the country’s economy so their benefits will be covered at least partially. At the same time, to prevent the arrival of the new illegal immigrants, the United States is to adjust its entry policies, and take more advanced control of the border with Mexico. Building a wall, of course, would be quite a radical measure, but patrolling, and the involvement of more military workers into the protection of the border from the fence-jumpers could be very helpful.\n\nIn conclusion, the United States’ leaders are torn apart by an ethical and financial dilemma. Their country suffers from extremely high rates of illegal immigration that causes a list of issues in such spheres as the economy, healthcare, and national security. This problem is difficult to eliminate since thousands or even millions of people’s lives are at stake.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nProblems with Illegal Immigration . n. d.

      "The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano Essay\n\nThesis Statement\n\nThere is no doubt that Black slavery will go down in history as one of the most shameful periods in European and American history. Just if they were soulless animals, Black Africans used to be rounded up and shipped over to various locations, throughout the world, where they would be required to perform a heavy physical labour, while being often subjected to physical abuse, on the part of their masters. At the time, it was very little known about what it felt like being a slave, among White people, because the overwhelming majority of Black slaves were illiterate, which meant that they simply could not relate their life experiences in the form of literary works.\n\nIn fact, these slaves were not even considered being humans, in the full sense of this word. Christianity was there to provide an ideological legitimacy for such state of affairs, with Blacks being considered to be the descendants of Ham – cursed to have dark skin and doomed to remain servants forever. Yet, as time went by, more and more Black slaves began to question the moral soundness of the very concept of slavery. Some of them were able to get an education, due to their owners’ progressive socio-political attitudes. It is namely these ‘privileged slaves’, which had provided White people with internal insight onto slavery, for the first time in history.\n\nThe earliest first-hand account of slavery, written by a former slave in 1789, is assumed to be Olaudah Equiano’s The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa , in which author does not simply describe his life experiences of a person who had been bought and sold numerous times, but also refers to slavery as utterly immoral practice. Even though that many contemporary literary critics point out to the fact that Equiano could not possibly had been born in Africa, as he claims in his book, there can be very little doubt as to his autobiography’s overall authenticity.\n\nIn its turn, this allows us to refer to The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa as a book of not only a great literary, but also a philosophical value, because in it, author does not simply describe his life experiences, but also analyses them from a truly unique prospective of someone whose mentality has dual subtleties – while being Black on the outside, Equiano considered himself being White on the inside: “I believe there are few events in my life which have not happened to many; it is true the incidents of it are numerous, and, do I consider myself an European” (p. 6).\n\nTherefore, we can only agree with Thomas (2000), who in her book suggested that Equiano’s autobiographical book cannot be thought of as being solely the intellectual by-product of Black mentality, simply because, while criticizing the practice of slavery, Equiano never ceases praising European civilization, thus proving its own worldview as being utterly euro-centric.\n\nIn its turn, this provides us with the insight onto the essence of the foremost message, Equiano wanted to deliver to his readers. This message can be formulated as follows: freedom can only be fully appreciated by educated and open-minded individuals, whose broadened intellectual horizons allow them to think outside of their racial affiliation.\n\nAs one of greatest African-American writers, Booker T. Washington (1901) had put it in his book Up from Slavery : “The individual who can do something that the world wants done will, in the end, make his way regardless of his race” (Ch. X). In the next part of this paper, we will aim to substantiate the validity of an earlier statement, while pointing out at particulars of how Equiano strived to reduce any negative perception of himself, on part of the audience – namely, by emphasizing the fact that he was born to the family of African nobility and by confirming the strength of his determination to become an educated individual.\n\nMain Part\n\nAs we have suggested earlier, the reading of Equiano’s book leaves very little doubt as to author’s perceptional euro-centrism. In its turn, this explains why, throughout his book, author had made a point in mentioning the fact of his noble birth, whenever opportunity presented itself – hence, confirming his ‘otherness’ from the rest of Blacks in the eyes of readers: “My father was one of those elders or chiefs I have spoken of, and was styled Embrenche; a term, as I remember, importing the highest distinction, and signifying in our language a ‘mark’ of grandeur” (p. 14).\n\nGiven the fact that Equiano wrote his book in time when Europe was still being ruled by the members of Europe’s aristocratic families, it was only natural for him to end up praising the virtues of ‘noblesnesness’, while expecting to win favour with the reading audience, many members of which were affiliated with aristocracy, and therefore – literate. In its turn, this also explains another remarkable feature of Equiano’s book – throughout its entirety; author strived to promote his view on education as the only virtue worthy of praising: “I thought of nothing but being freed, and working for myself, and thereby getting money to enable me to get a good education; for I always had a great desire to be able at least to read and write” (p. 54).\n\nApparently, Equiano strived to attune the motifs of his book with what represented existential anxieties, on the part of great many White people, he had met during the course of his life. By the end of 18 th century, Western civilization was only beginning to free itself out of intellectual imprisonment of Christianity, which is why, just as it was the case with the author, intellectually advanced people of the era experienced an overwhelming desire to indulge in secular educational pursuits.\n\nThus, by confirming his dedication to studies, Equiano was able to kill two rabbits with one shot: to increase his book’s literary and philosophical value – hence, increasing its appeal to the public, and to promote the cause of abolitionism, because book’s narrator is being represented as someone who, just as Whites, appreciates education and intellectual finesse above all.\n\nThis is also the reason why, unlike what it is the case with the novels of many contemporary Black writers, who grew up among Whites, the themes contained in The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa, are being the least concerned with author’s intention to talk about his ‘ethnic uniqueness’ as something worthy of exploring. Apparently, Equiano aimed at referring to the specifics of one’s racial affiliation as such that have very little role in defining the social worth of a particular person.\n\nWhile criticising the practice of slavery, Equiano never ceased being aware of the fact that being a Black slave among Whites was still better than being a Black slave among Blacks, because in Western countries, even the people affiliated with lowest social classes, are still being given the chance of social advancement – Equiano’s own biography substantiates the validity of this suggestion better than anything else does.\n\nThe context of Equiano’s book implies that its author actually thought of the hardships, he experienced throughout his life, as having been proven beneficial, in the end. As it was pointed out by Washington, in the book from which we have already quoted: “Negro boy’s birth and connection with an unpopular race is an advantage, so far as real life is concerned.\n\nWith few exceptions, the Negro youth must work harder and must perform his tasks even better than a white youth in order to secure recognition” (Ch. II). According to Doyle (2008), Equiano can be best referred to as the classical ‘Nietzschean character’, as his book does promote an idea that ‘whatever does not kill us, makes us stronger’: “His (Equiano’s) African identity, furthermore, fundamentally changes the meaning of his experience: what Europeans would consider disastrous he must consider fortunate” (p. 198).\n\nIt is needless to say, of course, that such Equiano’s stoic attitude towards facing life’s challenges resonated rather well, with what represented the essence of colonial era’s socio-political discourse. At that time, it is namely European explorers’ industriousness, courageousness and the sheer strength of their will power, which were believed to have contributed to the process of Whites imposing their undisputed dominance over the Earth. Therefore, after having been published in 1789, The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano, or Gustavus Vassa was bound to become popular with White readers, as book’s motifs corresponded rather well with the unconscious workings of their psyche.\n\nEvidently enough, it was not simply by an accident that Equiano was able to turn from lowly slave into a respectable member of London’s society. One’s strong commitment to intellectual pursuits, regardless of his or her racial affiliation, has always been known as utterly self-rewarding, because it is specifically this commitment which allows a concerned individual to act as the agent of social, cultural and scientific progress – hence, wining the hearts of those who benefit from such a progress.\n\nReferences\n\nDoyle, Laura.

      "“The Blue Gardens” Restaurant Business Idea Proposal Essay\n\nIntroduction of the Proposed Business\n\nThe proposed business will be a restaurant that will be located in the city of Chicago. The decision to start a restaurant in this location was arrived at following one-month long research that was conducted to understand how customers’ needs are met. From this market research, it was established that there is a market segment that has been ignored by almost all the current firms existing in the market.\n\nIn Chicago, the size of the middle-class population has been increasing. Young adults now have decent jobs in various companies in this city. Some of these young men are keen on getting quiet places where they can take their meals in privacy. Our research revealed that most of them are not very comfortable with the open-space design that is common in most of the existing restaurants. For that reason, we considered it appropriate to come up with a unique product, The Blue Gardens Restaurant, which will meet their unique needs in the market. In this essay, the researcher focuses on how this business can be put into operation, challenges that may arise, and how these challenges can be addressed in order to ensure that this business is a success.\n\nType of Business Entity\n\nThe business entity that has been chosen is a restaurant. The main products that will be offered here will be various types of foods and drinks. However, The Blue Gardens Restaurant will try to offer an experience, other than the products mentioned above. These products will be part of the experience that our customers will get. In fact, these products are available in other rival firms. However, the experience that they will be offered will be unique, given that the restaurant will be targeting young adults.\n\nThe products offered, design of the restaurant, the lighting that will be used, the music in the background, and the choice of colors, the waiters and the waitresses, the payment mode, and post-purchase services will all make the experience that this firm will offer to its clients. As Finch (2013) says, in the service industry, experience economy has become very important, and only those firms that have realized how it works can achieve success.\n\nCustomers are no longer keen on the products and services offered to them because most of the firms have perfected the nature of their products. The focus has now turned to the experience the customers get when they visit these facilities (Abrams & Abrams, 2003).\n\nOur firm will be operating in the hospitality industry where experience the customers get defines their ability to make repeat visits. The middle-class young adults were considered a more attractive market segment because of a number of reasons. These clients have the potential to afford to pay for the products that we will offer. Our products are designed to offer value based on their own tastes and preferences. Moreover, most of them have just started staying away from their families have graduated from colleges and secured good jobs. They may find preparing their own meals a little challenging. Our firm will be there for them, offering them unique products to meet their needs.\n\nSteps Needed To Successfully and Legally Start the Business\n\nIn order to start this business, there are steps that will have to be followed in order to make The Blue Gardens Restaurant a legal business. The first few steps have been conducted. These steps include conducting market research to determine the size of the market, the specific products needed, how to deliver the products to the customers, and the location of the business premise. Our team has also determined the amount of money needed to start this business entity, the number, and type of employees, the cost of these employees, among other issues of internal operations. The next step will be to undertake processes that will make this business to start as a legal entity. The steps include the following:\n\nBusiness structure\n\nThe first step in legalizing this business entity will be to define the business structure (Zaharuddin, 2009). Our business will be a partnership. We would have preferred a limited liability company, but we may consider that in the future because some of the requirements are way off our limits currently. This was a decision that was approved by all the partners.\n\nApplication of the business number\n\nThe next step that we will have to follow is to make an application for a business number. In order to operate legally in this country, we will need to have a business number that will be our identity when it comes to the issues of payment of taxes or other government obligations.\n\nChecking if the proposed business name is available\n\nWe will then go for a name search to determine if the proposed name, The Blue Gardens Restaurant, is available. If it is available, it will be registered against the business number. If it is not, then we will be forced to look for another name that is available.\n\nRegister the business name\n\nThe registration of the business name will be the formal acceptance by the government that our business entity is accepted legally and authorized to conduct business operations as defined by the applicants.\n\nRegister the website domain name\n\nIn the current digitized world, we will need to maintain an online presence. For this to be possible, we will need to put up a website that will help us to interact with our customers. We will register the domain name as per the name that was accepted during the name search stage.\n\nGet the certificate\n\nWe will wait for a few weeks for the certificate to be issued, identifying the business as a partnership to validate our operations.\n\nStart operations\n\nWhen all the above steps have been followed, and the business website is up and running, we will be able to start the operations immediately.\n\nA Draft of a Valid Contract with a Supplier\n\nIn this business, the suppliers will be very important in defining our success. The following is a draft of a valid contract of our relationship with one of the suppliers.\n\nContract for Supply of Vegetables\n\nThis is a contract made between The Green Suppliers Limited and The Blue Gardens Restaurant for the supply of vegetables for the period starting June 1, 2015, and ending December 31, 2015.\n\nDuties and obligation\n\n  * The seller and the buyer enter into an agreement that the supplier will be delivering 20 kilograms of the vegetables that will be bought at $ 15 per kilogram every morning before 10.30.\n  * The seller and the buyer enter into an agreement that the buyer will pay the cumulated amounts on or before the 4 th of every month.\n  * Any delays in the delivery of products or payment should be communicated in time and alternative mutually accepted by both parties.\n\nThe delivery mode of the product\n\nThe seller and the buyer agree that the products (vegetables) will be delivered by the seller through means that are convenient to the seller.\n\nBreach of the contract\n\nIn case the supplier fails to deliver the products as per the agreement without consulting and agreeing with the buyer, all previous payments will be forfeited.\n\nIn case the buyer fails to make the payments due for the seller without a mutually accepted reason, the buyer will be liable to a 25% fine of all the dues.\n\n  * Seller Date\n  * Buyer Date\n  * Witness Date\n\nEthical Considerations the Business\n\nWhen we start the operations, it will be important to put into consideration ethical concerns in order to enhance our sustainability. We will avoid any form of environmental degradation. We will establish a proper disposal mechanism. We will use modern cooking stoves to save energy. The firm will give customers a priority when it comes to meeting their needs in time and as per their desire. Our business will be responsible for the national and state government when it comes to payment of tax and other levies.\n\nSocial responsibility plans or attitudes that the business will embrace\n\nWe will engage in a number of corporate social responsibilities. The first two activities will be tree planting within the city and supporting sporting events for the youth in this city. We understand that most of our customers are sports enthusiasts. Supporting sporting events will be an activity acceptable to them.\n\nA Possible Disagreement That Could Be Encountered Among the Partners\n\nWe hope that when this firm starts the operations, we will not encounter any disagreements among the partners or the shareholders. However, we are conscious of the fact that such disagreements may not be avoided given that we are different individuals with varying business ideas. The main area of disagreement that may be encountered is how to reinvest the earned profits. However, we did not specify how to reinvest profits. One partner may feel that the profits should be shared while the other partner may feel that the profits should be reinvested. Unless this issue can be addressed amicably among the partners, it may be an issue with the potential of disrupting the operations of the firm.\n\nVarious Ways through which the Disagreements Could Be Resolved\n\nWhen such disagreements occur, the partners will have various means of resolving them. The first and most recommended way of solving the disagreement will be through dialogue. Each member will be given an opportunity to explain and justify his thoughts. From that, it may be possible to find common ground. When this fails to yield fruits, a mediator may be called in to act as a neutral person who will bring understanding and justice to the issue. If this fails to work out, then an arbiter will be called to guide the arbitration process. The parties will be legally expected to accept the decision of the arbiter. If this is not accepted by either of the parties, then the last resort will be a litigation process in a court of law.\n\nReferences\n\nAbrams, ‎R. & Abrams, R. (2003).

      "Chinese Ethnical Minorities and Sovereignty Essay\n\nWith the development of imperialism and the advancement of democracy, people started to identify themselves with nationality, religion, and culture. Nowadays, the Chinese ethnicities are diverse. Even though the ethnic groups are admitted to belong to the Chinese state, there are different approaches in regarding the cultural minority issue in the Western and the Eastern cultures that have distinct historical backgrounds. These approaches and the differences between them are described in the readings “Coming to terms with the nation” and “The politics of imagining Asia”.\n\nThe Chinese national identification has a long history. Nowadays China is regarded as a “home to fifty-six distinct peoples,” but in Qing Empire there were hundreds of ethnicities registered, and in the 12 th century there was only one ethnic group (Anderson and Mullaney 5). The changes can be explained by the cultural volatility that is dependent on geography, migration, and cultural interactions. Census was necessary for the political regulations and the consideration of the minor ethnic groups in the concept of citizenry and voting.\n\nThe region of the Yunnan province is the one that is the most culturally and linguistically diverse. Historically, the ethnicities that inhabited the region were regarded as minorities. But nowadays China “faces its most visible troubles precisely in the big minority areas – Tibet and Xinjiang” that claim for independence (Anderson and Mullaney 20). These troubles indicate that the national identification has a complex nature, and it rather is formed by the political regime and policies.\n\nWang and Huters write about the European approach towards regarding Tibet as a part of China. Throughout the history, Tibet was described by many European scholars as “a religious kingdom that must be regarded as unique” (Huters and Wang 140). Tibetan culture and religion was often compared to the western. The idea of “an ancient and mystical link between Europe and Tibet” contributed to the creation of a sympathetic relation and an idealistic view of Tibet by the western nations (Huters and Wang 144). Even though the Chinese sovereignty over Tibet is recognized, the historically developed image of the uniqueness of this nation plays a significant role in the support of Tibetans’ claim for independence.\n\nThe census made people aware of the cultural diversity; it also had a great impact on the development of the social studies and linguistics. The political purposes of the ethnical groups’ registration are many, but principally it is supposed to make the territory control simpler. Despite the convenience of the census for the political regulations, the rise of the ethnic awareness induced issues of the national identity. The current situation also emphasizes that the national identity is complex in its nature and that the regarding of the issue is dependent on the historical background of cultural interrelations and is subjective.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAnderson, Benedict and Thomas Mullaney.

      "Green Movement Definition, Challenges and Opportunities Term Paper\n\nThere are ongoing debates concerning the concept of green movement is closely connected with theories of economic development and population growth. Specifically, in order to advance social and economic welfare of the individuals, there should be an increase in the urge of natural resources, like water, energy, and minerals. The success of sustainable development here lies in a degree of efficiency of using the natural resources and in the extent to which the waste products are minimized 1 . In this respect, the concept of green movement provides us with the idea of using minimum resources to provide more means for larger groups of population. This ideology has led to a tag of war between two different groups that hold different thoughts about the same ideology. These groups are Boomsters and Doomsters.\n\nThe Doomsters, though in general support of the green ideology, hold that the population growth puts pressure onto the little resources that are available, compromising the quality of life human beings live. This is because population growth has a direct effect on resources like energy, water, space and even the climate. They further argue that it is this growth in the population that is responsible for social, economic and even political ills being experienced in the world today. Doomsters’ position is countered by the Boomsters whose arguments hold that all solutions to human beings are provided within human population. Therefore, a rise in the population is a major step towards alleviating human problems, among which is poverty.\n\nAny attempt to control the rate at which human beings reproduce is not supported by this group, since they believe that advancement of technology and the diffusion of the same has positively affected the lives of many poor people around the world. This group is particular about the individuality of human beings and their freedom to make use of such resources as energy and water. While considering the two sides of the debates from the viewpoint of green movement, the development of economically prosperous society consist in creating ecologically sustainability that takes it roots in social liberalism, grassroots democracy and environmentalism, which is the main idea supported by doomsters 2 . Specifically, they understand the concept as the urge to introduce approaches to controlling the utilization of natural resources that can be quickly exhausted.\n\nDefining the Term “Green”\n\nThe term green is often associated with ideology, concepts, and approaches that promote an ecological outlook on all social, political, and economical processes. Specifically, each field of social life, including technology, science, and psychology should be ecologically and environmentally oriented. For example, “green”-minded people are more likely to support recycling, minimizing the use of natural resources and advocating the methods protecting environment from negligent use and contamination 3 . There is another, more radical assumption about the definition of green ideology which consists in the urge to decrease the existing standard of living because human needs exceed the actual resources that nature can supply.\n\nAbuse of resources creates the necessity to limit social freedom and turn to more ecologically safe job environment. In this respect, the term green is more associated with extermination of existing social and economical systems that negatively influence the ecological situation. The green ideology can also been seen as a trigger to paradigmatic shifts in perceiving the surrounding world. These shifts should primarily occur to the fields of science, technology, and politics because they take the major control over the natural resources management 4 . In this respect, considering the concepts of “green” technologies and “non-green” technologies, it should be stated that the latter is more connected with approaches and tools that are more environmentally friendly whereas the former is mostly utilized for other than this purposes.\n\nOne way or another, the concept of “green” has gradually been integrated into the contemporary culture because more and more environmental activits are interested in introducing new patterns of behavior, lifestyle and attitude to nature. They are against consumerist culture and manifest approaches and instruments to strike the balance between the needs of the contemporary civilization and the resources that our plant has in store.\n\n“Green” Speak\n\n“Green” speak can be perceived as a method for rendering important messages about the existing environmental dangers. Its peculiarity also lies in a possibility to express outlooks on existing problems connected with global warming, carbon dioxide emissions, deforestation, and ozone layer reduction and provide possible solutions to improve the situation. In addition, green speak should always trigger action and participation in facilitating the changes to the existing environmental problems.\n\nIn the majority of cases, the “green” language is often used by environmental activists who resort to all possible meetings and negotiation aimed at encouraging people to change their outlooks, behaviors, and attitudes The activist also speak about positive action to make people understand what is wrong and what is right from the perspective of environmental ideology 5 . In this regard, green speak addresses the entire society, the globalized community, rather than to particular racial, ethnic, and economic groups because environmental protection and problem do not relate directly to economical and social problems, but to the social and ecological awareness of the Earth’s population. There are many web sites programs and actions taken by people to inform about the potential threats to natural resources, such as creation of web sites and online forums with the help of the Internet. Hence, technology plays a crucial role in promoting the environmental activities. Finally, green speak is in search of less aggressive means for implementing an ecologically sustainable society.\n\n“Green” Technology\n\nOverview of the concept of Green Technology\n\nIn order to understand whether “Green” technology is the solution to human problems today, it is worth making a close analysis of technology in terms of its different elements. For instance, talking of the social systems as an element of technology means that it must have a social setting. That is, occurs within a society. Looking at it from an informed perspective, in what society does this technology “comfortably” fit and is so much welcome? It will be congruent with the rich in the society, curving a niche within the human society that sidelines the poor majority 6 .\n\nLiving in the era of globalization, the environmental threats has also come to the international level. In particular, mass destructions and pollution in one part of the world has a potent impact on climate changes in another part of the world merely because the eco-system balance has been breached. In this respect, “green” technology introduction is often socially predetermined because ecologically problems often lead to economical and social constraints.\n\nSpecifically, it should be oriented on solving the problems of food supply and population growth, the aspects that in their turn strongly depend on sustainability development and ecological situation. Environmentalist are more concerned with the present problems of global environment and they believe that the introduction of a new action paradigm can initiate the creation of a new human power and resources that would positively contribute to the reducing environmental problems such as global warming.\n\nSolar Power: Assessing the Advantages and Disadvantages\n\nTo Whom Is the Technology Aimed at?\n\nThe contemporary green movements support the idea of using the wind, solar energy, and water for producing energy. In this respect, the usage of solar power is one of the most effective ways to reduce the consumption of fuel. The introduction of solar batteries that can be used either in houses or for automobiles can partially diminish the utilization of natural resources. The use of specific solar energy cannot be applied to all population of the world on the ground that not all societies have an equal access to electricity and solar power technology due to geographical location and social conditions. This is specifically connected to the developing countries where the economical system is not so well organized as compared to the developed economies.\n\nHowever, the platform for establishing solar plants at this region is even more promising due to the favorable climate conditions 7 . This is, first of all, explained by the fact that solar in the developing countries, particular in those located in Africa have desert spaces for building renewable energy factories. Second, these countries are less dependent on the sale of fossil fuels except for some countries. Finally, the investment into solar energy will meet the purposes of Green movement that is more orientated on the integration of pure sources of energy.\n\nChallenges and opportunities\n\nDespite the existing advantages of introducing solar power plants, some nuances hampering the integration process should be taken into the deepest consideration. First of all, the process of solar plant development can be hampered by the confrontation by fossil fuel industry who will not concede its position at the market. Second, geographical location matters as well, specifically when it comes to developed countries where space deficiency can cause additional problems. Finally, due to the fact that solar industry belongs to strategies industries, many countries are striving to gain the competitive advantage and win the position of the leading provider of green technologies.\n\nDespite the above presented constraints, solar energy as the kind of renewable energy causes much less harm to the environment in comparison with the one produced fossil fuel industry. Despite the problem with receiving the land for building the plants, the legal procedures will help settle the problem. For instance, China, one of the leading producing of solar energy has managed to solve the problem and introduce the network of solar power plants in its region 8 .\n\nEvaluation and Practical Application\n\nWhile evaluating the efficiency of Roger’s adoption model in terms of acceptance, attitude, and practical application, the project of solar power industry development can be replaced, but partially. This is explained by certain constraints that were enumerated in the above passages and the ones that will be disclosed below. Specifically, it is necessary to evaluate possible geographical situations as well as the actual environment situation in an identified region.\n\nSecond, the marketing demand is of the great importance as well because the money invested to the production should be fully reimbursed; otherwise, the venture will turn out to be non-profitable. In addition, the total replacement is impossible due to the existing social and cultural constraints that are primarily based on the attitudes and awareness of the necessity to implement alternative energy. Habits and established social systems prevent the community to transfer immediately to another level of development. In this respect, the introduction of green ideology and technology should be consistent and gradual and should be designed for long terms.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt was noted that “Green” technology is an ideology that proposes for an acute cut on the rate at which humans reproduce in order to sustain the development and even conserve the environment. Further, it has been realized that as much as this ideology seems the true solution to human problems today, it can introduce a new philosophy and attitude of life. The main aim is to compromise human freedom in the name of environmental conservation. Despite the fact that depriving human of social freedom is a challenge, this constitutes the major condition for introducing green mind and alternatives for improving the ecological situation.\n\nIt should be noted that the individuality of humankind is the only tool towards alienating human problems like poverty. It will be noted that freedom is the most important tool that a society must first have a grip of before seeking a solution to its problems. This, in itself, defies the ideologies that make the Green Movement.\n\nBibliography\n\nGreen Speak. Greenspeak, Saving the World on Word at a Time , 2007, n. p.

      "The PMI Decision-Making Technique Essay\n\nWithout doubts, good decision-making at all levels is important for any organization that wants to achieve its mission as it is captured in its mission statement. It is therefore also important that the organization, when faced with a decision to adopt one of the various decision-making techniques available and implement it fully and successfully. Decision-making techniques are approaches that guide an organization, individual, or other entity in making decisions that are in line with its goals, objectives, or mission. Examples of decision-making techniques include T-chart, Edward de Bono’s PMI technique, Buridan’s ass, measured criteria, decision matrix (weighted decision table), etc. Naturally and considering short and long-term significance to an organization, some decisions are more important than others. If necessary, more important decisions override those of relatively little importance, and as such, decision levels have been developed to aid in identifying the importance of a decision to an organization.\n\nStrategic decision making is considered to be of the highest level (Harris, 1998). Decisions made at this level are what give an organization, individual or other entity its general direction and long term goals. They, again, also define the organization’s or individual’s philosophy and values. Inherently, strategic decisions are unstructured, very imaginative, and potentially risky, owing to the uncertain nature of their outcome. The second-highest decision-making level is the tactical decision-making level (Harris 1998). Decisions made at this level support those made at the strategic level. Tactical decisions are at the medium range, and their significance, as well as consequences, are moderate as well (Harris 1998). The final and third-highest decision-making level is the operational decision-making level. Operational decisions are made on a daily basis and support tactical decisions.\n\nKava, an island country in the South Pacific, is where Nik’s company wants to establish a greater presence. From the business scenario, one of Kava’s strengths is its quality and inexpensive labor. An outstanding weakness, as deduced from the business scenario, is that the country lacks systems and mechanisms to protect itself from the various disasters it is prone to. Additionally, there is no mention of systems or mechanisms that mitigate the effects of such disasters when their strike. Opportunities in Kava lie in its diverse investment areas, which include petroleum, agriculture, and tourism. Kava’s threat is its vulnerability to both natural and artificial disasters. Considering that, the government of Kava is asking Nik’s company to help it with its social needs and also considering Chris Morales’s (company founder) inspiration of doing what is right then the apt decision-making technique to adopt in Kava will be PMI.\n\nIn the PMI technique, developed by Edward De Bono and which is an advancement of the T-chart technique, a list is made of all the pluses, minuses, and interesting aspects surrounding a decision to be made (Harris, 1998). The first and very critical step of the PMI technique is planning for the decision making process. One of the major benefits of planning for the decision-making process is that clear and independent goals has established that guide the decision-making process (Harris, 1998, 5). The effect of this is that decisions made are not forced by external drivers but are the end result of a well-organized series of choices. Another benefit of planning for the decision-making process is that a standard of measuring the effectiveness of decisions to be made is defined and established (Harris, 1998, 6). The importance of this is that the entity adopting the PMI technique is able to determine whether the decisions it makes are steering it to achieve its goals or not.\n\nAnother benefit of planning for the decision-making process is that values are converted into actions (Harris, 1998, 7). A decision-making plan enables an entity to determine how suitable a decision is in achieving its goals or mission. It additionally ensures that the decisions made are consistent in aiding the company to achieve its mission and goals. Another benefit of planning for the decision-making process is that the decision-making process is made budget-friendly (Harris, 1998, 8). A decision-making plan ensures that a limit is set to the number of resources and time allocated to the decision-making activity and, thus, in effect, eliminates unnecessary expenses.\n\nThe second step in Edward De Bono’s PMI technique is preparing the PMI worksheet (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 3). The PMI worksheet is prepared by drawing three columns in a sheet of paper and heading them, respectively, plus, minus and interesting (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 3). Once the PMI worksheet is completed, consider each given decision and the action it necessitates, and note its positives on the plus column of the worksheet (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 4). Still considering the decision and its action, note down all its negatives in the minus column (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 4). In the interesting column of the PMI worksheet, note down all known and possible implications surrounding the decision to be made whether there are positive or negative (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 6). In some cases, by the time the PMI worksheet is completely filled, it should be obvious whether the decision should be taken or not. If not, the third step in the PMI technique is associating a score to each of the plusses and minuses in the worksheet (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 5). Once you have completed the third step, the fourth step is to do a summation of all the plusses and minuses and evaluating the result (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 5). The PMI technique directs that if the summation results in a strong positive score then the decision should be taken and if it results in a strongly negative score then the decision should not be taken (Mind Tools Ltd, 2012, 6)\n\nCritical thinking is considered an approach to thinking that enables individual actions to be purely objective (Kurland, 2001, 1). Critical thinking is associated with a number of traits that are rationality, self-awareness, honesty, open-mindedness, discipline, and judgment (Kurland, 2001, 1). Examining the Edward De Bono’s PMI technique, it is evident that the technique is founded on rationality. This is because the positives and negatives are considered and a decision made on whether to adopt the decision or not. Edward De Bono’s PMI technique also supports open-mindedness as not only are the positives and negatives taken into account but also the interesting facts surrounding a decision to be made.\n\nEdward De Bono’s supports discipline in that it first and foremost necessitates the need for a decision-making plan, which guides the whole decision-making process. By being a decision-making technique, Edward de Bono’s PMI technique supports the making of effective judgments. By using the critical thinking theory to evaluate the effectiveness of Edward de Bono’s PMI technique as a decision-making technique to use in the business scenario described, it is found that the technique is compatible with most of the theory and therefore is effective.\n\nReferences\n\nHarris, R.

      "Organizational Development Planning and Evaluation Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Discussion\n 3. Recommendations and Strategies\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nOrganization development embodies planning and evaluation of structures within organizations in order to enhance effectiveness and productivity. Application of organizational development is diverse and complex, hence its multidisciplinary approach and orientation (Jackson 11). Organization development plays an important role in enhancing change and other resultant outcomes within organizations. It revolves around organizational culture, attitudes, and belief systems. Through organization development, organizations rejuvenate and adjust to recurrent realities that define operations within specific market landscapes.\n\nExperts in this area offer services that are vital in evaluation and determination of structural frameworks that support functions within and without organizational entities (Jackson 16). This enables organizations to seize opportunities and diffuse threats within their area of operation. Organization development assumes a holistic approach to evaluation of various parametrical thresholds that anchor performance in organizations. This research undertaking seeks to discuss the organizational inclination of Google. It shall look at the internal structure and organization of Google with a view to determining realities that relate to its position within the market. This essay shall also look at challenges and opportunities that the organization faces within its market scope.\n\nDiscussion\n\nGoogle continues to record unprecedented success in its operations within the market. The current success of this organization is monumental because of various factors that favour its operations. For instance, technological developments and advancements play an important role in creating success and progress for the organization (Girard 14). In modern society, there is increase in the number of people who use the internet for various purposes. This reality offers a favourable ground for Google’s success and progressive trajectory. Other factors contribute to success of Google in rendering services to its customers. An example of such factors is its internal organizational structure. Google has a progressive and dynamic management structure that plays a cardinal role in sustaining growth and expansion. The management is instrumental in formulating and implementing policies that govern and define Google’s actions in relation to market forces (Girard 21).\n\nAs earlier mentioned, organization development is vital in shaping operations within organizational entities. Through such undertakings, organizations acquire foresight and capacity to confront issues and challenges that manifest in their scope of operation. Organizations should always endeavour to seize opportunities for growth, expansion, and progress in critical areas of concern (Girard 25). The current success of Google emanates from appropriate design that supports navigation with ease. Internet enthusiasts have an opportunity to enjoy such services without much struggle. Google supports its activities by invoking its code of conduct that offers guidelines with regard to customer service and satisfaction. The code of conduct is integral in creation and development of sustainable corporate culture and belief systems. Devoid of such efforts, it is difficult for organizations to realize and actualize basic ideals and aspirations (Girard 29).\n\nGoogle has a succinct vision and mission statement that inspires its core values such as competence, quality service, and innovative thinking. The above qualities form basis for developing products and services that satisfy recurrent demands within the market. Customer satisfaction is an important aspect because it recognizes their role in sustaining profitability among corporate entities (Girard 33). From the onset, Google has developed structural frameworks that govern its quest for profitability and relevance within its market. The internet industry is highly competitive and dynamic. Organizations require foresight and innovation in order to achieve profitability and ensure dominant influence in the market. Recurrent changes and developments in technology necessitate strategic thinking and planning in order to give organizations an upper hand over competition (Girard 34).\n\nGoogle strives to increase profitability through efforts that enhance its quest for market presence. The company has a dynamic and inclusive expansion programme that accords it an opportunity to venture into new territories. This strategic plan has been instrumental in enhancing Google’s interests in regional and global markets (Girard 37). Presence in regional markets is important because of the potential that lies in such markets. For instance, Google has aggressively penetrated the African market with a view to seizing numerous opportunities that manifest in the market. According to recent research findings, there is increase internet use across Africa (Girard 41). By venturing into Africa and creating platforms for hegemony, Google appreciates the potential in this regional market segment. Google’s expansion plan also involves corporate acquisition and ventures within the market.\n\nUnder this strategy, Google takes over ownership and control of corporate and organizational entities that have presence in the market. It also involves partial acquisition of stakes within strategically positioned organizations within the market. An example of such acquisition is the deal between Google and Pyra Labs. Pyra Labs had substantial interests in internet and technology across the market. This acquisition increased and entrenched Google’s presence and dominance within its market scope (Girard 44).\n\nMost market surveys indicate that Google has a higher ranking with regard to service provision and customer satisfaction. Users assert that Google has an innovative design and outline that eases navigation and accessibility. This accords Google a strategic advantage over competitors in the market. The company has a team of experts who provide oversight regarding functions and operations that exist in the market (Weber 54). Such experts provide ideas and counsel to Google’s management regarding market penetration, integration, and preservation. These aspects are important because they enable the company to decipher areas that require action and attention.\n\nAdoption of new technology is an important aspect in Google’s regime of operation. It is evident that technology plays a pivotal role in supporting Google’s operations in the market. Google’s performance in the stock market is indicative of its popularity and success among internet users. This fosters confidence among shareholders because they develop faith in the performance and profitability of the company (Weber 56).\n\nDespite recording success in numerous areas of market presence, Google has challenges that threaten its position as the market leader. One such challenge relates to competition from other market players. Although competition is a ubiquitous reality in the corporate landscape, corporate entities should endeavour to scale down its intensity and disposition. Stiff competition requires innovative thinking in order to devise strategic reactions with regard to such corporate overtures. Google has had to initiate various structural adjustments to counter the effects of stiff competition within the market (Weber 64).\n\nGoogle has a unique niche that depends on its innovative and dynamic products and services. In order to satisfy various customer demands in its market segment, the company realigns its ideals and aspirations to guarantee compliance. Google has numerous strengths that bolster its stand as an influential player in the corporate arena (Weber 67). The company has an array of innovative products that seek to meet customer needs. Such products are popular among internet users because they are adaptable and cognizant of trends within the market. Google designs products that fulfil needs of customers from diverse social, economic, and cultural orientations. An example of such products is the Google Maps. This product offers direction to users across the market. This product is innovative and visionary because its applicability is legendary and revered by users (Weber 71).\n\nThere is opportunity in Google’s willingness to invest resources into programmes that complement its desire for success in a competitive corporate environment. The company has a strong resource base that accords it an opportunity to actualize its goals and objectives with regard to product development, innovation, and market penetration. Devoid of adequate resources, organizations cannot fulfil their obligation to meet and actualize customer needs. Google has strength in its ability to understand crucial realities that govern operations within the internet and technology market. Familiarity with market trends and demands enables Google to devise products and services that integrate innovation and applicability (Weber 73).\n\nGoogle also experiences numerous challenges that undermine its efforts within the market. One such challenge is the increasing popularity of mobile telephony. Most people use their mobile handsets to access internet services. This affects Google because it is difficult to relay advertisements over the internet because of spatial limitations. Increase in use of mobile phones reduces preference for personal computers as access points for internet services (Weber 79). Another challenge relates to presence of redundant products in the market. Currently, Google has products and services that fail to arouse excitement from users. Such products present setbacks that add little or no value to operations of Google. Such products also contribute to redundancy and dismal performance within its market scope. Another challenge relates to stiff competition from other industry players who provide standardized products and services (Weber 85).\n\nRecommendations and Strategies\n\nIn order to create room for progress, profitability, and innovation, Google should initiate a strategic structural overhaul of its operations. The company should undertake organizational development ventures that enhance its position as a market leader. There is need for comprehensive market research and evaluation to determine areas that require adjustment and realignment (McLean 45). Google should conduct a feasibility study to establish realities that characterize customer needs in different segments of its market. Such a study should also determine attitudes of users with regard to Google’s products and services. It is important for the company to ensure that its products and services reflect and satisfy current needs in the market (McLean 47). The company should also document all relevant areas that pose challenges to its dominance across national, regional, and international market. There is need for consistency and forthrightness in developing and implementing structural policies with regard to all operations within Google’s market. Implementation of the above recommendations should involve all stakeholders in Google Corporation (McLean 45).\n\nConclusion\n\nThe role of organizational development is evident in Google’s case study. Organizational development creates avenues for change, innovation, and progressive thinking within organizations. Through its application, organizational leaders understand and react to issues that pose challenges to growth and sustainability with regard to operations in their market segment (Jackson 22). Organization development creates an atmosphere of change and evaluation in contentious realms of an organization’s scope of operation. Besides identification of structural and managerial loopholes, this procedural undertaking creates viable solutions to challenges within organizations. Proper solutions ensure that organizations revamp their operations in order to comply with market needs (Jackson 23). However, it is important to note that organization development requires planning, foresight, and dedication because of complexities that manifest in its initiation and implementation.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nGirard, Bernard.

      "Sustainable Democracy in Developing Countries Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Choosing the most appropriate type of democracy\n 3. Sustainability\n 4. Discussion\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nDuring the last three decades, the American government has made numerous attempts to promote democracy in various regions of the world. For instance, one can mention such countries as Iraq, Syria, Libya, Ukraine, and so forth. Very often, these attempts resulted in the complete failure because new democracies proved to be unsustainable. This paper is aimed at determining what types of democracies can be most suitable for countries that experienced different forms of totalitarianism in the past.\n\nMoreover, one should determine the extent to which these new states can be made sustainable. It is possible to say that liberal democracy can be the most efficient approach for such states because it reduces the risks of discrimination and violations of human rights. However, the sustainability of such states is dependent on a variety of factors such as the efficiency of the government and economic development of a country; to a great extent, the future of these democracies cannot be easily predicted. Nevertheless, it is possible to identify the conditions which can contribute to the success of such countries. These are the main questions that should be discussed more closely.\n\nChoosing the most appropriate type of democracy\n\nOverall, political scientists distinguish various types of democracies that differ in terms of how people’s will is represented or how the rights of citizens are protected by the state. It seems that the main concern for the policy-makers should be the tyranny of the majority (Cunningham 53). In other words, there is always a risk that a group of people representing the majority of the population can adopt laws that can marginalize or even dehumanize minority groups (Cunningham 53). These minorities can be marked by such characteristics as religion, race, ethnic origin, sexual orientation, political convictions, and so forth. This is one of the risks that attract the attention of many political scientists and lawyers. Therefore, the main task is to implement a system of checks and balances that minimize this threat. It seems that liberal democracy can be the most suitable approach in this case. This approach implies that the power of policy-makers is limited by several important documents, such as the constitution or the bill of rights. These documents should provide various guarantees, such as the right to free speech or freedom of religion.\n\nMoreover, it is important to eliminate every form of discrimination, at least at the official level. This provision can also be included in the constitution of the country. One should bear in mind that many of these states are ridden with internal conflicts. For instance, one can mention the confrontation between different religious groups (Cohen 3). This argument is particularly relevant to countries like Iraq or Afghanistan. In turn, liberal democracy is supposed to ensure that the newly-formed government does not oppress various groups. This approach is important for reconciling the interests of different stakeholders who can often be opposed to one another.\n\nIt is important to remember that many of these states could have gained independence relatively late. Many of them could be colonial territories in the past. For example, Iraq was controlled by the Ottoman Empire and Great Britain. As a rule, these communities are profoundly affected by many internal hostilities. In turn, liberal democracy can be an important precaution against various pitfalls. Provided that the United States intends to support such countries, American policy-makers should take into account the socio-cultural peculiarities of a particular country; otherwise, their strategies can be based on flawed assumptions that may eventually prove disastrous.\n\nMoreover, one can say that this liberal democracy should be representative, which means that a group of people should be elected to promote the interests of the community. This method can be particularly useful in countries with a large population. However, representative democracy can be efficient if the elections are organized properly. These are the main points that can be made.\n\nSustainability\n\nStill, legal provisions may not be sufficient for the sustainability of these democracies. Their survival can depend on many external and internal circumstances that cannot be easily measured or predicted. In particular, it is possible to speak about the efficiency of the democratic government and its ability to promote entrepreneurship and curb corruption. So, it is critical to implement and enforce laws which facilitate the growth of private businesses.\n\nFurthermore, policy-makers and public administrators should consider the interests of various social groups. Overall, the democratic government should demonstrate that it is more efficient than a totalitarian regime. Much attention should also be paid to the efficiency of law-enforcement agencies that should act impartially and efficiently. Thus, the main task of the democratic government is to show that it can bring improvements into the lives of people; otherwise, they may believe that democracy as a form of government is not applicable to their country. Provided that this goal is not achieved, the country is at a greater risk of transforming into a totalitarian regime once again. Additionally, it is important to remember that totalitarian politicians can rise to power if democratic governments are affected by significant internal conflicts or power struggles. This is one of the main issues that should be taken into consideration by the policy-makers who should keep in mind that their interests or political ambitions should be set aside, especially at the time of crisis.\n\nFurthermore, much attention should be paid to the role played by civil society. A newly-formed democracy is more likely to be sustainable if citizens closely monitor the activities of the government and identify their mistakes. In many cases, journalists and various representatives of mass media can significantly contribute to the improvement in the work of governmental institutions. In turn, the government should be open to the critique offered by the civic society; otherwise, such a government may not be able to retain the trust of the public for a long time. This is one of the main pitfalls that should be avoided by the leaders of a new democracy.\n\nApart from that, one should not forget about the influence of external factors. For instance, much attention should be paid to the availability of foreign direct investment, which can be crucial for the economic development of the community (Rotberg 10). Similarly, a country, which is integrated into the global economy, is more likely to become a sustainable democracy. The most eloquent example of such a state is South Korea, which became more democratic due to its rapid economic growth. Therefore, the sustainability of such countries can depend on the policies of other states that should provide support to new democracies.\n\nFurthermore, the country should have an efficient army that can cope with external threats. For instance, it is possible to refer to such a country as Iraq that could not cope with the threat of terrorism. One should keep in mind that successful democracies such as South Korea or Japan did not have to face such risks as terrorism, religious feud, or ethnic hostilities. This is one of the things that distinguishes them from states like Afghanistan or Iraq. These are some of the main details that should not be overlooked.\n\nThus, it is possible to say that the sustainability of a democracy is dependent on the decisions of separate policy-makers, the functioning of social institutions, and the strategies of other states. Moreover, it is important to remember about the attitudes of citizens who should actively monitor the work of government, especially the ability of policy-makers to contribute to the social and economic progress. These are some of the main factors that should be taken into account because they shape how such societies can evolve in the future.\n\nDiscussion\n\nThe attempts to bring to democracy have been debated by many political scientists and historians. Admittedly, one can provide examples of countries that profoundly benefited from democratization. It is possible to distinguish such countries as South Korea, Japan, or Germany. Nevertheless, there are many examples of failed or failing democracies. Iraq. Libya and Afghanistan are probably the most notorious cases. Thus, it is important to identify the most important risk factors that can undermine a newly-formed democracy.\n\nFurthermore, one should single out the strengths can mitigate both internal and external risks. By looking at this issue from this perspective, legislators and policy-makers can develop better strategies. These are some of the points that can be made.\n\nConclusion\n\nThis discussion shows that the transformation of a country into democracy is a time-consuming and unpredictable process. It seems that liberal democracy can be the most suitable approach for the countries that were totalitarian in the past. This form of government is an important safeguard against the violations of human rights. However, this approach does not guarantee the long-term sustainability of democracy. Much attention should be paid to a variety of factors such as economic development of the state, the participation of citizens in the political life, the efficiency of the government, and the work of law-enforcement agencies. These are the main arguments that can be advanced.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCohen, Saul. Geopolitics: The Geography of International Relations , New York: Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, 2008.

      "Maya Religion and Spirituality in Ancient and Modern Times Term Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Understanding the Maya people: Ancient and modern\n 3. Theoretical background\n 4. Maya religion and spirituality\n 5. Future research\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. References\n\nIntroduction\n\nAccording to Lechner (2011), the Maya group comprises of a diversity of native people with rich religious and cultural backgrounds. These individuals inhabit North Central America and Southern American regions. The predominant term ‘Maya’ is used to define these indigenous communities due to their spiritual and cultural similarities. In addition, it is important to note that the Maya constitute individuals from different ethnic groups and societies.\n\nThese groups also exhibit differences with regard to some of their traditions and history. Laughton (2012) notes that there were about 7 million natives that inhabited the North Central American and Southern American regions at the beginning of the 21st century. Currently, the communities from Southern Mexico, Guatemala, Yucatan Peninsula, El Salvador, and Western Honduras still practice the ancient religion and rituals.\n\nLechner (2011) reports two unique characteristics that define the Maya people and are similar across the different groups. These include; drawing hieroglyphic and iconography scripts and the development of complex scientific and astronomical structures. The author also notes that the complex astronomical systems enable these people to promote sustainable farming activities (Lechner, 2011). Additionally, Maya practices various religious rituals and ceremonies to promote the success of these agricultural practices.\n\nBallou (2008) indicates that religion was an important component of the life of the ancient Maya communities and continues to be important to date. Specifically, religion is believed to be their ultimate maker and destroyer.\n\nThe aim of the current research is to assess the religion and spirituality of the Maya people. In respect to cultural pluralism, this research will provide an understanding of the cultural identities of the Maya. Moreover, it will promote the comprehension of the Mayan values and practices, and their acceptance in society.\n\nUnderstanding the Maya people: Ancient and modern\n\nIn reference to Lechner (2011), the modern-day Maya group constitutes the largest native community in Peru and Mexico. The majority of the individuals residing in Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula (Yucatec) and the highlands of Chiapas (Tzeltal and Tzotzil). The Yucatec Maya community is more populated than the Tzeltal and Tzotzil. The Chontal and the Chol are also minor Maya groups found in Mexico. Other larger communities constitute the Quiche’ and Cakchiquel who are found in Guatemala.\n\nSharer (2006) indicates that the Maya indigenous populations comprise of 31 distinct communities. These communities speak different incomprehensible languages that are within the larger Maya dialect. Lechner (2011) acknowledges that the native group has been able to preserve its culture despite intermarrying with other immigrants (majorly Spanish immigrants) over the years.\n\nThis is because the native community has been confined to the same region and culture since ancient times. According to Whittington and Reed (2006), the Maya empire was very successful in the Sixth Century A.D. The people were famous for agricultural activities and their specialization in astronomical systems. In addition, the native community developed impressive architectural structures and art creations.\n\nSharer (2006) indicates that the ancient Maya communities were mainly found in the Yucatan Peninsula and Guatemala. Their location protected them from invasion by other Mesoamerican indigenous populations. According to Whittington and Reed (2006), the ancient Maya communities are reported to inhabit these regions from 1800 B.C. to A.D. 250. This period was referred to as the formative period, and the group mainly practiced agriculture to sustain the lives of its people.\n\nDuring this period, the community began to migrate to the highland and lowland regions within Mexico and Central America. In addition, the Maya were still religious and practiced various cultural activities that were unique to them. Furthermore, in the formative period, Maya was well known for developing pyramids and stone shrines for religious purposes.\n\nThey were also responsible for building the ancient city of Mirador. During the Classic Period (A.D 250 to 900), the Maya empire developed into many cities, and the population increased to about two million individuals (Sharer, 2006). The Maya were the richest groups during the Classic Period, and they developed more advanced agricultural techniques such as irrigation and terracing.\n\nBallou (2008) acknowledges that the Maya community continued to be deeply religious during the Classical Period. Their religion also recognized human sacrifice as a form of nurturing the gods. In addition, kings who were believed to have blood relations with the gods ruled them. These kings served as mediators between the Maya people and the supernatural beings.\n\nAs a result of their deep religion, they built enormous temples that were pyramid-shaped (Sharer, 2006). Such architectural designs earned them a reputation as the best artists in the region. Laughton (2012) indicates that the ancient Maya were remarkable people as they managed to build an amazing civilization in the middle of a rainforest.\n\nThey also took advantage of the rich natural resources in the region to advance their lives. However, during the ninth century (Post-Classic Period), the Mayan civilization collapsed, and little is known on the cause of the decline (Lechner, 2011). Some scholars believe that the Maya community could not sustain the rising population, while others state that there were competing interests among the kings that led to the collapse.\n\nTheoretical background\n\nIn reference to Kunin (2006), religion refers to a structure of beliefs that define an individual’s actions. An example is Christianity, where people believe in God as their creator and depends upon the bible to give guidance on all matters in life.\n\nVarious religions have myths that explain the origin of the believers and attempt to decode the place of man in the universe. In contemporary societies such as the Maya Kingdom, religion formed an important part of their lives as they depended on the gods for the success of their architectural and agricultural activities (Ballou, 2008). According to Stausberg (2010), existing religious theories are not comprehensive, and scholars have failed in establishing solid theories.\n\nThere are two main challenges that these scholars face in developing comprehensive religious theories. First, it is difficult to integrate religion in an interdisciplinary manner. Second, the cultural characteristic of religion makes it difficult to define its true nature because it varies across different societies.\n\nSince religion is an essential component of the human culture, theories of religion focus on culture and the basic issues that affect humans. Hart (2008) defines spirituality as all aspects of being human that are critical to their health and well-being. It is a form of connection between the body and the spirit. Spiritualism is reported to occur synonymously with religion.\n\nThere are two main theoretical constructs that enhance understanding of the Maya religion; anthropology and sociology. According to Kunin (2006), anthropological theories in religion are different and are based on emotions and social systems. Moreover, there are three distinct factors that set them apart, and they include; evolution, humanity, and cross-cultural aspects. These theories are categorized into three major types that include; intellectualist theories, wishful thinking, and social solidarity theories.\n\nKunin (2006) indicates that social solidarity theories determine how religion promotes unity and solidarity within a community. These theories are the most useful in explaining the concept of religion in the Maya Kingdom (Ballou, 2008). Religion promotes cohesion among the different Maya sub-groups as it forms a ‘guideline’ through which the native community operates on. Wishful-thinking theories focus on the emotions of people and explain that religion eliminates feelings of fear and hopelessness (Kunin, 2006).\n\nLastly, the intellectualist theories look at the interest of humanity in understanding the world, and why everything happens the way it does. The social solidarity theory is mostly used to explain religion in ancient and modern societies, and it looks at the allegiance of religion to the community.\n\nAccording to Kunin (2006), there are three main sociological theories that have been used to explain religion by different scholars. These theories include; functionalism, social change, and conflict theories. Furseth and Repstad (2006) note that Durkheim proposed the functionalist theory, and it is the most useful in understanding the Mayan religion. According to this theory, sacred symbols are pure and should be separated from daily routine activities.\n\nThis is because the objects are divine and have a sense of relevance to the followers. In addition to supernatural beliefs, the theory states that religion should also involve rituals and ceremonies. Such ceremonies and rituals are necessary for strengthening the bond between human beings and the supernatural being.\n\nThis theory resonates very well with the Mayan community as they performed rituals during ceremonies after the birth or death of the community members (Ballou, 2008). Furthermore, modern communities are also known to offer animal sacrifices and perform rituals to their gods. Such rituals are viewed as a means of communicating their needs to the goods of nature.\n\nMaya religion and spirituality\n\nIn reference to Moises (2012), the ancient Maya religion believed in the existence of nature gods. This ancient community worshipped different types of divinities. The gods had the ability to work with each other and fight at times. According to Ballou (2008), they had the main god, who was referred to as Itzam Na , and he had the ability to perform the tasks of the other gods. The religious beliefs in this community governed the life of the members, and they were required to live harmoniously with the gods.\n\nEach of the gods represented a certain ritual that had to be observed. These rituals had to be followed by long periods of fasting, and certain sacrifices had to be offered to the gods. Ballou (2008) notes that one of the most common sacrifices among the Mayan people involved piercing the human ear lobe or the tongue and offering the blood to the gods. The indigenous communities would also offer animals and precious items during the sacrifice.\n\nMoises (2012) indicates that the gods exhibited dualistic personalities, as they were both compassionate and malicious. In addition, different gods tended to have contradicting characteristics. An example is the God of the sun, who was associated with daylight, but he also had the ability to exist in the underworld at night. As a result, the sun god was also classified as a night god.\n\nAccording to Ballou (2008), some of the Mayan groups used religious scripts during worship. An example is the Quiche Maya, who used the Popol Vuh for prophecy and making decisions pertaining to religion. This script was an equivalent of the ‘Mayan bible,’ and the original forms encompassed drawings regarding astronomical and earthly climate events. However, Ballou (2008) notes that researchers have not been able to trace the original Popol Vul , and hence most of the information regarding the ‘Mayan bible’ is unavailable.\n\nFurseth and Repstad (2006) state that the Mayan religion recognized death as part of the human life on earth. The Maya believed in the Cenote , which was a term used to describe the underworld. According to the ancient community, the dead went to live in the Cenote . However, the death of the ordinary people was different from that of the kings.\n\nThe kings followed a special path through the sun to travel to the Cenote . Since they were believed to be related to the gods, the kings were reincarnated after death to become gods. Lechner (2011) indicates that people who were offered as sacrifices, and those who died during childbirth were considered holy. In this view, they were believed to escape the underworld, which was inhabited by evil gods. Another amazing belief in the ancient Mayan religion was the Way’ ob .\n\nThis meant that every person had an animal that shared his or her soul. Moreover, an individual had the power to transform into his or her animal’s soul. Laughton (2012) also notes that the Maya believed that the dead had to be buried together with the religious items that they used while they were alive. Priests were considered sacred and had to be cremated, and their ashes were stored in the temples.\n\nHowever, Ballou (2008) notes that these religious practices changed after the Spanish conquest. The Spanish introduced Christianity to the Mayan communities. Despite these changes, some rituals continued after the conquest, and they included; idol worship, presence of ritual calendars, and burning of incense.\n\nBallou (2008) indicates that the modern Mayan religion still recognizes the interaction between the people, nature, and the supernatural world. This tri-dimensional relationship affects the actions and beliefs of the Mayan people. This author also notes that the Maya groups believe that the world is interconnected, and communities should live in unity (Ballou, 2008). According to Lechner (2011), the community believes that life is holy and should be respected at all costs.\n\nThey also worship most of the gods that their ancestors worshipped. Hart (2008) acknowledges the fact that the modern Maya religion combines animism and Catholicism. The extent of Catholic influence varies from group to group. Some of the groups believe that there are gods that support the four ends of their communities.\n\nAll the gods have to participate equally in holding the communities in place. Failure of any of the gods to cooperate is believed to cause earthquakes. According to Ballou (2008), some of the modern Maya believe that the sun is God, and the moon is the Virgin Mary.\n\nThe ancient mountain shrines are still used as places of worship. The elderly should be honored by offering sacrifices and praying in the shrines. The majority of the Maya groups still recognize the role of the ancient Shamans , whose responsibility was to pray for the sick villagers in the shrine. In reference to Lechner (2011), the modern communities still believe in the Cenotes and supernatural spirits that inhabit the rainforest. Ballou (2008) notes that there various aspects of the Mayan religion that are not in practice today.\n\nThe use of human sacrifices is absent in all the groups as they continue to place immense value on the lives of humans. Many scholars argue that the ancient Maya had an ‘unbalanced’ relationship with their gods.\n\nSpecifically, the members could offer human sacrifices or starve themselves to death in an effort to receive blessings, but the gods would still not care. The modern region seems to have diverged from such relations and focuses more on the importance of prayer and a healthy relationship between people and the gods. Lechner (2011) acknowledges that Christianity influenced these changes.\n\nFuture research\n\nScholars of the Mayan religion identify various gaps that require further research. Ballou (2008) notes that researchers have failed to explain why some of the communities continue to follow the traditional Mayan religion despite the spread of Catholicism across the region. Additionally, researchers seem unable to explain why some of the groups seem to incorporate Christianity in the traditional Mayan religions because the two religions are very different.\n\nAccording to Hart (2008), many scholars have, in the past, visited the Maya people in Mexico and Guatemala in an effort to uncover lost religious artifacts. When they decipher these scripts, they pass them to the Mayan groups to add to the lost traditional religious knowledge.\n\nIn view of this, there is an argument among scholars to whether reincorporation of the lost artifacts interferes with the modern religious practices of the Mayan people. Moreover, there is scanty evidence determining whether they actually incorporate the new knowledge to the modern religion. Lechner (2011) indicates that more research is required on the location of the ancient Popol Vuh, as the scripts would enhance understanding of the role of the bible in the traditional Mayan culture.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Maya people are a group of natives who are found in North Central America and Southern America (Lechner, 2011). These groups have similarities in their religious and cultural activities. Furthermore, some of the modern communities remain deeply rooted in their traditional culture. According to Sharer (2006), the ancient Maya communities were known for their magnificent astronomical and architectural capabilities. They built pyramid-shaped temples and shrines that were used for religious rituals.\n\nHowever, their civilization collapsed during the ninth century. There is a dearth of research on the reasons behind the empire collapse. The Mayan people have always been religious throughout history and believed in the gods of nature. They also performed rituals like human sacrifices to please their gods. After the Spanish conquest, some of the groups seemed to incorporate Catholicism into their ancient religious culture.\n\nThe modern Maya are diverse, as some remain deeply rooted in the ancient religion, while others have incorporated Christianity into their culture. It is important to note that most of the beliefs of the ancient Maya are still present among the modern groups. The belief in the existence of nature gods and an underworld is still present among the modern Maya. In conclusion, the modern Maya continue to be deeply involved in their ancient religion and spiritualism despite the spread of Catholicism in Mexico and Peru.\n\nReferences\n\nBallou, H. (2008).

      "Al Ain Municipality and Its Core Values Case Study\n\nIntroduction\n\nAl Ain Municipality can be considered as one of the major departments within the Municipal Affairs Authority. It provides services to the Al Ain city in the country. The municipality created a policy that was aimed at making it one of the most developed municipalities in the country.\n\nThis vision will be actualized by the experienced employees of the municipality using the state of art systems that are identified with it. At the same time, the municipality expects to maintain the unique characteristics and authenticity associated with it. The vision statement of this municipality is very specific and it captures the dreams and aspirations of the residents. It states: “A Distinguished Municipality and an Enduring Development for the City of Oases”.\n\nThere are several core values which can be associated with Al Ain Municipality. According to the Department of Municipal Affairs [herein referred to as DMA] (2012), the core values revolve around authenticity and protection of the city’s heritage. The leadership in this municipality addresses achievements that are distinct and which vary. When one analyses the vision of the municipality, they will note that credibility, transparency, innovation as well as creativity are all significant issues to the municipality.\n\nIn this paper, the author is going to assess the various attributes of Al Ain Municipality. The author will specifically factor in the vision of the municipality and its core values.\n\nAl Ain as a Service Authority\n\nThe municipality can be considered as a service authority which attracts a large percentage of most recent and scientifically advanced information and communication technology apparatus in the country. It is also considered as one of the city’s sectors which continue to develop its labor force which is sourced from the country’s highly skilled population.\n\nThe municipality’s business strategy is derived from the Abu Dhabi government’s policy agenda (DMA, 2012). This is given the fact that Al Ain is involved in the achievement of the greater plan drawn by the Abu Dhabi government. To this end, it can be argued that the government does benefit from the implementation of the municipality’s vision statement.\n\nPrioritizing the Strategies\n\nIt is also noted that Al Ain has prioritized its individual strategies to make sure that the objectives are fully achieved. This approach has made it possible for the municipality to achieve most of the objectives as compared to other municipalities in the country.\n\nAl Ain municipality has prioritized its strategy within the following areas:\n\nSustaining Urban Development\n\nIt is assumed that the municipality is crucial to the development of Al Ain city and Abu Dhabi at large. The municipality aspires to provide the necessary services and infrastructure in a timely manner. The organization responds to this by focusing on planning and managing infrastructure assets.\n\nImproved Service Delivery\n\nThe structure of the municipality and the strategy adopted makes sure that service delivery to the members of the community and residents of the city is improved. The organization has come up with formula to improve on service delivery. It has adopted a more service- oriented culture in the public sector. The services are also provided from a more customer- centric perspective.\n\nEnhanced Efficiency\n\nThe municipality has also made sure that legal structures have been constituted to enhance efficiency and process excellence as far as provision of services to the residents is concerned. The organization has identified agility and responsiveness to its stakeholder’s needs as one of the important factors in enhancing efficiency.\n\nAccountability and Transparency\n\nThe municipality requires the employees to be accountable. For example, individual employees are required to sign performance contracts within a given period. The contract defines the roles of the employees and the methods to be used in achieving them.\n\nDeveloping National Leadership\n\nIt is noted that the municipality is working on enhancing partnerships with members of the private sector. The organization has contracted the services of other stakeholders to improve service delivery. Within this context, it is noted that the partnership will enable the municipality to attract investors with the aim of improving the quality of services delivered to the members of the community.\n\nThe organization is also making efforts to establish an environment conducive for high Emiratization level. This is by promoting innovation, creativity and leadership for the citizens. It also aims at preserving the knowledge and experience of other qualified international candidates (DMA, 2012).\n\nThe Strategic Issue\n\nA critical analysis of Al Ain Municipality’s strategic plan reveals that several issues that need to be addressed by this organization. We can identify the issues the organization needs to work on solving.\n\nThe following are some of the issues that need to be addressed:\n\n 1. One of the issues that need to be dealt with has to do with the time spent on providing services to the public. To improve the provision of services, the organization needs to cut back on the time spent in delivering the services to avoid delays\n 2. There is also the issue of low integration between efficiency and effectiveness in the practices carried out by the organization.\n 3. The organization is also affected by low interaction between it and members of the public. If this is not addressed, the organization might be alienated from members of the public\n 4. It is also noted that the organization needs to be more open and transparent as far as provision of the services to the public is concerned\n 5. The organization also needs to improve the quality of the services provided to the public while reducing costs at the same time\n 6. The organization is also facing a challenge as far as implementing the Emiratization policy is concerned. This is especially so considering the fact that the organization needs to retain its experienced and qualified international employees\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it is important to note that the organization is grappling with internal and external issues that should be addressed if the municipality is to achieve its objectives. An example of an internal issue has to do with the achievement of the objectives defined in the mission and strategy plan.\n\nThe municipality has identified the source of the problems and needs to work on them to improve efficiency. External issues arise from the pressure put on this organization by stakeholders such as the government to operate more efficiently and effectively (DMA, 2012). This is especially so given that Al Ain Municipality is a section of the Abu Dhabi government. This being the case, the organization has to adhere to the policies and agenda of the government.\n\nAnother issue that has to be addressed by the Al Ain Municipality has to do with the integration of the strategies promoted by the organization with the reluctance of the policy makers to reduce their authority and adapt to changes. The organization should consider re- engineering its processes to address some of these challenges. Specifically, the organization should try to address the problem of bureaucracy in its structure. Bureaucratization is seen to occur in similar public organizations and it’s a hindrance to their organizational development.\n\nReferences\n\nDepartment of Municipal Affairs. (2012).

      "Brady Act Homicide and Suicide Associated Rates Essay\n\nExecutive Summary\n\nThis paper is a critical analysis of the case study conducted by Jens Ludwig and Philip Cook titled, “Homicide and Suicide Rates Associated with the Implementation of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.” The thesis of this paper was to determine whether the enactment of the Brady Act has a significant effect on the rates of homicide and suicide in the USA.\n\nAfter a brief introduction to the topic, this paper summarizes the case study of the authors by highlighting the background of their study, the methods used, their findings, discussions and conclusions. This paper also focuses on the methods that were used by the authors to collect, analyze, and present data for their study. Moreover it focuses on the strengths and weaknesses of the study and concludes by giving the recommendations that can be used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of future studies on the same topic.\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe United States of America has one of the leading rates of homicide and suicide in the world as a result of gun related activities. According to Goss (2006), most of these cases occur due to the possession and usage of firearms by individuals who have criminal records. In response to the, the nation passed the Brady bill into law as a means of minimizing the related acts of gun violence and suicide in the United States.\n\nReferred to as the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act, this bill was signed into law by President Bill Clinton on the 30 th of November 1993 and put into effect on the 28 th of February 1994 (Goss, 2006).\n\nThe main aim of this law is to minimize the purchase and possession of firearms by individuals who have a criminal background. To achieve this, the law introduced a 5-day waiting windowbefore an individual can buy a firearm from federally licensed firearms dealers (FFLs). The 5-day period is used by the FFLs to determine whether or not an individual can own a firearm.\n\nThis law was named after James Brady who was the Whitehouse press secretary during the reign to Ronald Reagan. Brady was fatally injured during the attempted assassination of President Reagan in 1981 (Goss, 2006). After surviving the incident, Brady has been actively involved in campaigns that aim at bringing gun violenceto an end in the United States.\n\nAs such, he played a critical role in the developed and enactment of the Brady bill into law. In the campaign to pass the Brady bill into law, Brady experienced a lot of opposition especially from organizations such as the National Rifle Association (NRF). At the same time, the people who were supporting this bill were uncertain whether it will actually reduce the level of gun violence in the United States. However, they supported the bill since it would actually reduce the ease at which individuals can have access to firearms within the nation.\n\nOn this regards, this paper will critically analyze the case study presented by Jens Ludwig and Philip Cook titled, “Homicide and Suicide Rates Associated with the Implementation of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.” The thesis of this paper is to determine whether the enactment of this act has had a significant effect in reducing the rates of homicide and suicide within the United States of America.\n\nTo realize this, the authors have conducted a series of statistical analyses from data that has originated from the National Centre for Health Statistics (NCHS) from 1985 to 1997. Thus, to realize its objectives, this paper will utilize the 7 stage checklist for program and policy planning.\n\nTherefore, this paper will summarize the case study of the authors, critically analyze the methods that the authors have used to collect relevant data for the study and critique the evidence that the authors have presented to support their thesis statements by determining their strengths and weaknesses.\n\nThe final segment of this paper will comprise of my view on the arguments that has been presented by the authors as well as the current trends regarding the Brady Act. The paper will then close by expounding on the individuals who might benefit from the information presented by this paper.\n\nSummary\n\nThe implementation of the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act in 1994 was received with mixed reactions. According to the authors, there is one group of individuals who viewed this law as a means of curbing gun violence in the USA while another group was skeptical whether the law will significantly reduce gun related violence. In this regard, the authors conducted a study that was aimed at determining whether the implementation of this law actually had a significant impact in the reduction of homicide and suicide rates within the USA.\n\nThis is because this law made it mandatory for FFLs to initiate a 5-day waiting period and also to conduct a background check in order to determine whether the individuals who were purchasing firearms are not legally prohibited. In most cases, the perpetrators of gun violent acts usually have a criminal background (Cook, Lawrence, Ludwig and Miller, 1999).\n\nTherefore, according to the authors, the main aim of the waiting period is to prevent such individuals who are legally prohibited from purchasing a firearm. As the authors state, the effects that the Brady law has on the rates of homicide and suicide have not yet been analyzed since the enactment of this law in 1994.\n\nAs explained by the authors, it is expected that an individual who had planned to shoot either himself or any other individual might change his mind during the 5-day waiting period. At the same time, the authors argue that the background information check plays a significant role in determining whether or not an individual is legally prohibited from purchasing and possessing a firearm.\n\nThus, if an individual falls under the category that prohibits him/her from purchasing a firearm, FFLs will stand a high chance of determining this within this 5-day window. However, it is always debatable whether this check actually reduces the level of homicide and suicide within the USA. With these two different scenarios in mind, the authors of this paper embarked on a study that aimed at comparing the rates of homicide and suicide within the USA before and after the implementation of the Brady Law.\n\nThus, their study focused on the homicide and suicide rates from the year 1985 to the year 1997. The aim of using these two different time periods is to determine whether the changes in the rates of homicide and suicide within the USA is as a result of the implementation of this policy.\n\nTo collect the relevant information that was required for this study, the authors analyzed the data that was collected from two sample groups; the treatment states and the control states. The treatment states comprised of the states that did not have any laws that governed the purchase of firearms. These are thus the states that had just implemented the Brady law.\n\nBased on the overall goals of the bill, it was expected that the rates of homicide and suicide would be lower in the period that followed the implementation of the Act. The treatment states on the other hands comprised of states that had firearm purchase regulation laws. In these states, it was mandatory for FFLs to conduct a background check during the waiting period before an individual purchased a firearm. This regulation was in place even during the period prior to the implementation of the Brady law.\n\nThe main source of data for this study came from the National Centre for Health Statistics. This data was collected between 1985 and 1997 from the treatment and control states that were included in the study. Moreover, to ensure that the collected data was relevant for the study, the authors focused on individuals who were above the age of 21-55 years.\n\nThis is due to the fact that the individuals who are within this age bracket are highly prone to homicide and suicide as compare to the individuals who are below the age of 21 years. Thus, the total rate of homicide and suicide was calculated per 100,000 individuals between the 32 treatment states that were selected and compared with the 18 control states. Other factors that were included in this study were age, sex, the level of poverty, residency (rural/urban), and consumption of drugs and alcohol.\n\nThe results that were arrived at revealed that the rates of homicide and suicide for individuals aged between 21 and 55 years did not change significantly after the implementation of the Brady laws. However, the rates of suicide for individuals who were above the age of 55 years significantly reduced.\n\nThe authors. These results made the authors to conclude that the analysis of the Brady Act based on the rates of homicide and suicide is not effective since it does not consider the transfer of guns from treatment states to secondary gun markets within the USA.\n\nMethods\n\nThe Sample Group\n\nFor a study to have conclusive results, it needs to utilize data collection and presentation techniques that are effective and efficient. On this regard, this study followed an experimental approach. Thus, the main outcomes of this study were:\n\n  * Homicide\n  * Firearm homicide\n  * Suicide\n  * Firearm suicide rates per 100,000 people in the treatment and control states for the study.\n\nAt the same time, this study laid a lot of emphasis on firearm deaths and injuries on the individuals who are above the age of 21 years. This is due to the fact that this is the main target group of the Brady Act. At the same time, it was assumed that this age group also comprised of a higher proportion of the perpetrators as well as the victims. As Basset (2003) asserted, it is critical to ensure that the selected sample group comprises of the variables that are essential for the study.\n\nThe authors of this study went further ahead to replicate this study on individuals who were 55 years of age and older. This is due to the fact that suicide rates are higher for older adults as compared to other groups within the USA population (Goss, 2006). It was thus essential for the study to consider the rates of suicide for individuals who fall within this age brackets before and after the implementation of the Brady Act to determine whether it had significant effects on suicide rates.\n\nFactors\n\nWhile collecting and analyzing the data for this study, the authors considered a number of factors to ensure that the results that they arrive at are conclusive with regards to their study aims. In this respect, this study focused on several factors that might have a direct influence on the rates of crime and violence within the nation. The first factor that the authors looked at was the consumption of alcohol per capita. Alcohol has always been considered as substance that impairs the judgment of individuals.\n\nAccording to Cook et al (1999), an individual who is in such a state is prone to be involved in violent acts especially if he/she is in possession of a firearm. The percentage of individuals who fall within the sample population living within metropolitan regions is another factor that was considered in this study. In the USA, the level of violent crimes is much higher in urban areas as compared to rural areas (Goss, 2006). Another factor that was considered in this study was poverty and the level of income per worker.\n\nPoverty, unemployment, and low income levels are among the leading factors that lead individuals into crime and other illegal activities. Therefore, it was essential for the authors to consider the effects that these factors have on homicide and suicide and whether they have increased or decreased after the implementation of the Brady Act.\n\nClassification of Treatment States\n\nAfter the Brady bill came into law, a total of 32 states were required to implement the 5-day waiting period as the Act stipulates. It was mandatory for these states to implement this law since they FFLs that operated within them did not have such a practice prior to the enactment of this law. The authors of this study referred to these states as “treatment” states. These included states such as New Mexico, Georgia, Kansas, Idaho and so on.\n\nOn the other hand, there were 18 states that had the 5-day waiting period before an individual can purchase a hand gun. Therefore, once the Brady bill became into law, these states did not change their prior practices with regards to the 5-day waiting period. As Cook et al (1999) asserted, these states had put in place the 5-day waiting period about 4 years prior to the implementation of the Brady Act. These states were referred by the authors of this study as “control” states.\n\nEvaluation Strategy\n\nThe main aim of implementing the Brady Act was to reduce the rates of gun related violence within the USA. Therefore, to determine the levels of mortality as a result of gun violence within each state, the authors came up with an equation that considered the controlled variables that have been explained earlier. At the same time, the authors also considered state specific effects that might influence the level of gun violence.\n\nTo minimize the level of errors and to ensure that the results are accurate, the authors used the least squares method. Thus, the application of this equation clearly brings out the changes in homicide and suicide rates in a given state after the implementation of the Brady Act. However, there is also a possibility that these changes have come about as a result of other modeled factors that have changed the trend of gun violence within the USA.\n\nEvidence\n\nIn the USA, gun violence gas grown to become one of the leading menaces in the society. As Goss (2006) asserted, gun violence is one of the highly debated political issues in the USA. The report by Cook et al (1999) stated that this phenomenon is common within poor urban areas among young males. Based on these facts therefore, the authors of this papers have focused on a critical issue that has significant effects in the contemporary American society.\n\nSince the enactment of the Brady Act was met by mixed reactions, it is thus critical to test whether or not this policy has had significant effects in reducing the rates of homicide and suicide in the USA. Therefore, the information contained in this study is beneficial since its results provide people with a concise view of the impacts that the Act has had in the reduction of gun violence within the nation.\n\nIt is essential for researchers to understand the developments that have been made in a particular topic of interest prior to conducting a study (Conkin, 2005). This enables them to understand the gaps in research that have been left in previous studies hence giving the current study a direction to follow. In lieu of this, the current study utilized the information that has been presented in studies and reports that have been conducted in the field of gun violence and the Brady Act.\n\nBy gathering the information that had been presented in these studies, the authors of this paper have developed a thorough understanding of the Brady Act and the role it plays in the reduction of gun violence within the USA. For instance, the study by Cook et al (1999) provided the authors with information regarding the flow of firearms from FFLs that operate in treatments states to secondary gun markets.\n\nThis phenomenon will highly affect the implementation of the Brady Act since it cannot be enforced in secondary gun markets. Thus, this study showed the need of incorporating stringent laws whose application will even capture the sale of guns in the illegal market.\n\nAs a result of this fact, the authors of this paper included state-specific fixed effects in their equation of calculating mortality rates after the implementation of the Brady Act to ensure that such factors are considered in their study. This consideration highly increased the validity and reliability of their results.\n\nA theoretical framework is an essential tool in a research study since it is used to define the set the themes that originate from the literature review that are used to set the boundaries of the current study through conceptual mapping (Conkin, 2005). This tool should also describe the various concepts that are being studied and the relationship that exists between them. The aim of this paper was to determine the impacts of the Brady Act on homicide and suicide after its implementation.\n\nFrom the information that was contained in the literature review, it was found that a high correlation exists between gun violence and factors such as poverty, metropolitan regions, alcohol abuse and so on. At the same time, it was found that the rates of suicide is higher for individuals who are above the age of 55 years. On this regard, the authors considered these trends and factors in their study in order to come up with results that can be used to justify the thesis of their study.\n\nThis study took an experimental design given the fact that it aimed at analyzing archived data through weighted least squares technique. Weighted least squares technique is one of the most effective tools for analyzing descriptive data. This method enables individuals to correct the heteroskedasticity of stochastic data (Ludwig and Cook, 2000). Moreover, this method enabled the process of data analysis and interpretation to be consistent with the theoretical framework hence increasing the validity and reliability of the study.\n\nMoreover, to realize the thesis of this study, the author used two equations; the first equation focused on the mortality rates as a result of gun related violence. The target group of this equation was individuals who were within the ages of 21 and 55 years. According to Goss (2006), this is the age group that is more prone to being the perpetrators and victims of gun violence.\n\nThe second equation focused on suicide rates of individuals who are above the ages of 55 years. In the USA, this is the age group that has the highest rates of suicide. Therefore, use of weighted least squares techniques in conjunction with the two equations played a significant role in the arrival of reliable and valid results of this study.\n\nHowever, unlike other studies that have been conducted on this topic, the current paper failed to have clearly defined research questions and/or hypothesis. Instead, the paper only focused on its main thesis; to determine the impacts of the Brady Act on homicide and suicide. Despite the clarity of the information that was contained the various segments of the paper, the lack of clearly defined research question greatly undermined the overall aim of the paper and the validity and relevance of the results that were collected.\n\nAs Bassett (2003) stated, research questions are essential tools in a scientific study since they act as a link between the literature that has been covered, the methods that will be used to conduct the study, and the manner in which the results will be interpreted. Thus, the arguments presented in this paper would have been more solid if clearly defined research questions, objectives, and hypothesis were used.\n\nThe sample size of this study comprised of 32 treatment states and 18 control states. While it is advised to have a large sample group to increase the generalizability and reliability of a given study, having such a large sample size with many factors and control variables might increase the level and extent of errors in a given study (Basset, 2003). Perhaps it is due to this fact that the authors could not find a significant difference in the rates of homicide before and after the implementation of the Brady Act.\n\nEvaluation\n\nThe paper by Ludwig and Cook has been well presented. First, the paper focuses on a contemporary issue that is affecting the American society. The level of gun violence has been increasing with time. The implementation of the Brady Act in 1994 was expected to reduce the level of gun violence and suicide in the United States. The fact that this paper did not find a significant difference in the levels of homicide in the treatment states before and after the implementation of the Brady Act does not mean that gun violence and suicide have reduced.\n\nAccording to The Brady Campaign (2014), approximately 32 people are killed daily in the USA as a result of gun violence while over 140 more are treated for gun related injuries. Moreover, at least 51 people kill themselves on a daily basis with a firearm while approximately another 45 are accidentally shot with a gun (Cook et al., 1999).\n\nIn addition to the deaths and injuries that come about with gun violence, this phenomenon also has a significant economic impact on individuals and the state at large. According to Cook et al (1999), violence costs the US tax payers approximately $100 billion annually. This figure is significant to the annual budget of the nation.\n\nThrough this paper, therefore, the authors have managed to showcase the trends of homicide and suicide rates as a result of firearms before and after the implementation of the Brady Act. The findings which state that the level of suicide has decreased since the introduction of the Brady Act clearly shows that the low has realized part of its overall mandate.\n\nAt the same time, the findings which showed that the rate of homicide has not decreased since the implementation of this law shows that there are other factors other than the purchase of firearms that have an impact in enhancing homicide and gun related injuries in the USA.\n\nThus, the information that has been presented in this paper can be useful to a number of individuals, bodies and agencies. Parents, for instance, can use this information to try and educate their children against the ill effect of gun violence. The youth on the other hand can use this information to reduce their engagement with the illegal possession and use of firearms.\n\nOn a larger scale, the entire US population can use this information as a means of developing sensible firearm usage within the community. Finally, the government and law making agencies can use this information to amend the Brady Act in order to enhance the effects that it has with regards to curbing gun violence in the USA.\n\nConclusion and Recommendations\n\nEnacted in 1994, the Brady Act is a law enforced in the USA that aim at reducing gun violence by making it mandatory for FFLs to issue a 5-day waiting period before an individual can purchase a firearm. During this period, the FFLs are expected to conduct a background check to determine whether the purchaser is eligible to purchase and possess a firearm as per the requirements of the law.\n\nBased on this fact, the current study was conducted to determine whether there has been a significant difference in homicide and suicide rates in the USA after the implementation of this law. To realize this objective, the study was conducted on 32 treatment states and 18 control states. It was found that there was no significant difference in the homicide rates in the treatment states before and after the implementation of this law. However, the rates of suicide for the elderly population had significantly reduced.\n\nBased on the results of the study, it is evident that the Brady law has no significant impacts on homicide. However, it has greatly reduced the suicide rates of the elderly. Due to this fact I would like to recommend that the future studies should also incorporate the Brady Act can amended to curb the smuggling and illegal purchase of firearms into the USA.\n\nReferences\n\nBassett, C. and Bassett, J.

      "Intellectual Property and E-Business Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Strengths of the Article\n 3. Limitations\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe article in questions dwells upon intellectual property protection. The author provides a brief analysis of major ways to protect intellectual property. The author claims that different countries have a variety of laws aimed at the protection of intellectual property.\n\nKotabe (2010) also argues that the contemporary business world requires global laws that could protect the intellectual property of companies operating in different countries. The author also highlights several global regulations which are being introduced. The author focuses on e-commerce and claims that it is very difficult to ensure the protection of intellectual property due to advances in information technologies. Kotabe (2010) notes that any electronic data are potentially vulnerable.\n\nStrengths of the Article\n\nIt is necessary to state that the issues concerning intellectual property in e-business have been discussed for decades. Melvin (2011) also highlights existing ways to protect intellectual property and stresses the need to introduce global laws which could be applicable in all cases.\n\nKotabe (2010) provides meaningful arguments to support his statement. First, the author analyses such types of intellectual property protection as patents, copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets. The author also mentions several treaties and conventions concerning international treaties for intellectual property protection. Remarkably, the author includes a variety of specific examples from real life. He mentions particular cases concerning intellectual property protection.\n\nThis makes the article more specific and reliable. The author does not simply reveal his viewpoint on the matter but provides specific pieces of evidence. This is one of the strengths of the article. It is also important to note that the author uses simple language along with the necessary terms.\n\nThe outline of the article is also very clear. Subtitles help the reader to easily follow the author. This makes the article suitable for a very wide audience. The article is recent, and it is located in a scholarly journal, which makes it a valuable source of information.\n\nLimitations\n\nNonetheless, the article also has certain limitations. Even though Kotabe (2010) mentions some treaties and conventions which can help multinationals operate globally, it seems insufficient. The author claims that the article touches upon certain limitations in the field. However, these limitations are too general. It is obvious that intellectual property protection laws are different in different countries, and this is one of the limitations.\n\nThe author also mentions that in the process of creation, countries try to ensure more possibilities for companies located within their boundaries. Again, this is too general. The author does not provide sufficient examples to prove his point. This part of the article needs specific examples to form real life, which could speak louder than words.\n\nConclusion\n\nOn balance, it is possible to note that the article in question is a valuable source of information for research concerning intellectual property protection. The author provides a brief analysis of existing types of protection of intellectual law in some countries as well as globally.\n\nThe author claims that the contemporary globalized world needs new regulations as companies are vulnerable due to the potential accessibility of data. However, there are certain limitations to this article. For instance, it is necessary to provide examples of flaws of existing international laws for intellectual property protection. It is also possible to provide a certain methodology which could help develop effective regulations and laws.\n\nReference List\n\nKotabe, M. (2010).

      "Film Studies: “La Strada” by Federico Fellini Essay\n\nPerhaps, one of the most controversial characters in Fellini’s movies, Zampano is a very complex one as well. Despite the seeming simplicity of his desire to be constantly at the helm and control the people, who are under his command, his motivations are rather obscure, much like his background.\n\nThe audience is never told what Zampano’s wishes and fears are; they never hear him saying, “I like this” or “I feel this.” However, Fellini did drop a few clues about Zampano’s nature here and there in the movie. Exploring Zampano’s social, emotional, political, cultural, and experiential background will reveal the motives behind the character’s actions and his unreasonably violent behavior towards the people that trusted him.\n\nZampano’s social background may seem very unclear. His behavior indicates that he was brought up in a rather unprivileged family, while his knowledge and intelligence proves the opposite.\n\nThis uncertainty in the definition of the character’s social origin can be attributed to the fact that Fellini aimed at attacking Fascism and, therefore, portraying his attitude towards the exploitation of people’s emotions and beliefs, as well as the relationships in which one of the sides represents the tyrannical and egotistic, while the other side embodies the essence of blind faith and compliance.\n\nThus, Fellini manages to warn the audience of the threats of Fascism through the implementation of the key principles of neorealism in his movie (Marcus 160).\n\nThe cultural background of the lead character in question shines through in the famous scene, in which he teaches Gelsomina to announce his performance in the circus (“E arrivato Zampano!” (Fellini 30:48). As soon as Gelsomina learns her cue, Zampano retrieves a horn from the depth of his suitcase and blows it. Thus, one may assume that he has been taught the basic skills of playing music and therefore, that he has a rather decent education.\n\nLikewise, the political background of the character can only be seen when reading between the lines of his interaction with Gelsomina and especially Il Matto (“The Fool”). Speaking of the latter, the relationships between him and Zampano can be defined as the search for an appropriate political relationship between the stronger upper class and a more vulnerable lower one.\n\nIronically enough, both of them seem to belong to the lower class, the class of the outcasts: “Normal society dares not risk taking him in” (Grunes para. 3). The details indicating Zampagno’s being a member of the “exploited” members of the society can be traced in such scenes as the famous “Alone” sequence (Fellini 1:05:16)\n\nIn contrast to the previous elements, the emotional back has been explored rather thoroughly in the movie. Campagnolo is portrayed as a restrained, cold and almost bitter man. His desire to be the leader comes from his attempt at bringing the world that collapses around him in order, yet he finally realizes that his attempts are pointless.\n\nThe analysis of Zampano’s background does reveal a range of details that had been passed unnoticed before and can be used to analyze his motivations. Although the movie does not disclose much about Zampano’s origin, family or previous experiences, the clues that Fellini drops in some parts of the narration, as well as the details of Zampano’s interaction with the lead characters, disclose a range of peculiar facts about his past.\n\nA character that seems amazing in his despicability, Zampano used to have a certain flair of mystery around him. After a thorough analysis of the movie elements, the veil dropped, and the source of the brutal force was finally revealed.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFellini, Federico. La Strada .

      "Relationship between Business Ethics and Social Responsibility Essay\n\nBusiness ethics and social responsibility have been topics of heated debates since the middle of the 20 th century. In the 21 st century, the discussion is still relevant as organizations are trying to adjust to the changing environment and remain competitive in the market. Researchers, business people, customers have agreed that companies cannot focus on their profits only and have to contribute to the social development (or rather its aspects) of communities (Tumay 64).\n\nThis is why organizations have to pay attention to such notions as social responsibility and business ethics. Sometimes these concepts are utilized interchangeably. However, it is important to note that although they are related, business ethics and social responsibility are quite different concepts. It is necessary to define the two notions to reveal the relationship between them.\n\nFirst, it can be effective to consider certain historical perspectives to better understand the concepts. It is noteworthy that the discussion of issues associated with ethics and social responsibility occurred in the first part of the 20th century but it was quite sporadic in nature (Carroll and Shabana 86). Comprehensive and systematic debate on the matter started after the World War II.\n\nSome researchers note that the notions of business ethics and social responsibility were “expanded” as tools to defend “free-market capitalism against… Soviet Communism” (Carroll and Shabana 86). It is also noteworthy that in the 1950s, business ethics and social responsibility were not linked to benefits of businesses. In the 1960s, which was the period of Americans’ struggle for civil rights, people also tried to make business people behave in a more responsible way.\n\nHowever, businesses still had quite a specific understanding of the concepts. In the 1960-1970s, the discussion was held mainly in the academic world. Numerous definitions were developed. One of these definitions developed by Keith Davis reveals certain restricted nature of the view on the matter.\n\nThus, Davis noted that social responsibility could be defined as business people’s decisions and actions that went “at least partially beyond the firm’s direct economic or technical interest” (qtd. in Carroll and Shabana 87). The 1980s became the period when the concepts started acquiring their modern meaning for the business world. At that, such concepts as corporate philanthropy and management of stakeholders were central to the understanding of social responsibility and business ethics (Madrakhimova 114).\n\nThose were close notions but they could not fully explain and help practitioners to apply the concepts in question. Prior to defining the concepts, it is also important to identify major peculiarities of the modern business world as the transition from industrial to information world resulted in people’s focus on ethics and social responsibility (Dimitriades).\n\nIn the industrial society, companies focused on production and sales, but the digital world has brought significant changes. It is not enough to produce some goods of certain quality and at certain prices. It is much more important to understand customers’ needs and respond to them in the most efficient way (to be more competitive than others).\n\nAt present, public opinion plays an important role in organizations’ development as favorable views hale companies develop while negative attitude may lead to significant constraints or even bankruptcy. Modern consumers do not expect high-quality products only. They expect that companies that make profit will share and will contribute to the development of the community.\n\nAt present, business ethics and social responsibility are associated with such concepts as corporate citizenship, sustainable development, corporate reputation and others (Madrakhimova 114). It is necessary to note that many approaches to defining the two notions exist (Godiwalla 1383). For instance, there is a profit-oriented approach that is based on the idea that companies have to focus on their economic gains but in terms of sustainable development.\n\nThere is also a stakeholder-oriented approach. It focuses on stakeholders’ needs and economic gains are not primary. This approach is not very popular among for-profit organizations that still strive for profits. There are theories that focus on particular levels (certain types of organizations, certain regions and so on) and some approaches concentrate on global trends.\n\nAs far as modern definitions of business ethics and social responsibility are concerned, they are comprehensive and they respond to the needs of the modern market as well as stakeholders involved. Thus, business ethics can be defined as a set of moral principles that is employed in the business world (Dimitriades). It is necessary to add that business ethics is mainly concerned with morality and ethics.\n\nIn other words, it is concerned with doing right or wrong. Clearly, there are various universal paradigms, but sometimes business ethics can be biased. When it comes to social responsibility, it is also concerned with doing right and doing wrong. Social responsibility is organizations’ responsibility to make choices and undertake actions that will contribute to the social development of communities at different levels (Tumay 64).\n\nImportantly, the concept of social responsibility includes such components as economic, legal, ethical as well as philanthropic (Dimitriades). In other words, it is not only about doing wrong or doing right, it is about doing right and contributing to the social development through attention to the four aspects mentioned above.\n\nIt is noteworthy that there is a significant difference between business ethics and social responsibility as the latter involve particular legal components while the former is more present in the terrain of conventions, culture, morality. With these definitions in view, it is possible to consider the relationship between business ethics and social responsibility.\n\nResearchers stress that business ethics is a broader concept (Belás 120). Hence, it is possible to state that business ethics can be regarded as the basis of social responsibility as it provides a certain kind of paradigm used by businesses. As has been mentioned above, business ethics is developed in terms of culture, beliefs and values of people living in certain areas.\n\nBusiness ethics sets major rules or even directions that are employed when organizations develop their strategic plans and shape their behaviors. Of course, social responsibility is a narrower notion and one of its major components is economic profits. However, the company has to contribute to the social development of a particular (or global) community and this is the terrain where business ethics and social responsibility are closely connected.\n\nThe relationship between social responsibility and business ethics is especially explicit when it comes to operations of multinational companies (MNCs) (Godiwalla 1381). These organizations have a well-established culture. They are committed to contribute to the development of the community and the entire humanity.\n\nAt the same time, their values, beliefs and methods are based on business ethics that has been developed in a particular area. There, these companies have a favorable reputation and they are regarded as socially responsible, which translates into economic gains. However, when a MNC expands and starts operating in a new market, it can lose its favorable image as some major morals, beliefs and values may be unsuitable for a particular region.\n\nThese companies have to change their operations and the way they provide the policy of social responsibility to adjust those policies to the existing business ethics. Of course, companies have to make sure that their operations are consistent with expectations of customers living in this or that area. Otherwise, they will become less competitive and will have to abandon the market, which will lead to reduction of their economic gains.\n\nIn conclusion, it is possible to note that the concepts of business ethics and social responsibility are closely connected. Business ethics can be regarded as a certain background for development of policies used by socially responsible organizations. Thus, business ethics is a set of moral regulations and values.\n\nSocial responsibility is a narrower concept and it consists of four major elements (economic, economic, legal, ethical, philanthropic). Companies still concentrate on their economic gains. However, their actions and decisions made are shaped by the public opinion and profitability of an organization depends on the degree of its responsibility. People now strive for development of the society and organizations that have significant resources are seen as potent agents in this process.\n\nThe public makes these agents contribute to the social development and, in return, customers remain loyal to this or that company. Of course, companies that do not operate in terms of the business ethics developed in the region where they operate and do not contribute to development of communities often have difficulties with attracting customers.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBelás, Jaroslav. “Social Responsibility and Ethics in the Banking Business: Myth or Reality?

      "The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality by Angus Deaton Critical Essay\n\nThis paper is meant to analyze the book The Great Escape: Health, Wealth, and the Origins of Inequality written by an economist Angus Deaton in 2013. As the author claims, revenue disparity among different nations has amplified over the last three centuries.\n\nDeaton gives the USA special attention, asserting that the extent of the nation’s disparity and its political troubles demonstrate the emptiness of the US claim of being a land of opportunity. The dynamics of disparity is particularly interesting.\n\nThe entire disparity of revenue is neither realistic nor advantageous, but the outcomes of disparity may be extremely harmful. The work’s vital geographical and historical background stresses the power of the message.\n\nThis work also offers a huge amount of smart statistical insights, causing the readers to imagine the cruel past, which the West has left behind.\n\nIn this book, the author fundamentally doubts the effectiveness of foreign financial aid, and demonstrates how the part of the global poor people are discovered not in Africa, but in booming, yet fundamentally uneven, economies of India and China. Simultaneously, author’s thesis is generally optimistic: humanity has made crucial progress while increasing its welfare.\n\nIn The Great Escape the author tries to tell the account of progress in profits and health during the past centuries. Through quite sincere preface, the author describe the experience of his own family to exemplify the book’s subject. The author’s father Leslie came into the world in a small village.\n\nHowever, he attended night school to turn out to be a certified civil engineer, and then convinced teachers to educate his son.\n\nThus, young Angus and his sibling became the first children in the entire family to study at the university; nowadays, Leslie’s grandchildren live in “a world of wealth and opportunity that would have been a far-fetched fantasy in the Yorkshire coalfield” (Deaton Preface).\n\nAngus’s father lived into his 90 year, and as the author mentions, his life story is one of enormous enhancements in health and financial security as Leslie’s parents passed away too young from illnesses, which could be cured nowadays.\n\nDeaton uses the work of Robert Fogel in order to create his most significant point. He asserts that the influences of health and prosperity are self-reinforcing.\n\nIf an individual experiences reduced nutrition, he can face a trap when his possible profits are cut as he is physically exhausted to work, but with no work he cannot buy high-quality products.\n\nAt the same time, healthier people can work longer and more effectively, creating profits, which give them far better nutrition and wellbeing. Hence, better wellbeing and prosperity feed one another in this circle.\n\nGenerally, the future that the author predicts is a bright one as life is getting much better. Humans are generally richer than ever before. In 1820-1992, the percent of humans living in extreme scarcity globally fell from 80 to 25 percent.\n\nThe author treats the Industrial Revolution as crossroads in economic growth, turning over centuries of stagnation. Powers in Western Europe and the USA enjoyed evolvement at an unparalleled level. The development in those nations carried on accelerating after the Second World War.\n\nAfter the war there were many pessimistic predictions concerning how human growth would cause the mass famine in the Third World.\n\nHowever, by the most noteworthy features – how long humans live, what they are aware of, how healthy they are – current existing has never been better. It is worth mentioning that the situation is continuing to improve.\n\nThe author certainly understands that some readers will treat these arguments with skepticism. Hence, he deals with possible skeptics with comprehensive and thorough depiction of how life of people all over the world has enhanced. Life expectancy demonstrates 50% since 1900, and it is still increasing.\n\nThe author uses many graphs and additional data to support his point of view. He attributes better health of people to increased nutrition and control of illnesses via public health measures. Moreover, better sanitation and clean water lessened the spread of sicknesses.\n\nOther programs, such as vaccination program also lessened infant mortality. Also, in spite of the resultant populace outburst, the quality of life has enhanced. The part of humans living on less than one dollar a day has dropped to %15, from nearly 40% as it was in the year 1981.\n\nThis work’s final chapter is dedicated to the impact of foreign aid on national evolvement (Deaton 267-325). Consistent with the author, aid does not merely have a positive effect on the national evolvement; actually, it delays it.\n\nThe author claims that financial aid prevents evolvement by breaking the necessity for administrations to be answerable to their people. The supporters of aid claim that the aid has to be substantial to help the nation. Nevertheless, Deaton believes that this approach can fail, as the trouble is not, in fact, a lack of sources.\n\nHe asserts that it is corrupt and unproductive organizations and politics that hinder country’s economic growth. Moreover, there are certain troubles with the approach to the structure of financial aid. Hence, Deaton joins other economists in disapproving financial aid.\n\nHe does not think that all sorts of aid are terrible. In fact, aid can save lives. Nevertheless, the advantages that financial foreign aid offers, should be estimated against its drawbacks, and Deaton thinks that aid damages countries over the long run (Deaton 267-325).\n\nThe book elaborates on one fundamental recommendation for assisting the poor countries: reduce the aid budgets.\n\nAid never promotes development. In fact, abundant aid is a way to growth, which may damage institutions – permitting rulers to do whatever they want without any approval as they do not have to tax local populace.\n\nHowever, Deaton treats far more sympathetically aid directed at enhancing health, as that may address certain malfunctions of market provision. Deaton admits that foreign aid has saved many lives in poor nations by reducing childhood deaths from contagious illnesses.\n\nHowever, even in health field aid’s role is restricted by the fact that it does not assist in creating the necessary fundamental health system. Prosperous nations’ investment in investigation, whose advantages would flow to the poorest states, could be especially helpful. Aid as knowledge rather than money is precious as well.\n\nThus, the author concludes that the record of external aid reveals no confirmation of any general valuable influence. Financial help weakens organizations, democracy and national prosperity. He claims that the foreign assistance has to be cut.\n\nThe prosperous nations should leave the evolving nations to grow using their own resources, in their own time, just as all developed states did. Deaton explains that if all circumstances for evolvement other than funds exist, resources will be gathered locally quite soon.\n\nHowever, if the circumstances for evolvement do not exist at the moment, then aid will be unproductive and, hence, useless. In fact, other tools, such as immigration, trade liberalization, and subsidy reform do more to support the national development.\n\nPrincipally, prosperous nations have to stop creating barriers in the way of the growth of poor states. Trade restrictions and farm funding put poor nations at a terrible position. The regulations on intellectual property rights should be modified so that they can never show favoritism against the poorest states.\n\nEasier migration can be the most useful aid policy. The immigrants from all countries are better off than ever before. The money they send back home also enhances the economic situation in the state.\n\nThese flows of money, which are, in fact, larger than the flows of financial foreign aid, may allow recipients to demand more from their administration, enhancing own political power instead of weakening it.\n\nEssentially, the author offers the readers three significant messages:\n\nFirst of all, for the majority of humans on this planet, life is longer, better and wealthier than all previous generations could have expected.\n\nSecond, obvious disparity within prosperous nations may be a hazardous issue. The author ties together the concept of Pareto optimality – the concept that some alteration reflects an enhancement if as a minimum one human being is feeling better.\n\nThis concept has been treated as the idea offering justification for trickle-down theories, but merely due to the fact that economists have used it narrowly to profits rather than to general social welfare.\n\nIn fact, disparity can be justified, but not the degrees of disparity in America nowadays, which weakens public services and provides the small interest groups with excessive lobbying control. The hazard is not merely to the happiness of the deprived citizens, but to general democracy and development.\n\nPowerful and rich upper class has choked off economic development before, and they can do it again if they are permitted to weaken the organizations on which international evolvement depends.\n\nThird, foreign aid is, in fact, a part of the dilemma, not the resolution. The author discusses other options, which might be more successful, embracing eradicating obstructive trade limitations, facilitating the temporary immigration and offering incentives for drug organizations to invest in medicines for certain diseases, for instance, malaria (Deaton 267-325).\n\nTo sum up, in his book, Deaton doubts the effectiveness of foreign aid, and portrays how the greater part of the global poor people are discovered not in Africa but in the flourishing, yet fundamentally uneven, economies, such as China and India.\n\nAt the same time, author’s thesis is generally optimistic: humanity has made crucial progress increasing its welfare.\n\nThis book is especially successful in two dimensions: it dedicates lots of attention to the thorough clarification of the measurement of dissimilar wellbeing features and ties among them; and the restrictions of what one can conclude from dissimilar features in terms of their causes and effects, given the accessible data and approaches.\n\nThis work avoids the intellectual disputes in economics, instead concentrating on offering the facts in an obvious and wide-ranging way. Hence, the book is mostly accurate and not controversial excluding the final two chapters.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDeaton, Angus.

      "Multilingualism and Children Language Behaviour Proposal Essay\n\nThe proposed study touches upon the effects of multilingualism on children’s language behaviour, this is why the research locale should be properly chosen.\n\nIt is reasonable to find 20-50 children from age 4 to 16, who grow or grew up in a bilingual or multilingual society (e.g. with parents, who may use different languages or have to live in one language-speaking society and do not want to neglect their native language); they usually live in particular blocks with their own cultural and ethical history that is supported by their parents or other relatives and fellows.\n\nA multilingual society is not a new issue nowadays, and children have to live in it without understanding its true essence and possible outcomes of their further development.\n\nThe effects of multilingualism on children’s language behaviour may vary considerably: from the inabilities to apply specific cultural norms to the current living conditions to the ways of how a communication process may be organized.\n\nChildren, who have to grow up in a multilingual society, may face a number of problems that define the quality of their language behaviour and influence the styles of life considerably.\n\nThis is why it is very important to investigate the effect of multilingualism on children in order to learn how to overcome possible problems and threats, improve the living conditions of such children, and assist parents in identifying the main components of communication that have to be considered in a children’s educational process by parents or other care givers and teachers.\n\nThe theory called the ethnography of speaking (or ethnography of communication), offered by Dell Hymes, will be used to situate the problem of multilingualism and its effect on children’s language behaviour as it helps to comprehend the components of communication and their role in the process of education.\n\nAccording to this theory, speech behaviour should be analysed in two types of contexts, social and cultural , in order to identify a number of culturally relevant features of possible variation, explicit and implicit norms of communication, and verbal and nonverbal parameters of interaction (Hymes, 2013).\n\nHymes’s theory (the ethnography of speaking) and the identification of the main components of communication) seem to be an appropriate idea that helps to address the problem and find out the most appropriate solutions.\n\nHis speaking model is a good chance to promote the analysis of speech events within a particular cultural context (Johnstone & Marcellino, 2010). The identification of the components like the genre, purpose, setting, etc. is an important step in understanding children’s language behaviour that cannot be neglected.\n\nIn case all the components are clearly identified and the categories for analysing a speech event are mentioned, the effect of multilingualism on children’s language behaviour cannot be negative, but turns out to be positive for a future development of a child.\n\nReference List\n\nPrimary Source: Hymes, D.

      "Tort Law: “Butler v. United States” Case Study\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Details of the Case\n 2. The Sides’ Arguments during the Case\n 3. The Ruling in the Case\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. References\n\nNegligence is usually discussed as a tort which is associated with performing a wrong act which causes damages or with failing to perform the act necessary to treat a person accordingly and to cope with the illness (Pozgar, 2012, p. 32-34).\n\nWhile referring to the cases of negligence which can be discussed in the context of the tort law, it is necessary to focus on the case Butler v. United States (2012) involving Kay Butler as a plaintiff and the United States of America and Veterans Administration as defendants. The decision on the case was announced on December 19, 2012 ( Butler v. United States 2012 , 2014, par. 3).\n\nThe Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals supported the judgment declared by the district court, and Mrs. Butler’s appeal was not satisfied because of failing to support the argument. In order to understand the aspects of the case, it is necessary to provide the case’s details, and analyze the effectiveness of the stated arguments in relation to the principles of the healthcare law and tort law.\n\nDetails of the Case\n\nMr. Butler, a husband of Kay Butler and a veteran of the armed forces, was diagnosed by a physician working at the Veterans Administration center in Durham, North Carolina, as having a vascular condition. Dr. Jonathan Gray concluded that Mr. Butler needed the urgent surgery. The diagnosis was announced in 2004. During the post-operative period, Mr. Butler was paralyzed from the chest down.\n\nThe health state of the patient worsened significantly during the following months. Mr. Butler died from developed sepsis on March 15, 2005 ( Butler v. United States 2012 , 2014, par. 5-7).\n\nMrs. Butler claimed to receive the compensation benefits from the Veterans Administration for negligent actions of the physicians which led to the death of the patient. Having received the benefits, Mrs. Butler appealed to court against the United States of America as a defendant in the case.\n\nThe Sides’ Arguments during the Case\n\nThe arguments of Mrs. Butler was based on providing the evidence to support the fact that carelessness of the surgeons, negligence during diagnosing and performing the surgery, and the lack of proper skill led to the injury and the death of the patient.\n\nThe claim of Mrs. Butler was satisfied in relation to the duty of the physicians and the Veterans Administration. However, the argument of Mrs. Butler against the United States to affirm the wrongful death of the husband lacked the evidence of the experts in the field (Pozgar, 2012, p. 34).\n\nThe Veterans Administration and the United States as defendants provided the support to their arguments with references to the Federal Tort Claims Act and principles of confirming the fact of negligence. Referring to the North Carolina law, the expert witness is required to discuss violation of the standard of care ( Butler v. United States 2012 , 2014, par. 5-7).\n\nThe argument of the defendants failed to reject the medical malpractice action in relation to the Veterans Administration, but the argument to support the position of the United States as a defendant was reasonable (Mandelstam, 2002, p. 54).\n\nThe Ruling in the Case\n\nThe complaint against the Veterans Administration was affirmed, and Mrs. Butler received the compensation associated with causing the death of her husband and necessary VA benefits. However, the complaint against the United States of America as a defendant because of the loss of consortium was not affirmed.\n\nIt was stated that Mrs. Butler’s FTCA claim directed toward arguing the duty of the United States of America as a defendant cannot affect the received benefits and compensation ( Butler v. United States 2012 , 2014, par. 5-7). As a result, the previous decision of the district court was discussed as reasonable (Hammaker, 2010, p. 122). The problem was in the fact that Mrs. Butler did not present the required expert witness\n\nConclusion\n\nIn spite of the fact that Mrs. Butler’s claim related to responsibility of the Veterans Administration and physicians was affirmed, her legal argument to state the loss of consortium was weak because of impossibility to provide the expert’s evidence. In this case, the best legal argument related to the issue was provided by the United States of America as a defendant.\n\nMrs. Butler’s argument related to stating the negligence in relation to the physicians’ activity was rather effective because she provided the evidence to support the fact that the surgical procedure was performed with violating the norms, and the physicians failed to diagnose the patient. All the elements of negligence such as the duty to care, breach of duty, injury, and causation were presented and supported with evidence.\n\nIn this case Mrs. Butler presented a prima facie case of negligence. That is why, Mrs. Butler received the compensation. However, Mrs. Butler failed to provide the necessary support and evidence for the argument while appealing to the court against the United States of America as a defendant.\n\nWhile discussing the standard of care, it is necessary to provide the expert’s evidence to support the argument in North Carolina. The defendant provided the most convincing argument in this case, and the claim was not affirmed.\n\nReferences\n\nButler v. United States 2012 . (2014).

      "“Urban and Rural Estimates of Poverty: Recent Advances in Spatial Microsimulation in Australia” by Tanton, R, Harding, A, and McNamara, J Essay (Critical Writing)\n\nSummary of the content\n\nThe purpose of this article was to use “a spatial microsimulation model to calculate the rates of poverty for small areas in Australia” (Tanton, Harding & McNamara 2010, p. 52).\n\nThe spatial microsimulation approach used in this research involved “reweighting data from Confidentialised Unit Record Files (CURFs) from surveys conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) to small area census data, also from the ABS” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 52). The authors considered spatial microsimulation as a substitute for other methods used in spatial analysis (Tanton et al. 2010).\n\nMicrosimulation considers small area in spatial analysis. The maps of poverty rates were obtained from small area estimation. They covered the eastern coast of Australia and its capital cities. The researchers further conducted “poverty analysis to determine poverty rates in capital cities” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 52).\n\nFrom this research, the researchers established that specific areas of higher poverty risks could be effectively located within Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Brisbane (Tanton et al. 2010).\n\nIn addition, they also found that areas of high poverty were mainly “buffered’ by areas with moderate rates of poverty” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 52). The researchers, however, noted that this was not often the case because there were some high poverty areas close to low poverty areas. Nevertheless, there were poverty buffers in most capital cities.\n\nA critical analysis of the content\n\nLiterature coverage\n\nThe article relied on previous studies to identify the gap in the field. For instance, the researchers noted that for a long time Australian researchers have experienced challenges related to producing neighbourhood level estimates of household features such small cases of poverty or housing stress, which affect social policies. This shows that the researchers were able to identify limitations of available literature and fill the gap.\n\nThe study was based on past studies. It showed that past studies have used national measures to understand variations in socioeconomic characteristics of households (Harding, Lloyd & Greenwell 2001; Pfeffermann 2002). In addition, recent studies used in the research showed that Australia and the UK have focused on developing studies based on spatial microsimulation (Ballas, Clarke, Dorling Rigby & Wheeler 2006).\n\nThe researchers acknowledged that previous studies were used to develop the methodological framework for their research. As a result, they were able to apply it on available data from Australian Census and other survey data to estimate poverty rates in cities. The article also acknowledged sources of data used in the spatial microsimulation methodology.\n\nLiterature used in this study is current and sufficiently covers the issue under study. Overall, the study has a thorough literature review, which provides background of the study and supports the model and findings.\n\nAppropriateness of materials used\n\nFrom the reference list, one can notice that the researchers used literature from various sources such as books, journal articles, research reports, national study reports and statistics among others. For instance, the researchers noted that national sample surveys were key sources of data.\n\nAustralia conducts a census after every five years to determine changes in gross income of households and people and understand factors that influence income variations.\n\nIn addition, national data provided “highly sophisticated information on relative advantage and disadvantages on disposable measures such as cash income, adjusted incomes for households and incomes for supporting each household” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 52).\n\nBooks provided background information on spatial microsimulation and small area factors. Therefore, the researchers were able to develop a synthetic estimate of every small area under investigation. In short, they noted that small area synthetic or estimation originated from the field of statistics and therefore, researchers could use microsimulation methodology as an alternative to other statistical models.\n\nArticles used in the study provided recent practices and areas of knowledge gap in small area spatial analysis. As a result, the researchers were able to develop an appropriate microsimulation model for the study. They also identified richer information about household characteristics than information contained in the census.\n\nMaps for the study were obtained from Spatial Microsimulation- SpatialMSM07a applied to STINMOD06B. In addition, there were also data from CURFs that were reweighted and Survey of Income and Housing – 2002/03 and 2003/04 (Tanton et al. 2010).\n\nOrganisation of the reading and development of ideas\n\nTanton et al. (2010) presented their idea clearly and logically supported with an abstract that provided overview of key issues covered.\n\nThe article presented an introduction that covered past challenges in spatial microsimulation analyses. This section also showed that researchers had experienced challenges in their attempts to obtain small area socioeconomic data. At the same time, it also covered literature review that presented background and theoretical underpinnings for the study.\n\nThe researchers then moved to a methodology section. This part covered various stages in developing regional poverty estimates or weights. The researchers also presented research benchmark variables in this section. There were also details on how the weights were applied in the study and calculating poverty rates.\n\nThe application section described how a spatial microsimulation model could be applied in various situations. For instance, Tanton et al. (2010) showed that the model could be used in the calculation of small area poverty rates and reviewing the regional effect of tax changes. The analysis of urban areas showed how “poverty rates were distributed in various parts of capital cities studied” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 58).\n\nHence, they showed clearly how microsimulation could be applied in in-depth analysis of urban poverty rates. Application in analysis of scenario modelling showed how the model could be used to understand effects of changes in taxes and transfer policies on a given population or household.\n\nFinally, the study also presented a clear conclusion. They showed that spatial microsimulation could be used to analyse poverty distribution in capital cities. The researchers concluded that, “poverty in urban areas tended to cluster in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, but did not do so to the same extent in Brisbane” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 62).\n\nPresentation of the argument\n\nIt is imperative to recognise that the authors attempted to improve on challenges that Australian researchers encountered when handling spatial microsimulation analyses. Hence, many studies in this research tend to support the ideas expressed in the article. Nevertheless, the researchers acknowledged that it was difficult to overcome challenges posed by variations in population sizes.\n\nSpecifically, such differences caused problems in data analysis. For instance, larger cities were likely to have populations with similar characteristics and therefore identifying poverty concentrations could be difficult in such areas relative to less populated areas. The researchers noted that such problems could not be overcome completely, but they provided population weighted quintiles of poverty rate to address them.\n\nThe authors showed that their findings differed slightly with findings based on STINMOD data. They claimed that such differences were expected because STINMOD data on poverty rates were usually lower relative to “aggregated synthetic estimates from the Survey of Income and Housing” (Tanton et al. 2010, p. 57).\n\nIn addition, they also showed that other confounding variables, such as the use of government benefits and headcount measure of poverty rates, could have created significant differences.\n\nOverall, the article presented a balanced argument with opposing findings alongside possible explanations for such variations.\n\nUse of language and statements on the significance of the findings\n\nThe use of the language in the study to demonstrate research findings is appropriate. The researchers clearly stated the outcomes of the study and its application in various areas. It is imperative to note that the researchers compared their study findings with other past results for credibility. They acknowledged the causes of slight variations in outcomes.\n\nTanton et al. (2010) validated their results thoroughly and determined poverty distribution across various cities under study. They noted similarities in outcomes between synthetic and census data. This implies that the researchers did not overstate the importance of their study outcomes or applications.\n\nThe study also showed similar results to those obtained in the 2006 Census data maps. It is imperative to recognise that this study aimed to provide a spatial microsimulation model that could be used to measure poverty in small populations. A lack of such measures has been major obstacles for researchers in Australia.\n\nConclusion with a synopsis of the main learning from the research\n\nTanton et al. (2010) provided a clear conclusion of their study alongside an abstract with the general overview of the study. It was therefore simple for other researchers to understand the purpose and outcomes of the study.\n\nFor instance, in the conclusion section, the researchers restated the purpose of the research as the application of a spatial microsimulation methodology to analyse and understand poverty distribution in a given urban area. Most importantly, the conclusion provided specific areas alongside poverty rate distribution, as well as differences between areas.\n\nThey also showed that the study results were validated for accuracy and comparison with previous studies. There were insignificant differences between synthetic data and census data. While the study showed that the outcomes conformed with the findings obtained from 2006 Census data, the researchers did not provide implications or weaknesses of their study in the conclusion section.\n\nReference List\n\nBallas, D, Clarke, G, Dorling, D, Rigby, J, & Wheeler, B 2006, ‘Using geographical information systems and spatial microsimulation for the analysis of health inequalities’, Health Informatics Journal, vol. 12, pp. 65–79.\n\nHarding, A, Lloyd, R & Greenwell, H 2001, Financial Disadvantage in Australia 1990 to 2000: the Persistence of Poverty in a Decade of Growth, The Smith Family, Sydney.\n\nPfeffermann, D 2002, ‘Small area estimation- new developments and directions’, International Statistical Review, vol. 70, pp. 125–143.\n\nTanton, R, Harding, A, & McNamara, J 2010, ‘Urban and Rural Estimates of Poverty: Recent Advances in Spatial Microsimulation in Australia’, Geographical Research, vol. 48, no. 1, pp. 52–64. doi: 10.1111/j.1745-5871.2009.00615.x\n",
      "Manchester United FC: Continuing Success but at What Cost? Case Study\n\nIntroduction\n\nBased in old Trafford, Manchester United is one of the leading and well renowned football clubs not only in the UK but also in the world. The club was initiated in 1878. It then had the name Newton Health before changing to its current brand name – Manchester United in 1902.\n\nIt was one of the founding members of the premier league back in 1992. Since 1938, Manchester United has always played the top division in English soccer apart from seasons of 1974 and 1975. The club has also recorded outstanding average attendance compared to all other English football clubs.\n\nCompared to any other organisation, soccer clubs are unique since they are subjected to various market forces and dynamics that act as threats to their performance and hence success. Success may be measured from different paradigms depending on the industry in which an organisation is established.\n\nFor football clubs, success may be measured from the number of wins of the club in the tournaments. Apparently, such success is also correlated to financial success. The success of Manchester United is owed to the exemplary management of Alex Ferguson.\n\nGiven the competitive nature of the football club business, Manchester United stands out as an ample example of analysing the success of organisations.\n\nManchester United has successfully managed to place its brand. The club is the reining champion in the European and English champions. It won 2007-2008 UEFA champions league and 2007 -2008 premier league coupled with 2008 FIFA world cup.\n\nIndeed, Manchester has won enormous numbers of world football honours since when Alex Ferguson was appointed the manager in 1986. For instance, the club won the European cup making it the first football club to take home the cup when it beat Benfica 4-1 in 1968.\n\nIt later won the same cup in 1999 for the second time and in 2008 for the third time. Furthermore, the club has also kept the world record having won the most FA cup titles.\n\nFrom financial contexts, the club is also immensely successful. As from 1990s, Manchester United has gone down the history as the richest club of the English premier league. However, Liverpool may dispute this argument.\n\nThe club also generates the largest amount of the revenues among all the clubs taking part in the European cup and English premier leagues. Such an enormous success of an organisation does not come easily: there is always an accompanying cost.\n\nConsidering Manchester United as the case study, the paper analyses the roles of CSR in the success of an organisation. However, before this is done background information is provided by discussing the success of Manchester United from both the contexts of tournament wins and financial performance.\n\nThe Case Study Description\n\nWithin the whole of Europe, Manchester United stands the third club just behind Barcelona and Real Madrid from the contexts of turnover.\n\nApart from the recent past (2008) wining in the European champions’ league, Manchester United has also managed to get to European champions final in 2008. On the other hand, with regard to Pyle (2010), “…the financial position of the club remains precarious despite its success on the football field” (p.601).\n\nThis argument is significant by appreciating the fact that, in 2009, Manchester United football club made revenues amounting to 278.5 million pounds. The club also reported, “Increased profits (before interests and taxation) to the tune of 90.3 m million pounds (up 13.6 percent)” (Pyle 2010, p.601).\n\nMuch of this profit was acquired through the sale of players (80.7 million pounds). The financial success of the Manchester United is outstanding upon comparing this profit to that of the red football limited.\n\nIn this end, Pyle (2010) argues, “red football limited (the parent company of MUFC owned by the Glazer family) reported a profit of by 6.4 million pounds due to interest payments of 68.5 million pounds paid on the erroneous debt incurred to purchase the club” (p.601).\n\nThe support of Manchester United across the globe is also incredible and a contributing factor to the success of the club. However, this does not imply that the English premier league clubs are not open to criticism over how they handle their financial matters.\n\nFor instance, Pyle (2010) reckons, “many fans are unhappy about the way English premier league football clubs are developing into multinational businesses with global brands, aggressive marketing, and foreign owners (some of dubious reputations)” (p.601).\n\nIndeed, some clubs have gone on record to have spent a lot of money often leading the clubs to experience large debts often exceeding levels that are justifiable by the turnovers that are made by the clubs.\n\nThe hefty spending is normally justified by the people who fund the clubs. This case makes commentators on the future performance of the football clubs worried that some of the billionaires who fund the clubs may get bored at some point to the extent of considering withdrawing their support.\n\nThe repercussion for this attempt would plunge the clubs to large financial debts that would often make business impossible. The main question that remains is whether Manchester United would be able to ensure that its entire stakeholders would be satisfied should such a situation occur.\n\nAmid being faced by the above interrogative, the brand of the Manchester United remains one of the most well built among the football clubs playing the English premier league. In fact, “the basis of Manchester United’s business success and global brand is rooted in the club’s history and traditions” (Pyle 2010, p.601).\n\nSince the first win of the European cup, in the time of Sir Matt, the company grew from small to a public limited company. At this time the chairman of the company, Martin Edwards, principally focused on handling the challenge of hiking funds for helping the company to improve and maintain its success in the pitch.\n\nAn effort was made to raise funds for attracting new top players. In 1991, “the club was floated on the London Stock Exchange with a valuation of 40 million pounds” (Pyle 2010, p.602).\n\nThis move was strategic for the success of Manchester United since, in 1994 through 1997, the company was able to have an accumulate share sales amounting to 71 million pounds.\n\nIn the effort to ensure that Manchester United remained a respected club, in 2002, Martin Edwards stepped down to pave way for Sir Roy to take over the leadership of the plc.\n\nIn 1991, when Manchester United was placed on flotation, there was minimal number of companies that had acquired a structure similar to that of plc. Therefore, the move was incredibly disputable though it attracted enormous controversies.\n\nFor instance, Pyle (2010) quote sir Ferguson reckoning, “when the plc started, there were grave doubts about it – I had them myself – but I think the supporters came round” (p.601). Indeed, the success of the club was looming. Manchester United had even overtaken Liverpool.\n\nTherefore, this move had little impacts on the growth and success of the company. Hence, worries accompanied by controversies were well resolved.\n\nOperating as a plc, an organisation seeks to expand its clientele. Manchester United embarked on a mission to seek out for global presence. This strategic goal resorted to the recruitment of Peter Keyon in 1997 “due to his marketing and branding experience” (Pyle 2010, p.602).\n\nHis experience was vital in helping the company to build a business interest that had a global feel. Through the effort of Peter Keyon, “sales of replica kits and all manner of club-related gifts continued to expand quickly with its merchandising success becoming the bench mark for the industry” (Pyle 2010, p.602).\n\nConsequently, Manchester United ended up being a brand that is known by almost everybody across the globe. However, the contribution of Peter Keyon in enhancing the success of Manchester United attracted the attention of rivals (Chelsea) who offered him a competitive package besides subsequently getting him out of Manchester United.\n\nNevertheless, this did not deter the continued success of the plc since his deputy Roman Abramovich took over. He has been incredibly instrumental in the continued growth of the company.\n\nPlcs have numerous obligations to achieve on behalf of the owners. On one hand, for the case of Manchester United, “shareholders demanded profits although some shares were held by supporters where the vast majority were owned by financial institutions, which were looking for returns on their investments” (Pyle 2010, pp.602-3).\n\nOn the other hand, apart from the owners of a plc, it is vital that a company seeks to achieve its success through operating and behaving in a socially corporate manner.\n\nTo achieve these goals, and to help in building further on the brand image of football clubs, the clubs have always welcomed the interest of media people to get into deals with them.\n\nFor instance, according to Pyle (2010), Manchester United signed a deal with America Online Corporation biding the two organisations between 2010/11 to 2014/15 worth 80 million pounds (p.603).\n\nManchester United has done a great deal of investments in sporting facilities and other social amenities. All these have gone into increasing the size of the club in terms of increasing the revenues generated through fees levied on sporting facilities.\n\nHowever, amid the increased revenues, Manchester United’s financial structures attract an immense alarm. It has been experiencing rising debts. Due to this reason, “Glazers converted 500 million pounds of debt into bonds, which do not mature until 2017” (Pyle 2010, p.604).\n\nAlthough it was an incredible financial relief to the club, these bonds will attract an interest of 45 million pounds, which will have to be paid in 2017. Now, it sounds plausible to question the sustainability of the Manchester United model for doing business.\n\nWould it enable the club to have continued growth in the future? Should the club develop new a mechanism of developing further its brand? If so, can social corporate responsibility aid in enhancing better and sustained growth of the club in the future?\n\nSWOT and PESTEL Analysis of Manchester United\n\nSWOT Analysis\n\nSWOT analysis seeks to reveal the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and the threats faced by an organisation in its normal business operations.\n\nThe idea for doing this is based on the argument that when these elements are clear, it becomes possible for the management of the organisation in question to concentrate on the strengths and opportunities.\n\nThis strategy enhances its performance while ensuring that its takes appropriate strategies to ensure that the weaknesses and threats are mitigated in the effort to attain optimality of the performance of the organisation.\n\nEssentially, SWOT analysis entangles strategic planning approach for evaluating the strengths, limitations, and opportunities coupled with threats that business establishment encounters (Hill & Westbrook 2006, p.47). Strengths are the traits that enable an organisation to have an advantage in comparison to other organisations.\n\nOne of the strengths of Manchester United is that it is has managed to build a highly recognised brand across the globe. The club has incredible marketing strategies coupled with merchandising practices that are of high quality.\n\nManchester United stands as one of the richest football clubs with a football stadium (Trafford) having the highest capacity (75,000). Large numbers of sponsors including AON, Nike, Airtel, Vodafone, AIG, and others also support the club.\n\nAlthough Manchester United has incredible strengths that have made it remain competitive in the UK’s football market, it has some weaknesses. Weaknesses or the limitations are the traits of an organisation that place it at a disadvantage in comparison with other organisations in the same industry (Hill & Westbrook 2006, p.47).\n\nOne of the subtle weaknesses of Manchester United is attributed to the fact that the club faces financial challenges. It also operates in a saturated market.\n\nOpportunities are the existing external chances, which while utilised make an organisation improve its performance (Hill & Westbrook 2006, p.49).\n\nOne of the opportunities for Manchester United is the possibility of tapping fans from all across the globe including regions such as the USA, India, and China. Additionally, brand visibility and advertising can aid in building brand equity.\n\nThreats are the external chances that impair the performance of an organisation (Hill & Westbrook 2006, p.49). One of the threats of Manchester United is the external competitive market forces in which other clubs purchase many of the good players.\n\nThere are also instances in which the management encounters conflicts with the players. Additionally, expensive transfers of players make Manchester United experience financial debts.\n\nPESTLE Analysis\n\nA number of factors influence the decisions of managers of any organisation. From the PESTEL organisational analysis approach, these factors are political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal (Gerry, Kevan & Whittington 2005, p.105).\n\nFor the case of Manchester United, the political environment affects the operations of the club via taxing policies since the club must pay taxes to the government. The management must also comply with environmental regulations, tariffs, and employment laws established within the UK.\n\nFrom the perspective of economic factors, the operational economic environment of the Manchester United is characterised by fluctuations. These fluctuations create barriers to the margin of profits that the club can reinvest in growth and or channelling to CSR.\n\nSocial factors act as an immense success factor of the club because spectators, players, and the staffs of Manchester United are promised compliance to safety standards hence enhancing the security of all stakeholders attending the Manchester United matches at the club’s facilities. This provision is critical in retaining and attracting new clients.\n\nIn terms of technology, Manchester United deploys the internet to accomplish tasks such as booking for seats in the stadium. Manchester United is also incredibly concerned about its environmental impacts especially accruing from inappropriate disposal of materials that wrap the consumables used by fans during the matches.\n\nVarious legal provisions that regulate the manner of conducting business also bind an organisation. Thus, Manchester United is bound by all legal provisions that control and monitor operations of plc applicable in the UK.\n\nSummary of Scholarly Articles\n\nMany organisations look for mechanisms of enhancing their performance. One of such methodologies is by becoming socially responsible.\n\nChallenged by the problems of how an organisation may increase its performance by being socially responsible, Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) conduced a “qualitative study of the legal, ethical, and moral statements available on the websites of Forbes Magazine’s top 50 U.S. and top 50 multinational firms of non-U.S” (p.175).\n\nAnalysis was conducted “within the context of stakeholder theory” (Snider, Hill, & Martin 2003, p.175). The authors cite business scandal in America such as the Tyco, WorldCom, and Enron as among the major drawbacks of development and building investor’s confidence.\n\nThey further postulate that these scandals may have an immense contributor to the economic down turn that was experienced in 2009 and 2011 in America. The impacts of this down turn on their full thresh hold were further spread into other regions of the world.\n\nArguably, this led to what became the global financial crisis. In this end, Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) argue, “in the aftermath of these egregious acts, the business community should be rethinking its responsibilities to the various publics concerned with its operations” (p.176).\n\nThis means that organisations that were caught up in engagement on fraudulent activities never considered moral and ethical considerations of their behaviour.\n\nCorporate social responsibility is anchored on the pillars of taking into perspectives the impacts of any organisational decision on the stakeholders and all interest groups in the performance of an organisation.\n\nThis case implies that any course of action adopted by any organisation should not compromise or rather place the stakeholders and the organisational interest groups at a disadvantage.\n\nHence, it is critical that ethical behaviour be strongly embedded in all operations of public limited companies. Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) concur with this line of argument by further reckoning, “the public is focused now more than ever on what firms are saying about their corporate social responsibility” (p.176).\n\nSoccer organisation encompasses some of the organisations where the stakeholders and other interest groups’ concerns on the performance of an organisation need to be proactively addressed and managed for continued operation of the organisation.\n\nThe main question is what the central significance of social corporate responsibility in success of organisations is.\n\nSocial corporate responsibility defines the obligations that an organisation has on the communities and the larger society. Compliance to principles of corporate responsibility requires an organisation to commit its resources to fund activities that are of social benefit.\n\nSnider, Hill, and Martin (2003) admit that this attracted heavy criticisms with many researchers choosing to evaluate the question: “should companies take responsibility for social issues?” (p.176). In response to this query, Kok et al (2001), suggest, “the only social responsibility of business is to increase profits by legal means” (p. 286.).\n\nThe implication of this argument is that any investment of financial resources of an organisation should be done only to the extent that it is not detrimental to the profitability of an organisation.\n\nHowever, Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) oppose this perception by asserting, “Business exists to serve the greater community as well as direct beneficiaries of the company’s operations” (p.176). Therefore, it is incorrect to presume that an organisation exists only to create profits for its owners.\n\nHowever, it is crucial to note that on adoption and incorporation of the perspectives and principles of CSR into the business model of an organisation, some effort must be made to look for mechanisms of increasing profits of the organisation because CSR projects require financial resources to execute.\n\nThese resources are drawn from the profits made by an organisation within a given fiscal year.\n\nThrough the development of social responsibility culture, an organisation is capable of winning the confidence of the community living within the areas from which it is established. This way, conflict of interest is minimised- something that is critical for the success of an organisation.\n\nThis outcome is attributed to the opinion that an organisation would spend lesser financial resources in the resolution of emerging conflicts due erosions of the interests of the larger society.\n\nTo amplify this argument, an organisation is largely dependent on coexistence in harmony with the communalities living in the environment in which it is established.\n\nIn case this harmony suffers in one way or another, a peaceful habitat for the organisation to conduct its business is sacrificed in the favour of the community-organisation conflicts. Therefore, it is the duty of an organisation to ensure that such conflicts do not exist.\n\nThis goal is best achieved by ensuring that an organisation is socially corporate responsible (Snider, Hill, & Martin 2003, p.177).\n\nThe findings of the Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) research indicated that the organisations, whose websites were analysed “concentrated their attention on similar set of stakeholders and approximately the same CSR issues” (p.180).\n\nHowever, there were variations in the specificity of the CSR messages carried by the websites. For instance, the authors found out that some spelt out some ethical values, which act as the framework of guiding the realisation of organisational missions on their roles in the society differently.\n\nHowever, in the stipulation of the ethical issues, the firms provide “a context within, which they define their relationships with internal and external publics” (Snider, Hill & Martin 2003, p.180).\n\nOther concerns of social corporate responsibilities in the United States’ organisations cited by Snider, Hill, and Martin are environmental policies.\n\nApparently, the environment forms one of the essential areas for consideration in the development of social corporate responsibility policies since most of the organisational activities often produce some negative impacts on the environment.\n\nIt is the duty of the organisation concerned to ensure that the environment is protected from these negative impacts. For this reason, Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) find, “both the U.S. and other global firms often establish comprehensive environmental policies” (p.180).\n\nAdditionally, the authors’ findings also reveal that the CSR messages that are used by various organisations studied were developed to match the needs of various stakeholders that are consistent with the concerns of the larger ecology.\n\nA good example of this is the case of Coca Cola Company, which states, “A large part of our relationship with the world around us is our relationship with the physical world” (Snider, Hill & Martin 2003, p.180).\n\nThis means that Coca Cola Company appreciates that it cannot be able to conducts its business and attain the organisational objects without taking into consideration the impacts produced on the environment by its business activities. This case forms one of the pillars of an organisation seeking to be socially corporate responsible.\n\nThe above discussions of the roles of social corporate responsibility in the success of organisations are discussed from a general context. Consequently, it remains questionable on how the theoretical paradigms developed by Snider, Hill, and Martin (2003) are applicable to soccer clubs such as Manchester United.\n\nIn this extent, the work of Walters and Tacon (2010) becomes relevant to the extent that it presents the results of a qualitative research on the relevance of CSR with particular focus on the sporting organisations (p.556).\n\nSince Manchester United is a good example of a well-established sporting organisation, the work of the authors is pivotal in helping to make recommendations and deductions on the roles that can be played by CSR in the enhancement of success of the soccer club.\n\nWalters and Tacon use the stakeholder theory to explain how “CSR can inform both theoretical debates and management practices within sport organisations” (2010, p.556). The article further argues that media has an immense attention on sporting organisations.\n\nConsequently, due to youth appeal, communication power, and mass media distributions, sporting organisations have no choice rather than implementing the initiatives of social corporate responsibility.\n\nThis argument is based on the perception that “sport CSR has a greater effect than those CSR activities in commercial organisations” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.567).\n\nThis argument makes sense upon the realisation of the evidence that sporting organisations are normally intensively inter-woven with the society, and dependent on the perceptions and affiliation of the society for their success.\n\nConsequently, due to the close relationships between the communities and the sporting organisations, CSR is inevitable from being adopted by the organisations including Manchester United football club.\n\nIt is from this perceptive that Walters and Tacon (2010) recommend, “sport organisations, particularly the UK football clubs, need to consider addressing CSR in order to maintain or increase spectator numbers” (p.567). Indeed, a number of researches have noted CSR as influencing costumer’s consumption behaviour.\n\nTherefore, consistent with Walters and Taco’s (2010) argument on the roles of CSR in the sporting organisations, “given that the stadium utilisation figures at the majority of professional football clubs in the UK are well below 100 per cent, it could be argued that CSR is a strategic approach needed to attract spectators” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.567).\n\nApparently, there exists evidence of sporting organisations that have leaped from the benefits of engaging in CSR elsewhere in the world. For instance, individual athletes in the United States have come up with various charitable organisations and foundations that fund various mitigation strategies of social problems (Paul 2002, p.25).\n\nA good example of this case is the Lance Armstrong Foundation, which has gone down the history as funding the cancer research (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.567).\n\nThe Walters and Taco’s work seeks to articulate the stakeholder theory with CSR as applied in the sporting organisations. The authors provide evidence that stakeholder theory has been critical in enhancing sport management (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.569).\n\nAdditionally, the authors are quick to pin point that the development in the deployment of the stakeholders’ theory in enhancing football club governance has its roots in studies that focus on “stakeholder identification and stakeholder perceptions in intercollegiate athletics” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.569).\n\nThe excellence of the soccer clubs in terms of performances measures form financial success is dependent on the interest of the stakeholders in the game because stakeholders are also mainly the spectators and hence the sources of revenues. This claim perhaps explains why soccer academic literature pays central focus on the stakeholder ideas.\n\nIn fact, with regard to Morrow (2003), “the stakeholder concept has greater relevance for football clubs in relation to conventional businesses because of the particular features of certain football club stakeholders” (p. 43).\n\nWalters and Tacon (2010) appreciate this argument but holds, “to date, much of the research in this area has either used stakeholder concepts implicitly, without making explicit reference to mainstream stakeholder theory, or has engaged openly with stakeholder concepts at a relatively underdeveloped theoretical level” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.569).\n\nArguably, while running a football club, the management has the obligations to the local authorities, communities, and even local populations. These obligations need not to establish conflicts with the commercial objectives of any soccer team.\n\nFor this purpose, it is critical that sporting organisations such as Manchester United become socially corporate responsible.\n\nWalters and Tacon’s research was qualitative in nature. It drew 15 interviews form different stakeholders of the UK football industry. The selection of individuals to be interviewed was done from the perspectives that information garnered was precisely reflective of the purpose of the research.\n\nThis purpose was to “develop an in-depth contextual understanding of the phenomena that is being studied and to interpret the meaning from social situations” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.572). The interviewees were drawn from various staff members of the selected organisations including the directors, CEOs, and chairs.\n\nThe researchers had the immense belief that the information generated from these persons would be pivotal in the determination of their take on objectives coupled with the roles played by their organisations, the kind of relationships that exist between the stakeholder and the organisation, and the details of various CSR initiates that are adopted by the organisation under study.\n\nThe results of the study indicated that the “interviewees recognised the relevance to sport management of stakeholders’ ideas and issues of corporate social responsibility” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.574).\n\nNevertheless, this does not mean that different individuals did not have different perspectives of the roles of CSR in their organisations.\n\nFor instance, the authors found out that some officials of various soccer clubs had an optimistic commitment to the social corporate responsibility coupled with the stakeholders’ management initiatives adopted by the organisations.\n\nOn the other hand, some interviewees “expressed scepticism about the strength of this commitment” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.574).\n\nTherefore, it is arguable that the roles of CSR in enhancing the success of soccer clubs remains fragmented depending on the perspective from which the management official of the organisations view the quests of being socially corporate responsible organisations.\n\nIt is from the basis of this argument that this paper focuses on discussing the principles of social corporate responsibility from the context of Manchester United.\n\nRevisiting the Case Study\n\nConsidering the case study of Manchester United, focusing on social responsibility initiatives are critical in fostering the continued success of the organisation coupled with dominance of Manchester brand among many soccer fans.\n\nFrom the description of the case study section, it is evident that. while operating as plc, Manchester United would have to focus its efforts in building good relationships with the stakeholders in the effort to ensure increased financial performance.\n\nIncreased financial performance means that more funds would be available at the disposal of the organisation to remunerate better the players. This would help in minimising the threat of the good players being taken by competing soccer clubs such as Chelsea, Real Madrid, Liverpool, and others.\n\nThe ultimate repercussion for this is presentation of better games to the spectators and other stakeholders of the Manchester football club. Therefore, increased clientele is likely to be drawn into the playing grounds owned by Manchester United.\n\nHence, more revenue would continue to be generated. Arguably, this case is critical in helping the club to offset various financial challenges that the organisation encounters. Apparently, financial capability of an organisation is vital for the development of strong social corporate responsibility initiatives (Porter & Kramer 2006, p.82).\n\nWith the already developed brand dominance in the football industry, Manchester United can proactively manage to create more success through taking part in more in social related activities such as creation of more charitable foundations ran from the part of profit basket of the organisation.\n\nThis would make the stakeholders to see the organisation as not only serving the purpose of creating profits at the expense of the communities in which the organisation is established.\n\nIndeed, according to Walters and Tacon (2010), “…recent emergence of charitable foundations to deliver social inclusion and educational based initiatives has demonstrated that football clubs can play a positive role within their communities” (p.568).\n\nIn fact, one of the competitive forces of the Manchester United (Chelsea) has embraced the concepts of CSR. With regard to Walters and Tacon (2010), this claim is evidenced and mirrored by “the trend for CSR reporting, which has made Chelsea to produce its own CSR report separate from the annual accounts” (p.568).\n\nArguably, Manchester United cannot drift from dedicating financial resources towards financing social corporate issues because even the governing bodies of football clubs are also recognising the relevance and benefits of being sociality corporate responsible.\n\nFor this reason, the UEFA “has developed a social responsibility partnership portfolio. It is working with a number of charity partners between 2007 and 2011 to address specific issues including racism, reconciliation, and peace, football for all, violence, health, and humanitarian aid” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.568).\n\nThis effort is boosted by commitment of 0.7 percent of the UEFA profits to fund various social projects.\n\nThe above effort by the UEFA makes it clear that football clubs would be forced by their own desires to influence positively their spectators who often come from the communities in which the organisations are established to adopt CSR initiatives.\n\nEven though this would mean digging into the profits of the Manchester United, it is a well thought cause of action since the arising deficits may be sealed by the resulting increment in the brand loyalty from the community members and other stakeholders of the Manchester United.\n\nThe process of endeavouring to invest in social corporate social responsibility projects will often demand Manchester United to deploy the concepts of stakeholder theory developed by Walters and Tacon.\n\nThe move will be the effort to help the organisation to “illuminate key issues in sport management and or how CSR can be implemented by sport organisations through stakeholder management strategies” (Walters & Tacon 2010, p.568).\n\nThe whole idea of sporting organisation attempting to become socially corporate responsible is pegged on the argument that, by being socially corporate responsible, the friction and conflicts of interests between various organisational stakeholders such as the customers, suppliers, the owners of the organisation among others would be greased.\n\nThis step leads to a better reception of organisation coupled with the decisions reached by the managers of the leaders of the organisations.\n\nSurely, this effort is an advantage that Manchester United cannot afford to lose bearing in mind the observations, “Glazers converted 500 million pounds of debt into bonds, which do not mature until 2017” (Pyle 2010, p.604) to help in easing the debts of the football club.\n\nConclusions and Recommendations\n\nOrganisations operating in the industry of sporting are highly susceptible to impacts of competitions because winning in tournaments forms the basis of determining the anticipated growth of the organisations, brand loyalty, and even the financial performance of the organisation in question.\n\nIn the paper, it was discussed that Manchester United stands as one of the sporting organisations that have managed to build and develop magnificently its brand. It has realised several wins in valid tournaments including the European cup and others.\n\nThe management of the organisation has also resulted and contributed to this exemplary performance of the organisation both in terms of game wins and financial performance.\n\nHowever, based on the case study described by Pyle (2010), the paper established that Manchester United also faces various challenges financial wise.\n\nThis case often calls for the interventions of tycoons funding the club to support it through conversion of several million pounds into bonds payable at such as a period in which the organisation will have made adequate profits to pay off the bonds while remaining operational.\n\nBased on these challenges, the paper recommends and adds an additional paradigm for fostering the performance of Manchester United. This paradigm is by focusing on strategic decisions of becoming more socially corporate responsible.\n\nThis recommendation is made in full appreciation of the reality that CSR approaches attract valid perceptions among various scholars and organisational stakeholders.\n\nSome people see it as an additional way of reducing the profitability of an organisation while others may see it is a noble way of helping to create good reputation of an organisation.\n\nAmid the two dimensional approaches to CSR, in sporting organisations such Manchester United, it is recommended for adoption since it is an incredible tool for helping to resolve conflicts of interests among various organisational stakeholders.\n\nReferences\n\nGerry, J, Kevan, S, & Whittington, R 2005, Exploring corporate strategy: text and cases , Prentice Hall, London.\n\nHill, T & Westbrook, R 2006, ‘SWOT Analysis: It’s Time for a Product Recall,’ Long Range Planning, vol. 30 no. 1, pp. 46–52.\n\nKok, P, Weile, D, McKenna, R, & Brown, A 2001, ‘A Corporate Social Responsibility Audit within a Quality Management Framework’, Journal of Business Ethics, vol. 31 no. 4, pp. 285–297.\n\nMorrow, S 2003, The people’s game?

      "Tax Equity in Countries Economy Expository Essay\n\nTax inequality is a crisis affecting many countries. For that reason, there should be a way of balancing the budget without overtaxing the poor in the society. The low-income bracket spends a large portion of their pay on sales tax. Additionally, income taxes are not proportional to the amount of income generated.\n\nAs a result, the poor spend a larger percentage of their income on tax than the rich. However, the government needs taxes to provide basic services. Therefore, a fair tax regime is necessary for a country’s economic growth. This essay evaluates income and sales taxes in terms of tax equity.\n\nSales tax refers to the tax paid by a seller to a government for selling goods and services. Thereafter, this tax is transferred to consumers as part of the prices of goods and services. In most cases, tax inequality is brought about by over reliance on sales tax. As a result, the low-income bracket spends a large portion of their pay on excise or sales tax.\n\nFor instance, in Washington the low-income bracket spends 15.7 % of its income on sales tax. On the other hand, the rich spend 4.4% of their income on sales tax. This leaves the poor with little or no savings. Nonetheless, if sales tax is lowered, poor people will use the extra cash available to them for personal development.\n\nIncome tax is tax imposed on incomes. This refers to the deductions made on incomes and salaries. When all forms of taxes are taken in to consideration, poor people spend a larger percentage of their income on taxes than the rich. Therefore, a tax bracket should be created to cushion the poor from high income taxes. Additional, there should be different tax brackets for the merely well-off and the super rich.\n\nThese tax brackets will ensure basic fairness in taxing incomes. In this regard, those who have benefited most from the economy will have to pay more. However, those with identical incomes should pay equal taxes. On the other hand, those with varying incomes should pay different taxes.\n\nIf the inequality in the taxation system is to be brought to and end, there should be a means of shifting the corresponding tax burden. This is the only way tax equity can coexists with a government’s need to collect taxes for its revenue. This is because a government requires finances to implement its budget. Therefore, a reduction in sales tax should correspond with an increase in other forms of tax.\n\nLikewise, a reduction in tax for the low- income bracket should correspond with an increase for the high- income bracket. Moreover, tax payment is evaluated using two principles. These principles include the ability to pay and the benefit. In this regard, taxes should be paid by those who benefit from them and those who have the capability to pay them. Therefore, fair taxation should not be contested.\n\nIn conclusion, it is agreeable that tax inequality is a debatable issue in many countries. However, governments should find ways of settling expenditures without shifting the burden to the poor. This is because the poor will be forced to spend a large portion of their pay on taxes. Nonetheless, a government requires taxes to provide basic services. Therefore, a fair tax regime is crucial for a country’s economic growth.\n",
      "Business Plan: Consultancy Services Proposal\n\nResearch Methodology\n\nIntroduction and background\n\nA report on the success rates of entrepreneurial start-up companies show that many of the organizations in the US do not make it past a critical point. A critical analysis of the situation shows that a decline in the number of business organizations that navigate through the challenges that face every start-up business has been the outcome (Ries 2011).\n\nIt has strongly been argued that despite entrepreneurs entering the business world with confidence, most of them lack the requisite professional training and experience necessary to become successful. To address those problems, this business plan aims to provide professional training that engages entrepreneurs with the domain knowledge necessary for them to create effective business plans (Chwolka & Raith 2012).\n\nThe goal of the business plan is to offer consultancy services that draw on different disciplines, skills, competencies, and experience of professional consultants in the business industry. The proposed offerings to focus on include basic documents and links to several internal and external resources.\n\nObjectives\n\n 1. To investigate the business challenges that lead to the early failure of start-up businesses\n 2. To determine the entrepreneurial skills necessary for start-up business to be successful\n 3. To establish the type of offerings necessary for the start-up business\n 4. Conduct a market analysis of the proposed business plan\n 5. Establish the marketing strategy for the business plan\n 6. Establish the staffing and operations of the proposed business plan\n 7. Develop financial projections for the proposed consultancy services\n\nResearch questions\n\n 1. What factors do lead to the early failure of start-up businesses?\n 2. What entrepreneurial skills are necessary for start-up business to be successful?\n 3. Which offerings could be necessary for the start-up business?\n 4. What are the marketing analysis results of the proposed business plan?\n 5. Which marketing strategy could be used for the proposed business plan?\n 6. How will the staffing and operations of the proposed business plan be done?\n 7. What are the financial projections for the proposed consultancy services?\n\nStatement of opportunity\n\nAfter the global financial crisis, it became evident that many entrepreneurs starting new businesses in the United States were unable develop and sustain their businesses to maturity (Chwolka & Raith 2012). The purpose of the study will be to develop a business consultancy service that provides business offerings tailored to provide professional consultancy services for new and upcoming business organizations to become successful.\n\nMethodology\n\nDifferent research methods based on theory and practice have been proposed for conducting business research. The continuum of research paradigms cannot be entirely applied on the proposed study. Here, two approaches, which include the qualitative and quantitative paradigms, have been proposed as appropriate for fact finding to answer the research questions (Daymon & Holloway 2010).\n\nIn the context of the proposed business plan, the justification for study is based on seeking for answers to questions on the factors that underlie the failures noted among start-up businesses (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010). The research will establish the right approaches for answering the research questions on the appropriate marketing strategies to reach the clients, staffing operations, and financial projections besides ethical and legal issues for business establishments.\n\nIn view of the research objectives, the proposed research paradigm includes theory that helps to explain the aims and functions of this research. Here, the deductive approach is proposed to enable the researcher to establish a connection between theory and practice.\n\nIn particular, when considering both the deductive and inductive approaches, it is important to note that those strategies enable the researcher to start from general to specific solutions to the research problem. The inductive approach is a top down approach that enables the researcher to develop a hypothesis to address the research questions.\n\nInductive paradigm\n\nA critical evaluation of logical thinking on research paradigms shows that the inductive approach provides the framework to infer the results of the study back into the investigation. According to Järvensivu and Törnroos (2010), inductive thinking corresponds to the tenets of approximate reasoning, logical thinking, and probabilistic approaches for creating solutions to the research problem.\n\nBesides, inductive reasoning provides the foundation for the professional consultant to apply the cognitive skills in the provision of advice on business processes and strategies for beginners.\n\nHowever, Järvensivu and Törnroos (2010) fail short of noting that inductive research could provide the foundation to a number of central issues related to cognitive activities, which include judgement, categorization of qualitative and quantitative data on various aspects of the business plan. This is category based induction where different techniques are used to determine the best strategy to segment and provide the right professional advice to the customers.\n\nDeductive approach\n\nJärvensivu and Törnroos (2010) provide a good foundation for researching on the use of deductive thinking. In theory, the deductive strategy is based on the methods used for developing hypothesis and drawing conclusions on data based on existing theories, which is used to develop the research design for addressing the research questions. However, the approach that is based on moving from the general to the specific solutions on the research issues under consideration.\n\nJärvensivu and Törnroos (2010) notes that deductive logic is systematic, beginning with the investigation of the underlying theory, followed by a hypothesis, observations, and gradually the acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis. However, the business plan is not based on validating a hypothesis, but depends on both qualitative and quantitative data to develop appropriate conclusions to act on.\n\nIn both cases, the deductive and inductive approaches could be combined to address the weaknesses and establish the research on the benefits of both approaches to inform the study. However, it is important to note that the two approaches cannot be used as alternative means, but together. In theory, both methods are based on the process and problem views.\n\nQualitative and quantitative paradigms\n\nThe sources of data include secondary and primary. Secondary sources include data from articles, Internet, and databases. While Daymon and Holloway (2010) do not account in detail how to apply data from the primary sources, it is important to note that interviews and questionnaires are some of the best candidates to adopt into the study.\n\nIn each case of the combined approach of the qualitative and quantitative paradigms, the deductive and inductive approaches could be used to address the research objectives exhaustively (Daymon & Holloway 2010).\n\nThe approach uses a mixed research method, which work primarily on the positivist techniques that are based on the QUAN and QUAL approaches. Basically, the thematic and statistical analytical are appropriate for use in data analysis based in the mixed research methods function by way of data conversion and transformation techniques to answer the research questions.\n\nOn the philosophical levels, the mixed research method could be appropriate for the study because of the ability to counter the incompatibility and pragmatism associated with other research paradigms.\n\nChurchill and Iacobucci (2010) contend that the approach is designed in such a way as to avoid the clash that exists between the purposes and capacities of both research methods. In theory, it is appropriate to consider the facts that the QUAN approach employs deductive reasoning and the QUAL approach employs logic or systematic reasoning.\n\nData collection tools\n\nIn practice, different tools are used for data collection. Among them are interviews, questionnaires, and observations. However, each tool is appropriate for a specific context of the study in data collection (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010). The proposed data collection tools include interviews and questionnaires. Observations will not be appropriate for data collection because of the time required for changes on the business to occur is long. In each case, both tools have their own advantages and disadvantages that suit them for use in this study.\n\nDespite lacking generalizations, interviews have certain issues such as acquiesced where some people show string consistency in agreeing or disagreeing on certain questions (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010).\n\nOther issues include social desirability bias where responses to questions are usually based on one’s bias perceptions. It has been suggested that structured interviews are characterized by response sets, where respondents provide answers that are consistent with the study, but irrelevant to the concepts of investigation. However, interviews provide immediate answers, are time\n\nQuestionnaires will be used as the tool for data collection when conducting the quantitative study. The rationale is to enable the researcher to collect data and make follow ups when the responses are inadequate.\n\nData analysis\n\nSecondary and primary data will be collected and analysed using statistical software to analyse quantitative data and categories to analyse qualitative data. The process of analysing quantitative data will include editing data to ensure completeness and consistency, eliminating questionnaires that have less than 10% responses, converting data into numerical values, and changing the data into new formats for statistical analysis (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010).\n\nHere, a univariate analytical approach will be used in the study besides using frequency tables and pie charts to show the behaviour and distribution of the respondents. SPSS will be used to generate numerical values of the mean, standard deviation, mode, and median definitions will be used to analyse the responses. The rationale for using SPSS is that the software has been used by students to analyse data and has been proved to be appropriate for the task.\n\nOn the other hand, qualitative data will be analysed by the use of the transcription methods using the hyper transcribe software depending on the language translation software such as SYSTTRAN (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010). Besides, data cleaning by labeling, structuring, familiarizing, and establishing a coding plan based on the framework for coding the data. By use of the descriptive analysis, the range of responses and recurrent themes will be established using second order analysis.\n\nJustify methods for data analysis\n\nThe approach used in statistical analysis will provide the p -values that enable the significance of the data to be determined so that the probability of establishing extreme values could be avoided.\n\nEthical\n\nAn ethical form will be issued to seek for consent from the participants and factors such as privacy could be factored as important components in the study (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010). In theory, ethics involves the fundamental application of the principles of ethics such as ensuring accurate reporting, ensuring that the principles of moral concern will be factored into the study, intellectual property rights, being conscious of multiple roles, following the principles and rules of informed consent.\n\nValidity\n\nIn theory, validity is the extent to which the results accurately correspond to goals of the study besides the attesting to the evidence of the theory and support of the interpretation of test scores (Churchill & Iacobucci 2010). Content, presentation, face, convergent, concurrent, and construct validity will be assured by putting in place the necessary measures to achieve the different forms of validity.\n\nReliability\n\nReliability is the overall consistency of the measures that will be used to ensure the accuracy and precision of the results. To achieve reliability, the factors that contribute to inconsistencies will be determined and removed to ensure that the results become reliable.\n\nTime plan for completion of the project\n\nLiterature review\n\nIntroduction\n\nThis section is a literature review of academic sources that provide qualitative data on the reasons for start-up failures and the appropriate strategies for adoption to avoid failure. The secondary sources of data include articles and books that have been written on the subject of investigation.\n\nBusiness challenges leading to failure of start-ups\n\nIn the proposed business plan, an investigation will be conducted to determine the challenges that new entrepreneurs get exposed to that leads to their failure to sustain the business in the market. Simmons, Wiklund and Levie (2014) note that between 2004 and 2013, approximately 2, 000 venture funded companies failed to penetrate and succeed their operations the US.\n\nFigure 1: Percentage of failing businesses between 1997 and 2010\n\nFigure 1 shows the rate at which businesses have failed to take off or to continue existing. Simmons, Wiklund and Levie (2014) note 25% to 30% of venture-backed businesses fail for various reasons. Here, failure means that the business either does not generate enough profits to become self-sustaining.\n\nOther start-up businesses have all their assets liquidated and investors end up losing all their money despite making investments in high potential businesses. Empirical evidence points out the facts that show the reasons for failure of the start-up businesses.\n\nWhile Simmons, Wiklund and Levie (2014) do not categorise different entrepreneurs, but generalise the factors that lead to their failures, the study is rich in the strategies to adopt to avoid failure based on specific indicators. One of the core factors that contribute to failures is marginal niche where the entrepreneur tries to void competition by operating in a limited market size.\n\nThe study will investigate the effects of marginal niche along with other factors such as derivative ideas, lack of obstinacy in pursuing a business idea to success. Researchers have suggested that market problems make significant contributions to the failures due to lack of value propositions for compelling buyers to be devoted to buying their products, wrong market timing, and a low market size. Daymon and Holloway (2010) suggest business model failures because most start-up entrepreneurs are overly optimistic.\n\nThey fail to factor issues such as the cost of acquitting a customer, lifetime value of the customer, and the capital efficiency rules. Besides, a poor management team that builds and works on a weak strategy with members who are poor at executing strategies. The study will investigate additional factors such as the effects of getting cash strapped, product related problems, having poor knowledge of who the investors are.\n\nThe research will focus on problems associated with marketing, failure to adequately conduct a PESTEL analysis and the five forces of competition, which include threat of new entrants into the market, bargaining power of suppliers and customers, threat of substitute products, and industry rivalry.\n\nEntrepreneurial skills necessary for start-ups\n\nCassar (2014) provides exhaustive evidence, which points out that for an entrepreneur to be successful, it is vital for them to have some skill to make them navigate through a competitive business.\n\nAmong the factors to be investigated in the study include the ability to manage money, overcome stress related issues, ability to raise money, strategies for improving ones; productivity, ability to make friends, knowledge on who to hire into the business, management approaches, and the training and development programs of the staff that the entrepreneur implements.\n\nType of offerings\n\nThe aim of the proposed business plan is to offer various professional services to educate entrepreneurs on strategic approaches to apply to make start-up businesses successful. Among the proposes areas of investigation are providing start-up kits that provides details on financial models and associated templates to use, business plans for specific markets, and execution presentations.\n\nIn addition, the proposed offerings include establishing access to program experts through the Internet, telephone conferences, emails, and on-site mentoring. In addition, further investigations will be conducted on additional offerings such as web based access to frequently asked questions to help the client avoid making the same mistakes. It is important to ensure that the customers are informed on technology patenting and the patents’ approval cycle.\n\nIt is proposed that professional services can be offered on other professional platforms by creating free website links to other expert services to supplement those services offered on those in the proposed business plan. Expert services include legal advice, accounting, and investment opportunities.\n\nThe study will provide the platform for free access to articles on start-ups, techniques for managing cash flows, and incorporation of other businesses into the start-up business. It is proposed that the consultancy services will include assisting clients to determine when and where market opportunities happen, analyse the opportunities, and establish the best methods for opportunity sizing.\n\nMarket analysis\n\nA market analysis based on competitive evaluation of the investing in the plan and market research on the existing opportunity will be conducted to justify the need for a consultancy firm (Galician 2013). Galician (2013) does not present an exhaustive list of strategies to adopt when conducting a market analysis, but provides strong evidence of accurate methods of conducting a market research before making a decision to enter the market.\n\nThe rationale is to demonstrate that the market is viable and that by offering the services, it is possible to generate profits that could sustain the business. In addition, the study will investigate the current size of the market. Studies show that many companies that are offering similar services focus on established companies and rarely take their services to start-ups. On the other hand, those companies that offer services targeting new start-up businesses are expensive and the success rates of the start-ups are low.\n\nIn theory, the strategic approach of establishing the feasibility of the business plan and the proposed approach to addressing the market research issues includes conducting cluster analysis, factor analysis, and understanding the customers. The theoretical foundation could include establishing buyer behaviour, relationship development methods, and conducting marketing research. That is in addition to conducting investigations targeting, positioning, and segmentation.\n\nMarketing strategy\n\nThe marketing strategy for the proposed business includes direct selling of the company to the target customers, using agents to market the company among the prospective entrepreneurs, and use of social sites and other Internet based services.\n\nIn theory, modern marketing strategies are based on massive power transfer to the customer (Palmatier et al. 2006). Here, the proposed marketing strategies include planning, social and ethical responsibility, and being able to develop the required competitive strategies for the business to successfully compete with rivals in the market.\n\nHowever, Internet based services such as social networking websites provide a platform for real time communication between the customer and the service provider. On the other hand, the strategic approach will include investigating the pricing strategies used by the competitors to determine the right pricing mechanisms for the services to be offered.\n\nHere, a preliminary investigation shows that an investor presentation could charge $ 2500, developing the marketing plan document could charge $ 1000 alongside the additional services such as focus strategy and plan, cost leadership strategy, service differentiation strategy, advertising plan, and the branding strategy. The proposed charges for the executive mentoring are $1000 and $5000 will be the charges for developing a business plan.\n\nStaffing and operations\n\nThe staffing operations will be done by advertising on the daily newspapers and the Internet to recruit the best candidates for the job. Recruitment will provide the best talents to occupy different positions to build the right management structure to operate the business.\n\nVarious responsibilities such as marketing, human resource, operations, and risk management will be filled by qualified and experienced personnel. Besides, employees will be subjected to regular training programs to ensure that those working in the organization are week skilled to do their work.\n\nFinancial projections\n\nVarious assumptions underlie the financial projections that provide the framework for arriving at key figures such as profits and income to the business. The sales forecast includes offering services to 10 customers per day besides advertising on the social media. However, the business is projected to grow by 50% in the first year and other subsequent years. On the other hand, the fixed assets of the business cost $ 1000 while $ 12, 000 was taken as a bank loan.\n\nModels\n\nTeece (2010) provides a reliable academic source that discusses various business models that entrepreneurs can adopt. Examples include the affiliate model that where products are sold by a third party on commission, the Auction model where products are sold through auction, the advertising model which relies on adverts.\n\nIn theory, a good model enables the entrepreneur to establish a good balance between the cost of acquiring the customer and the ability to monetize those customers. The characteristics of a good business model include those models that enable employees to work and see their jobs within the context of the firm, provide powerful tools for the strategy, and easy to retell the customers about the values offered in the business.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that different perspectives have been discussed on the strategies to adopt for the development of the business plan that could enable successful accomplishments of the outlined objectives. Basically, many business start-ups fail because of lack of professional training on the part of the entrepreneur, lack of organizations that offer specialized services to equip the entrepreneurs with the right skills and knowledge on how to start, manage, and successfully run the business to maturity.\n\nIn the case of the study, two theoretical approaches were proposed for use in the study. Both inductive and deductive analytical approaches were recommended for use in conducting and analysing the academic literature to answer the research questions. A mixed research method was proposed for the study.\n\nThe proposed strategy will provide the framework for capturing various aspects of the business plan by getting informed on how to address the research questions using information processed form data obtained through a mixed research method, which factors both qualitative and quantitative paradigms.\n\nIn theory, the qualitative paradigm is based on the QUAL technique that enables relevant academic literature to be assessed and critically analysed to inform the various aspects of the business plan. The core area of investigation is to establish the reasons that underpin the failure experienced entrepreneurs setting up new businesses from becoming stable. On the hand, the study will factor QUAN, which is based on the quantitative paradigm to collect data for statistical analysis.\n\nBesides, two data collection tools were proposed, which include interviews and questionnaires. However, observations were disqualified for data collection because such a tool could be expensive and require a long period of observations to establish the reasons for the occurrence of failures. On the other hand, interviews were deemed to be the right tools to use for data collection despite the weaknesses associated with them.\n\nOn the other hand, it was deemed necessary to use two data analysis tools, which include SPSS software for numerical analysis of questionnaire data to generate values such as the mean, standard deviation, and the p-values. Besides, the findings will be evaluated to determine the reliability and validity of qualitative and quantitative data. All the aspects of the quantitative and qualitative research study paradigms will be factored into the study in the data analysis process using appropriate software tools.\n\nOn the other hand, different models have been proposed to use in the study to answer the research questions. Among the models that were proposed to use in the study is the affiliate model among others. However, the most appropriate model proposed for the study was the advertising model.\n\nThe need in this case is to acquire the necessary knowledge and skills to start and sustain a business to grow to maturity. Besides, the physiological and psychological bases of need will provide the foundation on which the proposed business plan will be used to develop a framework that explains how the factors that that influence the customers can be manipulated by the consultant.\n\nReferences\n\nCassar, G 2014, ‘Industry and start-up experience on entrepreneur forecast performance in new firms,’ Journal of Business Venturing , vol. 1, no. 29, pp. 137-15.\n\nChurchill, G A & Iacobucci, D 2010, Marketing research: methodological foundations , Macmillan Publishing, New York.\n\nChwolka, A & Raith, M G 2012, ‘The value of business planning before start-up—A decision-theoretical perspective’, Journal of Business Venturing , vol. 3, no. 27, pp. 385-399.\n\nDaymon, C & Holloway, I 2010, Qualitative research methods in public relations and marketing communications , Routledge, New York.\n\nGalician, M L 2013, Handbook of product placement in the mass media: New strategies in marketing theory, practice, trends, and ethics , Routledge, New York.\n\nJärvensivu, T & Törnroos, J Å 2010, ‘Case study research with moderate constructionism: Conceptualization and practical illustration’, Industrial Marketing Management , vol. 1, no. 39, pp.100-108.\n\nPalmatier, R W, Dant, R P, Grewal, D & Evans, K R 2006, ‘Factors influencing the effectiveness of relationship marketing: a meta-analysis’, Journal of marketing , vol. 4, no. 70, pp. 136-153.\n\nRies, E 2011, The lean start-up: How today’s entrepreneurs use continuous innovation to create radically successful businesses ’, London, Random House LLC.\n\nSimmons, S A, Wiklund, J & Levie, J 2014, ‘Stigma and business failure: implications for entrepreneurs’ career choices’, Small Business Economics , vol. 3, no. 42, pp. 485-505.\n\nTeece, D J 2010, ‘Business models, business strategy and innovation’, Long range planning , vol. 2, no. 43, pp. 172-194.\n",
      "Effective and Competent International Management Skills Report (Assessment)\n\nGlobalization has created myriad of new business opportunities as various countries opt to lift trade barriers to accommodate entry of multinationals. The increasing number of business organizations that are pursuing international marketing opportunities has led to stiff competition. Hence, the emerging competitive business environment calls for effective and competent international management skills.\n\nOn the same note, foundation of successful management functions in international markets is dependent on intercultural skills of multinational managers.\n\nSimilarly, international markets are affected by variety of internal and external factors that are likely to hinder business operations in foreign business environment. Thus, proper application of integral management practices may guarantee success in achieving international and national business goals and objectives.\n\nNeedless to say, contemporary management activities are being directed towards achieving two important goals namely improving profitability and securing competitive advantage (Rhinesmith, 1996, p.118).\n\nIn order to achieve the aforementioned goals, businesses managers have been entrusted to carry out various managerial activities that are in line with business goals and objectives. So far, scholars in management have identified four management concepts that if effectively executed, may assist organizations achieve their set goals and objectives.\n\nOne of the most basic activities of management is planning. It acts as foundation on which all the other functions of management are executed (Clark & Demirag, 2002, p.105). Intrinsically, the process of planning involves critical assessment of an organization in terms of its present positioning in the market as well as future threats and opportunities that are likely to be encountered.\n\nThe results of the above evaluation are what determine course of action that a company will adopt to achieve the set goals and objectives. According to Clark and Demirag (2002, p.106), managers should note that planning activity is a continuous process that needs to be modified owing to dynami nature of organizations.\n\nIn some cases, external factors that negatively affect business may compel managers to redesign new action plans to accomplish certain goals (Clark & Demirag, 2002, p.116). For example, a new brand of soap in the market may compel companies dealing with similar products to rethink of new marketing strategies in order to maximize their positioning in the market.\n\nResearch has shown that business environments are continuously evolving and as such, it may become extremely cumbersome to predict these changes unless business managers undertake the process of planning seriously (Clark & Knowles, 2000, p.1). it is against this backdrop that managers should work towards adopting strategic management as part of planning activity.\n\nClark and Knowles (2000, p.368) observe that strategic management entails critical analyses of both internal and external factors that are likely to hinder attainment of goals and objectives.\n\nAs stated above planning remains to be the foundation of all management activities. The second function of management is organizing or mobilizing available resources in order to optimize production. The responsibility of management at this stage is to organize necessary resources (both manpower and material) that are needed to implement the course of action identified during planning stage (Rhinesmith, 1996, p. 116).\n\nIn any case, organizational management seeks to create relationships by assigning specific responsibility for each team member and identifying the authority to head each team. As part of organizational activity, it is the responsibility of management to take care of staffing issues since it is the most important asset in attainment of goals and objectives (Clark & Knowles, 2000, p.367).\n\nStaffing is basically concerned with the process of equipping an organization with the necessary workforce. This includes issues related to recruitment, selection, training, placement, compensation, demotion and employee’s retirement issues.\n\nThe main aim of assessing the staffing needs of an organization is to ensure that it gets the right men for the right job. The capacity and ability of an organizations hired personnel is what determines the future success or failure of the organizations goals (Boddewyn, 2004, p.198).\n\nThe third and equally important management activity is direction and leadership. The main concern of management at any given level is facilitating workforce delivery to achieve desired goals. Hence, it is imperative to note that human assets require continuous motivation and encouragement in order to work effectively (Boddewyn, 2004, p.211).\n\nIt is the role of management to direct team members towards delivery of action plans. It achieves the above function by giving instructions and constant communication about orders, rules and decisions (Schneider & Jean-Louis, 1997, p. 214).\n\nIn addition, the management provides guidance and leadership, supervises the work delivery process and employee behavior towards the same, and inspires the employees towards improved performance. Research has shown that employee satisfaction translates to positive and improved performance (Schneider & Jean-Louis, 1997, p.216).\n\nTherefore, most managers today are focused on improving employee satisfaction, and this should be activity for every organization that wishes to survive the cut-throat competition (Boddewyn, 2004, p.198). For example, the management can carry out employee satisfaction surveys to find out the level of satisfaction. Depending on the results, the management can improve on the areas identified to be creating a dissatisfied workforce.\n\nThis process of defining the desired direction and leadership of a company can be achieved with ease; however, pro-activation the right direction requires an insightful and experienced management (Boddewyn, 2004, p.200).\n\nThe last of the four activities of management activity is control. The main aim of this function is to establish performance standards that are biased towards achieving organizational goals (Clark & Knowles, 2000, p.366). It also involves carrying out performance evaluation on how the actual job is progressing.\n\nAt this stage, the management communicates the expected performance standards to their employees and sheds light in case any of the organization’s department is experiencing a challenge in achieving required standards (Clark & Knowles, 2000, p.362). Similarly to other functions of management, control activity is a continuous process.\n\nThe management constantly evaluates performance standards and identified challenges that may hinder improved performance standards. The continuous control evaluation process is important because if any future problems are identified, preventive measures can be put in place immediately (Boddewyn, 2004, p.199).\n\nIn brief, the managerial control activity is a kind of a follow up process that examines performance and compares it against the identified actions plans, and takes corrective measures if needed (Clark & Knowles, 2000, p.362).\n\nAs highlighted above, success of any organization depends on effective and efficient management. Any level of success is measured against the achievement of set goals and objectives (Rhinesmith, 1996, p.212). Hence, management functions are driven by individual bestowed with the responsibility to drive an organization towards its end goals and objectives.\n\nThe role of managers is constantly changing in response to the changing organizations needs. Most companies are venturing into international trade, and the move is demanding special qualities that the individuals in management should possess. Globalization has expanded business opportunities, but it has also created a complex corporate management structure.\n\nThe 21st century corporate manager has to adapt to the changing business environment to be able to come up with modern solutions in a challenging business environment (Usunier, 1998, p.118). on the same note, International businesses operate in multicultural environments, which equally demand managers to have cross-cultural management skills (Clark & Demirag, 2002, p.106).\n\nMany multinational businesses have realized the need for intercultural communication to drive the businesses in international markets. According to (Usunier, 1998, p.122) a manager should possess intercultural management skills to be able to effectively communicate with customers, employees and any other interest party.\n\nCommunication has been recognized as a key driver for a business success; therefore, intercultural skills are extremely essential for international business management. A successful intercultural manager is the one with demonstrative skills on proper supervision of foreign market penetration, besides the ability to oversee the process of employee selection, guidance and mentoring (Usunier, 1998, p.122).\n\nIn addition, they should be able to negotiate and manage any arising conflicts with the organizations clients as well offer insightful analysis on the intercultural differences that are likely to cause failure or success to the organization (Usunier, 1998, p.123).\n\nTo achieve positive results in cross cultural management, such a manger should possess key attributes such as flexibility, patience to work with multicultural workforce, high level of intercultural awareness and ability to exploit the intercultural differences to the benefit of the organization (Usunier, 1998, p.118).\n\nBoddewyn (2004, p.195) emphasizes that intercultural awareness attribute is the most fundamental factor for succeeding in cross-cultural management. The management in the international context must capitalize on direction and leadership function of management to be able to avoid the negative consequences evident in cross cultural workplace environment.\n\nThe organizational element of staffing is the most important factor in achieving success in international business. Therefore, managers should evaluate strength level of organization’s personnel so as to achieve high-performance standards (Chang & Ha, 2001, p. 32).\n\nAs exemplified above, globalization have opened new opportunities for international business ventures to expand. However, successful penetration to foreign markets is only attainable if management understands the internal and external factors that affect international businesses (Schneider & Jean-Louis, 1997, p. 216).\n\nThe external factors, which collectively forms the business environment include; economic, social, technological, political and legal elements. The external factors are likely to affect an organization’s business operations. Such factors are usually beyond the control of an organization’s management, but the management should be aware on how the factors are likely to affect their business.\n\nTo begin with, the economic dimensions of the business environment comprises of the nature of the foreign country economic system. The structural anatomy of the economy which is mainly shaped by the economic policies implemented by governments is also considered to an external factor that affects international business environment (Schneider & Jean-Louis, 1997, p. 216).\n\nIn addition, the social-economic structure present in a county plus organization of the capital market affects the operations processes of an organization. Therefore, businesses wishing to succeed in international markets should clearly visualize the economic factors likely to hinder their success.\n\nThe social dimension of the business environment comprises of the value system of the society present in a particular country. Any organization willing to succeed in international markets should evaluate the sociological factors present in the country of interest.\n\nAccording to (Boddewyn, 2004, p.200 ) sociological factors comprises of elements like; customs and conventions, cultural heritage, mobility of labor, cost structure and view towards wealth and income, all which have far reaching effects to the operations of an organization.\n\nBoddewyn (2004, p.195-212) adds that sociological factors defines the work culture and mobility of labor and calls for high level of intercultural management awareness to achieve success with such a dynamic workforce. The demand of products and services is highly dependent on the social cultural factors such dictated by customs, attitudes and preferences (Boddewyn, 2004, p.206).\n\nFor instance, MacDonald has to readjust their menu when they realized that the demand for their beef burgers was very low in China because the Chinese people prefer chicken to beef. Therefore, the social-cultural business environments as a determinant of businesses code of conduct, need to be evaluated before hand to ascertain how they are likely to influence international business ventures (Usunier, 1998, p.118).\n\nAnother pool of external factors that should be appreciated in international business is the political business environment. The latter is shaped by philosophical ideologies of political organizations fueled by the ideology of the government in power. Political ideologies are the main determinant of a country’s political stability depending on the foreign polices that are implemented (Rhinesmith, 1996, p. 102).\n\nInternational businesses, to some extent, are not free from external political influence. For instance, Rhinesmith (1996, p. 104) cites a case where implementation of a politically motivated policy in India discontinued business operations of Cocoa-Cola company in then late seventies. It was not until 1991 when the same government renewed its policy to allow reentry of multinationals.\n\nTechnological development in a country can either enhance or hinder growth of international businesses. The type of technological innovation and advancement is a strong determinant on the type and quality of goods and services that an organization produces (Schneider & Jean-Louis, 1997, p. 216).\n\nSome technological advancement that countries adapt may either act as an opportunity or a challenge for international business to succeed (Rhinesmith, 1996, p. 104).\n\nFinally, legal regulations that prevail in a particular country may hinder or accelerate growth of international businesses. Legal environment is determined by factors such like flexibility and adaptability to law in order to accommodate international business ventures (Usunier, 1998, p.118).\n\nThe rigidity of legal factors present in some countries poses a challenge to management activities because they hinder businesses expansion and performance (Usunier, 1998, p.118).\n\nIn a nutshell, it is vital to reiterate that globalization has created both opportunities and challenges in corporate management. As companies explore and invest in international business, they have to modify management functions to suit the ever changing business environment. Certainly, the most evident characteristic of international markets is diversity in cultures.\n\nTherefore, future success of international business heavily relies on proper cross cultural management. Any manager willing to succeed in cross cultural environment should prioritize proper coordination and implementation of intercultural communication within the workplace environment.\n\nThe latter requirement also amounts to one of the prime qualities of business managers. Therefore, it is crucial for business managers to develop both competent and skillful managerial practices in order to attain set goals and objectives within a given time frame.\n\nReferences\n\nBoddewyn, J., Toyne, B. & Martínez, Z. 2004.

      "Principal Causes and Consequences of the Spanish-American War Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nBy far and large, the Spanish-American war is viewed by most scholars as one of the major turning points in the history of both America and Spain in terms of their political, social, cultural and even economic structures (Schoultz, 2009). 1\n\nIn essence, the Spanish-American was a short-lived war that was fought between the US and Spain beginning in April 1898 and ending in August this same year. However, in the course of the war, other players like Cuba, Puerto Rico, Germany and the Philippines got involved based on their directly or indirect vested interests in the outcomes of the war.\n\nOn one hand, there are scholars who are of the opinion that, in spite of the casualties of the war, the Spanish-American war was a necessary endeavor. To support this argument, such scholars point to the positive results that came from the war—especially with regards to the territories that got colonized (Kaplan, 2003).\n\nOn the other hand, some scholars criticize the war basing their arguments on the deaths, loss of properties worth millions of shillings, and signing of some treaties which favored the winners of the war while looking down upon the losers, among many other effects that will be duly detailed in the course of this paper.\n\nIf we are to get the real picture of the Spanish-American war, then it is inherent for us to dig into the annals of history and get authoritative information on the specifics of the war. It is with that in mind that this paper seeks to give a succinct, yet inclusively representative, chronology of the events of the war—with major emphasis being laid on the causes and effects. Once these events are analyzed, a summative recapitulation will be given.\n\nCauses of the Spanish-American War\n\nPreliminarily, it is worth noting that, just like many wars in history, the Spanish-American war was a culmination of any factors all coming together at one time. In this section of the paper, some of the major factors that contributed to the war are going to be divided into three broad areas:\n\n 1. The Spanish world domination and the American need to overthrow them: This will entail the political, economic, social and cultural factors that pushed the two sides towards the war.\n 2. The influence of the mass media and “Yellow Journalism”: Here, emphasis will be laid on the journalistic practices and stories that contributed to the war.\n 3. The Cuban Connection: This will specifically focus on the Cuban interest by both America and Spain and how the need to control it led to the war.\n\nThe Spanish World Domination and the American Need to Overthrow Them\n\nAccording to Lennon (2002), Spain was considered as the most powerful nation on earth around the mid 1600s. 2 During this time, it controlled several colonies across the world especially in Central and South America, the Caribbean and some sections of Asia.\n\nHowever, as time progressed, Spain lost some of its colonial territories majorly through civil wars and the struggle for independence. In spite of loosing these territories, Spain still managed to hold on to a few of its colonies like Cuba and Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Islands and the Philippines in Asia.\n\nShifting our focus temporarily to USA during this time, Musicant, (1998) says that, having been a former colony of Britain; the United States was initially opposed to the issue of colonization as they deemed it as being immoral and unfair to the countries being colonized.\n\nHowever, as the 20 th century approached and the dominance of countries like Spain continued to spread like a wildfire; some leaders in USA who ascribed to the notions of mercantilism began promoting ideas in favor of imperialism.\n\nA key principle in Imperialism was ethnocentrism—which purported that some cultures and tribes were more superior to others thus necessitating the need for control of the weaker cultures (Lennon, 2002). It is on the basis of such ideologies that leaders like of Roosevelt and William Jennings Brian encouraged the people in USA to embrace the ideologies of colonialism.\n\nMany other people also came up to provide moral justifications for engaging into colonization including the need to spread Christian and protestant ideas, viability for trade encouraged by linking up with other nations and the better culture that would result from blending with other cultures (Immerman, 2010).\n\nResultantly, the demand for the US acquiring her own territories grew exponentially and by the 1890s; America had acquired a fair share of colonial territories making it a vibrant and easily noticeable player in the game of world power dominance (Roosevelt, 1913/1967).\n\nIt is during this time (the 1890s) that the idea of colonizing nearby assets such as Cuba and Puerto Rico came into central focus. 3 After a few futile attempts of peaceful negotiations for the colonization of these countries failed, it was eminently clear that the only way to colonize the likes of Cuba and Puerto Rico was through war or some form of battle (Loveman, 2010). 4\n\nThe influence of Mass Media and “Yellow Journalism”\n\nIn the 1890s, very few media organizations existed based on immense costs that were needed to run the outlets (Kaplan, 2003). In America, the domination of the media was by William Randolph Hearst and Joseph Pulitzer.\n\nThe competition between these two media bigwigs led to the birth of journalism whereby facts and ideas would be exaggerated or twisted to get public attention and increase the sale of newspapers (Lennon, 2002). This competition is what later came to be known as Yellow Journalism.\n\nOwing to the increasing rivalry between America and Spain in their world dominance and colonization efforts; Hearst and Pulitzer chose to capitalize on the opportunity by exaggerating facts and events—obviously favoring the USA, which was their mother country.\n\nFor example, in the bid to make the Spanish look bad and unwilling to allow Cuba to gain their independence; Lennon (2002) reports that Hearst and his journalists produced fictitious and ridiculously salacious stories of how the Spaniards were oppressing the Cubans.\n\nSoon, public interest in USA regarding the alleged suffering and oppression in Cuba began to grow with several people calling upon President McKinley (USA president at that time) to “do something” so as to change the situation and help the Cubans (DeGuzmán, 2005). 5\n\nIt is based on these reports that President McKinley sent American troops into Cuba—something which angered the Spanish and, after a series of other unfortunate events in Cuba which will be explained later, soon led to the war (Schoultz, 2009).\n\nThe Cuban Connection\n\nIn many ways, the Cuban connection was the major highlight and cause of the war. As was earlier mentioned under the contribution of Yellow Journalism towards the war, the public outcries in USA regarding the Spanish oppression in Cuba pushed the President McKinley towards taking an action—even though, personally, he was not a big proponent of the war (DeGuzmán, 2005).\n\nIn January 1898, President McKinley eventually found a reason for justifying his response to the public outcry regarding Cuba when reports by various media indicated that there were escalated riots by Anti-American “Volunatrios and Pro-Spanish people in Havana detesting against the USA saying that it (the US) was poking its nose where it does not belong (Herring, 2008).\n\nIt is also around this time that the Spanish Minister to US, Mr. Enrique Dupuy de Lôme is reported to have said that President McKinley was “weak and a bidder for the admiration of the crowd” (Lennon, 2002).\n\nNot being able to stomach the criticisms anymore, President McKinley decided to send US warships to Cuba. A few weeks later, one of the US warships was sunk and, as earlier stated; the yellow journalists together with the US navy soon corroborated a story alleging that the US Maine disaster, which resulted in deaths of around 250 people, was an act of saboteur by the Spanish (Lennon, 2002).\n\nOn the other hand, the Cubans who were in dire need for independence had promised support to the USA, in case they decided to help them fight the common enemy—the Spanish. The culmination of these factors is reason why the war eventually erupted. 6\n\nThe Consequences of the Spanish-American War\n\nBefore delving into the effects of the war, it is worth taking note of the following facts about the war. To begin with, the war reportedly began on 3 rd July 1898 with the battle of Santiago de Cuba, the fiercest of the naval battle between the Spanish and Americans. In this battle, the Spanish Caribbean fleet was destroyed courtesy of the American soldiers supported by the Cuban independence fighters thus resulting into the besieging of Santiago de Cuba, and, eventually the entire island (Lennon, 2002).\n\nMoreover, Theodore Roosevelt, together with his Rough Riders, were very monumental in the war based on their dedicated attacks and assaults on San Juan Heights and San Juan Hill—two important hills close to the Santiago Harbor which was in great contention (Roosevelt, 1913/1967). 7 Seeing that they were overpowered by the Americans, the Spanish tried to flee from the Santiago Harbor. However, the Americans captured them, sunk their ships and killed 323 people with only one American dying as a casualty (Lennon, 2002). This paved the way for retreat and surrender.\n\nIn finality, the Spanish-American war ended after 109 days with the signing of the “Treaty of Paris” being the major highlight. It is from this point where the treaty was signed that we are going to consider the consequences of the war.\n\nTreaty of Paris and The Political Effects\n\nPrimarily, this treaty was signed on the December of 1898 (109 days after the war had began) between the US and Spain—with the Cubans, Puerto Ricans and Filipinos being sidelined from negotiations of the treaty.\n\nSo, even though the treaty mentioned Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Filipinos, it is clear that the treaty was mainly signed to benefit and satiate the interests of the Spanish and Americans (who were the war winners) while sidelining the losers and people who had apparently contributed greatly towards the starting and ending of the war (Musicant, 1998). 8\n\nIn the treaty, America’s possessions, in terms of colonial power, was increased as they were given control of Puerto Rico, and Guam while they sold the Philippines for $20 million (Lennon, 2002). Also, the treaty managed to free Cuba who, for long, had been fighting for their freedom. On the other hand, the US gave back the city of St. Augustine Florida to the Spanish.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that, unlike the treaties signed previously, the Treaty of Paris did not give the acquired territories a promise of rights for citizenship or statehood. In other words, the treaty considered the acquired territories like Puerto Rico of being unable to self-govern their own based on their inferior ranks going by the imperialistic characteristic of ethnocentrism (DeGuzmán, 2005).\n\nAdditionally, America’s name was added to the list of existing colonial empires—something which they had previously fought against and branded as demeaning during the days when they were subjects of Britain (Lennon, 2002). Other treaties, or rather legal amendments also saw their way into the extensions of this treaty.\n\nFor example, before the war, US congress (which chiefly constituted of Anti-imperialists) had passed the Teller Amendment committing to grant Cuba Independence. After the war and Cuba being awarded its freedom, the senate (mainly consisting of pro-imperialists) passed the Platt Amendment which forced a peace treaty on Cuba which forbade the Cubans them from getting into treaties with other nations.\n\nAccording to Herring (2008), the Platt Amendment was considered to be a stab-in-the back move to the Cubans who had trusted the US and helped them during the war, only for US to go against their words after the war.\n\nAs a matter of fact, the Platt Amendment gave the US control of Cuba in terms of providing a permanent Navy base in Cuba and giving them freedom to stabilize Cuban Militarily as they wished. It is from such freedoms that later treaties were signed between US and Cuba thus paving way for the rise of imperialistic strongholds of US in Cuba like the famed Guantanamo Bay.\n\nThe Philippine-American War\n\nThe annexation of the Philippines, as a result of the Treaty of Paris, caused huge problems. In essence, the Filipino had allied with US during the Spanish-American war hoping that they, just like Cuba, would be able to gain their independence. Failing to accord them independence infuriated the Filipinos and made them feel betrayed. Consequently, on the 23 rd day of January 1899, the Filipinos forcefully proclaimed independence and elected Emilio Aguinaldo as their president.\n\nImmediately, the US responded by sending its army to put down the fake Filipino government thus resulting in war and protests from the natives silently supported by Germans who had vested interests in Puerto Rico.\n\nIn spite of not having a strong military influence, the Filipinos dragged the US into a hot battle that lasted longer than the Anglo-Spanish war claiming close to 4000 American lives and immense destruction of properties being witnessed.\n\nHowever, on 21 st March 1901, America finally managed to capture Aguinaldo, forced him to oath loyalty, take a pension from the US and retire peacefully while ensuring that no more revolts were witnessed from the Filipinos. This, eventually, led to the calming down of the Filipinos and thus the halt of the Philippine-American War.\n\nSocio-Economic and Cultural Effects\n\nThe Spanish-American war has both positive and negative socio-economic and cultural effects. Starting with the negative side, Loveman (2010) asserts that the war expectedly resulted in the loss of properties, deaths of useful individuals in the society, and the loss of freedoms and political power—all which had a direct negative economic impact.\n\nTo this effect, Herring (2008) reports that the collapse of the Spanish empire—especially in losing Cuba—caused national trauma which, in effect, reduced their economic strength. 9\n\nStill on the negative side, the war resulted in blood between some Spaniards and Americans, Filipinos and the US, Cubans and Spaniards, Germans and Americans (based on the Filipino contention) thus destroying the moral fabric of the relatively good cultural and social environment that previously existed (Musicant, 1998).\n\nOn the positive side, however, the war resulted in better economies by some nations, like the US who had new trade avenues in their colonized countries (Lennon, 2002). Cuba’s freedom also had a relative positive impact as the exit of the Spanish paved way for investments by their own people (Schoultz, 2009).\n\nIn Spain, modicum economic gains were witnessed from the investments made by Spaniards who came back from US and Cuba pumping money and business ideas into their home economy.\n\nSocially and culturally, some good language patterns emerged. For example, the intermingling between the US and Puerto Rico led to a hybrid of people able to speak English and Spanish on top of their native languages.\n\nSimilarly, Filipinos were also able to speak German, Spanish and English on top of their native language (Immerman, 2010). Also, there was an improved interrelation between the Northern and Southern people who, prior to the war were not able to speak to one another (Lennon, 2002).\n\nOther General Impacts of the War\n\n  * The birth of opinion-based and hyperbole journalism (Yellow Journalism)\n  * The shift in global power and recognition of the US as a superpower and the rise of a new generation of imperialist leaders in the USA like Theodore Roosevelt.\n  * Increased Involvement of Africans into the military based on their monumental impact during the war, for example, Booker T. Washington.\n\nIncreased involvement of political groups like the rough riders in national politics\n\nConclusion\n\nIn conclusion, the increase of imperialist leaders getting into the US government led to more expansionist ideas being circulated around the country thus creating the thirst for power consolidation rather than just focusing on progress.\n\nNonetheless, the lessons learnt from the war by all the involved parties served, and still serves, as a great reminder for the importance of dialogue, peaceful coexistence and good international relations amongst various nations and countries regardless of their different ethnicities.\n\nThis, probably, is the reason why, up to date, the politics of international relations still plays an irreplaceably key role in the balance of social, political, cultural, technological and social aspects of our lives.\n\nList of References\n\nDeGuzmán, M., 2005. ‘Consolidating Anglo-American Identity around the Spanish-American War’, Ch.3 of Spain’s Long Shadow.

      "Non-Profit Organizations Research Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nNon profit organizations are institutions that exist for various reasons for instance provision of educational or charity services. The essence of their establishment is usually not profit making but to provide services that are of help to the society.\n\nThe shareholders of these organizations do not benefit from them financially as the funds gained from the organization’s activities are usually retained for its own use for instance to cater for the operational expenses and emergencies. Due to their non-profit making nature, they are mostly exempted from paying taxes.\n\nJust like any other form of business, the non profit organizations face a lot of challenges in the running of their day to day activities and procedures (NSNVO, 2006). This paper discusses the major financial and ethical challenges experienced by these form of organizations.\n\nMajor Aspects of Non Profit Organizations Structure\n\nTo understand the challenges of the non profit organizations, we have to have an understanding of their general structure. One of the components is governance which is the part responsible for provision of strategic direction and controls which is undertaken by the top management.\n\nPrograms is another essential part of the non profit organizations structure which is the means through which resources are organized in order to achieve the organization’s goals. They constitute the inputs, the process undertaken on the inputs, the output obtained and outcome gained.\n\nThe final and most important element of the non profit organizations’ structure is the administration. Central administration involves the coordination of the staff and other resources that are important in running the programs.\n\nThe cost of central administration in non profit organizations should be kept as low as possible in comparison to the operational cost or the cost incurred in running the programs (Schmidt, 2004).\n\nChallenges of Non Profit Organizations\n\nHelmig, Jegers, and Lapsley, (2004) assert that non profit organizations face a lot of challenges in carrying out their activities and practices. Some of the challenges are major and affect them greatly while others are minor and create less impact on the organizations.\n\nThe challenges may either be ethical, managerial or financial depending on their nature.\n\nSome of the common challenges are; funding for their activities, communication of their activities or what they are involved in, staffing, strategic planning or setting of priorities because of uncertainty of their funding, regular changes in funding priorities and also constraints on the utilization of funds, management of donor and grants expectations, establishment of public trust with the organization and outside, technology related issues, and complying with legal requirements.\n\nThe most disturbing ones are however about funding, management and communication (Coffman, 2005).\n\nFinancial Challenges of Non Profit Organizations\n\nFinancial problems in non profit making organization are the biggest challenge as they hinder the progress of almost every process in the organization.\n\nThe organizations usually have lots of visions and ideas that ought to be developed but the problem lies in finding adequate funds to facilitate activities that ensure progression and financial sustainability of the organization.\n\nThis is because there is stiff competition on the available funds in various states or nation and it becomes hard to secure them and in most cases, only the most aggressive organizations benefit.\n\nThere are several sources of financial assistance that the non profit organizations can rely on for instance grants allocated for specific projects by the government, corporations or foundations, individual donations and also fundraising projects (NSNVO, 2006).\n\nFundraising Skills\n\nAccording to Deatherage, (2009), some non profit organizations lack financial support for instance from the government due to lack of recognition as a result of poor branding. Most non profit organizations underrate the importance of branding with the reason that they are not meant for profit making.\n\nA brand name is essential to all organizations irrespective of their nature and the activities they are involved with as it helps hold its clients interest and also that of other institutions that could be of support to them for example the government and other non governmental organizations.\n\nA brand helps sell the experience of an organization and in so doing, it serves the functional and even the social needs of the organization and helps people understand its cause and purpose through the emotional connection that is established.\n\nJust like profit oriented institutions, non profit organizations should build a brand by checking on the personality, messaging and value proposition in the organization.\n\nLack of expertise or staff who is well versed with fundraising and soliciting for funds from various sources for instances individuals, corporations and foundations also limits the chances of getting funds.\n\nGood programs are also necessary to facilitate fund raising. The programs should meet the important societal needs and demonstrate results that may catch the attention of the contributors.\n\nIncreased Competition\n\nThe sources for funds especially for charitable organizations where most of them are none profit making is usually limited due to competition as a result of an increase in the number of organizations offering similar services.\n\nThis has led to many negative changes in the organizations for instance having to lay off most employees as they cannot cater for their basic needs. The donors including the government have also become so strict in allocation of finances and are keen to make sure that any allocated funds are utilized appropriately.\n\nThis gives the non profit organizations an extra task of justifying their need for support from individuals, other organizations, corporations and even the government which requires qualified expertise who can persuade the donors.\n\nWhen the non profit organizations are not competitive enough, they are prone to financial crisis as the most aggressive ones stand the chance of securing the few available funds (Anonymous, 2009).\n\nChange of Environment\n\nThe changing of the environment in which the non profit making organizations operate has also led to increased financial crisis in the organizations as the need for provision of services to the community surpass the funds obtained from both the government and other sources.\n\nThe reduction of federal funding towards the non profit organizations has also been a negative impact to the organizations.\n\nOther foundations, State governments and even municipal governments have recently been experiencing some financial deficits and hence they find themselves reducing their donations towards social programs for example charitable organizations.\n\nThis affects the non profit organizations negatively as they are unable to execute their activities and processes effectively and efficiently.\n\nAccountability Challenges\n\nAccountability Pressures is also another financial issue facing most non profit organizations.\n\nThis is because most non profit organizations have not shown high profiles in terms of work done to the community and hence they find themselves facing some accountability pressures as they are expected to prove to the various support groups that their work has positive impacts through the services they provide to the community.\n\nThe public and funding bodies are concerned with the details of how effective and efficient the non profit organizations are in carrying out their activities.\n\nAccountability goes hand in hand with attracting and retaining public trust and they both enhance the process of seeking for financial support by the non profit organizations and also accounting for the funds given so as to ensure that they continue to get support even in future.\n\nFailure to provide accountability evidence to the donors and funding institutions limits the chances of the non profit organizations getting financial support.\n\nCollaboration Appeal\n\nMost funding institutions including the government are necessitating the formation of inter-organizational interactions for instance partnerships, alliances and collaborations as a basis towards which funding are grounded.\n\nThe relationships are expected to enhance the effectiveness of the non profit organizations. The organizations therefore spend a lot of time and resources in trying to form the relationships and in most cases they experience barriers to unite with other organizations for example due to interfering with their culture, lack of trust between the organizations and autonomy levels.\n\nFailure to form the relationships automatically disqualifies the non profit organizations as eligible beneficiaries for donations or funding.\n\nSustainability Challenge\n\nAccording to Donshik (2008), achieving sustainability is a major challenge faced by most non profit organizations.\n\nIt is the desire of any organization to have some level of financial security at any given time but since non profit organizations rely on others as sources of funding, their sustainability is reliant on the economic status of the funding institutions.\n\nWhen the income levels of the funding organizations are high the non profit organizations tend to benefit much as opposed to when the income levels are low.\n\nIt therefore becomes very difficult to achieve sustainability throughout the year making it difficult to keep their services and activities working efficiently. The non profit organizations are left with the option of looking for alternative sources of funding to cater for their needs.\n\nEthical Challenges of Non Profit Organizations\n\nEthics entails the rules of conduct that are established in regard to a given group or organization (Dictionary.com Unabridged, n.d)). It involves values that should be followed in human conduct basing them on the rightness or wrongness of a deed and the motive behind a certain behavior.\n\nMost non profit organizations find themselves facing ethical challenges especially while making various decisions regarding their activities and practices. The ethical challenges include; management issues, communication issues, sourcing for funds and mission drift and utilization of funds among others.\n\nManagement Issues\n\nManagement entails organization and coordination of the practices and activities of an organization in regard to some set policies and in manner that will enhance attainment of the organization’s aims and objectives.\n\nIt is a practice that requires commitment and innovation as poor management leads to failure of the organization’s processes and can in the long run cause the fall down of the organization.\n\nIt involves processes such as planning, organizing, directing, and controlling the organization’s resources with an aim of achieving its objectives. It is usually difficult to get qualified and good staff to take the sensitive posts of management in non profit organizations.\n\nMost of them use unethical means to carry out their managerial activities putting the organization in problems as it try to fight the unethical and corrupt deals.\n\nThe issues include staffing where the recruitment of new staff may not follow the stipulated procedure for instance the qualification and experience leading to poor performance and limiting the organization’s chance of progressing (Schmidt, 2004).\n\nCommunication Issues\n\nMost non profit organizations find themselves in difficult situations regarding dissemination of information regarding their products and services. Some issues also seem difficult to publicize as they are not common among the public.\n\nSome media also do not find some issues necessary to cover and it may require the organizations to put much effort in making sure that they are well known to the public.\n\nLack of expertise also limits the process of publicizing. Due to this problem the non profit organizations may find themselves carrying out unethical processes aimed at ensuring that they are well known to the public and also to the funding institutions.\n\nSourcing For Funds and Mission Drift\n\nAs a result of the financial constraints facing the non profit organizations, they are susceptible to drifting their mission and operating in a more business-like manner with the main aim of meeting their financial needs.\n\nThey mostly find themselves tailoring their programs in a manner that meet the requirements of the funding organizations. This may make them violate their policies that regard service to the community as opposed to profit making.\n\nUtilization of Funds\n\nThe non profit organizations are expected to be just in their utilization of the funds they either receive from the funding organization or from the revenue earned through their activities.\n\nThere is however instances of abuse of the funds for instance through use of the money to cater for personal expenses or excessively compensating the executive of the non profit organizations.\n\nAlthough all organizations should adhere to ethical standards in their activities especially in fund utilization, the non profit organizations should be more careful due to the consequences faced for instance, damage of public perception or view towards them, loss of public trust, and penalties and fines imposed by the government.\n\nPublic trust is very essential to the non profit organizations as it is the source of their support from clients and contributors (Theuvsen, 2004).\n\nUnder all circumstances non profit organizations should pay a lot of attention to ethical issues so as to maintain the trust of the society towards them and hence hold the interests of the public and the contributors and most importantly protect the name of the entire non profit organizations’ sector.\n\nUse of a good and clear code of ethics also ensures that the non profit organizations adhere strictly to their mission and provide their services as stipulated in their policy and objectives (Anonymous, 2005).\n\nConclusion\n\nJust like the profit oriented organizations and businesses, the non profit organizations are very essential to the community due to the services they offer and their existence and importance can not be under emphasized. They offer unique services that are not offered in other private and public institutions hence proving to be very helpful to the society.\n\nThey are however faced with a lot of challenges due to their nature and the fact that they are not profit oriented. Despite the challenges, there has been increased interest and participation in non profit and voluntary organization world wide as people become more inclined in helping the less fortunate or the needy in the society.\n\nReference List\n\nAnonymous (2005).

      "Possible Benefits of New Genetics Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThere is a lot of controversy attached to the idea of human cloning. For some people, human cloning is ‘ethically wrong’ and for others, it is a ‘repugnant’ and’ morally despicable’ practice. There are various potential benefits attributed to cloning. Emerging testimonies on human cloning have elicited mixed feelings on whether its potential benefits warrant the possible horrors.\n\nThere are those who agree that initial attempts to clone people could result in such horrific consequences as deformed children, spontaneous abortion, as well as putting the lives of women who volunteer to carry the first abortions in grave danger (Gibbs 4).\n\nIn addition, cloning is also associated with a number of disadvantages such as the disappearance of the meaning of life. We also have social, ethical, moral, political, and legal issues associated with the practice of cloning (Loston 1). The current paper is an attempt to explore social, ethical, and moral issues of cloning.\n\nHuman cloning is believed to enhance scientific development and scientific knowledge of humans. For example, the study of human cloning may lead to the discovery of a cure for such diseases as cancer and Alzheimer’s. Another benefit of human cloning is the ability to “grow” new livers, new hearts, and nerve cells.\n\nMoreover, human cloning may also allow for the rebirth of deceased humans, the discovery of new ideas and data, and a cure for genetics-related diseases (Gibbs 6). On the other hand, it is not clear yet the nature of the risks that human clones would face as they develop. Human cloning could result in superhuman beings and who knows their longevity compared to the rest of us? Human cloning can also lead to healthier beings.\n\nIn addition, it can also help shed light on the causes of spontaneous abortions, and a host of cancers. In contrast, conducting human clones may still be an unsafe practice considering the many risks and uncertainties associated with it. As Cohen (para. 2) has noted, human cloning can cause more deaths of human beings since both, the embryo and the child, can be in danger.\n\nI believe the idea of human cloning is wrong from a socialist perspective because we would literary be helping God in his work. The fact that God created us in his own image and likeness means that we should follow his commands, and not be co-creators with him. Considering that life is normally given to us freely, human cloning would be nothing short of mocking God.\n\nIt would also be a mockery of human kind because essentially, the socialization process of a human clone may be faced with resistance from the rest of us since this is something that we are not accustomed to. Moreover, the idea of human cloning has not been accepted by society in general, and as such, we can expect one form of resistance or another.\n\nOn the other hand, one might still argue that cloning is a purely individual decision and because we have that freedom, we might go ahead and embrace this practice as well. Other people also see human cloning as a gambling act whereby we may be intending to treat a preexisting medical condition such as Alzheimer’s cancer, or Parkinson’s disease. From such a perspective, human cloning may no longer be seen as an ethical issue but as a medical issue.\n\nFor the larger majority, we want to play it safe when it comes to the practice of human cloning. Accordingly, we are yet to take a stand on whether the possible benefits of human cloning would justify the potential horrors associated with the condition. We feel that scientists are leading us to an unknown world. As such, our moral may be compromised by undertaking the practice of human cloning.\n\nFrom a moral point of view, human cloning is wrong because when undertaking the experiments, we are likely to put the would-be clones in unnecessary danger. Because human clones are not generally accepted in the society, it would be morally wrong to bring forth a child who would be denied sufficient psychological and physical support.\n\nThere is the possibility of lack of attachment between a mother and a child in the case of a cloned child. Just as some people have found, the practice of animal cloning as unacceptable, we can also expect a lot of concern when it comes to human cloning. The larger majority is opposed to the idea of human cloning because they see it as a morally unacceptable practice. As such, it is currently inappropriate, not to mention unethical and morally wrong to undertake human cloning.\n\nThe possibility that cloning of human might one day become a reality has elicited a lot of ethical issues. Already, there appears to be high failure rates for animal cloning and for this reason, we need to be very afraid because we may be destined to a similar high failure pattern when and if we decide to embrace the idea of human cloning. This means that we also have to contend with the high morbidity rates that characterize cloned animals (Loston para. 4).\n\nCloning among animals has also been faced with high disability and deformity rates. For example, owing to disability, Dolly the sheep had to be put down when she was only 6 years old, although many sheep live to be over 10 years old. Although we might be able to overcome such coning problems over time, nonetheless, the associated ethical ramifications are not that easy. What would be the basis for denying couples to reproduce cloned babies? Whether cloning should be a preserve for homosexual couples or sterile couples, is still debatable.\n\nThere question of parents having to choose the traits of their children (because this is what cloning entails anyway), does not appears to go down well with a lot of people. If we allow human cloning to happen, then we shall have effectively started an inevitable process of phasing out the human identity as we know it today. The issue of individuality also comes into question, as well as the difference between manufacture and procreation. If we allowed human cloning to take place, how would the different generations relate?\n\nConclusion\n\nResearch indicates that cloning has a very low success rate. Even if we are in a position to increase the success rate of human cloning, we cannot rule out the possibility of problem developing during the cloning process, before, during, or after pregnancy. In spite of such risks, proponents of human reproductive cloning views the technique as a potential solution to infertility problems.\n\nThere are moral, ethical and social issues attached to the debate on human cloning. As such, policy makers, the public and researchers should all have a responsibility to assess the possible effects of human cloning technique on humans in order to make more informed decisions.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nCohen, Eric. “The Politics of Cloning”.

      "Task-based Language Teaching Applied in Elementary Classroom from Grade 1 to 3 Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Overview of a framework for task-based teaching 3\n 2. The Task Framework\n 3. Pedagogical task\n 4. Considerations for syllabus design\n 5. Syllabus content: Tasks and Functions\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Works Cited\n\nOverview of a framework for task-based teaching 3\n\nSpecialists and policy makers in the area of American education have developed a framework for the task-based teaching recognized in section 1 above. In fact, such a sophisticated teaching method cannot achieve its targeted goals without the involvement of specific guidelines specifically established for the teachers.\n\nIn this section, a framework for the CLT will be reviewed, with an aim of describing how the task based language teaching applied in elementary classroom will be enhanced in order to yield the desired outcomes. This framework provides a description of the key issues in the teaching model introduced in lower elementary schools.\n\nThis will include enabling both the target and pedagogical skills. This section provides an outline of the procedures that elementary school teachers will apply to develop integrated syllabus.\n\nIn the process of designing the syllabus, focus on material design will be an area of the main emphasis. Moreover, the principles for the procedures are going to be established.\n\nThe Task Framework\n\nThe target tasks or real-world tasks are the point of departure for TBLT. These tasks are several things that human beings do every day, such as using language, including writing, reading, exchanging ideas and socializing.\n\nThese have been recognized as the four macrofunctions of a language. According to this model, language is used for three basic purposes; they are exchange of goods and services, socialization as well as enjoyment.\n\nTeachers and policy makers in elementary education must develop effectiveness as they seek to develop pedagogical tasks by transforming the real-world tasks described herein. According to Richards and Rodgers (23), such tasks in language teaching are better achieved when they are considered and placed as a continuum from the rehearsal to activation tasks.\n\nPedagogical task\n\nRehearsal is an important task in teaching language in lower elementary levels. Rehearsal is actually a rationale behind the transformation of real world targets in language toward pedagogical tasks. For example, when teaching communication skills, a teacher may ask a student to take part in the task of writing his or her personal profiles.\n\nStudents will be asked to exchange their reports with their partners in order to see how different their answers are. From this task, it is evident that the task has been transformed from the real world task (the process of job seeking) to language teaching in class.\n\nThis framework is designed to provide the students with an opportunity to involve them in rehearsing some performance done outside the classroom, but which will activate their language skills in the classroom. In this case, learners will progressively move from reproductive use of language to creative language use.\n\nThe creative use of language is a state in which the learners are able to recombine some familiar words, expressions and language structures in a fresh way.\n\nIt is important to note that the learners will be in a good position to maximize their language acquisition when they begin to use the language in a creative way because they are required to use their emerging skills and resources in language. This is known as activation rationale in language teaching.\n\nConsiderations for syllabus design\n\nIn most cases, task based teaching approach faces a major problem because it consists of a random collection of tasks that have not been tied together. To tie these tasks together in an appropriate manner, it is necessary to consider two things.\n\nFirst, the teacher may tie these tasks in terms of lessons or units of work through task chaining principle. Within the syllabus, it involves macrofunctions, grammatical elements and microfunctions they express.\n\nTo enhance the process of task tying, there is need for an effective syllabus design. The syllabus is designed in a manner that expresses the task and the three elements of a task. For instance, in the task section, the teacher will make the students assume that they are in a party, where their partners will introduce three new friends.\n\nIn this case, the macrofuction is to socialize; the microfunction of the task is to exchange personal information while the grammar elements of the task include “stative” verbs such as “yes” or “no”. The following is an example of a syllabus design:\n\nTask                                            Macrofunction  Microfucntion                      Grammar element            \nAt a party a partner, three friends introduced  Socializing    Personal information is exchanged  Demonstrative verbs: Yes/No\n                                                                                                  Stative verbs              \n\n\nSyllabus content: Tasks and Functions\n\nTasks and functions of a task are related. A single task is always underpinned by at least one function. Tasks are normally made of a function and another element such as context.\n\nTasks allow grammar and functions to be activated within a give context of communication. Unlike the normal things done in a language, functions of a task appear more abstractive realizations.\n\nWithin the context of the syllabus, it is normally important for the leaner to share with others as they get oriented to the transformation of the real-life target to classroom experience with the task-based language and grammar elements.\n\nHowever, task-based syllabus, unlike synthetic syllabuses, allows a wide range of opportunities for naturalistic recycling. In this case, grammatical and functional elements must appear in a number of times within a wide and diverse range of contexts.\n\nIn particular, such a syllabus is important and good for second language learners as it allows them to restructure and develop an in-depth understanding of the grammatical issues in question.\n\nResearch has shown that a leaner’s ability to use a particular form of grammar several times and over a longer period of time will progressively increase his or her accuracy rates. However, research has also shown that the mastery of language does not proceed in a liner fashion from zero state to native-speaker state.\n\nSometimes, the learners’ ability may stabilize, while at other times, the ability gets from good to worse. This is primarily because linguistic items do not exist as isolated entities, but rather any item is likely to be influenced by a number of factors.\n\nAccordingly, learners must undergo a “linguistic metamorphosis” since language acquisition is a long and organic process (Richards and Rodgers 47). The syllabus for task-based teaching is based on this model in order to allow the leaner to enrich their language.\n\nConclusion\n\nTask-based language teaching applied in elementary classroom from grade 1 to 3 is better developed within the context of a framework that takes into consideration the tasks, their functions and grammar elements.\n\nThe task-based framework allows the teacher to take into consideration the process of transforming real-life tasks to pedagogical and grammar skills. Within this context, developing a syllabus that will take into consideration this framework must be based on the theoretical aspects of language acquisition.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nRichards, Jack and Theodore Rodgers.

Hypnotherapy: Definition and How It Works\n 4. How Hypnosis Therapy Is Used\n 5. Acute Stress Disorder (ASD)\n 6. Smoking Cessation\n 7. Irritable Bowel Syndrome\n 8. Conclusion\n 9. References\n\nThe history of hypnosis therapy can be traced back to the prehistoric times. However, it is not until the middle of the 20 th century that the use of hypnotherapy in clinical psychology became official and popular. At present, the benefits of hypnosis in clinical care are widely recognized.\n\nThousands of people throw themselves into the state of altered consciousness to improve their health and wellbeing. Of course, the way hypnosis influences the human organism is difficult to understand.\n\nFor many clinical psychologists, its mechanism is still unclear. Nevertheless, it is possible to say that hypnotherapy will become much more popular, as the whole health care system is shifting towards non-traditional, alternative methods of health regulation.\n\nThe History of Hypnotherapy\n\nAs stated earlier, the use of hypnotherapy in psychology is not new. The first descriptions of hypnosis and its power can be found in ancient writings (Whorwell, 2005). However, until the 18 th century, the study of hypnosis and hypnotherapy had been very unsystematic.\n\nThe first time hypnotherapy became a matter of professional concern was when Franz Anton Mesmer, Austrian physician, described the state of animal magnetism (Whorwell, 2005). Mesmer believed that physical health depended on the balance of the so-called “distribution” fluids, and the use of magnetic fields could potentially restore that balance.\n\nHe also claimed that placing the patient into a trance-like state was essential to the healing process (Whorwell, 2005). Mesmer was well-known for his eccentric personality, but his idea of animal magnetism eventually survived. With time, magnetism and hypnosis became popular medical approaches in Europe and the United States.\n\nIn the middle of the 19 th century, Manchester surgeon James Braid was put into the state of trance by a travelling French demonstrator (Whorwell, 2005). He became very interested in the hypnosis technique and wrote a whole book about it. It is in his work that the word “hypnotism” was used for the first time; it came to replace the term “animal magnetism” that originated in Mesmer’s writings.\n\nAlmost at the same time, another professor of medicine in London was starting to apply the hypnosis technique in his practice (Whorwell, 2005). He had to resign and start a private practice, because his experiments and their outstanding results were generating hostility in the medical community (Whorwell, 2005).\n\nDuring WWII, hypnosis was already used to deal with post-traumatic stress disorder. Hypnotic susceptibility scales were developed to make the use of hypnosis more professional and advanced. Today, hypnosis is quite popular among clinical psychologists and it is actively used to address the most controversial health conditions.\n\nThe Case of Anna O.: Hypnosis that Changed the World\n\nThe case of Anna O. was truly a turning point in the evolution and popularization of hypnotherapy. It is possible to say that the outcomes of the case served as a very good basis for the development of hypnosis as an official therapy in clinical psychology in other medical fields.\n\nThe first time Anna O. was attended by a physician was in 1880. She complained having nervous cough and had the symptoms of physical deterioration, which developed as a result of “overzealous nursing of her very sick father” (MacMillan, 1997, p.4). Her behaviors were quite peculiar, and it was not surprising that the physician immediately diagnosed her as being mentally ill (MacMillan, 1997).\n\nThose symptoms included a strange, even weird, tendency to be sleeplike and autohypnotic in the afternoons (MacMillan, 1997). At times, the sleeplike state would give place to increased, unreasonable excitement (MacMillan, 1997).\n\nThe decision to use hypnosis was justified by the fact that Anna O. could not remember what was happening to her during her sleeplike states, nor could she clearly explain what was responsible for her shaking psychological state. The psychiatrist used hypnosis to make Anna O. speak about her problems. He wanted to discover the secret of her disease, and it worked.\n\nThe case of Anna O. was, probably, the first time hypnosis was officially used in psychiatry and psychology. With Anna O., hypnosis helped obtain additional knowledge about her emotional and mental health state. What Anna O. shared during hypnosis sessions was used by her counselor to develop the list of topics and discuss them during their meetings (MacMillan, 1997).\n\nThe outcomes of hypnotherapy were very promising. The case showed that hypnotherapy was a self-directed cure. The patient provided the information needed to guide further counseling sessions. The case of Anna O. changed the world of clinical psychology and introduced hypnosis as a good alternative to medicines and coercive treatment of mentally ill patients.\n\nHypnotherapy: Definition and How It Works\n\nHypnosis can be defined as “a temporary condition of altered attention in the subject which may be induced by another person and in which a variety of phenomena may appear spontaneously or in response to verbal and other stimuli” (Whorwell, 2005, p.1061). Hypnosis is always associated with the changes in consciousness.\n\nIn this state of mind, individuals produce unexpected responses and are sensitive to suggestions (Whorwell, 2005). It is not uncommon to see a counselor or psychiatrist speak to a patient in the state of hypnosis.\n\nIn the hypnotic state, the psychologists can either induce or remove muscle rigidity and even paralysis; vasomotor changes may also take place (Whorwell, 2005). Hypnosis changes the world around and in the patient, opening new spaces for discussion and analysis.\n\nHypnosis is particularly useful in the analysis of various subconscious events and motives. Millions of people around the world face problems or behave in ways that cannot be explained. Unfortunately, hypnotherapy is still poorly explored. Even psychologists and psychiatrists, who are expected to have at least the basic knowledge of the technique, often have no direct experience with hypnosis (Whorwell, 2005).\n\nThe mechanism of the hypnotic process is surrounded by a lot of controversy. This misunderstanding is further reinforced by the stereotypes and folklore beliefs about hypnotherapy. Many patients still believe that hypnosis is dangerous to their health. They have a fear of being hypnotized against their will.\n\nThey think that, while in the state of hypnosis, their minds can be changed or taken over, and they will lose any control over their behaviors and decisions (Whorwell, 2005). In reality, hypnotherapy implies the use of trance and relaxation. The patient is allowed to speak about the most hidden thoughts and even make suggestions for improvement.\n\nAt present, hypnotherapy is actively used to treat acute stress disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, and smoking cessation problems. The main benefit of hypnotherapy is that it treats most health conditions as psychological, not physical. As a result, it is possible to avoid the heavy loads of pharmaceutical prescriptions and, instead, enjoy the relaxing atmosphere during hypnotherapy.\n\nHow Hypnosis Therapy Is Used\n\nPresent-day researchers actively explore the benefits and effects of hypnotherapy on different groups of patients. The most common associations are with acute stress disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, and smoking cessation.\n\nAcute Stress Disorder (ASD)\n\nIn terms of ASD, hypnotherapy is often used in combination with other cognitive and behavioral therapies. Patients with the symptoms of ASD can be placed in the state of hypnosis, followed by the use of cognitive-behavioral or any other therapy (Bryant, Moulds, Guthrie & Nixon, 2005).\n\nThe research shows that patients, who undergo hypnosis and CBT, have fewer symptoms of ASD and better chances to improve their quality of life. Nevertheless, the exact way in which hypnosis therapy influences individuals with ASD needs to be better understood.\n\nSmoking Cessation\n\nHypnosis therapy is often used to make the process of smoking cessation easier and less painful. It is no secret that individuals, who want to quit smoking, have to go through numerous and very serious changes to give up their harmful habit. Not everyone has the power and strength to resist the smoking temptation.\n\nIn this context, hypnotherapy can become a good alternative to the traditional methods of smoking cessation. Hypnosis does not eliminate the smoking cramps, but it helps manage thoughts about smoking more effectively (Riegel & Tonnies, 2011). Hypnosis transforms the ways, in which individuals think about smoking. They find it easier to cope with the desire to smoke a puff.\n\nIrritable Bowel Syndrome\n\nIt has become quite common to use hypnotherapy in the management of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). IBS was found to influence every fourth human at some point of their lives (Houghton, Heyman & Whorwell, 1996; Whorwell, Prior & Colgan, 1987). IBS greatly increases the burden of gastroenterological diseases.\n\nApart from the direct colonic symptoms, including disordered bowel habit, IBS also leads to the development of non-colonic health problems, such as backache (Houghton et al., 1996). Earlier methods of treatment have proved to be relatively or somewhat effective. Hypnotherapy has been a measure of last resort, but now it gives patients with IBS much more hope that their health can improve.\n\nHypnotherapy not only reduces the symptoms of IBS but also improves patients’ quality of life. Patients with IBS experience chronic pain, and hypnosis helps reduce its scope (Elkins, Jensen & Patterson, 2007). It is not difficult to imagine that, because of IBS, thousands of people should leave work and stay at home. Thus, hypnotherapy also has some economic benefits.\n\nConclusion\n\nHypnosis therapy is becoming more popular. By placing patients into the state of trance, clinical psychologists have better chances to understand their most complicated problems. Hypnotherapy suggests that most health problems have psychological roots. As a result, it is possible to replace traditional and costly methods of pharmacological treatment with hypnosis.\n\nToday, hypnosis is actively used to treat acute stress disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, irritable bowel syndrome, and even make the process of smoking cessation easier. Patients who have experience with hypnosis report improved health, wellbeing, and the quality of life.\n\nNevertheless, the knowledge of hypnotherapy and its mechanisms is quite poor. Moreover, the use of hypnotherapy in clinical psychology is still surrounded by myths. Many people believe that, while in hypnosis, someone can take over the control over their behaviors and lives.\n\nUndoubtedly, the current understanding of hypnotherapy is still in its infancy, but hypnosis does have the potential to become a cost-effective model of treatment in many health states and disorders. Through better education and research, clinical psychologists will be able to make hypnosis an acceptable form of medical treatment.\n\nReferences\n\nBryant, R.A., Moulds, M.L., Guthrie, R.M. & Nixon, R.D.

      "The Benefits of Outsourcing Essay\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe world is increasingly becoming competitive. Firms are facing various challenges from various fronts, and it is only the best that can succeed. Competition is one of the leading challenges that firms in the current market have to deal with. New firms are coming into the market with products that are already available. Such new firms have brought about saturation of various products in the market.\n\nAnother challenge that firms in the current society have to deal with is the emerging technologies. The emerging technologies have brought a number of new trends that are posing serious challenges to the survival of the firm. It is important that a firm comes up with the best strategy that can help it manage these challenges and come out successful.\n\nFirms must consider the way they can outsmart their competitors. This may not be easy because as they plan to outplay their competitors, the competitors are also considering the best strategy that can help them manage the competitive market.\n\nQuality has been proven to be one of the best tools of managing competition. In order to win customers, a firm needs to ensure that it has the capacity to offer its customers the best value for their money. They have to come out strongly in the market as firms that understand the needs of the market. As such, they have to meet and exceed the expectations of the market (McLaughlin & Aaker 2010, p. 78).\n\nOutsourcing offers firms opportunity to give this quality to the customers. Outsourcing refers to a strategy where a given activity is assigned to a contracted firm which does it on the behalf of the firm. It involves delegating some functions within a firm to another firm in a form of a contract. This is very common in cases where the function needs special knowledge in that particular area.\n\nThis may be in the telecommunication sector, in the engineering field, or any area that may require special knowledge in a technical field. This research seeks to gather evidence to support the fact that benefits of outsourcing outweigh its disadvantages.\n\nOutsourcing in the 21 st Century\n\nThe twenty first century is a very competitive century, and firms have been forced to come up with the best strategy in the market. A firm must give the best performance in the activity assigned. The process of having the best product in the market that is appealing to customers may be very difficult. However, the customers may not understand the difficulties of bringing these quality products in the market.\n\nDespite this fact, a firm has the obligation of constantly bringing products into the market. Outsourcing has come out as the best approach through which a firm can enhance the quality of the products. According to Hui-Ming and Paul (2010, p. 2090), outsourcing allows for individuals with the best capacity to perform certain tasks to perform them to their perfection. An individual cannot be all round perfect.\n\nThere are some areas where an individual may require the expertise of another individual regardless of the qualifications held in another area. Similarly, a firm may not have the capacity to perform various tasks in its area of operation.\n\nIn order to come up with a product with the best quality, it is important that a firm assigns duties that it is not best in performing, to a contracted firm with the best ability to perform such tasks. In order to understand the importance of outsourcing, it would be important to first look at the reasons for outsourcing\n\nThe Main Reasons for Outsourcing\n\nOutsourcing is one of the new trends in the current world. Initially, a firm would be involved in all the activities within the firm. The management would determine all the activities that should be undertaken within the firm. The management would then assign the activities to various departments within the firm to accomplish.\n\nThis was working well in those olden days, especially after the Second World War. Firms did not have to struggle looking for the market. The global market was very large, but firms that were doing mass production for various products were very few. There was therefore no serious competition in the market (Hooley 2008, p. 59). The main focus of most firms was to increase their production capacity because of the readily available market.\n\nHowever, this was changing as the world was getting globalized. Various firms were coming into existence from various corners around the world. With the emerging technologies, the world was fast turning into a global village. Many countries also considered opening up their markets for foreign firms. This brought about serious competition as firms had to convince the market that their products are the best.\n\nOutsourcing was first witnessed in the aviation industry. This industry still remains the leading outsourcing industry in the world. The airlines in many countries across the world realized that most of their employees did not have the capacity to offer quality service to the planes for maintenance purposes.\n\nThese airline firms struggled to look for employees with the capacity to take care of the maintenance of the planes. The process of looking for such experienced individuals was not only costly, but also very tiresome. It would take a lot f time getting an individual with enough knowledge in this area, and retaining them within the firm was another problem. This condition was worsened by the fact that such tasks would require a number of individuals to work as a team.\n\nThe airline firms therefore, had to come up with an alternative way of maintaining their aircrafts. It is because of this need for external expertise that these firms considered outsourcing as the best strategy that they can manage the problem of aircraft maintenance. They considered assigning individuals who are not direct employees of the firm the duty of maintaining the aircrafts on a regular basis.\n\nThis strategy spilled first to other industries in the United States and Europe (Bissoondoyal 2006, p. 92). Various multinational corporations realized that outsourcing offered the best strategy to manage internal operations. The strategy offloads some of the tasks that would have worried the firm to other firms that have specialty in dealing with such activities.\n\nIt also allowed some firms to lay off parts of its workforce as the need to have some departments was eliminated. Firms came to realize that they did not have to be perfect in all the stages of production in order to produce perfect products. They only had to select tasks that they had the best capacity to perform in, and assign other tasks to other outsourced firms.\n\nIn the current society, various firms have outsourced various activities to improve their quality of products. However, Outsourcing comes with a number of disadvantages. In order to determine if the benefits of outsourcing outweigh its advantages, it would be important to look at both (Montiel 2011, p. 119). The following are some of the disadvantages of outsourcing\n\nDisadvantages of Outsourcing\n\nIt is true that firms have considered outsourcing as a way of improving their operations. However, this comes at a cost. Firms may need to sacrifice a number of factors when outsourcing some of its activities. As Pellicelli (2010, p. 280) observes, outsourcing is not as simple as it may appear to be.\n\nThere are a number of factors that a firm must be ready to forego when outsourcing. This puts such a firm at risk, especially in the current competitive market. The following are some of the disadvantages of outsourcing.\n\nReduced Control of the Firm’s Activities\n\nThe current competitive market requires the management of a firm to be on top of every operational activity in the firm. It requires a firm to develop mechanisms that would enable it operate all the activities within the desired time. This control is always reduced when a firm decides to outsource the services of another firm.\n\nThe individuals who will be performing these tasks within the firm are not employees of the outsourcing firm. The management of the outsourcing firm therefore, does not have direct powers to direct them on how to carry out their activities. This may be frustrating to the management, especially when there is some form of urgency in the task.\n\nExposure of the Firm to Competitors\n\nThe level of competition in the market today requires firms to hide most of their strategies to the competitors. Large firms like Apple have been very successful in the market because they have hidden some of their strategies in the market. They keep their competitors guessing how they are going to approach some issues in the market.\n\nWhen the operational activities are left open for the competitors, a firm ends up losing its competitive advantage in the market (Prasanna & Lorin 2009, p. 18). Outsourcing increases chances for a rival firm to access classified information about the firm.\n\nDifferent Approach to Handling Activities\n\nMost successful firms always develop conventional ways of approaching various activities. This way, it becomes easier for the management to monitor the progress within various departments. The employees are also able to determine what is expected of them in the firm. When a firm is outsourced to perform certain tasks within the firm, the employees of the outsourced firm may come up with their own approaches of handling various activities that may be strange to the firm. This may complicate the need for the two sets of employees to work as a team. This may reduce the overall efficiency of the firm.\n\nBenefits of Outsourcing\n\nIn the current dynamic world, no firm can claim to have the capacity to perform various tasks that it may be faced with. It would be prudent for a firm to consider assigning some of its duties to other firms that have the best capacity to perform these tasks. According to Richard and Joseph (2007, p. 12), outsourcing has massive benefits that can enable a firm to achieve the best results in the market. The benefits so far outweigh the disadvantages that come with outsourcing. The following are some of the benefits of outsourcing.\n\nIncreasing of the Operations Efficiency\n\nOutsourcing is one of the best ways of increasing operations efficiency. It is common to have cases where a firm lacks proper expertise to undertake certain activities. This is very common when dealing with the emerging technologies. It may take a very long time for a firm to train its employees on certain activities within the industry. Outsourcing therefore comes out strongly as the best strategy that allows the firm to operate with the highest efficiency level even if it lacks expertise in some fields.\n\nEmployees who have knowledge and experience will be retained in their departments to increase their efficiency. Those tasks that the firm lacks proper expertise will be assigned to other firms with enough capacity to deliver good results. This way, the operations of the firm will be very efficient.\n\nIncreasing Time to Focus in Other Core Activities\n\nAccording to Steven (2007, p. 272), it is always a strenuous and time consuming process trying to undertake a task that one has limited knowledge in. Such an individual will be performing two tasks at a time. The first task will be learning how to perform the task, while purporting to perform the task. This takes a lot of time that would have been used to undertake other activities.\n\nWhen such activities are outsourced, it allows the firm more time to focus on activities that it can perform best. This way, the management, and the employees will be left with ample time to focus on other core activities of the firm.\n\nImproving Management of Information\n\nInformation is one of the key components of a firm that always dictates success or failure in the market. A firm that is able to develop an information flow has the capacity to succeed, unlike another with disrupted information strategy. Information management is always very important. Outsourcing enhances information flow.\n\nWhen a firm outsources another firm, it would mean that the firm will have a reduced number of employees. Coordinating the reduced number of employees is much easier. The management will use the leadership of the outsourced firm to ensure that its employees work within its expectations.\n\nReduced Cost of Operations\n\nFirms are currently fighting to reduce costs of operations. Customers are demanding more for a lesser cost. The suppliers are demanding more money for lesser suppliers they deliver, citing increased cost of operations. A firm is pressed between these two forces.\n\nIt has to find a way of meeting the needs of the two forces. Outsourcing offers firms this opportunity. When a firm outsources another to perform certain tasks, this would mean that the firm will not need to hire individuals in these departments. This reduces the cost of labor for the firm.\n\nReduced Risks\n\nThe process of outsourcing reduces the risks of errors in performing certain activities. This is very common in the aviation industry. When these tasks are assigned to experienced individuals, chances that the activity will be done in a faulty way are minimized. This reduces risks that would be met if the activities were done by inexperienced employees within the firm.\n\nQuick Implementation of New Technologies\n\nThe emerging technologies are very important in the modern world. It is important that a firm ensures that it has the capacity to manage the emerging technologies. Outsourcing other firms in various departments within the organization helps in quickening the implementation of new technologies.\n\nTo implement new technologies as quick as may be desired, there is always need to ensure that there are individuals who have an understanding of such technologies (Viardot 2004, p. 28). A firm will only need to go for a firm with experience and knowledge of the new technologies. Outsourcing their services will enable the outsourcing firm to implement new technologies at a faster rate.\n\nCompliance to Security\n\nIn most of the industries, there are some rules and regulations set by relevant authorities to protect the public. In the aviation sector, there are safety and security rules set up by various aviation bodies. The same case applies to various other departments. Some sensitive industries like the aviation industry would require individuals with a deep understanding of the requirements put forth by the regulators.\n\nWhen a firm outsources such sensitive tasks to other firms, it makes it easy for the firm to comply with the security and safety rules. This would eliminate any possible cases of litigation.\n\nStaffing Flexibility\n\nOne of the biggest tasks that human resource department has to handle is the flexibility of the staff. The staff of any given organization must be flexible. It must be able to approach the emerging trends in the market and be able to come out successful. However, this is not very easy because of specialization that comes with division of labor.\n\nWhen an individual is assigned a specific task, it would be difficult to make them perform other activities that are different from their current tasks. However, there must be flexibility of the workforce to enable the firm withstand the emerging trends.\n\nOutsourcing is the best way to enhance staff flexibility. A firm will only need to hire individuals with understanding of the emerging trends as and when needed. Employees will be given time to develop understanding of these new trends and master them, before they can start performing such tasks.\n\nDevelopment of the Internal Staff\n\nIt is import to develop the internal workforce. Development of the staff can come in various approaches. One of the most common ways of developing the workforce is through in-service learning. In this strategy, employees’ capacity is improved while they are at work. Outsourcing is very vital in this strategy.\n\nThe management will outsource a firm with the desired skills in a particular sector. The management will then select the workforce that should learn the desired strategy and assign them to work alongside the outsourced firms. The employees would be expected to learn how to handle certain tasks by getting involved in doing them (Tejaswini & Rajiv 2010, p. 320).\n\nThe outsourced firm will not only be helping the firm in performing that particular activity, but also in teaching and developing the local staff. The firm will therefore develop a strong workforce that has the capacity to handle various activities within the firm.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe world is increasingly becoming competitive. Firms are facing various challenges in the market that requires them to develop appropriate mechanism to overcome them. In the current world, it is important that the management understands the new forces that are relevant within the industry and acts upon them well in time.\n\nOutsourcing is one of the best strategies that a firm can achieve this. It has been clearly demonstrated that the benefits of outsourcing outweighs its disadvantages.\n\nList of References\n\nBissoondoyal, U 2006, Total quality management: a practical approach , New Age International, London.\n\nHooley, G 2008, Marketing Strategy and Competitive Positioning , FT Prentice Hall, Harlow.\n\nHui-Ming, W & Paul, W 2010, Modelling of outsourcing decisions in global supply chains: An empirical study on supplier management performance with different outsourcing strategies, International Journal of Production Research , vol. 48, no. 7, pp. 2081–2094.\n\nMcLaughlin, D & Aaker, D 2010, Strategic market management: global perspective, Wiley, Chichester.\n\nMontiel, P 2011, Macroeconomics in emerging markets, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge.\n\nPellicelli, M 2010, Outsourcing strategies.

      "The Probability for Libya to Become a Democracy Essay\n\nDuring several decades, the countries in North Africa are characterized by the prolonged transformations in relation to maintaining the democratic principles in the political and social spheres within the territories. The orientation to democracy is typical for a lot of countries around the world, but the situation in the Maghreb region is more controversial than within the other territories.\n\nCivil wars in the countries of North Africa resulted in the necessity to change the developed political regimes. The discussion of the contemporary situation in Libya can be referred to the arguments presented in the article by John Barger in which the researcher concentrates on predicting the possibilities to build the democratic society in Libya after ceasing the rule of Qadhafi.\n\nIn spite of the fact the situation of ceasing Qadhafi’s rule provides the political opposition with a lot of opportunities to change the regime in relation to the democratic basics, there are more limits for the process than advantages because of the impossibility to overcome the social and political apathy and consequences of the previous rule immediately.\n\nDemocracy in Libya could not be reached during a long period of time because of the peculiarities of Qadhafi’s regime known as Jamahiriyya. However, today the situation is changed.\n\nWhat obstacles can prevent the political activists from using the opportunities and building a democracy in the country? According to Barger, the process of democratization can be realized with the help of different organs of civil society used to guarantee the concentration on the people’s rights (Barger 64).\n\nThese organs can be established only as a result of forming definite political parties as the symbol of the democratic society. From this point, the exiled opposition to Qadhafi can be discussed as the effective force, but the realization of the idea also depends on a lot of particular limiting features.\n\nMoreover, Barger focuses on the definite apathy and passivity of the exiled opposition forces in spite of the possibility to establish certain organizations oriented to democracy. Thus, these organizations often showed a high degree of “apathy even for the minor roles allowed them by the Libyan state.\n\nAfter three decades of institutionalized passivity, it is questionable that interest groups will be capable of assuming politically active – or at least effective – roles” (Barger 66). That is why, it is possible to state that in the situation of receiving the opportunity to build a democracy, Libyan political activists can be rather helpless to mobilize their forces and establish the effective political system based on the democratic principles.\n\nHowever, the new approaches to the Libyan politics can be used by the Islamists who can establish the alternative regime. Barger accentuates that “any successful future political settlement in Libya will have to include the Islamists who … have demonstrated their ability to disrupt any political order of which they do not approve” (Barger 71). Nevertheless, the Libyan political system requires significant transformations, and there are no opposition forces which are sufficient enough to complete the transformations in short terms.\n\nThe contemporary situation in Libya and the analysis of John Barger’s arguments presented in the article allow speaking about the impossibility to establish a democracy in the country quickly. However, the orientation to the multi-party politics can be discussed as the effective strategy for the further development of Libya according to the democratic ideas and principles.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBarger, John. “After Qadhafi: Prospects for Political Party Formation and Democratisation in Libya”.

      "Constant Shock Syndrome and Tourism Industry Essay\n\n“Constant shock syndrome” is one of the key challenges facing tourism industry. It is characterized by pandemics, global economic problems, natural disasters and terrorism. In order address these challenges the tourism business has employed the strategy of experience economy. Experience economy is a wide context in which tourism; sports, arts and events industries or sectors operate.\n\nExperience economy offers more than mere products and services to increase visitors comfort and satisfaction. One of the practices is provision of sporting activities in tourism destinations. Experience in sports is one of the main reason visitors travel to a given destination. For example, a tourism destination can offer professional golf or tennis events. This experience attracts has sustained the tourism sector and has been used to address the “Constant shock syndrome” challenges.\n\nThe sporting activities are also accompanied by rich and diverse tourist experiences. In order to increase visitors comfort, tourism destinations have provided extra services in rooms like internet, automated teller machines to enhance withdrawing cash and high level of security and safety.\n\nProvision of such services enhances comfort of visitors and improves the profile of the destination. It gives the place unique features. The practice has been widely employed to address the challenges tourism sector is facing.\n\nSpecial events like cultural experiences, festival and business events can be used to boost tourism industry. Including unique arts and music in destinations increases the number of visitors.\n\nMoreover, use of diverse cultural heritage in a given destination can be used to attract more visitors and ensure they are satisfied. These elements will ensure maximum consumer experience which will attract more visitors despite global economic crisis and terrorism threats.\n\nRestaurant business is the tourism business to invest on. This business could be located in South Africa. Due to many tourists visiting the country, the business would do well because many visitors will be in need of food and drinks.\n\nThis type of business would offer a great opportunity to provide sporting activities and different forms of art considering that there are no restaurants with this provision. I would also explore the rich cultural experiences and provide them. As a result, the restaurant business could be successful.\n\nAnother reason is that South Africa is a strategic place for this business. Considering hygiene, safety and security are issues in South Africa; building a restaurant which has high standards of cleanliness and hygiene would be a great idea.\n\nI would also ensure that the place is well secured for safety of visitors. As a result the visitors have a different kind of experience which is unusual. With provision of accommodation rooms, entertainment in the rooms and internet facilities to ensure comfort, the restaurant will serve convenience purposes.\n\nSouth Africa is endowed with natural resources like beaches, diverse flora and fauna. This is a great source of attraction to the visitors. Building a restaurant a restaurant along these beaches will be a great idea. Visitors can relax after bout riding, swimming or sporting.\n\nThe country also has great national parks where provision of food and accommodation could a great idea. In addition, competition may be less stiff. A restaurant with great features can stand out compared to others. Such features like automated teller machines will increase the competitive advantage of the restaurant, thus increasing the business profits.\n",
      "Formation of Self Identity Term Paper\n\nFormation of self identity is the growth of distinct character of a person. The process is usually termed as enduring entity since it happens during the specific period of human life when an individual possesses characteristics which he/she is recognized with.\n\nDuring that period of time in human life, they establish a reputation which they are identified with. Formation of self identity defines a person; who he is and how people see him (Dupre 8).\n\nIndividual’s entity includes logic of uniqueness, logic of continuity and logic of affiliation. Many issues are usually developed by identity formation and they include distinctness and individual identity whereby a person can comprehend who he or she is as a separate and distinct being.\n\nHumans usually experience this through individuation when they apt to become unique. This paper mainly traces the theme of formation of self identity through the readings such as various liberal arts and my own experience as an individual.\n\nA student may decide to major in philosophy but before he or she begins to study, he must be fully aware of benefits of the course. Recognizing a field of study is self identity since a person becomes aware of what he/she wants to obtain in the end.\n\nParents usually invest financially on their children when they take them to college and that is why they always have the desire to know benefits to them. Parents will invest as much money as they can in educating their children if they know that it will secure their future.\n\nThose students who have chosen to major in the field of sociology, philosophy, anthropology or art history study liberal arts. There exists broad and versatile learning in liberal arts that forces students to immerse in studies.\n\nThis is a unique element of American higher education and a foundation of vitality. Today, many students have decided to major in different careers and ignore liberal arts. This is because the curriculum allows students to specialize in what they want and feel comfortable with.\n\nA student is allowed to choose a goal that is practical and most students believe that liberal arts are not practical. Administrators and faculty members have neglected to offer advice to students on the values of studying liberal arts.\n\nMost students and families, however, do not think the same with administrators and faculty members. They believe that it is not worth sacrificing money and time on liberal arts since they will not get any practical return on their investment.\n\nThey believe that it is valueless to study liberal arts since the return is apparent.\n\nUnderstanding the meaning of liberal arts and its purposes is what can make a person like this field of study. Many education institutions have failed to award undergraduate degree to liberal arts students.\n\nIn United States, 60 percent of undergraduate degrees offered by education institutions are in technical and pre-professional fields. Business courses account for 21% of the awards.\n\nIn 2006 report on improving American higher education, the special commission totally ignored the field of liberal arts and education and finished his speech without mention either of them.\n\nIn developing countries, the situation is even worse; many new institutions of higher learning only offer education on subjects which they view as practical which include: science, technology or business.\n\nThis is a common practice in China and Uganda; the government only gives scholarship awards to those students whom have pursed courses that are practical such as science, technology and engineering.\n\nStudents should understand that liberal arts comprise sciences and arts. Liberal arts can be contrasted with vocational education. Those students who major in liberal arts study psychology, history or biology.\n\nThey do not cover applied fields like criminal justice, journalism or agriculture. Having a clear understanding and knowledge of what liberal arts is comprise of, will enable students to make right choices.\n\nFor students to become successful, they require intensive intellectual dialogue between them and the faculty on diverse spheres of highest human values and concerns (Hallman 6).\n\nLiberal arts education involves students in formal dimensions of discussions which make students active since they are engaged in different discussion groups. Based on Socrates thoughts, students learn more effectively if they are involved in a discussion or given a question to pursue on their own.\n\nThis is what is called active learning where students are involved in asking questions and they are being asked questions. Elusive answers are received after dialoging with their fellow students.\n\nStudents will determine who they are and what their thoughts are concerning significant issues in life if they are involved in meaningful discussions which are challenging and require them to ask questions and think harder.\n\nStudents will also learn more about who they are if they are engaged in active learning where they can come up with their own questions and answers. This is what is termed as substantial learning.\n\nLiberal arts students do more of substantial learning as compared to other field of education (Roche 12). Most of the times, liberal classes comprise peer discussions, independent research projects and service learning.\n\nEssay examination, tutorials and oral examinations are some of the modes of which liberal arts learning is being fostered.\n\nStudents who participate actively during the learning process, who know how to connect the earlier knowledge to what they find meaningful are much brighter as compared to other students.\n\nBeing engaged outside the classroom substantive topics will make students enjoy their experience while in college. The more a student is involved in classroom, the greater their chances of learning deeply and developing personally.\n\nThis clearly shows that narrow education is not enough to enable students to identify what they want in life. The key to success in the global economic world today is liberal education.\n\nThis is because it introduces students to develop multiple perspectives on their own making them independent in such a way that they can make their personal judgment.\n\nLiberal education enables students to acquire broad knowledge and it gives them multiple opportunities to gain real life skills that they can use in the outside world, for example, in identifying that internet is everything in today’s world since it provides us with all the answers that we need (Naughton 7).\n\nThose students with broad knowledge are able to recognize that technology is what drives photography. They will also be able to give reasons why this is so by viewing at what photography is made of. Photography is surrounded by machines and that is what it is built of.\n\nA bright student will be able to identify if the quality of an image has gone up or it has a sharper focus or the lighting in the camera is better or much higher or if the color has lushes. A student who is not bright will assume and believe that all cameras are designed that way.\n\nLiberal students have skills that they can apply in many fields in today’s global economic world. This is because these students are curious and have the passion to know more and identify why certain things occur in life.\n\nOnly a bright student will be able to identify why there is war in the world and what can be done to overcome it. Some will see war as a natural thing which existed since Stone Age period.\n\nHuman beings are able to identify what is sacred because it shows and manifests itself. It is also totally diverse with profane. Something sacred is something unique which does not belong to this world; it may be an object or a stone which is different from natural ones that exist in the world.\n\nSomething that humans have identified as sacred is not adored in their form instead they are worshipped due to their hierophanies nature since they show something beyond their natural form.\n\nAnything that has been identified as sacred by humans will change their form to something else yet it still retains itself since it continues to perform its cosmic milieu in the surrounding where it is located.\n\nFor example, a sacred tree will continue being a tree, nothing will distinguish it from all the other trees. Only those whom the tree reveals itself to be sacred will see it differently. They will consider it as a supernatural thing.\n\nThose people who live in archaic societies tend to live a sacred life because they believe that it is power and reality itself. Their sacredness is saturated in their being human.\n\nArchaic societies believe that everything is real and at the same time they value life and believe that it is worth enduring. This explains why religious people such as archaic have great desires for mortality, to join in reality and to be power saturated.\n\nSacred people usually believe that the world is not homogenous since they can undergo interruptions, break through it to some other space such as mass (Eliade 8).\n\nSacred people also believe in sacred spaces. They value these places more despite the fact that they are surrounded by other grounds. Non-homogeneity experience of religious people can be termed as primordial experience since it proceeds all outside world reflection.\n\nTo them it reveals the central axis and the fixed point for the future. Homogeneity of a space will break if a sacred place manifests in hierophany. It also reveals reality as compared to non-reality of the surrounding.\n\nThe world was found on the sacred ontologically manifestation. Sacred people believe that the world is nonaligned and homogeneous; it cannot be qualitatively differentiated or wrecked into various elements.\n\nThey, however, believe that geometrical space can be delimited and cut in all directions but cannot be differentiated qualitatively. It requires no orientation by virtue of its structural inherent.\n\nIt will be much easier to acquire orientation and obtain a fixed point in homogeneity chaos if sacred space is reveled. The world will be found and the people will have real sense about it.\n\nIdentification of sacred is a vast subject which concerns not only historians of religions but also sociologists, social historians, politicians, psychologist, ethnologists and philosophers.\n\nThese people have enabled us to understand the state of sacredness as assumed by religious people. They have made us understand the universe and the spiritual world. They have also enabled us to identify the characteristic mode of the world existence.\n\nThey have made us understand why sacred people believe in sacred life and the main reason being that it has a sacred origin. Human existence in the world therefore brings out the reality in life as believed by religious people.\n\nSacred people believe that man was created by the gods in the world while the cultural heroes are responsible for completion of creation. They believe that the history of existence of semi-divine and divine works is not reality but myths.\n\nDevine behaviors possessed by man that keeps them closer to their gods are imitations induced by re-actualized sacred history. Non-religious people, however, have different views on the world. Non-religious people do not believe in transcendence while they acknowledge the concept of reality.\n\nThey do not also believe in the meaning of reality of life. Non-religious people are responsible for the development of western culture in the world. Modern non-religious people regard themselves as agents and subjects of history but they do not believe in transcendence.\n\nNonreligious beings do not recognize any humanity form that exists outside humans since they view it as an historical state. Nonreligious people believe that “ Man makes himself, and he only makes himself completely in proportion as he desacralizes himself and the world (Eliade 18).”\n\nThey believe that sacredness is a great obstacle to human freedom since it bounds them to one belief. They also believe that after totally demystifying themselves they will become free people. Nonreligious individuals also believe that killing the last god is the only way to gaining their freedom in the world.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDupre, Ben. 50 Philosophy Ideas You Really Need To Know .

      "Improving Practices in MRO Sourcing Essay (Article)\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe best practices in supply chain management include; developing an elaborate global supply system, controlling spending to enhance savings and achieve greater productivity and the reduction of transaction expenses.\n\nCompanies should aim at the alignment of both the supply network and acquisition process with organizational targets and objectives in order to ensure ultimate value for funds spent.\n\nAccording to (Avery Vol. 2), “UTC, Intel, Procter & Gamble, Dow Chemical and IBM have been successful with integrated supply models”. These companies are seeking services from integrated global procurement firms for improved efficiency.\n\nAt Intel Corp., there is heavy reliance on Electronic Data Interchange with its suppliers. This technology is dependent on system and hardware compatibility. Improvements can be achieved through partnerships with its suppliers to put in place IT infrastructure that allows for seamless compatibility, to enhance information sharing.\n\nIntel strives to reduce its operating costs through benchmarking and collaborations in overall company cost modeling with its suppliers. This supplier program has been successful in quality improvement.\n\nTo achieve greater results for both itself and its suppliers, Intel should consider the supplier’s unique operating environment and other factors that may make their overall cost model different from theirs, and make any modifications to their own model in order to boost the supplier’s morale.\n\nThere has been increased procurement pugnacity in collaborating with a single supplier to meet particular objectives of superior quality, sufficient and adequate quantity, and a desirable price. Intel’s sourcing strategy should be need based, with emphasis on the unique client requirements.\n\nIntel sources its materials from different suppliers because of the diverse products that it deals in. However, it should strive to engage suppliers with a global presence and with the ability to supply multiple products and services. This will help in achieving the best practice of developing an elaborate global supply system.\n\nThe choice of such a supplier is a tricky affair as organizational requirements do change over time, and the decision is based on a number of factors, a combination of which can only be best suitable to a specific company. The supplier’s preparedness and their technical capacity dictate what strategy firms choose.\n\nThe unfolding events in the global supply market have presented a major challenge to Intel. It is costly to terminate current contracts to cater for changes in the market, because Intel enters into long-term contracts that are legally binding.\n\nIt should thus prepare contracts with provisions for termination based on prevailing market needs to avoid servicing contracts for materials and goods that it may not require as a result of market shifts.\n\nConclusion\n\n(Flynn, Fraser, and Leenders M. 57) suggest that “an integrated supply strategy is depended on the IT infrastructure and systems used by a company and its suppliers”. Intel should source from regions where materials and services are lower.\n\nThey should in their own capacity, establish sustainable long-term and mutually beneficial relationships with local suppliers within their proximity. It should closely and continually monitor the performance of suppliers for better results.\n\nDeveloping a continuous and up-to-date communication system will ensure that any changes are incorporated and adequately catered for. Measures should be put in place to address emergency requirements that arise due to the dynamism usually experienced, as a result of uncertainties in the global economy, political and legal systems.\n\nReferences\n\nAvery, S.

      "Leadership: Role, Benefits, and Limitations Expository Essay\n\nLeadership is practices that influence other parties in completion of managerial aims and targets by directing the organization to become coherent and cohesive. For example, the mayoral role in a town is leadership, whereby he takes the responsibility of guiding the people to support the laid down policies for the development of the town. Leadership must involve responsibility.\n\nAll leaders use this process for outstanding results and productivity. They only do this through a leadership process that entails them applying their skills and what they know to influence actions. Different leaders have different traits influencing their actions as, ‘Trait leadership’ ascertaining that people are never born already leaders, but they are made.\n\nHowever, exemplary leadership does not involve responsibilities alone it incorporates the main concepts of leadership such as the role played by a good leader, excellent leadership skills, the effectiveness of the leadership activities carried out and the best leadership approach styles used by that leader.\n\nThis paper’s aim is to discuss what leadership involves, the role it plays in adapting and dealing with organizational change, the benefits observed when using the approach of leadership in an organization and its limitations.\n\nThe first concept of leadership is an exemplary leader: he may be a boss in the sense that he is somebody who has the responsibility of guiding and supervising a certain group to get the job done. The effectiveness of leadership must involve an exceptional leader who is creative and capable of inspiring more future leaders in his team.\n\nA principled leader deals with the group and the job because one without the other would mean no need of his leadership. Characteristics of a strong leader determine the efficiency of the group that he leads and the best leadership for increased productivity in an organization (Lencioni, 2002, p. 52).\n\nSome of the key things that contribute to the best leadership entail what the leader does, knows and who he is as a person.\n\nEffective leadership must put in consideration the followers in an organization; this means the leadership styles used by a leader should be unique and related to the uniqueness of every group. For example, experienced employees need less supervision than the newly hired and the same applies to the under performers and motivated employees.\n\nEach group has their own characteristics hence one leadership style cannot work for all job groups in an organization. A leader would therefore need to base his leadership styles on the specialization of each group entirely. Understanding and caring for employees needs is also extremely beneficial in building a working relationship.\n\nAnother aspect that cannot be ignored in ensuring effectiveness in leadership is the leader. One must have an understanding of his personality, capabilities and the knowhow. In leadership, the person in charge ought to display a good sense of command, use his knowledge on the task and incorporate this in what he plans to do for the organization.\n\nNotably the followers determine the success of leader so if they distrust the leader then the organization is likely to face leadership challenges. A worthy leader would convince his followers that he is visionary and can be trusted.\n\nAdditionally communication holds the key to exceptional leadership it is often nonverbal, but must work both ways. Relay information to the followers and let them have room to be able to raise their views and give feedback. The information that a leader relays to his followers either enhances his relations with them or destroys the same.\n\nFurthermore, situations determine the different styles applied by a leader and as a result, they carry much weight in predicting the effectiveness of leadership; in that different situations call for different approaches. Leadership and situation co-relate in that one cannot exist without the other; a certain situation prompts leadership and the leadership style approach used.\n\nFor example, when an organization is undergoing change due to a major budget cut in the economy, a wise leader would apply the participative style of leadership in order to have everyone contributing in keeping the organization afloat.\n\nWhile traits changes with time in different situations, situations remain stable, hence they have more effect on the traits of a leader. Different forces affect and influence these four factors, the followers’ skills, and their relationship with the seniors, the organizational strategy and the informal leaders within that organization (Northouse, 2007, p. 49).\n\nOne can be either a boss or a leader. An assigned leader gets his authority through that position he holds in the organization but this does not qualify him as a leader. Leadership is different in the case that it motivates the followers into desiring to achieve the highest goals, (Emergent Leadership) as opposed to dictating your employees.\n\nHence, assigned leadership is driven by the position one holds while emergent leadership influences the group in doing positive things. The Bass’ theory (Bass, 2008, p. 47) explains better, how people become leaders. Leadership development for a small group of people is defined using three different theories.\n\nFirst is the Great Events Theory; in this theory, unique leadership qualities portrayed by a common person may be prompted by a serious event or crisis that pushes them to act. In the occurrence of a crisis, one can respond in a way that brings his outstanding leadership qualities or show his weakness in leadership.\n\nSecondly, in leadership development, there exists Trait Theory; certain qualities possessed by an individual naturally lead them into management responsibility. An individual with an outgoing personality is likely to focus on leadership as a career or an area interest as opposed to someone who has a laid-back personality.\n\nLastly the Process or Transformational Leadership Theory is also crucial in explaining how some people learn leadership skills while others just get to be leaders by own choice.\n\nTransforming to become a leader would mean going through a training process to learn and adapt skills that lead to leadership development. On the hand, other people just choose leadership as a career and work tirelessly until they become exemplary leaders in the society.\n\nA group of people work exceptionally well under a certain leader who has total control in playing his role as a leader; this is what defines total leadership. Followers always desire to be guided by those leaders whom they respect and have a defined sense of direction; attained by someone who is ethical and visionary.\n\nLeadership that turns out exceptional depends on a dedicated and respected leader who sacrifices all his time and effort to benefit the organization. From the employees’ perspective, ethical leadership entails what one does that affects and contributes to the accomplishment of organizational objectives and its wellbeing (Northouse, 2009, p. 47).\n\nOn the other hand, components exist that contribute to the key factors influencing key leadership. In reference to the Hay Group study, Consultancy in global management, 75 components are significant to employee satisfaction hence effective leadership.\n\nThe study concluded that effective communication was crucial in winning organizational confidence and trust. This can be achievable through assisting employees comprehend the business strategies, their contribution to the achievement of principal business objectives, and share with them information about the company’s progress and employee’s division in relation to the business strategies (Giuliani & Kurson, 2002, p. 61).\n\nMoreover, self-confidence and reliance in the top management was the only way to foretell employees’ fulfillment. The other key concept of leadership that contributes to effective leadership is the principles of a leader.\n\nTools to this effect involves: the knowledge one possesses and uses to improve himself in the sense that he must be able to understand his do’s, dont’s, his knowledge capacity, attributes, and constantly strengthen them.\n\nIn addition, a leader must be familiar with their job and employees tasks if they plan to lead effectively and accomplish the company set goals. Another aspect is responsibility for one’s actions; in order to propel the organization to new heights one must know the situations at hand, analyze, correct and offer solutions before proceeding to other new challenges (Northouse, 2009 p.40).\n\nAdditionally the best decision-making, planning and problem solving play a leading role in determining the effectiveness of leadership if well timed. Setting the example is very crucial when blending with employees because they need an excellent role model who not only gives instructions of what is to be done but also follows the same.\n\nFor effective leadership, having the knowledge of your followers is very necessary in caring and understanding their human nature in order to also keep the employees satisfied.\n\nCommunication is also important since workers need to be informed through constant interaction with other seniors in getting views and feedback that effect to exemplary leadership. An added advantage would be training these workers on responsibility to equip them with traits that become useful when performing their respective tasks (Giuliani and Kurson 2002, p.61).\n\nFurthermore, delegation of simplified duties to workers determines the level of leadership effectiveness for example, when giving instructions on tasks to be accomplished; leaders should ensure the clarity of what each employee is expected to do.\n\nIn addition to the above, leaders should advocate for more team-building training and workshops with the aim of attaining organizational cohesiveness in order for leadership to be successful. Lastly, utilization of organizational capabilities should be activated in that the developed togetherness of the team assists a leader to drive the organization to its full potential and capabilities.\n\nAs an added advantage, the attributes of a leader determine the level of trust and respect from his employees and a certain framework of leadership aids him to do so. The do, know and be, attributes must be acquired through constant education of self, study and work in order to achieve the best leadership and leadership skills.\n\nThe process of leadership involves the leader’s knowledge and skills, but his unique attributes make his leadership exceptional (Posner & Kouzes, 2009, p. 66).\n\nSome of the characteristics of an outstanding leader entail a visionary leader who has the understanding of the people and the task to be able to shape the image of the organization. For example, the exemplary leader Christopher Columbus, who is a strong leader someone who has thick skin to stand and accept any criticism about his plans and still stay focused?\n\nStrong opinioned and hardly compromises their work or lose focus from their goal due to mishaps. Exceptional leaders are not born, but they are made. An individual with passion and a strong sense of command makes the best leader. Developing an exemplary leader takes a lot of effort put in studying the right person for the task, educating them and building their experience (Khurana & Nohria, 2010, p. 81).\n\nThe role of leadership in organizational change\n\nIn an effort to do organizational change, management leadership is the most crucial element needed with the top management playing the most pivotal role in this change. This leadership has its limitations and benefits that affect and influence the employees work lives respectively.\n\nEffective and un-manipulated leadership guarantee the success of wiping out the unpleasant effects that arise from the change. The success of wiping out the unpleasant effects of change depends on successful leadership.\n\nFirst impression of a leader’s competitiveness and qualities in dealing with change matters more than the change-taking place. For effective management of change, one needs to be knowledgeable about the three distinguished zones of time such as, the preparation stage, surviving through the change and the period after the change.\n\nThe role of leadership in an organization undergoing change depends on the abilities of the leaders. Often during change in the organization, employees would expect the best from their leaders in terms of dealing with the change hence communication plays a key role in implementing change.\n\nLeadership comes out as support, commitment and concern of the employees’ welfare during the change times as well discovering the need to make tough decisions (March & Weil, 2005, p. 75).\n\nThe first step in dealing with change is to have leadership that employees can believe in to give them new vision into the future of the organization. Able leaders deal with the impacts of change practically by mobilizing the employees and applying the best leadership style approaches to get through the change.\n\nThe existence of leadership from the point change begins until the phase after the change is the key subject to note when dealing with change. However, for easy transition and coping during change effective leadership must be established first before the unpleasant organizational hits.\n\nA solid foundation laid down through leadership should put an organization at a better position for any changes that occur in the future. For effectiveness in transition to organizational change, a leader needs to establish a proper record of decision-making and credibility. Hence, the employees would trust one’s ability to figure out solutions to get them through the change (Wooden & Jamison, 2005, p. 29).\n\nSurviving through change is the second time zone when leadership plays a valuable role during the implementation of change. The period of change renders the organization most vulnerable and unstable due to many changing characteristics in the employees.\n\nHence, a wise leader would concentrate on identifying ways of motivating and improving the welfare of his employees. Secondly, leaders assist employees in transitioning after change through pulling all the resources and finding solutions as a team. The key role that leadership plays in this phase is balancing the time to focus on change, pain and move to the future (Daft & Lane, 2011, p. 63).\n\nArrival period is the phase after the change, has taken place characterized by less emotion, more stability and workers ready to forge a new direction with a fresh mandate. Therefore, more responsibility is dumped on leadership to effect new ways that work to the organization’s advantage.\n\nAdditionally, the leaders make a better future for the employees by offering long lasting solutions that improve their lives at work. The ultimate role of leadership in this period is completing the change by convincing employees accept the current situation and understand their new roles in the changed organization.\n\nCollaboration and communication are some of the leadership behaviors that contribute to support and adaptation during organizational change (Clampitt & Dekoch, 2001, p. 54).\n\nDiscussing with examples what are the benefits and limitations of leadership approach\n\nThe benefits and limitations of the leadership approach can only be realized in the different leadership styles used by various leaders in their respective organizations. A leadership style is the manner of approach that leaders use in providing direction and implementing the plans of an organization to get things done.\n\nBenefits of the leadership approach\n\nLeadership is extremely useful in urgent circumstances and the military in determining the direction and success of sound decisions. Some time, the people in the field of combat may prefer direct instructions from someone in control on what to do than think and make wrong decisions.\n\nThe best leadership approach in this case is the Autocratic styles where by the subordinates receive orders on what to do and without questioning or disputing; they carry out those orders to the latter.\n\nLimitation of arguments is another beneficial role of the leadership approach. In any work environment, there exist different employees with different views and personality’s hence lengthy debates may likely occur if all those employees were to be given room to have it their way in performing the organizations tasks.\n\nHence, leadership through autocratic style limits the chance of such occurrences by having one leader delegating all the duties, supervising and dictating order at the workplace (Kouzes & Posner, 2002, p. 34).\n\nLeadership offers intellectual stimulation: it inspires people into creative and diverse thinking by suggesting new dimensions of looking at things as in the case of business. For example, this was evident in Martin Luther King’s role as a leader (Phillip’s,2000,p.31) because he constantly inspired and motivated his people through his fluent speaking style and gave them a compelled vision on life.\n\nIt has charismatic influence in politics especially for people who apply this approach. It gives them the poise and confidence to be able to address and convince an audience in supporting their political stand.\n\nAs in the 1970’s case when James McGregor Burns developed it to guide all the leaders in politics, (Burns, 1979, p.15) Leadership made the political leaders energetic, dynamic and gave them a strong sense of command.\n\nWhenever good leadership exists in an organization, employees and other members of staff get individualized attention basing on their varied grievances. Leaders using transformational leadership style attend and constantly monitor the well-being of employees through team building and motivational activities. This ensures meeting of individual needs leading to employee satisfaction hence increased productivity.\n\nAdditionally, leadership approach dictates the foundation and direction of solving problems in instances of clashes on behavioral standards or values. Leadership plays a significant role in this by laying down strategies that act as a guide in solving the clashes conflict.\n\nAn example of this benefit existed in U.S. through Martin Luther King’s leadership he successfully appealed fair play by advocating for the outlaw on buses’ segregation (Wise & Kowalski, 2010, p. 37).\n\nThis approach strengthens employees’ position in an organization through team spirit. Involving the employees in decision-making in the same way leaders do in the democratic style of leadership ensures efficiency of leadership and satisfaction on the part of the employee. Hence, increased input resulted because they feel as part of the organization.\n\nReduced gap in communication through leadership: for example, application of the democratic style of leadership clears tension in any work environment. This is achievable only through giving employees the freedom of speech and contribution into the organizational decision-making process.\n\nThis addresses problems and issues just as seen in the Obama’s regime. Obama’s rule is more effective than for any leader in the past; his democratic leadership style ensures the hearing of common citizens and their needs met (Laszlo & Laugel, 2000, p. 52).\n\nLeadership approach creates a positive environment for working in several organizations. It encourages fair distribution of challenges and responsibility among the junior workers as witnessed in a school setting. When the vibe is right among workers in a company work, becomes more fun.\n\nAny learning and working environment utilizing the use of leadership approach inspires creativity during problem solving and task performance. Leadership with this motive ensures that all ideas as different as they may be included in one box for reaping of greater benefits to an organization. Hence when that happens creativity resulted from the complexity of the final idea reached.\n\nFor example in Skype leadership focused more on results and not efforts as highlighted by Terry Brock in an interview about their leadership styles. He asserted that Skype’s leadership motivated employees through team play to get the job done; additionally they cultivated and supported creativity (Tangri, 2010) by awarding their employees.\n\nIncreased safety at work enforced through the leadership style in use. Safety and health rules enforced by certain leaders in the bureaucratic leadership style ensure maintenance of health and save lives thus increased safety at work. The people who benefit more from this leadership approach are the construction workers and the medical staff in hospitals.\n\nIn addition to the discussed benefits, exemplary leadership increases the quality of work in an organization. It is common sense that supervision is crucial in any work environment for the achievement of excellent result. Hence leadership plays that role in supervision, and as a result, only the best piece of work achieved; high quality.\n\nInfluential parastatals and successful companies like the Microsoft company headed by Gates benefited from his visionary leadership(Prince, 2005, p.20) where by he led by taking part in reforming the products to meet the customer demands hence the quality of Microsoft product increased tremendously.\n\nLeadership approach encourages the division of labor where by the managers, junior workers team up, and work together for the same course in a company. In participative leadership applied mostly at construction sites, division of labor is common. It allows the efficient utilization of skills and talents in a certain job hence resulting into increased input that is profitable for the company (Burns, 1979, p. 25).\n\nLimitations of the leadership approach\n\nLeadership limits the social appeal and autonomy in an organization. The pushy and dictatorial leadership applied by some leaders kills the whole essence of interactive cohesiveness at work because the employees had worked in fear and close supervision by their respective leaders.\n\nEmployees become afraid to communicate to each other or interact with their supervisors because of tension and distrust they have. For example of leadership in prison and army camps, they viewed the juniors as robots to follow orders from the superiors (Wise& Kowalski, 2010, p.40).\n\nSecondly, there prolonged decision-making has been observed in many cases applying this approach; the process depends entirely on the leadership style used by a leader. A longer decision-making process means a democratic or situation leadership style while autocratic style of leadership has the shortest process of making decisions.\n\nThe top leaders word is always the final decision as to a family where the parent makes the decision most of the time for the young kids. Decisions are long drawn in the case of democratic leadership. Here, all the team members undergo consultation and feedback collected from each one of them before making decisions (Kouzes and Posner, 2002, p. 43).\n\nAnother limitation is the dehumanization of humanity for instance, the bureaucratic leadership approach removes the potential of errors by a human and all enjoyment sucked by the rewards of their hard work; work becomes just a routine rather a passion.\n\nAs for the example of leadership under Muammar Gaddafi’s rule; he dictated every thing and anyone opposed to his rule got killed or imprisoned (Ezro & Frantz, 2011, p.22). He started ruling Libya when at 27years and stuck in power where he set the committees of how people lived and even ruled the media; depriving the people their humanity freedom.\n\nAn additional negative impact of leadership approach occurs in instances of obsession in the power of a position by some leaders. The power and authority that enforced by certain working environments makes the leaders self absorbed in power and greediness of a certain position that they forget the critical aspects of their leadership.\n\nThis not only kills the team spirit but the organizational overall productivity. An example of such a limitation is evident in politics in most countries, where the leaders fight for power and forget all about the people, the sole reason why they are in power (Lencioni, 2002 p. 40).\n\nFurthermore, personal growth sometimes stagnated with the wrong leadership or obsessive leadership. Some leaders obsess on leading others, and they bar any chances the employees would have in expressing their creativity and growing professionally. This example was experienced by many immediate subordinates to CEO’s of most organization they want to remain in power in power.\n\nLastly, misappropriation of funds is almost top on the list in limitations of leadership approach. Most leaders use their power and positions in their respective organizations to embezzle and misuse funds. Additionally, they hide the accounting blanks under so many less weighty projects.\n\nFor example, this is a common occurrence when it comes to college and students’ trust funds like in the Philippines, college trust funds have really been misused in the past, through bad leadership hence, you will notice the dwindling level of education in some parts of the country (Posner and Kouzes 2009 p. 52).\n\nIn conclusion, leadership is not just the responsibility of leading others but, as an employee, it entails dealing with the situations that are present and making professional sound decision that favor the group, the organization and the objective tasks to be accomplished.\n\nIn time of change, a leader should show support for the situation and play his role in implementing leadership skills that would give direction of the organizational future after the change. All in all leaders are made, not born but, true leaders are made in a long process of leadership.\n\nReferences\n\nBass, B. M. 2008.

      "TV Show Classification Classification Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. House TV Series\n 3. Theme as a Classification Principle\n 4. Conclusion\n\nIntroduction\n\nOne way of making complicated things simple to understand is through classification. The entertainment industry classifies movies and TV shows using various principles such as genre. There are many TV shows in the entertainment industry which are divided and classified using various classification principles.\n\nDue to similarities in characteristics of these TV shows it becomes important use better classification principles than the generally used. Different TV shows depict different themes in the plot. Thus theme can be an ingenious classification principle. This paper seeks to divide and classify TV shows using theme as a classification principle.\n\nHouse TV Series\n\nHouse is a TV show currently being viewed by many people. All episodes of the show are set on a hospital set up. The main characters are all doctors belonging to a diagnostic team which goes beyond its means to solve very complicated medical conditions. In such a setting, it is expected that conflicts will always come up and this becomes the main backbone of classification.\n\nTheme as a Classification Principle\n\nThe main principle of division and classification is theme. TV shows can be divided into different categories depending on the predominant theme depicted.\n\nA close observation of the series suggests that theme of conflict of interests is most predominant. Under this theme, House can be categorized into three types. These types include conflict of moral values, gender conflicts and intellectual conflicts.\n\nAccording to my classification system, TV shows can be classified according to main theme of the show. House lies in theme of conflict. Then, a chosen TV show is categorized according to the type of conflict that is dominant. Different shows in House series demonstrate different types of conflicts.\n\nOne show that really demonstrated conflict of intellectual values as a type of conflict is season four episode six. In this show Gregory house was invited to the secret CIA center where he was expected to perform a diagnosis to a sick CIA agent.\n\nGregory house really had a hard time with the CIA doctor Curtis. Both doctors engage in a tough intellectual battle with each trying to prove his worth. The diagnostic team left back at Plainsboro engage in an intellectual tug of war.\n\nChase, Foreman and the interns try to use their intellectual muscles against each other. Although they fail to solve medical case on their own, each one of them tried the level best to outdo others in absence of their master.\n\nThe whole House series tried to demonstrate elements of gender conflicts in the workplace. However, this type of conflict became eminent in the last episode of season three. Cameron and Chase despite being engaged to one another engaged in a gender conflict.\n\nThere is war between genders with Lisa Cuddy supporting Cameron against Chase and House. Cameron fails to take it anymore and is forced to quit her job as a diagnostician at Plainsboro. She calls it quits and resigns her job and the next season had to begin with a process of recruiting a new diagnostician to replace her. This shows how gender conflicts affect people at work place.\n\nThe most exemplified type of conflict is conflict of moral values. Although most of the episodes contain elements of conflict of moral values, season six episode three went overboard in demonstrating this type of conflict.\n\nThe diagnosticians were faced with one of the most morally challenging issues they could ever handle. They had to treat a leader of an African country who was implicated in massacre. The leader wanted to be so that he could go on with his massacre plans.\n\nCameron and Chase were faced with a tough moral decision of whether or not to let him live by secretly breaking some medical rules. Chase finally decides to secretly kill the evil minded leader.\n\nForeman and House cover up the conspiracy. However, Cameron comes to learn the truth and this breaks her moral nerves. She ends her marriage with chase over this case and vows never to return to Plainsboro hospital.\n\nThese three scenarios in House TV show are just a representative of how a TV can be divided and classified according to a well thought principle. Other TV shows can as well be put under the same classification. What is needed is to understand what the TV show is all about and what theme is exemplified.\n\nConclusion\n\nIt can conclusively be said that, division and classification can be used to categorize any movie or a TV show. In this case, the theme of TV show was used as the main principle of classification. Under the theme of conflict, three different types of conflicts were used to categorize the TV shows.\n\nThere may be faint elements of overlap of the types of conflicts used to categorize the shows. However, the examples from the whole series serve the purpose well. The theme principle can be applied to categorize any other TV show as well.\n",
      "Motor Industry: Forklift Market Analysis Report\n\nThe evolution of motor industry has progressed for decades from innovative individuals to corporate organizations witnessed today. This has contributed to the establishment of material handling industries around the world. Some of these material handling sectors are involved in manufacturing equipments and machines for use in mining, power generation, construction, and transport industry.\n\nHowever, the most popular machinery within the material handling sector happens to be the forklift. Forklifts are used for different purposes and are available in all sizes and models. As a segment of material handling sector, forklift industry has over the years grown tremendously. The actual growth can be testified by the gains made by different manufacturers who have continued to dominate the global market.\n\nFor instance, the leading forklift producer for the last ten years has been Caterpillar Tractor Company. The firm was established in the wake of 1925 after Holt Caterpillar and C.L.Best Gas Tractor merged to form Caterpillar Inc. Currently this organization is one of the largest producers of material handling equipments.\n\nAs indicated by the market reports from 2001-2010 Caterpillar Inc. had sold over 4 million forklift units globally.Jungheinrich Lift Truck, Komatsu Utility Co, Anhui Forklift Group, Mitsubishi Caterpillar, TCM Corp and Kioni Group, are some of leading forklift manufacturers.\n\nDue to structural and economic issues, forklift industry has been operating on three major business lines; provision of financial products, manufacturing, and assemblage of material handling equipments such as forklifts. From the year 2001-to-2010 the industry had generated total income amounting to $499.6 billions and earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization of $50.7billion (Thomas, et al 2005).\n\nStrategic overview\n\nThe economic, structural, and marketing focus of forklift manufacturers for 2001-2010 was trained on operations. The purpose of this disposition was to enhance individual manufacturer operations in regard to competition and production. As testified by Caterpillar Inc. most of the forklift manufacturers have over the years employed an enterprise approach that purposely focuses on the industry’s clients, workers, and stakeholders.\n\nThe industry’s objectives are founded on the manufacturer’s tactical objectives, operating principals, in addition to corporate obligations. The industry’s primary strategic goals are: to have the best team in all of their operations, create better economic results, and be the best manufacturing industry.\n\nThe forklift industry has remained in the market due to its corporate, structural, and economic values. These values have compelled the forklift manufacturers to provide quality products, solutions and services to their clients. This includes facilitating minimal total owning as well as operating life-cycle expenses as is apparent from 2003-2010.\n\nThis approach enabled this industry to attain unequaled growth compared to other manufacturing and assemblage industries globally. Hence, Michaely claimed that the industry’s strategic objectives allowed the forklift manufacturers to experience the highest customer constancy in addition to attractive productivity (2001).\n\nCompetitive environment\n\nBasically, from 2001-to-2010 forklift industry was involved in construction, mining, and farm machinery trade. However, the industry’s principal objectives allowed the manufacturers to offer technical solutions to other industries. Some of these solutions were given to mining, rail, agriculture, forestry, petroleum, construction, and power generation industries.\n\nOwing to the extent of its operations within the period spanning from 2001-2010, the industry joined the competitive assemblage and manufacturing market globally. Like any other major industry it was faced with government regulations and market variations which affected its productions.\n\nThis aspect is testified by Komatsu a major forklift manufacturer who for this period witnessed mounting competition from both regional and domestic manufacturers.\n\nExploring all segments associated with material handling operations, forklift manufacturers such as Caterpillar competes on the tenets of product performance, quality, price, and customer service. Hence, in regard to this industry analysis I will focus on the following global competitors: Komatsu, Cummins Inc. Deere and Company (Deere), Volvo Group AB and CNH Global NV (CNH) (See table 1).\n\nAcquisitions\n\nEconomic prospects and changing consumer preferences saw the rate of acquisitions in this industry take a new shape. This was due to dwindling global economy, and the competition wars which transformed the once simple material handling sector into a global market.\n\nConsolidation of business procedures equally contributed to the high rate of mergers and acquisitions within the forklift industry. The forces of open enterprises witnessed during this period saw the forklift industry being buried in either mergers or acquisitions. The principal causes of either mergers or acquisitions in the industry were linked to the scope of seeking stable stock market, suitable regulatory environment, as well as economic and technological transformations.\n\nIn 2001 Kalmar acquired Nelcon BV; while a Canadian firm Finning International acquired a UK company Hewden Stuart. Another notable acquisition in this industry involved Detroit and Fraza which joined to form Fraza Forklifts. Also the industry witnessed Bolzoni SpA of Italy merging with Auromo of Finland. In 2010 Caterpillar Inc acquired UIT (underground imaging technologies), and Clean Air.\n\nMarketing strategy\n\nForklift industry has some of the most notable brand such as Volvo, Komatsu, and CATS According to market surveys the industry had CAT as the most predominant brand. And this contributed in making CAT and Caterpillar the most popular names within the material handling and heavy industrial machinery markets.\n\nToday, CAT label is among the most respected brand in regard to products as well as services pertaining to earth-moving sectors/industries globally. (CAT will refer to the brand, while Caterpillar Inc.will refer to the business organization in this project)\n\nReputation\n\nFrom 2001 this industry grew to be a major global industrial player. According to Edwards, the forklift industry has persistently progressed due to its worldwide dealership network in addition to its superior quality products (2003). As witnessed in the course of 2001-2010 period the industry has established itself as a domain of excellence.\n\nWith the new entrants such as Komatsu, Cummins Inc. Deere and Company (Deere), Volvo Group AB and CNH Global NV (CNH), the industry’s manufacturing division has forged a very positive image globally.\n\nSegmentation\n\nThe market segmentation plays a critical role in as far business success is concerned. Regarding forklift industry, Bhagwati (2009) noted that the industry was involved in various aspects of market segmentation. Some of the cited aspects entailed business-to-Business participation and business to government promotions.\n\nWithin the scope of 2001-2010 period this resulted in the industry having such clients as; Independent contractors, Industrial corporations, and Government as well as government contractors. Dividing the market in this manner allowed manufacturers to easily identify and determine their principal customers. Thus, this approach necessitated the formulation of more effective marketing strategies aimed at enhancing the industry’s brand impartiality and success.\n\nPositioning\n\nThe fundamental aspects of forklift industry are to satisfy its clients. And this is reflected in the manner majority of the manufacturers in this industry were engaged in the success of their client. Hence, some of the industry’s labels like, Komatsu, Deere, Volvo, Cummins and CAT were positioned as brands for the hard working individuals.\n\nAlso the players in the industry implemented unique marketing strategies. This entailed effective communication objectives that recognized the importance of people. Constant with this assurance, a philosophical emphasis on relationships linking the clients and their forklift dealers was cultivated.\n\nThe industry’s objectives went far beyond the traditional transactional client-dealer relationship.And the concern wafted towards a more partnership oriented relationship. This approach facilitated the expansion of diverse products allied to forklift marketing concepts. Hence, industrial analysts assert that this boosted the industry’s position and brand equities globally.\n\nAs measured by world total production, the forklift industry presented mixed reactions in regard to the period covering 2001-to-2010. Compared to other similar industrial players, forklift manufacturers occupy 10% of global industrial ratio. This is in relation to size. Regarding its market ratings the industry has since 2001 grown progressively with over 42% annual rate positing over $566.3billions profit annually (OAS 2010, Bhagwati 2009). During this period the forklift industry has been widely described as moderately competitive.\n\nHowever, global economic challenges, trade restriction, protectionism, and near monopoly trade practices affected its total production. Hence, Little, et al (2005) described the industries performance as either moderate, or subdued. This indicates that the nature and terms forklift industry considerably diversified in both designs and manufacturers preferences.\n\nAs testified by Caterpillar Inc. Komatsu, Cummins Inc.Deere and Company (Deere), Volvo Group AB and CNH Global NV (CNH) the demand for forklifts was on decline. From 2004-2007 the industry registered 1.1% growth (OAS 2010). The claim is reinforced by Komatsu group testimony that the demand for forklifts had considerably gone down by the end of 2007.\n\nThe group notes that from 2004 the demand for forklifts went down by 1.9 % but in the second half of 2008 the demand rose to 4.4 % (Bhagwati 2009). The growth was expected to boost the anticipated sales in the coming financial years. Most forklift manufacturers have different sets of allied products which go beyond industrial machines.\n\nAs is testified by Caterpillar a leading forklift manufacturer, the organizations sells, services and also rents equipments linked to engines, electronic as well as turbines. Examining the extent of product pricing in the industry, Caterpillar had one of the best pricing policies when compared to Komatsu, Cummins Inc.Deere and Company (Deere), Volvo Group AB and CNH Global NV (CNH).\n\nAccording to Bhagwati, the company had sold over 2million units, while the nearest rival Komatsu had sold 0.8million units globally within 2001 to 2009 periods (2009).\n\nThe success of this company was linked to its well formulated legacy of rental scheme. The arrangement allowed its clients to use the company’s machinery without financial commitment of purchasing the rented unit. Also the company had a program allied to rent-to-own preference.\n\nLooking at the current financial trend the forklift industry has over the last one year shown concentrated growth in comparison to 2009. The Machinery and Engine analysts noted that the forklift industry generated an approximate of 407.7 billion as EBIDTA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) in 2001-2009. This was a 63% increment compared to 2001-2007 financial period. However, as shown by Caterpillars Inc and Volvo Group the industry growth level was considerably low by 2008, the growth rate was progressing at 0.21% annually (Bhagwati 2009).\n\nDetermining Changes in globalization\n\nForklift industry over the period of ten years witnessed a number of changes that compactly influenced unit productions. It ought to be noted that each manufacturer had dynamic procedures of determining market positioning. This is also reflected on the manner manufacturers approached and treated the anticipated consumers.\n\nAnd this was demonstrated by the growing rivalry between Caterpillar, Komatsu, Cummins Inc. Deere and Company (Deere), Volvo Group AB and CNH Global NV (CNH). The emerging global changes witnessed during this period present a candid view. The consumption of heavy machinery such as forklift was heading towards uncertain future particularly for those companies and brands without a strong market base.\n\nWorld trade volume\n\nAccording the projections provided by National Association for Business Economics, 70% of forklift manufacturers were facing stiff market restrictions. While 10% were under threat of involuntary acquisition. Too, 20% of the expected consumers are had cut their spending heavily affecting the industry’s net income globally (Bhagwati 2009). This is as shown by the association survey conducted from 2002-2009.\n\nThe observation is also reinforced by Material Handling Industry in Africa which asserts that globalization was slowing the growth and expansion of forklift industry considerably (Krueger 2004). The scope of globalization influenced market segmentation, product promotion, and capital distribution within the industry. As witnessed in the leading forklift producers, globalization tilted the marketing and production strategies considerably.\n\nThe shift in production was necessitated by market demands. For instance Caterpillar Inc. was compelled to develop electric powered forklifts within a span of five years (McMillan 2001). The move from IC powered equipment was necessitated by competition from rival forklift manufacturers.\n\nHence, the changes in globalization as seen in forklift industry were correlated to bargaining power of material suppliers, threat posed by new entrants, extreme rivalry among manufacturers, and threat of alternative products.\n\nThese factors played a central role in determining the world trade volume in regard to forklift production. The onset of 2001 saw the demand for material handling equipments soar. This contributed to the increase in the global demand for forklifts which was accountable for 2.0% of world trade volume as per 2004.\n\nThe strong demand for IC counter balanced the need for forklifts with dynamic load bearing capacity. Hence, in 2001 Komatsu group produced over 3000 units, while Deere manufactured 10,000 units. However, Caterpillar Inc. in the same year produced over 55000 units.\n\nThese figures show the impacts of globalization in the industry (OAS 2010). The extent of globalization forced many countries to embrace SAPs (structural adjustment programs), in which industrial liberalization was slapped with increased tariffs. These features contributed to immense competition which displaced some of the producers from the market.\n\nThe restricted exports and low priority on forklift industry contributed to the industry decimal world trade attained in the year 2004 and 2007. Basically, this shows that between 2001 and 2010 this industry incurred less gains points. This is testified by world gross product in regard to world trade volume revolving around 8 and 28% witnessed in 2008 and 2009 (Bhagwati 2009). This resulted in a sharp drop in sales which reached 40% in 2009 (Bhagwati 2009). Also the sales of forklift in Africa, Asia, Europe, and America plummeted.\n\nIntra-industry trade\n\nThe sharp increase in IIT from the early 2004 to 2010 was linked to the outward oriented agenda in this industry. Industry level examination shows that forklift was experiencing a lethal fall in protection due to its higher degree of IIT. More so, an increment in IIT suggested that adjustment expenses linked to industry liberalization were technically low. As the forklift industry indicates product differentiation as well as scale economies were influenced by intra-industry variations including IIT.\n\nHowever, R&D had no direct impact on IIT in relation to forklift industry. For instance, simultaneous imports and exports within this industry were found to be instances of IIT. As exposed by both patterns and market determinants IIT affected the industry’s productivity globally.\n\nHence, Forklift industry has over the years witnessed a number of changes due to the influence of IIT and globalization. Some of these changes are a result of either seamless exports or imports. As witnessed in the case of Caterpillar, most global nations are importing more of this group product that is its flagship brand CAT. Other than exploring the degree of determining transformations due to globalization, the range of intra-industry trade developed to be a global economic issue.\n\nConsider the fact that from the wake of 2001 to the year 2010 the global market in regard to material handling equipment had gone up. The prominence of Caterpillar Inc and Komatsu explains the scope of IIT globally. This affected the extent of trade in terms of both exports and imports. What this testified is that IIT had transformed to be a fundamental pillar in as far forklift industry was concerned.\n\nAccording to the industry analysts intra-industry trade helped to sustain strong economic ties between the major forklift producers from the mid 2002.\n\nThis was fueled by rapid dismantling of trade and investment barriers around the world. More so, seamless structural changes necessitated the need for these policy changes. The impacts of intra-industry trade were felt in mid 2009 after it emerged that majority of the industry players were manufacturing dissimilar varieties of the analogous product. This resulted in low demand levels due to consumer preferences.\n\nWorld Industry Trade Barriers as measured by the MFN (Most Favored Nation)\n\nFrom 2001to 2010 the forklift industry encountered numerous challenges. These challenges involved market division and stiff regulatory measures. As was noted from Africa, India, China, and Australia the instances of trade barriers, tariff quotas and export restrictions compelled principal forklift industry stakeholders to operate on losses.\n\nHowever, some of the leading industry players like Caterpillar Inc opted to sustain the scope of open trading scheme which is employed by most countries today. Though, the tariffs in regard to this industry were at all times high. What this shows is that tariffs were employed as instruments exploited to guard domestic industries. This scope was evident in forklift manufacturing countries as china, USA, Korea, Japan and UK.\n\nFrom a global perspective this approach was employed as parameter of guarding this industry as a principal source of income in some quarters. Globally, tariff structures have since 2002 encountered seamless simplification. Applied MFN tariff ratios have persistently moved upwards, from a global unweighted standard of 7.5 % in 2001 to approximate 10% in 2008 and was expected to soar up to 11.5% in 2009 (OAS 2010; Bhagwati 2009).\n\nThis is allied to the industrial tariffs which stood at 12.3% and 11.00% in 2008 (OAS 2010). Comparing this industry with other competitive sector, the escalating tariffs were seen to be incoherent with the stated objectives of most governments allied to the gradual reductions on tariffs linked to forklift industry. This scope affected the forklift manufacturers who were manufacturing other equipments unrelated to material handling sector.\n\nThis saw such forklift manufacturers as Komatsu, Cummins Inc.Deere and Company (Deere), Volvo Group AB and CNH Global NV (CNH) cutting their production. These cuts were as a result of import licensing, trade quotas, export subsidies as well as voluntary export limitations. Typically, tariffs are taxes that increase the cost of any imported product.hence, the extent of tariffs, trade barriers, and trade restrictions were against the scope of MFN.\n\nAs indicated by industry’s market trends WITB worked against the growth of forklift industry. For instance, EU member states trading in forklifts enjoyed lower customs duties while discriminating against third world countries such as Ghana, Kenya, and India. As demonstrated by WTO and GATT from 2001 to 2010 there were no specific rates tied to forklift industry. However, different countries had their own approach to this issue.\n\nThis is due to the fact that the tariff issues have played a central role in causing division among diverse trading partners. For instance, the product requirements for Africa were less diversified than those intended for Asian, European or American markets. Also the product specification for either China or India differed considerably with what exported in either Kenya or Ethiopia.\n\nThus, in as far as this industry is concerned product variation was determined by the market. And this was against the principal tenets of WITB as defined under MFN and GATT. Consider the table below in regard to scope of tariffs as established from 2001 to 2010.\n\n                      Before  After\nDeveloped countries   70      99   \nDeveloping countries  13      73   \nTransition economies  70      98   \n\n\n(These %s are not correlated to trade density or value, they are major global tariff lines: source: OAS 2010)\n\nFactors affecting Forklift industry\n\nBoth internal and external factors play a central role in determining the scope or destiny of any given industry. The extent of forklift industry in general and in particular in Africa has been considerably affected by political factors. It ought to be noted that Africa is one of the richest continent in terms of natural resources.\n\nHowever, political instability has played a critical role in destabilizing the manufacturing industry. Democratic republic of Congo, for instance, is one of the major consumers of Komatsu products a leading forklift manufacturer. In the wake of 2003 the group anticipated opening an assemblage branch in this region so as to serve their clients effectively.\n\nHowever, their plans were aborted after the country exploded in a range of civil war. It is apparent that almost all industries do in one way or the other experiences seamless cycles of economic instability. Some of these factors have played a principal in regard to development of forklift industry.\n\nFor instance, global news, war, consumer preferences, even such unrelated circumstances as earthquakes, epidemics, and overall health of the market tilts the industry position globally. Thus, economic events also revolve within the scope of inflation which is commonly related to political instability. What should be noted is that some of the core markets for forklifts are in developing countries like Kenya, South Africa, Ghana, Pakistan and India (Little, et al 2005).\n\nHowever, the happenings which have engulfed some of these regions propelled most of the industry players to relocate. Some of these events are like 2007 post election violence in Kenya. The said events affected forklift sales in east Africa. While in South Africa Komatsu group had a massive profit margin in due to the world cup.\n\nHowever, the scope of political instability in some of the regions such as Zimbabwe, Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan saw the forklift industry leaning towards the development of military and commercial oriented products. These observations indicate that political events do compel the industry players to seek venues which are less prone to risk.\n\nThus, from 2001 to 2010 the forklift industry in all its spheres had experienced harsh economic events. As is evidenced by high tax rates in some of the regions such as the Caribbean’s and in particular Venezuela. This has compactly impacted on the growth of this industry. However, these challenges have contributed to the creation of economy class forklifts which are marketed in those areas which are hostile and interest rates are either high or falling. When the interest rates are high the markets are typically crippled (IDB 1996).\n\nConcerning technological events that have shaped or affected this industry it can be argued that diverse players have injected new life into forklift industry. This can be allied to the manner and nature of different models being released into the market. The entry of new companies has over the years since 2001 reshaped the industry and making the competition even stiffer.\n\nThis resulted in the manufacture of user friendly machines with diverse attributes which made these products to be all time attractive. Also governmental involvement or intervention can be attributed to the manner the forklift industry behaves in some regions. It ought to be noted that almost all major industries are controlled or regulated by the government.\n\nThis is testified by the role of government agencies such as Environmental Protection Agency in US. And due to the nature of forklift industry it is heavily regulated in such countries as china, South Korea and UK and this for the last ten years have weakened this sector.\n\nOther events affecting the historical development of forklift industry relates to stability including predictability. Note that political institutions are mandated with generating what is perceived to be dynamic stability as well as separation of diverse powers among them being checks and balances of all executive authorities. Thus, from such observation, the wake of 2001-2010 saw the unsteady progression of this industry amid instable global economics.\n\nThe top 5 global firms\n\nMarket dominance as well as global sales is some of the principal pointers that determine the position of any industry on the global scale. It is from such observation we note that the forklift industry has a number of key players who have stayed in the market for years while others are recent entrants.\n\nIn regard to concentration ratio we are examining five top most firms. This would entail examining the proposition of the total output in the forklift industry generated by the five principal players in the industry. The scope of this approach is to determine the degree of the given firm in regard to market control to which a company may be classified as monopolistic or oligopolistic. This method would thus entail calculating the concentration ratio based on the market shares of the leading firm in the industry\n\nThe concentration ratio can be articulated as:\n\nCR m = s 1 + s 2 + s 3 +…… + s m\n\nwhere s i = market share of the i th firm.\n\nThe table 1 presents the 10 years sales of the top five forklift manufacturers globally\n\nForklift industry\n\nThe above table demonstrates that the forklift industry sales were over $ 16,000million for the period of 2001-to-2010.\n\nThe concentration ratio in this case can be either calculated using one of the principal identical procedures. The first procedure is to add up total sales of the top firms in the industry, then dividing the sum with the total. On the other hand, the market shares of the top companies can calculated separately or individually, then summed. According to the above calculations the measures indicates that the forklift industry falls within the premise of medium concentration. What this demonstrates is that concentration ratio doesn’t give details pertaining to market competition rather it provide an indication in relation to industry market nature.\n\nThe Herfindahl index is employed to measure or determine any given industry concentration ratio. The standard formula for calculating Herfindahl index is:\n\nHI= (Share 1)^2 + (Share 2)^2 + (Share 3)^2 +… + (Share n)^2\n\nThis method is commonly employed to measure any industry concentration. in addition, by inference, the level of market control. While there are no Supremes (absolutes) when one attempts to evaluate the concentration, common degrees as well as the corresponding HI values are typically presented\n\nConcentration levels\n\nLevel   concentration ratio  Herfindahl Index\nHigh    80% to 100%          1800-10,000     \nMedium  50% to 80%           1000-1800       \nLow     0%to50%              0-1000          \n\n\nHerfindahl index for the top 5 firms\n\nThe above observations (See table 2) illustrates that the industry concentration has not changed much. However, as is testified by the topmost company the industry concentration has not trickled down to be defined as monopoly. Thus, in the course of 2001-to-2010 the industry has grown gradually with the market control being evenly distributed among the competitors.\n\nWhat this indicates is that companies with greater market values and shares maintained a greater market share. In regard to the industry concentration the anticipated changes can only be determined by exploring each individual firm market involvement and this cannot be determined through industry concentration (Krueger 2004).\n\nHowever, it is evident that even those companies with minimal market shares can have a profound impact on the market. Thus what this implies is that the instances of monopolistic rivalry within the forklift industry cannot take root despite the differences apparent within the industry concentration.\n\nMore so, over the period of 10 years it has emerged that each company had a significant percentage no matter how decimal it was that influenced the market. However, it is apparent that product differentiation as well as other variations of non-price competition gave the individual company’s some features leveled against monopolistic supremacy that highly competitive corporations didn’t have.\n\nThus, the scope of industry concentration was also etched within the scope of having a brand name as well as a packaging that was identifiable and was a symbol of authority in the market. As shown below by some of the key competitors (See table 3)\n\nIt is evident that the greater the company market dominance so as its concentration and profitability. What this demonstrates is that the competing organizations can in one way or the other join the growing market and equally make a credible monetary profit. However, as the above key competitors shows the industry concentration diminishes as more firms join the industry and more so this decreases the demand as consumers opts to shift their allegiance to other firms.\n\nGeographic concentration\n\nAs presented by the above information concerning both concentration ratio as well as Herfindahl index, it is apparent that geographic concentration played a central role in determining the nature and level of industry concentration. Diverse regions had different preferences in as far as material handling equipments were concerned.\n\nIt ought to be noted that geographic concentration in specific regions evolved to be near monopoly. This trend was necessitated by the market values and product presentation. Caterpillar Inc, for instance, had become the global standard for almost all forklift manufacturers.\n\nBe it in Africa, Asia, and china, America or the Caribbean’s, geographic concentration as presented by the firms examined offers candid insight into the industry requirements. It is evident that geographic concentration provided the opposite platform for the involved firms to examine their strengths, weakness, opportunities as well as threats (Bhagwati 2009).\n\nThis concept as presented from 2001 to 2010 illustrates that each and every company having a profound impact on the market regional exploited the scope of geographic concentration to capitalize on the weaknesses of the competing company. This is testified by the way Caterpillar enjoyed massive popularity in African market and this was made possible by its product awareness which was anchored within its geographic concentrations across the globe.\n\nAccording to the data gathered it is evident that forklift industry has unique and dynamic industry structure. The structure of the industry provides a considerable insight into the manner this industry runs or is operated by diverse global players. The structure of the forklift industry is essential in that it has over the years affected the both industry sellers and buyers.\n\nFrom 2001 to 2010 the industry structure has touched and influenced the profitability of such key industry players as Caterpillar, Volvo, and Komatsu. What this asserts is that forklift companies have over this period evolved to be more consolidated as manufacturing industries.\n\nThus, the concept of industry structure proved to be essential for both trade policy as well as public policy. And this helped in nurturing healthy competition within the forklift industry and more so making certain companies look more attractive while affecting the performances of others.\n\nBy exploring the forklift industry structure from 2001-to-2010 it is evident that the scope and extent of this industry has provided an essential window by which to understand the global attributes in regard to entry barriers, competition, rivalry as well as dynamics of competitive aspects in the industry.\n\nAnother instrumental feature is that over this duration forklift industry has proved to be a more attractive sector, despite its competition extent which is commonly found within either fragmented or consolidated industries (Bhagwati 2009).\n\nThe key driving forces in this industry and how conditions may change in the future\n\nThe major driving forces in this industry are allied to the concept of having the opposite tools and strong financial base. This can be allied to the fact that unlike any other general industry, forklift industry is classified under heavy industries which are closely monitored and this calls for apposite planning as well as production of high standard products.\n\nThis concept can be testified by the manner Caterpillar Inc has over the years managed to package and market itself globally. Thus the expansion of resources and investment in research, market orientation as well as motivation among the industry players can be said to be among the major driving forces in the industry.\n\nHaving credible product development procedures is another notable feature which has over the period been employed to boost performance and economic gains in the industry. Equally, maintaining balanced research as well as development spending has been a core driving factor that has helped this industry to maintain a stable profit margin and more so enhance its supplier and consumers collaboration.\n\nAnother significant feature is exhibited by Volvo Group AB which over the years have developed and progressed profound presences locally as well as in foreign markets by employing the indigenous staff so as to strengthen its ties with the locals as well as with the government and equally restricting the risk of severe government strategies (Rodrik 2002).\n\nOther major factors driving this industry includes mergers and acquisitions, the scope of this approach is to ascertain of a market niche in both existing and emerging markets both locally and internationally. And this is being achieved organically via expansions.\n\nHowever, due to the emerging market challenges being fueled by e-commerce the industry is facing diverse challenges which are either as a result of political influence or as the market dictates. As from 2001 to 2010, the industry has in some instances been faced with antitrust challenges especially in EU markets (OAU 2010).\n\nTo overcome competition laws which are being implemented by diverse economic blocks the players or the stakeholders in this industry have to change marketing and packaging strategies.\n\nIn essence, the scope of pricing distribution and promotion must be considered. As the world is moving towards formation of greater economic blocks as is being witnessed in Africa, Asia, the Caribbean’s and the entry of china in the forklift industry, only the best policies and effective implementation will make the industry to remain relevant and competitive.\n\nReferences\n\nBhagwati,J., 2009.

      "Conditioning Theory by B.F. Skinner Research Paper\n\nBrief Overview of the theory\n\nAccording to Skinner, operant conditioning is a form of conditioning that that influences the formation of personality (Skinner, 1948, p.23). In other words, it is a learning method where people’s behavior is changed with the introduction of different incentives and reinforcements. External factors should be considered in explaining the behavior of persons. Skinner looked at any active action or behavior that is bound to bring consequences as operant.\n\nReinforcement is one of the key components of operant conditioning. It refers to any event or aspect that serves to strengthen or bring a high likelihood of a certain behavior (Skinner, 1948). Positive reinforcement can be described as a favorable outcome which is realized after a certain behavior.\n\nFor example, when a person is rewarded after good behavior, then such is considered as positive reinforcement. Negative reinforcement is the exact opposite of positive reinforcement where there is removal of an unfavorable outcome and this response is reached by means of a certain behavior.\n\nPunishment is the other basic component of operant conditioning. This basically refers to presenting an outcome or event that is unfavorable which seeks to decrease a certain behavior (Skinner, 1948). Just like reinforcement, punishments are of two kinds and these are positive and negative punishment.\n\nPositive punishment simply involves doing something to prevent continuance of a particular behavior. Negative punishment on the other hand refers to removal of something with an aim of decreasing the tendency to behave in a particular manner.\n\nCritical Examination of the Theory: Strengths and Weaknesses\n\nWhen discussing the operant conditioning theory, it is of great importance to ensure that a line is drawn between this theory and conditioning theory also known as classical condition developed by Ivan Pavlov. One aspect that makes operant condition different and unique from other theories is the fact that this theory does not rely on thoughts, intentions, attitudes, or beliefs of people to predict or explain certain behavior. Instead, this theory concentrates solely on external factors such as the environment (Iversen, 1992, p. 1326).\n\nThis is however not to say that Skinner does not recognize or appreciate the existence of these external conditions. In comparison with Pavlov’s model, Skinner’s findings demonstrate a significantly rapid conditioning of a reaction that has not been drawn from the reinforcer. In other words, Skinner’s method is much more advanced and superior because the response intensive increases further whereas Pavlov’s method does not allow to do that.\n\nMany organizations have adopted this approach. They therefore look at external factors such as workplace environment to explain the behavior of employees at the workplace. For this reason, the management of an organization will always construe employees’ motivation as being a result of the good environment at the workplace.\n\nCommon behavior that is observed at the workplace tends to be more learned than reflexive and it becomes easy for the theory of operant condition to be made applicable. Employees tend to learn different behavior prior to joining the company and even after becoming part of the company. The stimuli that employees face upon joining a company can and does influence them to behave in a certain way.\n\nJust as is the case with other kinds of studies, the theory of operant conditioning has been subject to criticism as well as support. In the studies by Iversen (1992), much research has been on a comparative analysis of Skinner’s theory with other related frameworks.\n\nThe findings reveal that Skinner’s conditioning theory has a great number of implications for further exploration. In particular, the experiments conducted by the scientists have proved that a single reinforcement is enough for forming an operant behavior. While tracking the discoveries, Iversen (1992) manages to define the connection between all aspects of Skinner’s empirical observations.\n\nIn addition, the author of the studies has highlighted that fact that Skinner’s findings are closely correlated with the analysis of behavior, specifically its formation through successive approximation. From Iversen’s (1992) point of view, “…by systematically implementing and refining the method of shaping by successive approximation, Skinner soon served as a great promulgator of this useful technique to generate new or complex behavior from existing behavior” (p. 1325).\n\nIn whole, the presented study is a useful guide to existing theories of personality development and assessment. It provides an exhaustive overview of the concepts and term applied by Skinner to study personality. Therefore, Skinner’s work can be seen as fundamental in the field of learning theory development. It is also a great contribution to the development of psychology disciplines.\n\nDiscussing Skinner’s studies from behavioral focus, Delprato and Midgley (1992) have managed to consider all important aspects of operant behavior, including the scientist’s approach to psychology. Specifically, his influence and attempt to fill in the existing theoretical gaps and provide a more comprehensive view on behaviorism and personal development are certainly commendable. In the article, the researcher presents their own positing pursuant to certain issues and assumptions introduced by Skinner.\n\nFirst of all, Delprato and Midgley pay close attention to the scholar’s vision of scientific goals that did not recognize deductive methods, theory testing, and hypothetical assumptions. With particular reference to empirical data, Skinner introduced prediction and control as fundamental bases for defining the scientific relations. Second, while evaluating operant conditioning theory, one should notice an experimental nature of all evidence the scholar defined.\n\nAccording to Delprato and Midgley (1992), “the key point of Skinner’s methodology is the connection among experimental functional analysis, functional relations, and what he meant by controlling variables” (p. 1509). As a result, experimental design implies the creation of cause-and-effect relations between the object, but Skinner deviates from a strict observance to the pragmatic aspect.\n\nThird, the leading scholar in studying behaviorism believed that there are two ways of controlling behavior. The first involve inside impulses whereas the second examines the environment outside the organism (Delprato and Midgley, 1992, p. 1510). In other words, operant conditioning is premised on placing the focus of behavioral control in environmental events.\n\nFinally, while examining the main positions of operant behavior, the scholar largely focuses on the behavior itself, but on the variables affecting it. With regard to this, presence and absence of specific stimulus are analyzed only when highlighting the changes occurred to behavioral patterns (Delprato and Midgley, 1992, p. 1516). In whole, a multi-facet analysis of Skinner’s positions and assumption has contributed to a more comprehensive view on the researcher’s discoveries.\n\nSkinner’s theory of operant conditioning has come under serious criticism with mainly his procedures of experiment being questioned on the basis of validity. Other issues that have been raised regarding this theory are the assumptions that his theory has made especially concerning human nature. One of the causes of disagreement related to this theory involves the assumption that behavior is affected only by the external environment and never because of internal factors such as thoughts, beliefs, and attitudes.\n\nWhile approaching individual behavior from a limited angle, one ignores other important factors which clearly affect the manner in which individuals behave (Feist and Feist, 2008, p.12). The opponents of this theory have gone further to prove that the internal factors such as attitudes, ideas, and beliefs contribute significantly to the kind of behavior patterns exposed.\n\nThe other issue that has been raised by those who are opposed to this theory is the fact that much as it is based on scientific researches, Skinner made a lot of assumptions with only a few of his conclusions based on observation. More importantly, the majority of his assumptions have been applied to other disciplines and scientific field for practical purposes.\n\nPrecisely, Blackman and Pellon (1993) explain the contributions, Skinner’s operant issue has made to the sphere of psychopharmacology. Theory application has demonstrated the influence of a medication on behavior that become more dependent on schedule. Hence, environmental characteristics of behavior as well as main feature of the medication determine the conditioning of psychological and physiological systems.\n\nIn addition, the reinforcing effect of drugs as well as their stimulus properties should also be taken into account while evaluating operant conditioning. In this respect, Skinner’s theory has greatly contributed to renouncing an assumption that drugs have exclusively pharmacological effect on the state of the organism. In whole, Skinner’s non-reductionist theoretical approaches to behavior has made a tribute to the development of such a interdisciplinary science as behavioral pharmacology.\n\nClosing the discussion, there is yet another dilemma that has been raised regarding this theory. People do not always display certain behaviors as explained by this theory. Due to the fact that individuals realize that they will be rewarded for good behavior does not necessarily make them change their behavior.\n\nHowever, operant conditioning theory does not exclude the possibility of removing stimulus for eliminating behaviors that are not encouraged in specific situations. In this respect, it is possible to argue that behavior can be shaped irrespective of dependent variables involved into this process.\n\nRelationship between Operant conditioning and Personality Psychology\n\nPersonality psychology simply refers to study of human behavior. It involves an attempt to understand why someone has a certain kind of personality and what kind of personalities display certain behavior. Paying attention to the above discussion on operant condition theory developed by Skinner, it become apparent that this framework is closely related to the sphere of personality psychology.\n\nOperant conditioning looks at ways in which behavior of persons can be influenced and controlled so that people can behave in a desirable manner (Skinner, 1948, p.23).\n\nThis theory looks at reward and punishment as the two main ways in which behavior can be influenced. According to this theory, personalities of people can be altered or influenced by either offering reward or failing to do so. This theory therefore looks at personality as an aspect that is more dependent than independent.\n\nSkinner argues that the personality types are highly dependent on the external factors affecting a person such as the environment. In organization situation for instance, Skinner states that people who are hardworking will be those who are often commended for their hard work and great efforts and those who are rewarded often (Skinner, 1948). On the other hand, an employee who appears lazy at the work place is one whose efforts are hardly recognized.\n\nWhile investigating the connection between operant conditioning, it should be stressed that instrumental conditioning is another form of conditioning that affects personality. This kind of behavior is seen is a more active because individuals are assessed while interacting with environment. As a result, behavior and personality is shaped while gaining new experienced from the external environment.\n\nSkinner’s different types of reinforcement have allowed to control and manipulate behavior from the outside through the use of different stimulus. There is no doubt that personality formation and changes to behavior patterns are carried out through learning and practicing specific actions. From conceptual point of overview, personality change is carried out through systematic desensitization, aversion therapy, and counter-conditioning.\n\nAll the above-presented interventions are designed to elicit certain behaviors and impose new patterns. Judging from the above, Skinner’s theory of conditioning is a great contribute to the development of personality psychological because the scholars empirical observations and experimental designed have managed to introduced new concepts and approaches to learning and development.\n\nConclusion\n\nPsychologists have attempted to explain the reason behind certain behavior by human beings. Various theories, hypotheses and models have been developed all aimed at coming up with valid explanation regarding the same. One of the most popular theories that explain human behavior is the theory that was developed by B.F. Skinner who looks at behavior of people as traits that are shaped and influenced by what is happening around them.\n\nHaving laid his claims, Skinner then went ahead to carry out experiments and give illustrations and examples to prove the validity of his claims. Looking through the presented studies dedicated to the analysis of operant conditioning theory, it should be stressed that Skinner has made a significant contribution to the development of new disciplines and has triggered a great number of researches related to the analysis of personality psychology.\n\nIn this respect, there is no doubt that the relation between personality psychology and Skinner’s introduced framework is evidence because the experiments he presented were applicable to explaining some of the behavioral patterns of individuals.\n\nSystem of reinforcement and behavior formation has also been carefully considered by other scholars to define the necessity of introducing new learning theory. In addition, Skinner’s theory of operant behavior has given a basis for further discussions in such areas as pharmacology where much research has been done on the defining the connection between drugs taking and behavior transformation.\n\nTherefore, in light of the above discussion, in order to understand personality properly, one will need to look at different approaches carefully. A narrow way of explaining behavior of people may end up giving biased results because the factors that affect the manner in which people behave are multiple and multifaceted.\n\nSkinner’s approach to understanding behavior and personally is well grounded and empirically justified. His focus on experimental design and empirical researched proved to be a valuable addition to studying psychology of personality.\n\nReferences\n\nBlackman, D. E., & Pellon, R. R. (1993).

      "The Religious and Political Views of the Epic Poem Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Religious Views of Paradise Lost and\n 3. Political Views of Paradise Lost\n 4. Conclusion\n 5. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe poem Paradise Lost by Milton is a piece of art that has been coined wonderfully to pass both political and religious messages. The name Paradise Lost was carefully chosen as a summary of what Milton was talking about in the entire book. According to Sander (64), the way Milton has used diction in this poem, and the way themes come out shows a high level of expertise in this field. The book brings out the historic nature of the creation of mankind.\n\nWhen man was created, he was supposed to live in heaven with God. He was supposed to enjoy a life free from any toil, pain, death or any other form of suffering. This was what God intended for man. This poem brings this message in a careful and very interesting manner. The poem brings out the cunning nature of Satan. Determined to compete with the power of God, Satan comes out to put a challenge to God. He uses a special creature of God, the mankind.\n\nParadise Lost skillfully knits religion and politics into one large garment. As Storr (84) observes, Milton has successfully brought together politics and religion into one plate. He has managed to demonstrate that the two are very closely connected. In this poem, it would be easy to see how religion and politics are closely related. From the perspective of Sander (86), some of the facts that are brought out in this poem can either be considered as political or religious.\n\nDepending on the approach one takes in the analysis, major themes may be categorized into the two topics. As this scholar puts it, when the poem is given to a political scientist, he shall see politics on the other hand. On the other hand, when this work is given to a student of religion, he shall see a lot of religious facts. This poem is focused on analyzing the poem Paradise Lost from both the religious and political standpoints.\n\nReligious Views of Paradise Lost and\n\nThe poem ‘Paradise Lost’ strikes as a religious poem. John Milton brings out the kingdom of God before the fall of man, the process where man fell off with God, and how he was finally sent from Garden of Eden. As Milton says, man was a special creature of God. God considered man a special creature as compared to other creatures.\n\nAs such, he was given freedom to rule over other creatures of God. He was given power to eat of all the fruits that were in the Garden of Eden extract the fruit of knowledge. God provided man with everything in the garden. He offered man immortality and every other thing that he would need while in the palace. According to Milton (117), besides any other reason that may exist, one of the reasons why God gave Adam and Eve the instruction not to eat from the fruit was to ensure that mankind obeyed him.\n\nHe had created man and offered all that he might need in the Garden of Eden. However, after the rebellion of Satan and other angels who were loyal to him, God wanted to ensure that this special creature do not fall off his glory. He gave the instruction to man in order to ensure that he remained faithful to him. However, it unfortunately happened that Satan had plans against God, and against this special creature of God.\n\nSatan was disguised as a snake, came to Eve and convinced her to eat of the fruit. Milton (78) says that Satan knew that it would be difficult to trick Adam directly. He therefore, chose to use someone who had the capacity to get through to the heart of Adam, and that was Eve. Sure enough, Eve easily fell to Satan’s trick and ate the forbidden fruit. Consequently, Adam was convinced to eat from the fruit of knowledge as demonstrated in the poem.\n\nMilton says:\n\nOf Mans First Disobedience, and the Fruit\nOf that Forbidden Tree, whose mortal tast\nBrought Death into the World, and all our woe\nwith loss of Eden, till one greater Man (1.1.1-4)\n\nMilton says that the decision of man to eat from the fruit of life was disobedience. God had given man all the freedom he would have needed in this kingdom. He only left him with one instruction. The instruction was that he was not to eat from the fruit of knowledge. When man committed this sin, God considered it disobedience. Just like Satan who was his servant but rebelled, God considered man as a special creature who had rebelled against Him. Given his nature, God does not tolerate disobedience.\n\nHe banished Satan and all other rebellious angels to hell. Man also had to receive a similar treatment. Milton says that this sin brought death and woe to the world. Besides this, man was sent out of the Garden of Eden. Man, unlike Satan, was never given a heavier punishment of being banished to hell (Fromm 28).\n\nWhen Satan tricked man through Eve, he knew that God would banish man from paradise to hell. In hell, Satan knew that he would have control over the special creature of God. However, this was not to be. Unlike Satan who was keen to continue fighting God for the control of the heaven and earth, man realized that he had sinned. He humbled himself before God and told him that he appreciated the fact that his actions warranted punishment.\n\nHis reactions after sinning shows that man remained loyal to God. He was able to realize that Satan was evil minded and therefore, tricked them to eat from the forbidden fruit. His words and actions reaffirmed his trust and loyalty to God. Even after eating from the fruit of knowledge, man still realized that God was the creator, protector and provider. This was the reason why Satan was hiding from God. He had realized suddenly that they were naked.\n\nMilton says:\n\nSay first, for Heav’n hides nothing from thy view\nNor the deep Tract of Hell, say first what cause\nMov’d our Grand Parents in that happy State,\nFavour’d of Heav’n so highly, to fall off\nFrom thir Creator, and transgress his Will\nFor one restraint, Lords of the World besides? (2.1.27-32)\n\nUpon realizing that they were naked, Adam and Eve tried to hide their nakedness from God. However, God told them that under the sun, man could not hide anything from him. He had knowledge of every single activity that was taking place in the garden and any other place in the world. God had to punish man although he had admitted his sin. However, the punishment given was not as great as that which was given to the Satan.\n\nHe was not sent to hell. He was only sent from paradise where everything was given by God, to the earth where he was expected to toil in order to earn a living. He was sent from heaven where there were no deaths, diseases, sufferings and all other evils witnessed on earth. The life that was offered in heaven would never be seen to man again in all his life on earth. He had rebelled against God. He had listened to the enemy of God, and ate from the forbidden fruit.\n\nSander (37) says, “Adam and Eve lived a life in paradise where they lacked nothing. They were under the care of God who provided for all their needs till they sinned.” This scholar says that the glory of paradise was taken from man because of the sin. He was sent to earth where he would face evil power determined to destroy him. The animals that he named after their creation, and controlled when in paradise would turn against him, just like he turned against God.\n\nThe serpent, which was a harmless creature in paradise, was given ability to bite and kill man given the opportunity. However, God realized that man could not survive if left alone on earth. He therefore maintained his presence through his trusted angels who watched over man.\n\nMilton (56) says that although God sent man out of the garden, he kept a close eye on him to ensure that he was protected from any harm, especially from Satan and his forces. Milton says that following this sin, God considered man a rebellious creature. Because of this rebellion, the paradise was lost forever.\n\nWhen God created the law to Adam, it was supposed to make him know how he would rule over other creatures that had been bestowed under his watch. Forsyth (29) says that God never gives laws that are oppressive. God loved His creatures Adam and Eve. For this reason, He could not hide from them anything which was good for them. They were God’s favorite creatures. God gave them the garden where they would find everything they needed without any struggle.\n\nGod knew that eating from this fruit would harm them. This is proven when Adam and Eve struggled to hide their nakedness from God. All this time man and woman had been naked, but never realized. They never struggled to hide from God. However, this fruit brings shame, struggle and the need to run away from the presence of God. All these are sufferings that God wanted to save Adam from when he gave him the law.\n\nPolitical Views of Paradise Lost\n\nAccording to Sander (93), poems are always based on issues about the society. This scholar says that although poems are always fiction as the actions would take place in the mind of the author who will then transfer it into a written art, the actions are always based on facts on the society. Poets would use their skills to bring out specific information about the society in a special way. In this poem, Milton brings out how politics manifests itself in the society.\n\nThis is brought from the leadership perspective. In this poem, Milton brings in a case that demonstrates revolution from the leadership. When God created man and woman and placed them in the garden, they were supposed to obey the command given by God. Political perspective comes in when Satan challenges power of God. He convinces man to disobey God and challenge His authority.\n\nMilton says:\n\nWho first seduc’d them to that foul revolt?\nTh’ infernal Serpent; he it was, whose guile\nStird up with Envy and Revenge, deceiv’d\nThe Mother of Mankind, what time his Pride\nHad cast him out from Heav’n, with all his Host\nOf Rebel Angels, by whose aid aspiring\nTo set himself in Glory above his Peers,\nHe trusted to have equal’d the most High (2.1.33-40)\n\nIn this extract, two centers of power are shown to be fighting for control. As shown in this extract, Satan, through the serpent, was determined to win over Humankind because it was the most treasured creature of all. He seduced humankind to revolt against God. The extract shows that Satan had developed an empire by joining forces with other rebel angels.\n\nAccording to Milton (114), Satan formed a very strong kingdom where he was the ruler. In his kingdom, this scholar says that Satan made a great effort to ensure that he fought against the powers of God. He wanted to reign over the world. These two forces have been in constant battle. They are struggling to rule Humanity.\n\nFrom the extract, Satan was full of envy towards man, and the need to revenge. Man had been considered as the most precious creature that pleased God. By attacking him and making him part ways with God, Satan knew that he would be left to control mankind (Sander 86).\n\nThis scholar says that the mission of Satan was to separate man from God so that he would find his way between the two. By manipulating man to disobey God, Satan knew that mankind would be sent away from Heaven where God would offer full protection. However, by managing to separate them, he would have time to attack man with a lot of ease.\n\nAccording to Sander (86), in a political environment, powers will always clash while trying to determine which power is stronger. Two empires staying side by side will never be at peace until one exerts its authority and proves that it is stronger. In this poem, we are introduced to two kingdoms.\n\nThe first Kingdom is headed by God, and has all the angels that remained loyal to God. The second kingdom is headed by Satan, and has various followers who fell from the first kingdom. Satan himself was an angel under the leadership of God (Milton 73). These two kingdoms are fighting to gain control of the kingdom.\n\nMilton says:\n\nThat Glory never shall his wrath or might\nExtort from me. To bow and sue for grace\nWith suppliant knee, and deifie his power,\nWho from the terrour of this Arm so late\nDoubted his Empire, that were low indeed,\nThat were an ignominy and shame beneath\nThis downfall; since by Fate the strength of Gods\nAnd this Empyreal substance cannot fail, (3.1.110-117)\n\nFrom this extract, Milton appreciates the existence of the two kingdoms. He appreciates the fact that the two are very strong kingdoms, but with forces pulling in different directions. While God is determined to see a peaceful society, with humanity living within the freedom allowed, and obeying the rules given, Satan is determined to counter this. He challenges God and uses terror to counter the power of God. Milton finally appreciates the fact that God’s empire is actually beyond any failure.\n\nAccording to Forsyth (116), the war between God and Satan can be viewed from the political perspective. The argument of this scholar is in support of Milton’s Paradise Lost. This scholar says that when Satan was in the same kingdom in heaven under the leadership of God, he believed that the power of God could be challenged. He envied the power of God. This was despite the fact that he was one of the most trusted angels of God.\n\nHowever, he wanted to be like God. He wanted to experience how it would be as a leader of a given community. He wanted to create a territory where he would be the leader. For this reason, he rebelled from God. This rebellion did not come because God did something that Satan considered outrageous. It is only that Satan was yearning for power. He wanted to reign, just like God.\n\nStorr (56), in his review of the poem ‘Paradise Lost’, says that Milton presents a struggle for power in those early days. This scholar says that the paradise which was lost was actually the ability to enjoy the benefits of being in a superior kingdom.\n\nThis scholar further says that during those early days, the rulers based their ruling strategy on rod and stick. Those who obeyed the stronger power would enjoy the benefits that come with it such as staying in paradise where man would not be subjected to any labor and pain. This story clearly demonstrates that disobedience comes with consequences.\n\nMankind lost the paradise because of the failure to obey God. As such, he was made to suffer. According to Forsyth (47), the poem Paradise Lost is a narration of the events that took place in the Garden of Eden just before man was sent to earth. This scholar says that religion is about obedience. From religious perspective, people have the responsibility to ensure that they follow the laws and all the regulations put in place by God.\n\nWhen God made the first law and gave it to Adam, it was supposed to guide him within the Garden of Eden. These laws were not meant to oppress him. The law was not meant to make him foolish before other creatures in this Garden. Other than God and His angels, man was the most intelligent animal.\n\nHe was given power to control other creatures on the earth. Man lacked nothing within this garden, and was always under tight security. Just like in an earthly kingdom, this kingdom had laws. These laws always help in defining relationship between one man and another, and between man and nature. This is what this law given to Adam was meant for. The law was to help define the relationship that exists between man and nature, and with God.\n\nGod knew why the tree’s fruit was never to be eaten by man. Adam had all the reason to obey this law that was defining how he would relate to nature (Shaffer 57). This law was also a sign of how God wanted Adam to behave with Him. Disobeying this law was a disobedience to God who created the law. Just like in a kingdom, such a behavior could not go unpunished. Being banished from the Garden of Eden was the punishment given.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe epic poem ‘Paradise Lost’ by John Milton presents a story of how man came to fall off from paradise. The poem skillfully knits together religion and politics into one garment. Satan is seen determined to challenge the power of God. He fights God directly, but realizes that that is dangerous. He then chooses to fight God through His special creature, man. Again he realizes that man is very loyal to God, and would not disobey Him if he was to approach him.\n\nCanning as he was, Satan found his way into the Garden of Eden. He sneaks into this garden in the form of a snake. Using his oratory skills, Satan manages to convince Eve to eat from the forbidden fruit. Eve goes ahead to eat the fruit without realizing that this is an act of rebellion against God. She takes some to Adam who also eats this fruit of knowledge. They suddenly realize that they were naked, and hide their nakedness from God when they heard him enter the garden. As a result, man is sent to earth from the Garden of Eden.\n\nHe is relieved of all the privileges that he enjoyed while he was loyal to the kingdom of God. Now that he had listened to the Kingdom of Satan, he had to experience the suffering that comes with this kingdom. He was to toil in order to eat. He had to protect himself from wild animals in order to survive. He was assigned various tasks that were strenuous just because of this sin. Paradise was lost, and lost forever. He had to stay on earth with all its challenges. This is the message that this epic poem by John Milton brings out.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nForsyth, Holly.

      "A Response to the Dalits’ Way of Life in the 1950s as Told by Valmiki Essay\n\n“Joothan” is a Hindu book that details the life of a Dalit citizen. The book was first published in 1997 and then translated into the English language in 2003. Joothan is a Hindu word meaning food that is left on someone’s plate. The author of this book is Omprakash Valmiki who experienced the Dalit lifestyle when he was growing up. The author offers the truth about his life in this book. His closeness to the issue of discrimination is well reflected in the book. This paper will offer my response to the author’s heart-rending story.\n\nThe book offers incredible insight into the Hindu’s caste system. The author notes that not many books in the Hindu literature catalog can present the real truth about the caste system. Most of the authors who have written books on the caste system belong to the higher castes and their opinion is mostly biased (Valmiki 8).\n\nAfter reading this book, I was amazed by the author’s authority on the caste issue. The author’s heritage gives him a formidable advantage over authors who were brought up in a higher caste. The author is able to use his personal experiences to cement his arguments against the caste system. For instance, the author writes about the time he questioned a teacher about Hindu literature.\n\nIn the book, the author admits to being irked by the teacher’s insistence on Dronacharys’s poverty and that is why he questioned why no one was concerned with the Dalits. The Dalits were poorer than the Dronachary but no one seemed interested in their pain. This is one example why this book is a solid testimony of the Dalit’s way of life.\n\n“Joothan” is a book that affected my emotions in a major way. When I was reading the book, I sometimes found myself overwhelmed by emotions. The author’s tone and prose are able to transport the reader back to the Hindu’s way of life in the 1960s. The book has achieved the right balance between emotional narratives and commentaries on inequality.\n\nRight from the beginning, the author gets through to the reader by printing his most vivid childhood memories. For instance, he lists all the jobs he and his family were expected to do. These jobs included heart-breaking tasks such as sweeping the roads and cleaning toilets (Valmiki 23).\n\nThis book is supposed to be both a personal story and a tool of protest against the caste system. The author dwelt too much on his personal story and made the book look like a sympathy-seeking attempt. The author chose to dwell only on the negative aspects of his life.\n\nThe positive aspects of the story, like the story about the boys from the higher castes who befriended him, are not given much airtime. Instead, the author focuses on those who bullied and mistreated him (Valmiki 78). This is a sign of a bias opinion in the story and the author could have left a little room for counter opinions.\n\nThe book opened my eyes to how things can degenerate in silence. During the author’s time, castes were a way of life. This scenario had me thinking that indeed today’s way of life is part of tomorrow’s despicable evils. This is why it is important for citizens to evaluate the aspects of their life that may become tomorrow’s evils.\n\nRight now, some of us may be propagating an evil that might shock literature readers in future. There are still traces of the caste system in today’s Hindu society, but the battle has been long and weapons like “Joothan” have been very helpful.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nValmiki, Omprakash.

      "Disaster of Columbia shuttle Essay\n\nIn this chapter James Surowiecki describes the events that led to the Columbia shuttle disaster and explains the factors that contributed to this catastrophe. First of all, the author mentions that during the launch of Columbia a large piece of foam was broken off and smashed into the wing of the shuttle.\n\nThe thing is that that the members of the Mission Management Team (MMT) knew about this event, but they convinced themselves that it did not pose a significant threat to the crew. More importantly, the findings of the Debris Assessment Team (DAS) were not properly investigated. So, poor decision-making within the NASA led to the death of seven astronauts. In his book, James Surowiecki analyzes organizational factors that can explain unsatisfactory performance of the MMT team.\n\nFirst of all, people, who took part in this project, were extremely firm in their conviction that there had been no defects with Columbia. This is one of the reasons they rejected the request to take photographs of the shuttle in order to estimate the impact of the foam on the shuttle.\n\nThe problem is that they did not know much about the possible quality of these images. This is why they lacked evidence when analyzing the situation and evaluating risks. James Surowiecki believes that it is a form of confirmation bias when people choose to see that they want to see. Moreover, such situations exemplify such a phenomenon as groupthink. It occurs when separate individuals do not want to contradict the opinions of their superiors.\n\nFurthermore, James Surowiecki notes that when the member of the MMT team realized the extent of the threat, they came to the conclusion that nothing could have been done. Yet, after the investigation, it became clear that there could be at least two ways of rescuing the Columbia crew. These examples demonstrate that poor decision-making can have significant implications for people’s lives.\n\nApart from that, James Surowiecki argues that such organizational behavior can in part be explained by the culture of the NASA. In the past, this organization recruited people who had worked in various industries. It was more likely that they could have different views on the same question or problem.\n\nYet, nowadays, the employees come to the NASA mostly from graduate schools. Very often they may not be experienced in such discussions. In many cases, the employees may be reluctant to voice their disagreement with those people, who occupy a higher position in the workplace hierarchy.\n\nAdditionally, the writer attempts to explain the reasons why group discussions in organizations may not be very productive. In his opinion, some members of the team can dominate others, while the opinions of more reserved people can be overlooked. James Surowiecki refers to empirical studies demonstrating that teams are more likely to take better decisions than separate individuals, if team members can openly exchange ideas. The task of a leader is to ensure that communication within a group is not hindered in any way.\n\nJames Surowiecki emphasizes the necessity of looking at the same question or problem from different angles. More importantly, people should express these different views on during discussions or meetings. Only, in this way, organizations can avoid tragedies like the collapse of Columbia. The issues discussed by the author are relevant to many organizations that consist of many divisions or discussions.\n",
      "The Use of Near Field Communication in Business Essay\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. Architecture\n 3. Applications of NFC\n 4. Uses of NFC in business\n 5. Challenges Associated with NFC Use\n 6. Conclusion\n 7. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nNear field technology (NFC) is a form of technology that allows wireless communication between two devices over short distances. This form of communication usually involves a target and a reader. The distance between such devices is limited to just a few centimeters. For the process to occur, a reader needs to have a power source. On the other hand, the target does not necessarily need to have a power source. NFC technology is closely related to Radio –frequency identification technology.\n\nThese two technologies share similar standards. NFC’s standards are defined by the NFC forum that was initiated as a joint effort by Nokia, Phillips, and Sony corporations (Want 5). This technology is mostly used in smart phones and other similar devices. NFC technology uses tags that contain information that can be interpreted by NFC enabled devices. These tags are mostly small stickers that can be put on products or even documents.\n\nUse of NFC technology has increased around the world. In countries such as United States and China, NFC technology has been incorporated in various sectors of those economies. An example of such is the use of contactless mobile payment. It is for this reason that NFC has become a tool of interest for businesses around the globe. In 2011, the number of mobile users in the world was estimated to be five billion.\n\nThis number is still expected to rise in the next five years. The incorporation of NFC into mobile phones makes this technology a viable business tool. Henceforth, NFC can be used to serve and communicate with customers even in remote places. Recently, some mobile application developers in conjunction with mobile phone manufacturers have incorporated this technology into their devices. Phones like Samsung Galaxy, Nexus S, and Nokia C7 have this ability to scan and read passive tags.\n\nArchitecture\n\nNFC operates on three different interfaces. These are NFC-A, NFC-B, and NFC-F. Interfaces A and B are based on the ISO18092 standard. Type F operates on ISO-14433 standard. NFC operates under a protocol suite that has been defined by the NFC Forum.\n\nThis technology operates under the data link and physical layers of the OSI reference model. When a device is NFC enabled, it contains an interface for managing tags. Such a device can also create a tag as well as read one. A tag stored in one device can also be read by another NFC enabled device.\n\nApplications of NFC\n\nOne of the strong points of NFC technology is that one enabled device can accomplish various tasks using different applications. One of such applications is E-Passport. This where passports are equipped with a contactless smart card that incorporates a digital signature. The data stored in this chip is used for authentication purposes.\n\nAnother application is when making mobile payments. With NFC technology, it is possible to carry out cashless transactions. Cashless transactions are easy to document and track. This makes it easy to keep records. NFC can also act as a better alternative to the conventional barcode.\n\nThis has been one of the most popular applications of NFC yet. Barcodes have various shortcomings. For instance, they have to operate on a clear line of site. They are also easily obstructed by dirt. This makes NFC a viable replacement for barcodes. NFC does not necessarily require a clear line of site for its operation. For instance, this replacement has occurred during marathons where a competitor’s shoe is tagged in order to establish the start and stop times of the race.\n\nNFC technology is widely applied during sorting procedures. It is mainly preferred because it saves time and eliminates chances for errors. This sorting procedure is incorporated in hospitals, airports, and during sporting events.\n\nUses of NFC in business\n\nOne way in which businesses can make use of NFC is by turning it into an information-sharing tool. This ensures seamless transfer of files on demand. Lately, smart phones and tablets have been replacing computers. Most businesses prefer using hand-held devices as opposed to laptops and computers. This means this technology can be used to exchange ideas or even prepare for presentations.\n\nNFC is a tested and proven payment tool. Mobile payments are being preferred over card payments. This means businesses can use NFC to accept payments from clients. The vice-versa can also apply where businesses can use NFC to make payments. The main advantage of using NFC is because it incorporates robust security standards.\n\nIn addition, only a short distance is required for a transaction to occur between two NFC enabled devices. This is also an added advantage in terms of security. Some of the credit card companies that have incorporated this payment system in their regiment include PayPass and MasterCard. The latest Blackberry models can access applications that can work in tandem with these companies.\n\nOne of the more recent uses of NFC technology is in advertisements and promotions. This is where promotional campaigns are expected to be more interactive. For instance, using NFC it is possible to put a tag that enables targeted audience to respond instantly. This response may be concerning further information on the product or even general responses. An example of this is a tag put on an advertisement poster on the street.\n\nBy scanning such a tag, a prospective customer can be able to purchase a ticket instantly. The main advantage of using NFC in promotions and advertisements is because its response system is instant. Other methods of advertising offer unreliable avenues of gauging customer or user experiences. NFC can also help merchants rate the conversion rates of their campaigns.\n\nDisplaying product information is sometimes a tedious task for most businesses. Most product information is often displayed on the product. Some products lack adequate space for displaying this information. At other times, too much product information makes a product’s package unattractive.\n\nOther information can be concerning matters such as product improvement. In other scenarios, a company might want to clear up some controversies surrounding their products. These tags can also be included in important documents such as invoices. For instance, a tag in an invoice can offer a direct link to a payment mechanism. Some of these uses of NFC are opening up new frontiers for businesses. This is because most of them are providing businesses with a simplified way of conducting business.\n\nChallenges Associated with NFC Use\n\nCurrently, NFC use is one of the newest trends in business. This technology has also simplified various business applications. However, its use is also associated with various challenges. Some of these challenges are arising as NFC’s use progresses. One of the main challenges associated with NFC use in businesses is security.\n\nBecause NFC operates on a short-range distance, it is secure from a number of threats that are commonly associated with other communication technologies. However, NFC is still vulnerable to Eavesdropping, data-modification, and man in the middle attacks.\n\nEavesdropping refers to scenarios where unintended recipients can be able to read data through interception. This data is intercepted when it is moving from a sender to a receiver. In this attack, someone with a stronger modulation radio signal is able to retrieve a useable signal during the transaction. This attack can be prevented by ensuring that a chip that is storing data is in a passive device.\n\nAnother form of attack involves data modification. In this case, attackers are able to intercept and modify data before it reaches its destination. This attack can easily be prevented by putting strong authentication measures in place. Most payment systems ensure that there are strong authentication measures. Data can be modified in a number of ways including corruption and insertion.\n\nMan in the middle attack is a common threat to various communication applications. NFC is one of them. In this scenario, communication is intercepted by an attacker. The attacker then manipulates the system to simulate a private connection (Finkenzeller 34).\n\nThis attack is usually used to solicit information from unsuspecting users. This information can then be used to conduct fraudulent transactions. Due to the close proximity of devices using NFC, it is almost impossible to accomplish this attack. This attack can be mitigated by making sure that only one terminal has an active radio frequency during a transaction.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe rising number of hand-held device users is on the rise. This means it is imperative for businesses to embrace NFC. The technology has changed the consumer experience and benefited most businesses. Almost all hand held device manufacturers have incorporated this technology into their products. With time, this technology will dominate commercial activities. However, there are security threats associated with NFC that still need to be addressed.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nFinkenzeller, Klaus.

      "Management’s Definition Research Paper\n\nThe term management as often used in English is derived from the Italian word managgiare, which literally means to handle, the Latin word manus which means hand and lastly from the French word mesnagemen t which founded the modern day management. This brief explanation on the development of the term management is very crucial in coming up with an absolute definition of management in the scope of this study.\n\nThe term management can be defined as the articulate process in which any system systematically combines all its resources ranging from the financial to the human capital in the organization by effectively and efficiently coordinating them in a manner that guarantees that the cardinal objectives and goals of that particular system are achieved (Murugan, 2007).\n\nMintzberg, a renowned researcher and scholar in the field of management defined management roles as the specific managerial behaviors that are exhibited by managers in any system. It is evident from his work that this specific behaviors are articulated on a number of factors are include interpersonal relationship, transfer of information and lastly the decision making process of the organization. These three factors interlink around ten interrelated roles of the management (Dubrin, 2011).\n\nThe interpersonal role includes the leadership roles, the figurehead and the liaison roles. These roles involve the people in the organization and the ceremonial duties of the organization. The information managerial roles include the monitoring, disseminator and spokespersons roles and they are involved with the collection, receivership and the dissemination of information in the organization.\n\nLastly, the decisional roles that entail the choosing of an alternative over the others that is, making of a decision that is expected to benefit the organization. This facet of the managerial roles has the following sub-roles under its umbrella: entrepreneurial, negotiator, resource allocator and disturbance handler roles (Murugan, 2007).\n\nIn any kind of a system, management is paramount and this creates a similarity in the functions that are undertaken by management teams in the quest of ensuring that their organizations run smoothly. It is the goal of the management to ensure that organizations are working as a unit in pursuit of their goals and responsibilities in an organization.\n\nThe organization’s objectives are achieved via the planning, organizing, leading and controlling functions of the management. These functions are vital and none has precedence in its application over the other.\n\nThe planning function encompasses the generation and development of strategies or plans of action that are expected to affect the organization in the medium term or long-term.\n\nThis function of the management demands that the managers be aware of the environmental conditions that the organization is facing and from the observations made, it should be able to forecast the conditions that are in all probabilities are going to face it in the future and thus it is paramount that the managers be good decision makers (Shim & Siegel, 2009).\n\nThe organizing function of the management entails the development of organizational structures that run the organization and the allocation of duties to the organization’s human capital with the objective of attaining the objectives. The organizational structure that governs the organization is the framework that coordinates the efforts in the system. The leading function encompasses influencing the organization human resource towards the attainment of the organizational objectives.\n\nIt should be noted that an effective management should motivate its workers through effective and efficient communication processes by using the power and authority bestowed on it effectively. The controlling process of the management is involved with ascertaining that organizational performance in the production of goods and services is up to standard and it does not deviate from the set out processes or procedures (Dubrin, 2011).\n\nAn important tenet in analyzing management issues in the organization is the behavioral perspective that is exhibited by a faction of the organization employees. Behaviorism entails all things people do an organization do in response to the decisions that the organization management undertakes. It should be noted that at times, the employees could embrace or resist the decisions of the management (Murugan, 2007).\n\nThere exist a number of moral challenges that affect multinational companies or persons who are involved in doing business in different countries. This is because the expectations are projected on these businesses are staggeringly high.\n\nFor instance, in the developed countries, the moral expectations that are projected towards the business person or company are stringent, while in the third world countries, the expectations are quite lax thus creating room for the production realms of multinational companies to produce substandard goods in these countries.\n\nThe most major moral challenges that are faced by business people or multinational companies in doing business in different countries include: demand for bribes by authorities especially in the third world countries, influence from foreign countries to the host country and lastly exploitation of the host countries by the uncouth business people (Fieser, 2011).\n\nOperations management is a tenet of management that is mandated with overseeing the designing and subsequent revision of the designs that were adopted by management in the production of the goods and services in the organisation. This facet of the management is responsible for ascertaining that production processes of the organisation are effective and efficient. This is achievable by use of as little raw materials that are needed as possible, establishment and subsequent attainment of the customer requirements.\n\nIt is in this facet of organisation management that is held liable with approving the production processes that are employed by the organisation in converting inputs that are in form of raw materials such as lime used in the production of cement, the labour employed and lastly the energy required into outputs such as goods or services that are consumed by consumers (Shim & Siegel, 2009).\n\nThe term “team” has become a buzzword in many organizations in the recent past and this has arisen from the benefits that are being derived from the formation of teams. Teams have benefited individuals making them more effective in comparison to performance as isolated individuals.\n\nThe benefits that have been derived from teams include: teams have given all the team members the opportunity to attain new skills that enhance their capabilities to solve more complex issues in the future. Also, teams encompasses persons from different factions of the organization and therefore, enhance creativity thus ensuring that more ideas are generated leading to formulation of better solutions to problems that could be facing the organization.\n\nIt is evident that teams offer the team members a platform on which they can seek help if they need it (Midura & Glover, 2005). It should be noted that the benefits highlighted in this study are not conclusive, but depict a tip of all the benefits that are derived by the organization and the individuals from the team.\n\nReferences\n\nDubrin, A.

The relationship between free-riding and illegal immigrants\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Reference List\n\nIntroduction\n\nIn a situation where firms are operating in a free market economy, most business entrepreneurs will only be aiming at getting returns of their investments. Therefore some services and goods and services essential to the society will not be provided forcing the government to come in and provide them. Such goods are referred to as public and merit goods. Therefore, Public goods are commodities provided by the government in a free market economy because the private firms would not provide them (Cornes and Sandler, 1986, p.254).\n\nThe finance that the governments use to provide the public goods is obtained from taxation of citizens. The private firms refrain from providing them because of the mare reason that they cannot adequately charge them on the public. In addition if private firms in the market are left to provide public goods they will be inadequate and of low quality hence undesirable.\n\nSome Examples of public goods include; street lighting, national defence, national reserves and parks just to mention but a few. Public goods have two distinct features which make them fit in that class of public goods (Cornes and Sandler, 1986, p.272). They are non-excludable meaning that on provision it is not possible to bar people from using them. They are thus used by the general public whether they have paid or not paid for them. This consequently leads to the issue of free-riding.\n\nFree-riding means that everyone has access to such goods despite the fact that they have not paid for them. Free-riding occurs in the case of street lights, public roads, defence, natural scenery such as oceans and forests among others. This paper is therefore an in-depth analysis of the free riding concept and its relationship with illegal immigrants who are deemed to be the most free-riders in any nation.\n\nThe Free-rider problem\n\nAs mentioned above the free rider problem will exist when people enjoy the benefits of government-provided public or merit goods without paying for them, or pays less than their fair share, or they consume more than they paid.\n\nNot all the people who enjoy the public goods are taxpayers yet the government uses the taxpayer’s money to facilitate the provision of theses goods and services to the general public (Musgrave, 1995, p.1). The issue of free riding is inevitable in each and every country because of the presence of the presence of minors, tax evaders and illegal immigrants just to mention but a few.\n\nIllegal Immigrants and their impacts\n\nIllegal immigrants are people who enter the borders of a nation without proper immigration procedures and choose to remain in that country without permission. Such people are forced to run away from their countries because of political, religious issues as well as natural disasters.\n\nThe United States of America is one of the most preferred destinations for most illegal immigrants in the world because of its open border policy. As a matter of fact, the United States has procedures in its constitution that allow the presence of illegal immigrants in the country. Thus it is deemed to have the highest number of immigrants according to research done by the Department of Homeland Security where the population of illegal immigrant was 10.8 million in 2009 (Espenshade, 1995, p.195).\n\nIllegal immigrants in the United States of America have led to both negative and positive impacts in terms of economic and social status. For example, they have created problems of a bilingual society, drug trafficking, traffic congestion and the free-rider problem. However, illegal immigrants contribute greatly to the society by performing tasks that the civilised Americans would not perform such as the construction industry.\n\nThe relationship between free-riding and illegal immigrants\n\nIt has for a long period of time been believed that the free-rider problem is as a result of illegal immigrants. I do not agree with this theory because I believe that those who risk their lives to cross their border are in search for the fulfilment of the American dream and not to use the freely available resources.\n\nThe reason that these immigrants do not apply for U.S. citizenship is mainly because of their illegal entry (Espenshade, 1995, p.195). I presume that Most of these illegal immigrants are willing to become U.S. citizen and pay for taxes, and many of them are actually paying for income taxes.\n\nThe illegal immigrants enter the border for genuine reasons such as being safe and getting cheap employment to sustain their livelihoods. Thus assist in industries such as the construction, restaurants, truck driving, and masonry among others which heavily depend on the labour from illegal immigrants.\n\nIt has been noted that most of the employers prefer using labour from the illegal immigrants because they end up saving so much on the cost of wages. Therefore, despite the fact that these illegal immigrants do not pay taxes to enjoy the public goods and services, their contribution to the economy counterbalances the argument.\n\nTherefore the notion that that the illegal immigrants enter the country to enjoy the public utilities and should therefore be barred from accessing them is not appropriate. This is because recent research has indicated that about sixty seven percent of the illegal immigrant’s population in the United States actually pay taxes.\n\nIn actual sense, these immigrants have great contribution to the provision of social services, Medicare as well as payment of personal taxes. This makes it clear that despite their citizenship in the country, they play a great role of contributing to the revenue of the country. Given the aforementioned assertion, it would be against the human rights to deter the illegal immigrants from accessing the public utilities.\n\nThe issue of illegal immigrants as the free-riders is not worth causing any upheavals because the 1996 reforms on the Welfare Bill barred the illegal immigrants from accessing some of the public goods and services. “These include; Medicaid and Medicare, Housing assistance, Food stamps and Funded hospitalization” (Beck, 2001, p.98). The aforementioned services are only available to legal citizens of the United States of America.\n\nIn addition to this, illegal immigrants should not expect any form of assistance from even charitable organizations and churches. This is because provision of any form of assistance to them is against the law where the organization could face charges if found guilty of supporting an illegal immigrant. Thus, very few organisations and institutions would be willing to assist the illegal immigrants thus forcing them to work in order to survive.\n\nIn my opinion, most of illegal immigrants are genuine people who unlike some people view them are only in the country because of concrete reasons. This can be depicted when the US government warranted all the illegal immigrants to apply for social security numbers so as to pay taxes. Statistics collected after 1996, indicated that about seventy five percent of the illegal immigrants have social security numbers which they use to pay taxes from their little earnings (Beck, 2001, p.126).\n\nStatistics have at the same time depicted that the amount of tax collected from the illegal immigrants is much higher than the amount they use on public services. The surplus definitely goes to the government to perform other duties which would not even benefit the immigrants. This is an indication that the illegal immigrants are not in the country to just enjoy the public services offered by the government.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the above discussion it is clear that despite the fact that the illegal immigrants are a societal problem, their benefits outweigh their disadvantages. Those who accuse the illegal immigrants as increasing the problem of free-riders in the country are deemed to be wrong. As a matter of fact, the free-riding concept on illegal immigrants should only be accorded to the thirty three percent who do not pay the taxes.\n\nIt has been clearly seen that the larger percentage of the illegal immigrants are paying taxes from their meagre earnings in a bid to obeying the law. To add on this, is the fact that their tax contribution outweighs their consumption of the public goods and services hence a surplus to the government thus a contribution to the country’s economy.\n\nThey also contribute to the country’s economy by providing cheap labour in industries that the civilised Americans would not work such as in the construction industry among others. It can thus be concluded that illegal immigrants are not the cause of free-riding problem and nor is the free-riding issue a cause of the presence of illegal immigrants.\n\nReference List\n\nBeck, Rita.

Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nSteered by Terrence Malick, Days of Heaven is an affirmative piece of masterwork, set in the dawn of the twentieth century in America. Malick qualifies in presenting the then weird conditions of America that fueled economical change. The film sets in during a time when industrialization was on the rise.\n\nIt is a time when people were yearning for the long-awaited days: the days of heaven, when the world was to take a new shape of economy. Marxism theory underscores the theme of this movie that, social conflicts between the rich and the poor fueled the social change that America underwent along her the path to capitalism.\n\nEconomic Forces\n\nMalick successfully creates a picture of a society that bears two categories of people, powerful (the owners) and the powerless (the workers). Abby and her Boyfriend Bill exemplify the powerless class while the wealthy lonely owner of a wheat farm stands in for the powerful lot.\n\nThis follows since the two poor jobless lovers end up seeking refuge from the rich farmer. According to them, he is more powerful than they are. Worth noting is that the two groups of people are not depicted with equal attention. The powerless class draws lesser attention from the movie compared to the powerful.\n\nFor instance, Linda says “…we used to roam the streets. There were people suffering of pain and hunger. Some people their tongues were hanging’ out of their mouth” (Malick). These words are symbolic in that, they refer to the poor countries that end up in crises, only for the powerful countries like America to ignore their cries. However, when the reverse occurs, all of them must respond. I admire the Bourgeoisie because this group stays on top of the world watching the others serve under its commands.\n\nOn the other hand, the proletariat class is subject to sympathy because it has to struggle to cope up with the standards of the former group. In fact, Dirk asserts, “The foreman, riding in a buggy, chides everyone to work hard, while the owner sits in a padded chair in the middle of a field” (Para. 14).\n\nThe powerful people have their power because they own vast lands and are rich. However, they deny it to others in fear of competition as well as the fear of losing the work force, which they get from the powerless class. Malick symbolically shows a fight between Bill, a worker, and a wealth man to show that this power comes through violence.\n\nMaterialistic Values\n\nConcerning the then distribution of power and wealth,the 1916 setting of this movie tells it all. It pictures America as the only powerful and wealthy nation assuming the front line in World War I. The author provides sufficient evidence of conspicuous consumption.\n\nThe film is set in a time when electricity and expensive things were rare. ”…the owner sits in a padded chair in the middle of a field” (Dirk Para. 16). The workers, earning $3 a day cannot afford a padded chair; therefore, the owner only intents to show his wealth, hence a conspicuous consumption.\n\nThe society brought to light by the author value things to convey their social status and not their usefulness. The scenario between the farmer and the workers exemplifies the social value this society places on things as opposed to their usefulness. The farmer owns a gothic mansion but when the workers are tired of working in the wheat farms, they can only camp outside the star-lit night and not in the mansion. It is of no use to them.\n\nThe work done by the powerless lot is not a product of the culture that produces it. The taking by force of poor Bill’s girlfriend by the rich man symbolizes how the culture on study delights in things from elsewhere and not in its own products. Bill bases his decision to persuade his girlfriend to fall in love with the rich man on material rather than spiritual reasons. The two want to benefit economically from the wealthy man.\n\nClass Conflicts\n\nThe characters employed in the film picture two different social classes. There is the class of the poor workers like Bill, Abby, and Linda and that of the wealthy men like Robert Wilke, the rich rancher. The two classes are in a struggle with each other. Each class wants to develop itself economically.\n\nFor instance, Bill tells his girlfriend never to give up the fake love affair because he knows what he expects in return. “Just have to get fixed up first. Things are not always gonna be this way” (Malick). On the other hand, Abby feels oppressed following the advantage that the rich man makes out of her, which is no more than a manipulation of workers. It is worth noting that this bourgeoisie lot manipulates the less powerful through religion. For instance, Linda says, “Unless one is…saved by God’s mercy in heaven…” (Malick).\n\nThe powerful lot wants the less powerful people to think that it can save them if they serve it but Linda comes in to declare God as the only savior of humanity. There is a sufficient evidence of alienation and fragmentation in the film when the workers are warned not to enter in the owners’ houses. As the films unfolds, when Bill protests against the charges subjected to Abby because of her poor work, he fears being fired showing how the working class admits their powerlessness.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe Days of Heaven is a must-watch masterpiece for any person interested the economic history of the current powerful countries like America. People tend to think that the power that America boasts today came in overnight; however, Malick shows the struggles and conflicts Americans faced as the economy walked down the path to capitalism. It is an informative piece of composition.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nDirk, Tim. Days of Heaven Review, 2004. Web.\n\nMalick, Terrence, dir. Days of Heaven. Twentieth Century Fox, 1978. Film.\n",
      "“The Glass Menagerie” by Tennessee Williams: Play Analysis Term Paper\n\nIntroduction\n\nThe Glass Menagerie is a play that was written by Tennessee Williams and debuted in Chicago in 1944. It won a New York Drama Critics Award a year later. The Glass Menagerie propelled Williams to higher circles in the literary industry and established him as one of the most articulate playwrights in America.\n\nPlot\n\nThe Glass Menagerie has three major characters, Tom Wingfield, his mother, Amanda and his sister, Laura. Tom is an upcoming poet and works in a warehouse. His father abandoned them some years back and, apart from one postcard, has not communicated with the family since. Tom’s mother is from a genteel southern ancestry and frequently narrates the stories of her youth to her children and the number of suitors who wanted her. She is upset that her daughter, who is agonizingly shy, does not draw a similar number of suitors.\n\nAmanda takes her daughter to college hoping that she will have her own family and an occupation. However, she discovers that Laura’s extremely shy behavior has made her to drop out of college and spends her days roaming in the city all by herself. Laura’s only comfort seems to come from her music records and a set of small animal statuettes.\n\nTom hates his job and is dying to leave the family in order to have fun in the outside world, he frequently stays out late and claims to have been at the movies. In one of the disagreements with his mother, he unintentionally breaks Laura’s animal statuettes.\n\nAmanda tells Tom to find suitors for Laura at the workplace and Tom chooses Jim O’Connor, his friend, and asks him for dinner at their place. We learn that Jim went to the same school as Tom and Laura. Before Jim’s arrival, Laura makes Amanda to wear a new dress while she wears a beautiful gown to remind her of her youth.\n\nJim arrives and is let in by Laura, but she leaves, leaving the two men alone. Tom informs Jim that he used the electricity bill to join the merchant marine and intends to leave the family, Jim informs about his aspirations to become an executive. The lights go out as the characters are still having dinner and are forced to light candles. Amanda persuades Jim to entertain Laura as she and Tom clean up.\n\nLaura is initially too shy to converse with Jim, but his friendliness soon warms her up to him. She admits that she knew and developed a crush on Jim but was too shy to talk to him. They talk fondly about their schooldays for some time. Laura then decides to show Jim her favorite animal figurine, a unicorn, but he unintentionally knocks it and its horn breaks, making it resemble other horses. Shockingly, she forgives him and laughs off the occurrence. It is obvious she likes him. Eventually, Jim tells her,\n\n“Somebody needs to build your confidence up and make you proud instead of shy and turning away and—blushing—Somebody ought to—ought to—kiss you, Laura!” (Williams, scene 7). He kisses her but swiftly withdraws, apologizes, and mentions that he has a fiancée. Laura presents him with the broken animal as a memento.\n\nAs soon as Jim leaves, Amanda reprimands Tom for bringing home an engaged man for a suitor. Tom had not known that Jim had a fiancée. As they argue, Tom shouts:\n\n“The more you shout about my selfishness to me the quicker I’ll go, and I won’t go to the movies!” (Williams, scene 7).\n\nTom becomes the narrator at this moment as he was at the opening of the play and explains how he left his family and ran away, just as his father did. He spent many years journeying overseas, but something still bothered him: he is unable to forget the guilt that Laura placed on him.\n\nCharacterization\n\nTom Wingfield\n\nTom acts as the author’s mouthpiece in some scenes. He provides a separate explanation and evaluation of what is taking place. He also acts in the play. This duality in role makes Tom’s position confusing to the audience, as we do not know whether to trust the role he plays as a character in the play or that of being a narrator. However, The Glass Menagerie is partially an autobiography and Tom is Tennessee William’s mouthpiece, therefore we can learn of William’s experience in his own youth through Tom (Heintzelman & Howard, pp. 182).\n\nTom is full contradictions, on one hand he reads books, writes poems, and wishes he could escape the family and have adventure, but on the other hand, he appears to be inextricably attached to the nasty, paltry world of the Wingfield apartment. We know that he studies D. H. Lawrence’ works and tracks the politics of Europe, but we do not know his intellectual ability. Besides, we have no knowledge of the genre of his poetry. All we know is his thoughts on Laura, Amanda, and his job- exactly the things he wants to flee.\n\nTom’s position on his mother and sister is clearly puzzling. While he evidently cares for them, he is often unconcerned and even mean to them. His closing speech shows how strongly he feels for Laura, yet he abandoned her (Bloom, pp. 57).\n\nAmanda Wingfield\n\nAmanda has a hard time measuring up to her role as a single parent. She is frequently nagging Tom and refuses to recognize Laura’s shy behavior. She also reveals a readiness to sacrifice herself for her children. Fro example, she engages in the embarrassing labor of subscription sales to increase Laura’s chances of landing a suitor, she does it without ever complaining.\n\nSimilar to Laura and Tom, she pulls out of reality and engages in fantasy: she frequently tells her children of the number of suitors that came after her, and wishes the same for Laura. However, she feels she is not doing enough and involves outsiders. Her numerous monologues with her children plainly reveal her moral and psychological failures, but they are also some of the most vivid and memorable statements in the play.\n\nLaura Wingfield\n\nThe emotionally disabled Laura is the only character that never upsets anyone. Despite having a heavy burden, she demonstrates deep kindness and empathy: she sheds tears due to her brother’s unhappiness despite the egotistic and resentful acts that typify the Wingfield household (Williams, scene 4). She has the least role in the play among the Wingfields, yet everything in the play revolves around her. The major symbols in the play- blue roses, the glass unicorn, the complete glass menagerie- all seem to characterize her (Bloom, pp. 74).\n\nEveryone in the play sees Laura as one who can assume whatever role they wish, similar to a transparent glass that takes on any color going through it. Her mother uses her to stress how glamorous she was during her youth days while Jim and Tom view her as an exotic being, very different from others.\n\nThemes\n\nThe Impossibility of True Escape\n\nTom amuses his sister with the story of a magic show in which the magician escapes from a nailed coffin. He pictures his life at home and at the workplace as a confinement. The desire to escape haunts him throughout the play and in the end, he opts to free himself by running away from his mother and sister.\n\nThis escape haunts him wherever he goes and leads to questions of morality. How does an able-bodied young man leave his struggling mother and a sister behind for reasons only beneficial to himself? Leaving home is no true escape for him and no matter how far he wanders, memories of home still linger in his mind.\n\nDifficulty of Accepting Reality\n\nOne feature of characters in The Glass Menagerie is their difficulty in accepting the truth, especially Amanda. Laura’s keeps glass animal figurines- items that are fanciful and precariously fragile. Tom is a realist: he has a job and makes friends with other people, be eventually succumbs to fantasies written in books and the trance offered by alcohol, he runs away from home to seek adventure.\n\nAmanda’s relationship with reality is the most distant if the three: she desires to achieve financial and social success and wishes the same for her daughter. She cannot come to terms with the realities of life, for example, she refuses to accept that Tom is not an upcoming businessman, that Laura is unique, and that she might be to blame for some of her children’s failures (Heintzelman & Howard, pp. 257).\n\nWorks Cited\n\nBloom, Harold.

      "Advertising and Mass Awareness Research Paper\n\nTable of Contents\n 1. Introduction\n 2. The Past\n 3. The Present\n 4. The Future of Advertising\n 5. Conclusion\n 6. Works Cited\n\nIntroduction\n\nAdvertising can be defined as a kind of commercial mass communication intended to advance the sale of goods and services. It can as well be viewed as a message designed by an organization or an individual to encourage members of the public to adopt a certain policy (Louw 14).\n\nFrom the definition, it is eminent that advertising can be viewed from various viewpoints. However, the main aim of advertising is to increase a company’s sales of goods and services. Advertising is a common phenomenon in the contemporary world, having started many years ago when individuals wanted to improve the image of their organizations or their life styles.\n\nIn the 20 th century, advertising turned out to be a reliable source of expanding the operations of an organization, as well as increasing the popularity of individuals during campaigns. Some of the media such as newspapers, TV, mails, magazines and the internet became some of the important mediums used by organizations and political leaders to convince members of the public to endorse their ideologies.\n\nAdvertising has always been utilized to distribute information to consumers, even though it has both negative and positive impacts. Advertising can be used to persuade people to engage in unhealthy actions such as smoking or drinking, which are proved harmful to individual health.\n\nAs globalization was witnessed in the mid 20 th century, people had to advertise their goods, agendas and ideologies in order to match increasing competition in the world (Kleppner 23). During the Cold War, the two superpowers utilized advertising to convince the global public to accept their ideologies. Advertising has grown with time meaning that it keeps on changing.\n\nThe Past\n\nIn the 1950s, the advertising industry flourished owing to the availability of communication mediums such as TV sets, radio and many others. A single sponsor mainly funded many programs in the TV and Radios. People respected TV’s adverts after realizing that they could influence an individual’s choice of a product or idea.\n\nConsequently, the adverts that were previously considered cheap became expensive to an extent that only big corporations and prominent individuals would afford. Moreover, the lengths of adverts became shorter because there were many people wishing to advertise their goods and services via the same media.\n\nSince it was the main channel of advertising, various individuals purchased the TV sets in 1960s and 1970s in order to access important information from political leaders and businesspersons (Horkheimer 12). In 1980s, there were further developments when there were additional cable TV, which gave rise to ESPN, CNN and MTV. At this time, there were changes in the advertising industry whereby commercials turned out to be less real and fantastic (Habermas 31).\n\nCompanies went ahead to convince the public to consume their products or services without considering health concerns. For instance, the Coca-Cola Company encouraged people to consume its drinks without revealing the contents. Scholars at the time were keen to criticize the commercial adverts because people could consume substandard products only because they are advertised in the TV (Lears 54).\n\nSome believed that all products were the same, only that they are packaged differently to confuse the consumer. For instance, General Mills Company produced more than 65 different cereals. The company could advertise the products differently hence confusing the consumer to believe that the products are made differently, with different ingredients.\n\nCritics argued that commercial adverts only encouraged the public to consume goods and services according to the adverts. People believed that advertising could solve their consumption needs, which was a false perception (Achbar 21).\n\nThe Present\n\nIn the 21 st century, advertising is a big business because each company and corporate organization aims at promoting its image through advertising. In 2001 for instance, $18.6 billion were spent on TV advertising in the US alone (Cook 43). In 2002, the US agency on communication reported that $41 billion was spent on broadcast advertising (Graydon 45).\n\nThis shows how advertising has grown over the years to surpass the expectations of many. Currently, other forms of advertising such as the internet are slowly overtaking traditional forms of advertising such as TV and radio advertising.\n\nThis is mainly because of the change in technology whereby the consumer is believed to be using the internet frequently, as opposed to listening or watching the radio and the TV respectively. Digital signage is the main mass media owing to its capability to reach a huge number of consumers at a reduced fee. Furthermore, the company can easily track the progress and the effectiveness of the advert.\n\nDue to technology, it is possible in the contemporary world to control the information meant for consumers easily, which would enable the sender to reach the target at a convenient time. The supermarkets are successfully using digital signage to advertise their products.\n\nFurthermore, the use of World Wide Web is overtaking the use of traditional mediums of advertising. Individuals are using social sites such as Face book and Twitter during campaigns to popularize their political parties, as well as services. The sites are effective because they attract a large audience, especially the youths who are very important in any political process.\n\nThe Future of Advertising\n\nNiche Marketing whereby individuals would be targeting specific regions or audience, owing to increased competition and increased uncertainties in business, would characterize future advertising.\n\nThrough niche marketing, advertisers would be able to reach many people because this form of advertising would be targeting only a few individuals who would be showing potential interest to consume the goods or services of a particular company. In the past, the aim of many companies was to produce goods in mass and advertise the same goods to the entire public.\n\nThis system had several shortcomings because the advertiser would not track the usage of the good or service, the profiles of customers could not be established and it consumed many resources and time. Niche marketing is more efficient because it offers advertisers with a chance to define the market clearly. This would help them to come up with adverts that suit a particular market. In other words, niche marketing aims at changing the attitude of the consumer from being reactive to becoming proactive.\n\nIn future, research would determine the effectiveness of any commercial advert. For any company to attempt to advertise its goods or service, it would first conduct a pre-test research to establish its effectiveness. This would be aimed at reducing the costs because some goods and services might be advertised but their sales would not increase.\n\nThis is always considered a loss to a firm. From the above analysis, it is true that advertising has undergone various stages, depending on the development of technology. Advertising depends on technology meaning that it changes with the changes in technology. Before the internet age, the TV was the main medium of distributing information.\n\nConclusion\n\nFrom the above analysis, it can be concluded that advertising is an important aspect in human life since it contributes to improvement of living standards. Advertising is known for shaping the way people interact, as well as creating mass awareness. As far as its development is concerned, the earlier advertisement channel was mainly the television, radio and the newspaper.\n\nCurrently, advertisement depends on the internet as the major channel of passing information. Unlike in the past where producers of goods and services would produce in mass and advertisement later, the current producer targets specific markets based on advertisement response. In future, advertisement is projected to improve whereby producers would employ niche marketing.\n\nWorks Cited\n\nAchbar, Mark.

      "OKLAHOMA CITY -- All-Star point guard Russell Westbrook will have surgery to repair cartilage in his right knee and will be out indefinitely, dealing a harsh blow to the Oklahoma City Thunder's championship chances.\n\nGeneral manager Sam Presti said Friday the Thunder had not yet scheduled Westbrook's surgery and would not have an accurate timeline for his return until after the procedure was done. No one would rule out Westbrook's possible return if Oklahoma City keeps advancing in the playoffs, and All-Star teammate Kevin Durant only said his teammates \"hope\" Westbrook can play again this postseason.\n\n\"We're not trying to rush him or bring him back ahead of schedule.

Even the most hardcore of Moonies have a hard time trying to marathon through all 200 episodes. However if someone wants to get through the anime ASAP they can skip over the many filler episodes that plague it. These episodes tend to lean heavily on a formula and be entirely skip-able. So how do you know if an episode is a filler episode? Odds are that episode will follow this formula pretty closely.\n\n\nCrimson means you can skip it no matter what episode it is.\n\n\n★ The episode will start with a quick Episode Preview before the opening theme. Not all episodes do this depending on the episode director, so even filler episodes may start off with the the opening theme.\n\n★ Opening Theme will play and will end with the episode title.\n\n★ It won't be very long until a Character of the Day (CotD) is introduced to one or more of the main characters. This character has never been mentioned or shown before and will disappear as soon as this episode ends. (90% of the time they will have brown hair and brown eyes.)\n\n★ Activity of the Day (AotD) and/or a Problem of the Day (PotD) is established. This is brought up before, after, or right when the CotD is. This can be just about anything, ballet lessons, arguing with a friend, a new store opened, etc.\n\n★ CotD is targeted by the Baddies of the arc. They will be targeted in a rather generic way. They will have a beautiful dream or a pure heart or whatever and just the vague notion of one of those things is enough for the Baddies to rush in and attack them.\n\n★ Bumpers/Commercial Break\n\n★ The Baddies will set loose a Monster of the Day (MotD) to handle their dirty work, while whoever summoned the monster will hang out and will be very upset after their monster is inevitably defeated.\n\n★ CotD is attacked by the MotD and will almost never have what the Baddies were looking for.\n\n★ Now it's time for the fight scene of the episode which will be Sailor Senshi vs MotD. Especially grating episodes will pour on the stock footage at this point and will have the Sailors transform and attack one by one.\n\n★ MotD is defeated, CotD is saved. Any loose ends from the episode will be wrapped up quickly here.\n\n★ Ending Theme\n\n★ Next Episode Preview\n\n\n★ The episode will start with a quickbefore the opening theme.

Pro-tip 1: Filler is most likely to show up through the middle of a season, which may be why it's so hard for you to finish an arc.\n\n\nPro-Tip 2: My advice to anyone trying to marathon through the anime is don't. It's much better if you limit yourself to a few episodes a day if you can.",
      "Winnipeg MP Robert-Falcon Ouellette is withdrawing his name from the list of possible candidates for Speaker of the House after controversial remarks he made about the position.\n\nOn Saturday at a town hall meeting with his constituents, Ouellette explained why he thought running for the position was a good idea.\n\nMistakes have consequences, and I accept them. - Robert-Falcon Ouellette\n\n\"I've talked to other Speakers who have been in the position before,\" Ouellette said in the speech.\n\n\"They said, actually, it's a position of great influence because if I have an issue in my riding where I need some funds or I need something to happen ... I would call over the prime minister to my chair,\" he continued.\n\n\"This is what other Speakers have said and perhaps what people don't think about, but you can actually use that influence that you have in the House, because you do control the debate and the prime minister wants to keep you happy.\"\n\nRegrets remarks\n\n\"I suggested that the Speaker has the ability to call over a minister or the prime minister, I at no time intended to convey that there was any suggestion of quid pro quo,\" Oullette wrote in an apology he posted on Facebook Sunday.\n\nOuellette goes on to say that he regrets any impression his remarks gave of the role of the Speaker.\n\n\"While I never intended to imply anything other than that the Speaker, as MP, still has the capacity to bring constituents' concerns to the attention of government, I must take responsibility for my clumsiness in the way I expressed myself.\"\n\nThe newly-elected Winnipeg Centre MP also noted that in order for the government to move forward with a fresh start in Parliament, standards must be raised and he is \"no exception.\"\n\n\"Mistakes have consequences, and I accept them,\" he wrote.\n\nTwo hours after the post was published, there were more than 50 comments, many of which were supportive and positive.\n\n\"Wow, Robert.

You are a great person of good character and honest resolve,\" wrote Cherish Lynn Rose.\n\n\"Well, Robert, I will be speaking to our MP and strongly suggesting to him that he puts your name forward for the Speaker's position. I will also e-mail as many other MPs as I can asking them to do the same,\" read a comment written by Andrew Gilmour.\n\nOuellette refused to provide CBC Manitoba with a response to the comments he made at the town hall.\n\nMPs from across Canada will vote on their next speaker on Dec. 3.\n\nRobert-Falcon Ouellette's statement in full:\n\nWith heavy heart, I am withdrawing my name from consideration for the Speaker of the House of Commons.\n\nAt a Town Hall with my constituents, I suggested that the Speaker has the ability to call over a Minister or the Prime Minister, I at no time intended to convey that there was any suggestion of quid pro quo.\n\nI deeply regret any impression I gave of the Speaker's role.

      "Story highlights There have been scans and attempts that indicate hackers are trying to see where they can get in\n\nIn no cases was information changed, nor were any actual voting systems at risk, James Comey said\n\nWashington (CNN) — The FBI has discovered attempted hacks of voter registration sites in more than a dozen states according to two law enforcement officials. US investigators believe that Russia is behind those attempted hacks the officials said.\n\nEarlier Wednesday, FBI Director James Comey spoke of additional attempted hacks at a House Judiciary Committee hearing in Washington, but did not specify a number.\n\n\"There have been a variety of scanning activities which is a preamble for potential intrusion activities as well as some attempted intrusions at voter database registrations beyond those we knew about in July and August. We are urging the states just to make sure that their deadbolts are thrown and their locks are on and to get the best information they can from DHS just to make sure their systems are secure,\" he said.\n\nThe FBI director is telling states to make sure they are on top of their voter registration systems, saying would-be hackers are \"poking around.\"\n\nComey said while there haven't been any additional successful hacks, there have been scans and attempts that indicate \"bad actors\" are trying to see where they can get in, in response to questions about a warning the FBI sent to states in June, and two successful intrusions into voter registration databases in Illinois and Arizona.\n\nRead More\n\nIllinois election roll breach scaled down to 90,000 records In no cases was information changed, nor were any actual voting systems at risk. Comey reiterated to Congress that those actual voting systems are not connected to the Internet and are decentralized, making broad hacking of the election nearly impossible. Hacking attempts are also not a cause for panic. Voting registration databases have always been appealing targets for hackers, who can use personal information for financial crime. This cycle, there is a concern that Russian government-linked hackers are also looking to sow distrust in the US election system as a way to undermine Western power. Could a 400 lb couch potato have hacked the DNC? Without commenting on Russia's specific activity, Comey said the takeaway is for states to make sure they are secure. \"We are urging the states just to make sure that their deadbolts are thrown and their locks are on and to get the best information they can from (the Department of Homeland Security) just to make sure their systems are secure,\" Comey said. \"Because there's no doubt that some bad actors have been poking around.\" On Tuesday, Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson said 18 states have requested cyberassistance from his department for voting systems.\n\nCNN's Pamela Brown contributed to this report.",

      "Jessa Duggar, the 21 year old daughter of fundie parents with an obsession with popping out babies, has been touring museums to broaden her mind, I guess…or more likely, to practice a little motivated reasoning and rationalize her existing ignorance. She toured the Holocaust Museum and figured out what caused it: EVOLUTION.\n\nI walked through the Holocaust Museum again today, very sobering. Millions of innocents denied the most basic and fundamental of all rights–their right to life. One human destroying the life of another deemed 'less than human.' Racism, stemming from the evolutionary idea that man came from something less than human; that some people groups are 'more evolved' and others 'less evolved.' A denying that our Creator–GOD–made us human from the beginning, all of ONE BLOOD and ONE RACE, descendants of Adam. The belief that some human beings are 'not fit to live.'\n\nDo I really have to go through this again? Evolution, a theory first published in 1859. Racism, a symptom of human ignorance and tribalism, which has been around for millennia (it's in the Bible, even!). Cause and effect. It's pretty simple: the scientific theory of evolution can not possibly be causal to ideological views that existed prior to its existence.\n\nThe Bible does say we're all descended from one couple (we aren't, actually; that's scientifically demonstrable). But it also says that some of those descendants are marked with dark skin to be eternally servile. Christianity has not traditionally been an idea that supports universal egalitarianism.\n\nBut to say that after touring the Holocaust Museum — the Holocaust was propagated by good Lutherans and Catholics who had a centuries-long history of pogroms against the Jews. You're not going to find an explanation in The Origin of Species for that abomination.\n\nSo where could she possibly have gotten this idea that evolution caused the Holocaust and that the Bible did not promote slavery and genocide? That's easy. She toured the Creation \"Museum\" earlier, and that place is full of lies.\n\nIf there really was a worldwide flood (as the Bible speaks of), what would the evidence be? Billions of dead things buried in rock layers, laid down by water, all over the earth. And that's exactly what we find. Billions of dead things buried in rock layers, laid down by water, all over the earth. An Evolutionist and a Creationist will look at the same thing, but come to different conclusions because of their different starting points.\n\nWait. The theory of evolution also predicts lots of dead things buried in rocks, so this is not an adequate criterion for distinguishing the two hypotheses. We have to look for different predictions that we can verify with the evidence in the rocks. Here's one:\n\nEvolution predicts that the billions of dead things would be deposited in layers over many millions of years, and that different strata would contain different organisms representing a sample of the living things living at the time the rock was formed. Creation predicts that the billions of dead things would be primarily deposited in one catastrophic event, all buried in a swirling mess by one gigantic flood, so there would be no stratification of the different forms.\n\nGuess what the evidence shows? 1. Evolution wins.\n\nBut also, isn't it ironic to be deploring millions of dead in the Holocaust, blaming it falsely on evolution, while not deploring the many billions of dead, slaughtered in a great cataclysm, and not blaming it on God, the self-confessed mass murderer?\n\nWhatever you do, don't learn logic from the Duggars!",

      "Sharks in the Chesapeake Bay!\n\nThe most common shark species seen in the lower Bay during summer and fall is the sandbar shark. The Chesapeake is a nursery ground for them so most sandbar sharks seen here are juveniles. The young range from 2 to 3 feet in length and adults are up to 8 feet long. Sandbar sharks are dark gray above and white below. A ridge runs between the two dorsal fins. The bullnose shark is similar to the sandbar but lacks the ridge between the two dorsal fins. Although bullnose sharks can grow up to 12 feet, those visiting the Bay are usually less than 6 feet.\n\nTwo smaller sharks in the Bay are the smooth dogfish and spiny dogfish. Both species are only 2 to 3 feet long and travel in schools. The smooth dogfish is gray to brown in color and both dorsal fins are about the same size. Spiny dogfish is quickly recognized by the spine in front of each dorsal fin. For the most part, sandbar and dogfish sharks pose little, if any, danger to humans.\n\nSharks in the Chesapeake are found mostly in the lower Bay but some species do travel into the brackish water of the middle Bay.\n\nThe sandbar shark (Carcharhinus plumbeus), sometimes referred to as the thickskin shark, is the most common coastal shark in Virginia and is a routine visitor of the Chesapeake Bay during early spring and into late fall. This shark can be identified by a rounded snout, a large upright first dorsal fin, and by an interdorsal ridge. Color varies from bluish grey, brownish grey, to bronze with a paler or white underside. A rather stout shark ranging from about 4-6 ft. in length at maturity, the sandbar shark is considered large for a coastal shark. Related species include the dusky shark, the bignose shark and the bull shark.\n\nHaving a cosmopolitan distribution, sandbar sharks are found in tropical to temperate waters throughout the world. In North America it ranges from New England to the Florida Keys and is often found along the bottom in shallow coastal waters such as bays, estuaries, harbors, and river mouths. Every other year females bear an average of 9 pups in the summer. The sandbar shark has an annual migration cycle along North and South America. The adults form segregated schools (males and females) while the young form mixed-schools when leaving the nursery grounds.\n\nBeing a predator, the sandbar shark prefers fresh fish such as sardines, shad, menhaden anchovies, eels, barracuda, mackerel, groupers, croakers, flounders, skates, stingrays, squid, shrimp, crabs, mollusks and other smaller sharks. Although large, common in human swimming areas, and having adequate teeth, the sandbar shark has never been incriminated in a human attack.\n\nSandbar sharks do not have many natural enemies. Although pups are sometimes preyed upon by tiger sharks and adults by great whites, the most common and potentially dangerous predators are humans. Due to the fact that it takes 3 to 13 years for these sharks to mature and that they can only reproduce every other year, their populations can be easily over fished to dangerous low levels. Recreational fishing does little damage compared to commercial fisheries. These pose the greatest threat, trying to fulfill the demand for meat for human consumption, hides for leather, and livers for vitamin rich oils. Abundances of adolescent and adult sandbar sharks in Virginia have declined dramatically by nearly two-thirds, highlighting the need for effective fishing management.",

      "CLOSE In 2014, while working for the Inkster Police Department, Officer James Ture used his Taser on an apparent innocent bystander in a gas station while responding to a shots-fired call. An internal investigation later determined Ture used the Taser \"without justification or cause\" on the man, failed to report use of it and lied about the circumstances. Inkster fired Ture over the incident. Wochit\n\nIn this dashcam video from Inkster Police, officers are seen pulling Floyd Dent from his car. Dent was pummedled during the traffic stop. The assault of Dent eventually cost the impoverished community $1.4 million. (Photo: Inkster Police)\n\nAfter a Free Press investigation revealed lax oversight of problem officers in Michigan, a state senator has asked the agency overseeing licensing of police whether more can be done to address the issue.\n\nAnd he has offered to help with legislation to make changes happen, if any are recommended.\n\nAs well, the chair of the Michigan Commission on Law Enforcement Standards said late last week that the agency's board will discuss the issues reported in the investigation, published July 9.\n\nThe Free Press found that problem officers in Michigan landed new jobs, despite such issues as serious misconduct and criminal histories. Among the findings: police officers are sometimes given second chances despite alarming conduct; disciplinary records are sometimes shielded from release, and background checks, while routinely conducted, are not always effective at discouraging police departments from hiring problem officers.\n\n\"Those issues — unfortunately in the current system — there's no way the commission would ever know about them without self-reporting or reporting by the local department,\" said St. Clair County Prosecutor Michael Wendling, who is also the chairman of MCOLES.\n\n\"If they hire poor candidates or don't do background checks appropriately you have that potential to hire people that don't represent the community well.\"\n\nInvestigation: Disorderly Conduct: How problem cops stay on the street\n\nAbout this report: How we found problem cops\n\nWendling said the commission will take up a discussion of the Free Press findings. The board's next scheduled meeting is in September.\n\nState Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, said he reached out to the agency that oversees police licensing to offer legislative assistance. (Photo: Dave Wasinger, Lansing State Journal)\n\nState Sen. Rick Jones, R-Grand Ledge, said he reached out to MCOLES to offer legislative assistance to address the issue. Any future action would be in addition to a bill Jones — a former Eaton County sheriff — already proposed that is weaving its way through the Legislature. That bill would require police departments to maintain records on why officers leave and give the agencies immunity from civil liability.\n\nHermina Kramp, who is serving as acting executive director of MCOLES, said recently passed legislation — which added a handful of misdemeanors to the list of offenses that can lead to police license revocation — also gives the commission the ability to set detailed guidelines on what should be included in background investigations.\n\nStill, she said, MCOLES has no authority over decisions made by local departments.\n\n\"We don't have the ability to intervene and make the employment decision on behalf of them,\" Kramp said.\n\nThe Free Press found cases where agencies overlooked red flags and hired officers anyway. That included an officer who had a sexual relationship with a college student while on duty and one who used a Taser on his partner.\n\nDespite the slight gain in authority, Michigan is still weaker than 25 other states when it comes to decertifying officers, according to a national survey. In those states, law enforcement licenses can be revoked for misconduct that does not rise to the level of a criminal conviction. In Michigan, officers have to be convicted of a felony or those recently added misdemeanor crimes to have their police license revoked.\n\nWhile Wendling conceded the state does not know how many problem cops there are in Michigan, he said he believes the majority of officers are good ones committed to serving the public.\n\n\nHe said he expects the commission and state Legislature will discuss whether enough is being done to weed out problem officers. He said there are models in other states, where commissions like MCOLES have more power. If Michigan were to mirror some other states, it could require additional money to build an infrastructure to independently investigate police misconduct.\n\n\n\"Nobody wants a dangerous or unethical officer on the street,\" he said.\n\nThe Michigan Fraternal Order of Police issued a statement discounting the newspaper's findings. The organization pointed to the legislation proposed by Jones regarding departments keeping documentation of why officers leave, saying it will help protect officers and agencies.\n\nThe organization said it \"does not — and has never — supported bad cops. The FOP continues to work daily to protect the overwhelming number of good cops who protect our communities.\"\n\nThe issue of police-community relations caught the attention of Gov. Rick Snyder,",

      "Gallery Top Sips from Colorado Beer Week\n\nMore BEER! We love it. And you've voted. See which is the best American beer city.\n\nThe 3rd Annual Colorado Beer Week was held May 12-19 across the city of Denver, offering a plethora of choices for craft beer fans. Piggy-backing off of American Craft Beer Week, the goal of Colorado Beer Week is to \"host events that bring you great beer and educate everyone on the versatility of this tasty beverage\", says founder Scott Kerkmans.\n\nThe Opening Ceremonies at Highland Tap & Burger featured beer from 16 breweries, including a few rare surprises if you stuck around long enough. Throughout the rest of the week we visited several breweries and beer bars to take in as much as possible. Here are a few of our favorite sips.\n\nOskar Blues Brewery: Deviant Dale's This devilishly hopped IPA (85 IBUs) won a Silver Medal at the Great American Beer Festival in 2011. The perfect combination of citrusy hops and malty sweetness make it go down smooth despite it's 8.0% ABV.\n\nDenver Beer Company: Colorado Weiss This spontaneously fermented wheat ale is one of the latest brews from the guys at Denver Beer Co., who turn out new beers like they're going out of style. I went back twice for refills of this crisp, clean, and refreshing weiss beer.\n\nNew Belgium Brewing Company: Tart Lychee Definitely the most interesting beer we had all week, Tart Lychee is a great new sour offering from the guys who seriously know their sour beers at New Belgium. By itself, the lychee fruit is incredibly sweet, but it was transformed into something else entirely in this sour beer.\n\nDry Dock Brewing Company: Green Chili Double IPA Most people wouldn't think of adding green chili to their beer, but the brewers at Dry Dock aren't most people. As part of their Firkin Frenzy for Colorado Beer Week, they created this beautiful combination of hops and heat. The beer provided just enough spice on the back of the throat to make it interesting while staying drinkable.\n\nLeopold Bros. Maryland Rye Barrel-Aged Old Chub This beer is the perfect representation of Colorado Beer Week. Oskar Blues (Lyons, CO) Old Chub aged in Leopold Bros. (Aurora, CO) barrels created one of the most balanced and flavorful beers we've had in a long time.

A module using route-recognizer could use functions or other objects with domain-specific semantics for what to do with the handler.\n\nA route description can have handlers at various points along the path:\n\nrouter . add ([ { path : \" /admin \" , handler : admin }, { path : \" /posts \" , handler : posts } ]);\n\nRecognizing a route will return a list of the handlers and their associated parameters:\n\nvar result = router . recognize ( \" /admin/posts \" ); result === [ { handler : admin, params : {} }, { handler : posts, params : {} } ];\n\nDynamic segments:\n\nrouter . add ([ { path : \" /posts/:id \" , handler : posts }, { path : \" /comments \" , handler : comments } ]); result = router . recognize ( \" /posts/1/comments \" ); result === [ { handler : posts, params : { id : \" 1 \" } }, { handler : comments, params : {} } ];\n\nA dynamic segment matches any character but / .\n\nStar segments:\n\nrouter . add ([{ path : \" /pages/*path \" , handler : page }]); result = router . recognize ( \" /pages/hello/world \" ); result === [{ handler : page, params : { path : \" hello/world \" } }];\n\nSorting\n\nIf multiple routes all match a path, route-recognizer will pick the one with the fewest dynamic segments:\n\nrouter . add ([{ path : \" /posts/edit \" , handler : editPost }]); router . add ([{ path : \" /posts/:id \" , handler : showPost }]); router . add ([{ path : \" /posts/new \" , handler : newPost }]); var result1 = router . recognize ( \" /posts/edit \" ); result1 === [{ handler : editPost, params : {} }]; var result2 = router . recognize ( \" /posts/1 \" ); result2 === [{ handler : showPost, params : { id : \" 1 \" } }]; var result3 = router . recognize ( \" /posts/new \" ); result3 === [{ handler : newPost, params : {} }];\n\nAs you can see, this has the expected result. Explicit static paths match more closely than dynamic paths.\n\nThis is also true when comparing star segments and other dynamic segments. The recognizer will prefer fewer star segments and prefer using them for less of the match (and, consequently, using dynamic and static segments for more of the match).\n\nBuilding / Running Tests\n\nThis project uses Ember CLI and Broccoli for building and testing.\n\nGetting Started\n\nRun the following commands to get going:\n\nnpm install bower install\n\nThe above assumes that you have bower installed globally (you can install via npm install -g bower if you do not).\n\nRunning Tests\n\nRun the following:\n\nnpm start\n\nAt this point you can navigate to the url specified in the Testem UI (usually http://localhost:7357/).

      "\"The monstrosity has … begun to be implemented and we're not giving up the fight\"\n\nIt's not so secret. Republicans have been talking about repealing Obamacare since the day it was passed. And the House has been voting on repeal, and the Senate Republicans have been trying to figure out a way to use the reconciliation process.\n\nIt's no secret.\n\nBut it is a catchy headline at National Journal, The Secret Republican Plan to Repeal 'Obamacare':\n\nIn the months that followed [after the Supreme Court upheld the Obamacare mandate as a tax], top GOP Senate aides held regular strategy meetings to plot a path forward. Using the reconciliation process would be complicated and contentious. Senate rules would require Republicans to demonstrate to the parliamentarian that their repeal provisions would affect spending or revenue and Democrats were sure to challenge them every step of the way. So the meetings were small and secret…. By Election Day, Senate Republicans were ready to, as McConnell put it, \"take this monstrosity down.\" \"We were prepared to do that had we had the votes to do it after the election. Well, the election didn't turn out the way we wanted it to,\" McConnell told National Journal in an interview. \"The monstrosity has … begun to be implemented and we're not giving up the fight.\" Indeed, when it comes to legislative strategy, McConnell plays long ball. Beginning in 2009, the Republican leader led the push to unify his colleagues against Democrats' health care plans, an effort that almost derailed Obamacare. In 2010, Republicans, helped in part by public opposition to the law, won back the House and picked up seats in the Senate. Last year, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney's embrace of the individual mandate while Massachusetts governor largely neutralized what had been a potent political issue. But, in the next two years, Republicans are looking to bring the issue back in a big way. And they'll start by trying to brand the law as one that costs too much and is not working as promised.\n\nThat should be the easiest branding job ever, but the media will fight back against it. The National Journal calling it a \"secret plan\" is part of the counter-narrative, that there's something tricky or deceptive about actually trying to fulfill a very public policy of repealing the monstrosity known as Obamacare.\n\nI wish we were half as good as secretly scheming as we are made out to be.",
      "According to a recent study by the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, 24 million Chinese men will be unable to find wives by 2020 because of the country's gender imbalance. Before the mass migration from the villages to the cities, young men could rely on their parents to find them a wife. Now many of those single women live in the cities, working in factories. They only see their parents during the spring festival so the chances of finding a wife are limited. It's a particular challenge for men with low income, who don't own their own apartment or who don't have a good job. In some parts of rural China there are several communities with so many single men they've been labelled 'bachelor villages'\n\nThe trend has led to a growth in internet dating while at the high end, rich men join 'single entrepreneur' clubs that run competitions to find them that someone special.\n\nLucy Ash reports from China on the ways in which both parents and the single men are attempting to make the perfect catch.\n\nProducer: Julie Ball.",
      "It's been a tragic week for child gun accidents. Two 2-year-olds and a 3-year old have been shot dead in the past few days in gun accidents.\n\nIn Kentucky, a 5-year-old boy shot and killed his 2-year-old sister. He was using his own gun, a rifle made for kids called \"My First Rifle,\" that he got as a birthday gift the year before. His parents \"didn't realize\" the real gun they let their 5 year old play with had live ammo in it at the time. In all fairness to the parents, what could possibly go wrong with giving a 5 year old a loaded rifle as a gift?\n\nInterestingly, the story says the gun's child safety lock was in place and operational. And it was just a \"tragic accident.\" Then how did the gun go off?\n\nI went to the \"My First Rifle\" web site, and look, they even have pink ones for girls!\n\nThen there was the 3-year-old boy in Tampa who found a loaded gun in his uncle's backpack, and shot himself dead. The proud defender of the Second Amendment uncle apparently didn't think it was a problem leaving a loaded gun in a 3-year-old boy's bedroom.\n\nAnd there's the 2-year-old Texas boy who shot himself in the head, and died, after finding his dad's loaded handgun. How does a 2 year old get a loaded handgun if it's way up on a shelf above a kid's reach? Unless it isn't.\n\nThen there's the 13-year-old boy who accidentally shot his 6-year-old sister with the gun they found in their home in Florida. And the 4-year-old boy in Alabama who's in critical condition after finding a gun in a bedroom and either he shot himself, or a 4-year-old girl who was with him shot him.\n\nThen, not a child gun story, but just a moron gun story, there's the guy who fell asleep on his gun, after cleaning it, only to roll over and accidentally shoot himself through the chest.\n\nOf course, gun advocates are claiming that the problem isn't guns, it's kids with guns, or something.\n\nState Rep. Robert R. Damron, a Democrat and an outspoken gun rights advocate in Kentucky, said the problem is not guns, but the parents who do not teach gun safety and responsibility. \"Why single out firearms? Why not talk about all the other things that endanger children, too?\" he said. \"The Second Amendment doesn't give anybody carte blanche freedom to put children and juveniles at risk.\"\n\nFirst off, the boy was 5. According to WebMD, he probably still needs help wiping his behind after pooping, so good luck teaching him how to handle a deadly weapon.\n\nSecond, yes, there are lots of other things that endanger children too. And the government already regulates the hell out of all those other things that can hurt kids, and we even ban kids from having a number of them – things like drugs, cigarettes, and alcohol come to mind. But we don't ban kids from having guns, and thanks to John Dingell (D-MI) we don't even regulate guns as consumer products, because that would infringe on your right to let your pre-pre-school child shoot himself in the head.\n\nAs we've noted before, the NRA has been targeting kids for a long while now. The NRA's even launched a new iPhone app, only three week after the Sandy Hook Elementary massacre in Newtown, Connecticut. The app is geared for kids as young as four years of age. That is, if they're still alive.",

      "Our culture is a patriarchy. It has been this way for a very long time, and while women's rights have made leaps and bounds, from suffrage to the much more recent Lily Ledbetter fair pay act, equality seems closer and closer. But the thing is, we still do have our roots in this male-dominated mindset. These roots have lead to more than just income inequality and women being unable to vote. Though those are more overt, and can be addressed directly through legislation, there is still a large issue present. Basically, what our culture considers to be masculine, is damaging, both to the men subjected to the cultural pressure, and to Gender and Sexual Minority(GSM) groups. Now how is it that this is the case? Well, to begin, we need to examine masculinity and how it' is impacting males, because this is sort of the key to all these issues. The traditional view of masculinity has many traits; for instance, men are expected to be stoic, emotionless. The only emotion that is acceptable to show is anger - other emotions, especially sadness - are signs of weakness. Men - \"real men\" - don't cry. Crying is a weak, pathetic act. It's womanly - women cry, women are weak. Men are better than that. Men are expected to be sexually ready at any turn, and to embrace any and all opportunities they get. Men are expected to be the assertive person in relationships, from the first time the guy asks her out, to their first, second, fifth time in bed together. If a man were to be passive - that's weak and emasculating, and unattractive. They need to be strong on their own, independent. They need to keep their troubles to themselves, because they can show no weakness. \"Real\" men want to have sex, and they want to have it often and with as many women as possible. But only women - because all the \"masculine\" logic falls apart if there's two men in the relationship. The consequence here is that men are widely constrained emotionally, and physically. Men are expected to bottle up their sadness, their depression, they're expected to grin and bear situations which may require emotional support. They're required to be assertive, despite their personality or wishes to the contrary. There is a drastically limited scope of what a \"masculine guy\" is. And it's reinforced, both in the media, and in the social behavior of groups of guys. Teasing someone about their sexuality (for instance) in order to make them feel insecure in their own masculinity, as if that had any real bearing on how masculine they are.  Men are, consequently, emotionally chained, cornered. They're bombarded with messages about how they are to be emotionally, who they can be sexually interested in, and with how narrow the scope is, this leaves many men scrambling to reconcile the parts of them that don't fit the \"masculine stereotype\".  In many ways, the emotional constraints on men mirror the physical constraints on female beauty, where a limited scope is considered \"acceptable\". Now that we have a grasp on masculinity, we can talk about the impact this has on GSM groups. As I mentioned before, a large portion of the masculine caricature I described earlier revolves around who it's acceptable to be attracted to. In the case of the masculine individual, the assumption is woman. The \"man's man\" is a womanizer. Now, bear in mind, not everyone is introspective to the levels required to understand that the social pressure is on them in this way, but it is. It's self evident from the way boys insult each other calling them \"gay\" or \"a fag\". The intent is to say \"look at you, you like someone who it isn't acceptable to! You're not living up to the masculine image and are worthy of ridicule!\" The insult here is an assault on the person's masculinity. Now, that's not to say that this alone is the culprit - but it sets the stage for far worse. Because men are made to feel insecure about the possibility that they may not be 100% unequivocally into women, they will fight against that notion. Even if they may be partially bisexual, they are forced to bury that aspect of their selves because it will bring ridicule and questioning of their masculinity. This internal conflict and turmoil manifests itself in a number of ways, all damaging to GSM groups. For one, they are likely to engage in further behavior against homosexual men and transgender women. Because if they're insulting people and belittling them, then there's no way they could possibly be hypocritical and actually be that themselves, right?   It's this repression that causes these negative reactions. It isn't simply limited to venomous insults, either. When a man finds out he's dating a transwoman, well, there's a reason for his negative reaction. Its often that he's more worried about his own image, both self and perceived. Because in his mind,",
      "Abstract Young children regularly engage in musical activities, but the effects of early music education on children's cognitive development are unknown. While some studies have found associations between musical training in childhood and later nonmusical cognitive outcomes, few randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have been employed to assess causal effects of music lessons on child cognition and no clear pattern of results has emerged. We conducted two RCTs with preschool children investigating the cognitive effects of a brief series of music classes, as compared to a similar but non-musical form of arts instruction (visual arts classes, Experiment 1) or to a no-treatment control (Experiment 2). Consistent with typical preschool arts enrichment programs, parents attended classes with their children, participating in a variety of developmentally appropriate arts activities. After six weeks of class, we assessed children's skills in four distinct cognitive areas in which older arts-trained students have been reported to excel: spatial-navigational reasoning, visual form analysis, numerical discrimination, and receptive vocabulary. We initially found that children from the music class showed greater spatial-navigational ability than did children from the visual arts class, while children from the visual arts class showed greater visual form analysis ability than children from the music class (Experiment 1). However, a partial replication attempt comparing music training to a no-treatment control failed to confirm these findings (Experiment 2), and the combined results of the two experiments were negative: overall, children provided with music classes performed no better than those with visual arts or no classes on any assessment. Our findings underscore the need for replication in RCTs, and suggest caution in interpreting the positive findings from past studies of cognitive effects of music instruction.\n\nCitation: Mehr SA, Schachner A, Katz RC, Spelke ES (2013) Two Randomized Trials Provide No Consistent Evidence for Nonmusical Cognitive Benefits of Brief Preschool Music Enrichment.

Competing interests: The authors have declared that no competing interests exist.\n\nIntroduction Young children's lives are saturated with musical activities: parents worldwide sing regularly with their children and most preschool programs incorporate musical activities into their curricula (for review, see [1]). In spite of the pervasiveness of preschool music activities, however, the effects of early music education on children's cognitive development remain unclear. Many studies have reported associations between music training and improvements in cognitive skills [e.g., 2–3], though the largest correlational study on the topic reported no such effect [4]. Only five published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have investigated causal effects of music training on areas of cognition seemingly unrelated to music [5]–[9] – effects that would support the often-repeated claim that \"music makes you smarter\" – and no clear pattern of results has emerged. Schellenberg [7] reported a significantly greater increase in general intelligence (as measured by the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children—Third Edition; WISC-III [10]) in children randomly assigned to keyboard or voice lessons, compared to those taking drama or no lessons. However, two subsequent RCTs failed to find corresponding IQ effects with other types of music training [8]–[9]. Moreno et al. [8] administered the WISC-III after Kodàly music or painting training and found no evidence for a greater increase in IQ in the music group. In a second study, Moreno et al. [9] administered two subtests of the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence—Third Edition (WPPSI-III [11]), an IQ test for younger children that corresponds to the WISC-III, after computer-based music or visual arts training. The music group significantly outperformed the visual arts group on the Vocabulary subtest but not the Block Design subtest; the authors reported no overall effect of music training on general intelligence [9]. Two further RCTs reported similarly mixed results: Costa-Giomi [5] found significant increases in children's general intelligence (as measured by the Developing Cognitive Abilities Test [12]) after two years of piano lessons, but not after one or three years. Bilhartz, Bruhn, and Olson [6] tested kindergarteners on subtests of the Stanford",
      "Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption John Kerry said he was serious about ''meaningful'' negotiations\n\nThe Russian and US foreign ministers have begun crucial talks in Geneva on a plan to place Syria's chemical weapons under international control.\n\nSergei Lavrov and John Kerry said they hoped the plan could avoid military action against Syria.\n\nThe UN has confirmed it has received documents from Syria on joining the Chemical Weapons Convention, a key step in the Russian plan.\n\nSyria's president said it would submit arms data one month after signing.\n\nThe US accuses the Syrian government of killing hundreds of people in a chemical attack in the Ghouta area of the capital, Damascus, on 21 August. The government denies the allegation, blaming rebels.\n\nAnalysis The United Nations has received what is called a \"letter of accession\" from the Syrian government - the first step in signing up to the chemical weapons convention. The treaty came into force in 1997 and bans the production, stockpiling and use of these deadly weapons. It has been signed up to by all but five nations: Angola, North Korea, Egypt, South Sudan and, until now, Syria. Under its terms, Syria must provide a detailed inventory of all its chemical weapons agents and facilities, detail the exact locations of its stockpiles, and open them to inspection by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). This is the first time that a country has started the process of joining the convention while in the midst of war. According to a source at the OPCW, this raises practical problems, and the security situation would make it very challenging to carry out inspections.\n\nRussia announced its proposal for dealing with the escalating chemical weapons crisis on Monday, as the US Congress was preparing to debate whether to back President Barack Obama's moves towards military strikes.\n\n'Doable but difficult'\n\nIn a news conference ahead of a working dinner in Geneva, Foreign Minister Lavrov said the resolution of the chemical weapons issue in Syria would make any military strike by the United States unnecessary.\n\nHe said there had to be a move away from military confrontation, and that successful talks could lead to a \"Geneva 2\" meeting.\n\nSecretary of State Kerry said that only the threat of force had spurred Syria to accept relinquishing its chemical weapons, but that he hoped diplomacy could prevent military action.\n\nHe said the expectations for the meeting were high - particularly for Russia.\n\nMr Kerry said: \"This is not a game. It has to be real, it has to be comprehensive, it has to be verifiable, it has to be credible, it has to be... implemented in a timely fashion. Finally, there ought to be consequences if it doesn't take place.\"\n\nHe added: \"President Obama has made clear that should diplomacy fail, force might be necessary.\"\n\nThe Syrians' use of the phrase \"standard practice\" in supplying information to the UN appeared to irk Mr Kerry.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Secretary of State John Kerry: \"You want me to take your word for it - it's a little early for that.\"\n\n\"There is nothing standard about this process at this moment because of the way the regime has behaved,\" he said.\n\nMr Lavrov appeared to admonish Mr Kerry for making a political address, saying: \"Diplomacy likes silence\". Mr Kerry failed to hear the translation of Mr Lavrov's final words and asked to hear them again.\n\nMr Lavrov said in English, \"It's OK, John\", only for Mr Kerry to say, smiling: \"You want me to take your word for it - it's a little early for that.\"\n\nThe BBC's James Robbins in Geneva says these are critical talks, aimed at breaking two-and-a-half years of deadlock over Syria.\n\nOur correspondent says the American and Russian teams are unusually large - packed with weapons experts as well as diplomats.\n\nMedia playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Jeremy Bowen near the Syrian town of Maaloula: \"In the distance... I can hear quite heavy explosions\"\n\nHe says the idea is that detailed talks on the practicalities of chemical disarmament will run in parallel with the hard political graft between Mr Kerry and Mr Lavrov - but it is expected to be a lengthy process, as each side tests the other hard to see if they really can find common ground.\n\nUS officials had earlier described Russia's plan as \"doable but difficult\".\n\nMr Lavrov also gave an outline of the three main phases of the proposal:\n\nSyria joins the Chemical Weapons Convention, which outlaws the production and use of the weapons\n\nSyria reveals where its chemical weapons are stored and gives details of its programme\n\nExperts decide on the specific measures to be taken\n\nBefore meeting Mr Lavrov, Mr Kerry held talks with the UN-Arab League envoy to Syria, Lakhdar Brahimi.\n\nThe meeting",
      "kirk , a highly-flexible thread pool for Rust\n\nDocumentation\n\nThe documentation is hosted on GitHub Pages.\n\nStability\n\nThe API and internal designs are subject to rapid change, so breakages could happen frequently until a pleasant and high-performance interface is found. Play around with this and figure out ways to improve it, but don't rely on it yet for anything truly important.\n\nExamples\n\nPools are generic not only to the jobs performed, but also to the method for giving jobs to workers. They may also be scoped, allowing safe access to data in the stack of the originating thread.\n\n// unscoped, dynamic dispatch using a Chase-Lev deque let mut pool1 = Pool :: < Deque < Task >> :: new (deque :: Options :: default ()); pool1. push ( || { println! ( \"Hello!\" ) }); pool1. push ( || { println! ( \"World!\" ) }); // unscoped, dynamic dispatch using a locked channel let mut pool2 = Pool :: < Channel < Task >> :: new (channel :: Options :: default ()); pool2. push ( || { println! ( \"Hello!\" ) }); pool2. push ( || { println! ( \"World!\" ) }); // unscoped, static dispatch enum Msg { Hello, World }; impl Job for Msg { fn perform ( self ) { match Msg { Msg :: Hello => println! ( \"Hello!\" ), Msg :: World => println! ( \"World!\" ), } } } let mut pool3 = Pool :: < Deque < Msg >> :: new (deque :: Options :: default ()); pool3. push (Msg :: Hello); pool3. push (Msg :: World); // scoped, dynamic dispatch let mut items = [ 0usize ; 8 ]; crossbeam :: scope ( | scope | { let mut pool = Pool :: < Deque < Task >> :: scoped ( & scope, deque :: Options :: default ()); for (i, e) in items. iter_mut (). enumerate () { pool. push ( move || * e = i) } }); // scoped, static dispatch struct Work < ' a > { i: usize , e: & ' a mut usize } impl Job for Work { fn perform ( self ) { * self .e = i; } } crossbeam :: scope ( | scope | { let mut pool = Pool :: < Deque < Work >> :: scoped ( & scope, deque :: Options :: default ()); for (i, e) in items. iter_mut (). enumerate () { pool. push (Work { i: i, e: e }); } }\n\nDesign\n\nI was inspired to start this after attending the January 2016 Bay Area Rust meetup and watching Aaron Turon's presentation about crossbeam . The initial version of this crate supported only boxed, dynamically-dispatched tasks (closures). At this stage, it was essentially scoped_threadpool with a different task-passing mechanism.\n\nThe first breakthrough came when I realized that a simple Job trait would make both static and dynamic dispatch possible:\n\npub trait Job : Send { fn perform ( self ); } pub struct Task < ' a >( Box < FnBox + Send + ' a > ); impl < ' a > Job for Task < ' a > { #[inline] fn perform ( self ) { let Task (task) = self ; task. call_box (); } } impl < ' a , F> From <F> for Task < ' a > where F : FnOnce () + Send + ' a { #[inline] fn from (f: F) -> Task< ' a > { Task ( Box :: new (f)) } }\n\nMuch better: static dispatch with no additional allocation, while maintaining convenient dynamic dispatch. I soon added support for 'static jobs that run outside a crossbeam::scope .\n\nAt this point, I was pretty happy with the result. However, scoped_threadpool , with its simple Arc<Mutex<Receiver>> method for delivering tasks to worker threads, stayed in the back of my mind. Eventually I decided to write benchmarks comparing the two, but since it didn't support static dispatch, I wrote a parallel set of pool and worker types.

      "About Us\n\nWind farm proposals in Tasmania are set to cause quite a stir to the Australian state if they are allowed to be developed as proposed. There are declarations for 3 private wind farms which would come at an expense of almost $450 million dollars and yet there are many good reasons that these should not be allowed in the beautiful area of the country. As a non-profit we and other surrounding businesses are trying to prevent the devastation that would become evident if these 200 wind turbines are allowed to be added to the landscape.\n\nThere are many disadvantages that wind turbines present and this is why they should not be allowed here. For one, wind turbines can provide an increased level of danger to wildlife and in particular birds. These innocent birds can quite often collide with the turbines that are producing this wind energy resulting in severe injury or death. Migratory birds and threatened species can be especially difficult in the Tasmanian land.\n\nNext, there are many negative effects on tourism that are realized by the construction of wind turbines like the 200 slated to be erected if not prevented. One of these is the noisy and unattractive nature of the turbines themselves. There are many beautiful vistas in Tasmania that attract tourists each year and these views would never be the same when the grass is dotted with towering turbines like a chessboard in disarray. Scenic beauty has always been important to this Australian community and the location of future turbines should be more carefully considered in order to not seem like corporate graffiti across the land.\n\nProperty value can often see significant decreases once wind turbines are put in place due to future buyers not being willing to place themselves so close to the zone. This is partly due to the unsightly nature of the giant fans as well as partially related to the reasons already given above. In the end a consumer is likely to choose a similar location that is not next to turbines than the same building that is in the vicinity. Residents of Tasmania want to be prudent with any developments that have the potential to harm things rather than bring positive outcomes. We urge everyone to contact the developers and plead with them not to bring this construction to our area. It is an uphill battle due to the money involved in the construction project but it can be stopped with enough effort.\n\nMany established companies in the community agree with our stance that these 200 turbines should simply not be built at all. Macquarie Builders is a locally owned and operated construction company that shares this view with our non-profit. Jim Brown an industry expert at Milano's states that, \"the addition of these wind turbines will be devastating to the local economy in similar ways as they have been in other communities unfortunate enough to have these poles deposited in their presence.\" Tas Clothing company is a third company which supports the effort to block the construction of the turbines before it is too late.",

Ralph became infamous for losing the 1951 National League pennant to the New York Giants by giving up the dramatic \"Shot Heard 'Round the World\" home run to Bobby Thomson. Despite being branded a scapegoat for the rest of his life Ralph kept secret for 50 years about that fateful game and the 1951 Giants team.

      "DHAKA: Bangladesh on Wednesday pulled out of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (Saarc) summit to be held in Islamabad, a day after India said it was boycotting the event over a deadly cross-border attack on a military base.\n\nBhutan and Afghanistan were also reported to be withdrawing from the November summit after India announced late Tuesday that Prime Minister Narendra Modi would not take part, citing \"increasing cross-border terrorist attacks in the region\".\n\nRelations between the nuclear-armed neighbours have deteriorated sharply since a deadly attack on a military base in disputed Kashmir that New Delhi blamed on militants from across the border.\n\nPakistan denies any involvement in the attack, in which 18 Indian soldiers died.\n\nBut Modi, under pressure to act after the worst such attack in more than a decade, has threatened to make it a pariah state.\n\nOn Wednesday junior Bangladesh foreign minister Shahriar Alam confirmed to AFP by text message that Bangladesh would not attend the Saarc summit.\n\nIndian media cited Dhaka as blaming \"the growing interference in the internal affairs of Bangladesh by one country\", and said Bhutan and Afghanistan were also planning to withdraw.\n\nThe country was not named, but Bangladesh has in the past accused Pakistan of interference for protesting the execution of Jamaat-e-Islami leaders found guilty of war crimes.\n\nSouth Asia analyst Ashok Malik said the pull-outs would have little practical impact on Pakistan but could push it closer to rival regional power China.\n\n\"It basically scores a symbolic and a political victory. As for Pakistan, this will push it even closer to China,\" said Malik, head of the Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation's regional studies initiative.\n\nResponding to India's move, Pakistan said it remained \"committed to peace and regional cooperation\" and accused New Delhi of perpetrating \"terrorism\" on its soil.\n\n\"As for the excuse used by India, the world knows that it is India that has been perpetrating and financing terrorism in Pakistan,\" tweeted foreign ministry spokesman Nafees Zakariya late Tuesday, citing the capture of an Indian intelligence officer in Baluchistan earlier this year.\n\nPakistan has repeatedly accused India of interference in the southwestern province of Baluchistan, which borders Iran and Afghanistan and is afflicted by militancy and a separatist insurgency.",
      "A severed section of the fuselage lay 20 yards from a part of the under-carriage, beyond that were two upturned seats; across the road an open suitcase was gathering rain, next to children's shoes, magazines and a set of keys. These were the poignant remains of flight MH17 dispersed over fields of eastern Ukraine on Tuesday.\n\nAttempts were made to secure the site, but the white tape had long been torn, and yesterday it flapped around in the wind and rain. An array of what came out of the Malaysian airliner, including potential evidence, has been left exposed to the elements. Visible among the magazines in Dutch, Chinese and Malay, the dolls, drawing books and pencil boxes, briefcase and backpacks, were shards of grey metal, possibly from a weapon, although it was impossible to discern.\n\nThere had been widespread condemnation of what was seen as hindering the work of the forensic experts by the rebels who had been accused by the Ukrainian government, and the West, of using a Russian anti-aircaft missile system to shoot down the Boeing 777. Incriminating items had been spirited away, it has been claimed, and looting by local people allowed to take place.\n\nThis last allegation was angrily denied by residents nearby. \"These stories are lies which have been spread to prepare excuses if they fail to find out who was responsible,\" said 68-year-old Aleksandr Borodkin. He produced a crucifix on a chain around his neck: \"Look, I am Christian, Russian Orthodox, so are my neighbours. We know it is a very bad sin to rob the dead, that did not happen.\n\n\"They have produced a preliminary report today. We don't know what the full report will say, all I can tell you is that all we saw were a few people from the OSCE [Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe] who took away a few things, and that was months ago. It did not look a very thorough job to me. I am a retired miner; accidents in mines got much more examined than what went on here.\"\n\nThis area has experienced the violence of Ukraine's vicious civil war.

      "Ahmednur Ali's family fled the chaos and violence of their East African homeland Somalia in the 1990s, eventually making their way to Minnesota like thousands of their compatriots.\n\nWhile many of the estimated 32,000 Somalis who settled in the state have struggled to adapt, Ali flourished. By age 20, he had blazed a path to Minneapolis' Augsburg College, where he played soccer, studied political science and aspired to a political career modeled on President Barack Obama's.\n\nHe was shot and killed last September outside a busy community center where he worked part-time as a youth counselor, and prosecutors said the 16-year-old accused of killing him was part of a gang.\n\nAli was one of seven Minneapolis-area Somali men killed over a 10-month period, and authorities believe all were killed by fellow Somalis. Police say it's too simple to tie all the killings to Somali gangs, which have lured hundreds of young community members to their ranks in recent years.\n\nThose in the insular community willing to speak out, however, disagree.\n\n\"It was all gang activity, totally, 100 percent,\" said Shukri Adan, a former Somali community organizer who estimated in a 2007 report for the city that between 400 and 500 young Somalis were active in gangs. \"The police don't want to say that but everybody else knows that.\"\n\nDespite anger and despair over the killings in Minnesota's Somali community — the nation's largest — police and prosecutors have struggled to catch and try the killers. Few witnesses have stepped forward because of a fear of reprisal and deep-rooted distrust of authority. More than half of Minnesota's Somalis are living in poverty, according to state statistics, and many complain that authorities are biased against Somalis because of their Islamic faith.\n\nLast month, prosecutors dropped the murder charge against the teenage boy in Ali's case after one witness backed out and another apparently fled the state.\n\nGangs like the Somali Hot Boyz, the Somali Mafia and Madhibaan with Attitude have grown more active in recent years, said Jeanine Brudenell, the Minneapolis Police Department's Somali liaison officer.\n\nKillings since December 2007\n\nThe recent spate of killings started in December 2007, when two Somali men, ages 27 and 25, were found shot to death at a south Minneapolis home. No arrests have been made in that case.\n\nThey culminated last September, when a man was fatally shot outside of the Village Market Mall, a cluster of Somali-owned businesses and a popular destination for local Somalis. Investigators believe the shooter was retaliating for the death of his cousin, one of the other slain Somalis. The mall shooting was the only of the seven slayings for which anyone was convicted — 23-year-old Hassan Mohamed Abdillahi.\n\nHennepin County Attorney Mike Freeman said he hoped the conviction would show local Somalis that the law is on their side, and spark new progress in closing the other cases. \"We have a job to do to convince people they can trust us,\" he said.\n\nA gang expert in California said economic and social factors are more likely to blame for the spike in gang activity than any spillover of violence from war-ravaged Somalia.\n\n\"When there's unemployment and poverty and lack of external support, there's gangs,\" said Jorja Leap, a social welfare professor at the University of California Los Angeles and former gang adviser to the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department.\n\nInvestigators in a separate criminal investigation have said they've also had trouble penetrating Minnesota's Somali community. The FBI is looking into the disappearance in recent years of up to 20 young Somali men, mostly from Minneapolis, believed to have been recruited into Islamist terror groups back in Somalia.\n\nThe first sign of progress in that investigation came this week with the indictment on terrorism charges of two young Somali men, at least one of whom is accused of traveling to Somalia to fight.\n\nSomali gangs elsewhere growing\n\nElsewhere in the U.S. and Canada, police and community officials have reported an increase in Somali gang activity.\n\nIn and around Edmonton, Alberta, six young Somali men have been slain in the last six months. The leader of a small Somali outreach group there said the deaths are seen as evidence of a growing gang problem, and that they've led to better cooperation between Somalis and police.\n\n\"It seems like the community now is getting to the point where we are trying to give information to the police, and they are sharing information with us,\" said Mohamednur Mardowe, who heads the Brotherhood Community Support Service Association.\n\nPolice in Columbus, Ohio, which has the second-largest U.S. population of Somalis, have also seen growing evidence of Somali gangs, said Sgt. Chantay Boxill.\n\nAhmednur Ali's sister, Hindia Ali, said she hopes her fellow Somalis will stand up",
      "Many an eyebrow was raised inside the Old City walls when a revered Iraqi rabbi gave his daughter's hand in marriage to the son of Polish immigrants. After all, weddings between Sephardic and Ashkenazi Jews were highly uncommon in 19th-century Jerusalem — and these nuptials took place in 1854. But Jerusalemites were shocked for another reason as well: groom Yehoshua Yellin was 13 years old at the time. And his child bride, Sarah Yehuda, was only 12.\n\nThe Yellin and Yehuda families were to make history again, only a few years later. Indeed, while Sir Moses Montefiore was building apartments outside the city walls in 1860, the Yellins and Yehudas were busy establishing the first agricultural colony in modern Israel (yes, long before Petah Tikva and Rishon LeZion.)\n\nBoth families were well-versed in the Holy Books, and felt passionately about settling the Land of Israel. For this pioneer agricultural venture, they chose the fertile fields of Colonia, an area that the Romans had set up as a community for retired soldiers. The Arabs living in Colonia nearly 2,000 years later had fallen on hard times, and were delighted to sell what the Yellin-Yehuda families called Motza — named for one of the cities that Joshua allotted to the tribe of Benjamin.\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up\n\nSarah's brother Shaul and her husband Yehoshua hoped they would be joined by others, and that Motza would become a thriving settlement. Unfortunately, in 1864 Shaul caught a fatal case of pneumonia after walking home to Jerusalem in the pouring rain.\n\nBut Yehoshua continued the endeavor. He grew vegetables, olives, and all kinds of fruit — including the rare wild plum that is endemic to the area. And he used the basement of the house he built in 1890 as a cowshed for his dairy. Finally, in 1894, four new pioneers appeared. While two left pretty quickly, the other two remained. Motza began to expand and flourish and today, with its rustic atmosphere and lovely homes, it is one of the most sought-after communities in the area.\n\nIn 1994, I wrote an article about Motza. At the time the Yellin House was in shambles, just a sad skeletal reminder of the first modern Jewish house in the Jerusalem hills. For over a decade I watched as it continued to crumble.\n\nA few years ago, however, Eliezer Yisraeli — grandson to one of Yehoshua Yellin's grandsons — decided to preserve the family heritage. The Society for Preservation of Israel's Historic Sites stepped in to assist, along with a generous donation obtained from Leonard Kahn through the Jewish National Fund. Yellin's home and interior have been faithfully restored, along with the enormous cowshed discovered in the basement during renovations. Someday, if plans come to fruition, the historic Yellin house will be transformed into a first class Visitors' Center, with lecture hall, convention center, and exciting exhibits about Motza.\n\nJust in front of the Yellin house stands the Motza synagogue, whose ground floor features stone arches first built during the Byzantine period. In the early 1860's, Shaul and Yehoshua utilized these arches and began construction of a way-station. Yellin wrote later that 30-40 carriages a day stopped at the inn, which opened in 1871 and serviced Arab merchants from Jaffa who wanted to appear early in the Jerusalem markets.\n\nWhile the upper story housed a European-style restaurant and hotel, traders and animals slept together down below. It is said that when Motza children get lice in their hair, their parents blame it on the lice-infested fur that inhabited the khan a century earlier.\n\nPeople standing on the balcony of the Yellin house gaze into the backyard view of newly replanted fruit trees, Yellin's olive grove, and picnic tables. Also visible are remains from the summer home of arch-terrorist Haj Amin-el Husseini, and the slopes behind it that once housed the Arabs of Colonia.\n\nThe Arabs of Colonia enjoyed an excellent relationship with the Jews of Motza… In fact, some of the settlers refused protection from the Haganah\n\nHaj Amin-el Husseini was the uncle of Abdel Kader el-Husseini, a commander of Arab forces in the Jerusalem area during the War of Independence, and was also the grandfather of late Palestinian activist Faisal Husseini. One of the parties responsible for the bloody anti-Jewish riots of 1921, Haj Amin was tried, found guilty, and sentenced to prison. Soon afterwards, he was pardoned by British High Commissioner Herbert Samuel who, in his",

      "An androgynous alien species called the Taelons arrive on earth, claiming to be companions of humanity, putting an end to crime, illness, and famine. Some are suspicious of the Taleons, and form a resistance movement. The resistance soon learned that the force that sustains the Taelons are breaking down, and they are using humans as test subjects in experiments to help save their species. The initial focus of the show was Commander William Boone and his partner, Captain Lili Marquette, who worked for both the Taelons and the resistance. After Boone was killed, the show introduced a new protagonist, Major Liam Kincaid, and began to play on the strengths of its ensemble cast. Written by Ronos",
      "The wild finish to the NFC Championship game will go down as one of the most unlikely and unbelievable comebacks in NFL history. The Seahawks erased a 16-point second-half deficit -- the largest comeback in championship game history -- including a 12-point Packer lead with under three minutes to go. Only twice before in postseason history has a team overcome a 10-point deficit under three minutes and gone on to win.\n\nDown 19-7 with 3:52 remaining, just about everyone had given Seattle up for dead. To that point in the game, Russell Wilson was living a nightmare, and despite coming into the game with one postseason pick on 152 attempts (the lowest interception rate in NFL postseason history), he'd thrown a career-high four picks and had only completed 8 of his 22 attempts for 75 yards.\n\nBut, that's when an improbable chain of events would kick into motion. From that point on, Wilson would finish out the game 6-of-7 for 134 yards with a touchdown pass, a touchdown run, and a successful 2-point conversion.\n\nThe bizarre, exciting final three minutes of regulation\n\nSeattle took control of the ball at their own 31-yard line, down two scores and beyond desperate to get something going. They got things started off with a nice read-option run with Marshawn Lynch that picked up 14 yards and then quickly followed that up with a 20-yard pitch and catch from Russell Wilson to Doug Baldwin. Seattle was now into Green Bay territory and threatening. A first-down misfire to Baldwin again set up a second-and-10.\n\n3:02\n\n2-10-GB 35 (Shotgun) R.Wilson pass deep right to M.Lynch ran ob at GB 9 for 26 yards.\n\nThe Seahawks would run a simple, yet effective two-man route combination that would send Marshawn Lynch out-then-up on a wheel route over the top of tight end Luke Willson, who is flexed outside at the snap. The angle of Lynch's release baits Packers' linebacker No. 58, Sam Barrington, underneath the tight end hitch route, and when Lynch cuts it upfield, Barrington is toast.\n\n\nLynch stretches to make an athletic catch, not the easiest or most natural feat for a lot of running backs. He reels it in, tiptoes the sideline, and on the live broadcast, would actually break a few tackles and go on to score. But, subsequent replays would say he stepped out of bounds at the 9-yard line, bringing the play back. Nonetheless, Seattle had some juice back, and were threatening to push this thing to a one-score game.\n\nOn first down, Marshawn Lynch would rush for 4 yards, followed by a 4-yard scramble by Russell Wilson on second down. That set up a third-and-goal from the 1-yard line.\n\n2:13\n\n3-1-GB 1 (No Huddle, Shotgun) R.Wilson left tackle for 1 yard, TOUCHDOWN\n\nAt the handoff mesh-point, the Packers miscommunicate assignments, and two defenders crash down hard on Marshawn Lynch. Wilson, seeing this unfold, pulls the ball back, keeps it, and strolls into the end zone.\n\n\nThings were getting interesting at this point as the Seahawks cut into Green Bay's lead, which now sits at 19-13. I'd suppose most Seahawks fans at this juncture were tempering their hopes and dreams though, because onside kicks are notoriously hard to convert.\n\nAfter kicking the extra point to make it 19-14, Seattle lines up for that crucial onside kick.\n\n2:09\n\n(Onside Kick formation) S.Hauschka kicks onside 15 yards from SEA 35 to 50, impetus ends at SEA 48. RECOVERED by SEA-C.Matthews.\n\nSeahawks kicker Steven Hauschka's kick was on the money as it bounced high into the air, and it was mishandled by second-year tight end Brian Bostick. Bostick reacted to the football instinctively but had it go through his hands and into Seattle's Chris Matthews' hands. Depressingly for the Packers, it looks like Jordy Nelson would've been there to field the ball.\n\nFor what it's worth, Bostick owned up to his mistake after the game.\n\n\"I felt like I had my hands on the ball and it went through,\" Bostick said. \"I got hit and I didn't have the ball. ... It wasn't my job at all. I was supposed to block. I just reacted to the ball and thought I could get it. Obviously, I couldn't.\"\n\nThe young player's mistake led to another opportunity for the Seahawks, one they took advantage of.\n\nTo this point in the game, the Seahawks had saved their read",
      "NEW DELHI: The government's big capital infusion plan took the D-Street by surprise on Wednesday. Data suggests that the capital infusion amount was 48 per cent of PSU banks' market capitalisation put together as of Tuesday. The recap amount was over 30 per cent of PSU banks' current capital, over 25 per cent of total stressed assets. An up to 40 per cent rally in PSBs on Wednesday, thus, was no surprise.Brokerages believe the move is a long-drawn process and will lead to a rerating of the sector.RBI Governor Urjit Patel in a statement called the government's 'decisive' package to restore the health of the Indian banking system is in the view of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a monumental step forward in safeguarding the country's economic future. \"For the first time in last decade, we now have a real chance that all the policy pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will be in place for a comprehensive and coherent, rather than piece-meal, strategy to address the banking sector challenges,\" he said.RBI welcomes bank recapitalization planA well-capitalized banking, and in general, financial intermediation, system is a pre-requisite for stable economic growth. Economic history has shown us repeatedly that it is only healthy banks that lend to healthy firms and borrowers, creating a virtuous cycle of investment and job creation.The Government of India's decisive package to restore the health of the Indian banking system is in the view of the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), a monumental step forward in safeguarding the country's economic future. For the first time in last decade, we now have a real chance that all the policy pieces of the jigsaw puzzle will be in place for a comprehensive and coherent, rather than piece-meal, strategy to address the banking sector challenges.It bodes us well that this step has been taken in a time of sound macroeconomic conditions for the economy on other fronts.The proposed recapitalisation package for the banking sector combines several desirable features. First, by deploying recapitalisation bonds, it will front-load capital injections while staggering the attendant fiscal implications over a period of time. As such, the recapitalisation bonds will be liquidity neutral for the government except for the interest expense that will contribute to the annual fiscal deficit numbers.Second, it will involve participation of private shareholders of public sector banks by requiring that parts of the capital needs be met by market funding. Last but not the least, it will allow for a calibrated approach whereby banks that have better addressed their balance-sheet issues and are in a position to use fresh capital injection for immediate credit creation can be given priority while others shape up to be in a similar position. This provides for a good way of bringing some market discipline into a public recapitalisation program compared to the past recapitalisation programs. Financial sector policies should support growth while maintaining financial stability.On behalf of the Reserve Bank of India, I commend the government on its bold steps in this direction, starting with implementation of the Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code that is helping resolve the underlying corporate stress, and culminating in yesterday's announcement of the public sector bank recapitalisation program. The RBI looks forward to working with the Government to ensuring these plans reach their natural completion to the benefit of the broader Indian economy.\"",

Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) spoke twice last year with Russia's ambassador to the United States, Justice Department officials said, encounters he did not disclose when asked about possible contacts between members of President Trump's campaign and representatives of Moscow during Sessions's confirmation hearing to become attorney general.\n\nOne of the meetings was a private conversation between Sessions and Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that took place in September in the senator's office, at the height of what U.S. intelligence officials say was a Russian cyber campaign to upend the U.S. presidential race.\n\nThe previously undisclosed discussions could fuel new congressional calls for the appointment of a special counsel to investigate Russia's alleged role in the 2016 presidential election. As attorney general, Sessions oversees the Justice Department and the FBI, which have been leading investigations into Russian meddling and any links to Trump's associates.

He added: \"I have been called a surrogate at a time or two in that campaign and I did not have communications with the Russians.\"\n\nOfficials said Sessions did not consider the conversations relevant to the lawmakers' questions and did not remember in detail what he discussed with Kislyak.\n\n\"There was absolutely nothing misleading about his answer,\" said Sarah Isgur Flores, Sessions's spokeswoman.\n\nIn January, Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.) asked Sessions for answers to written questions. \"Several of the President-elect's nominees or senior advisers have Russian ties. Have you been in contact with anyone connected to any part of the Russian government about the 2016 election, either before or after election day?\" Leahy wrote.\n\nSessions responded with one word: \"No.\"\n\nJustice officials said Sessions met with Kislyak on Sept. 8 in his capacity as a member of the armed services panel rather than in his role as a Trump campaign surrogate.\n\n\"He was asked during the hearing about communications between Russia and the Trump campaign — not about meetings he took as a senator and a member of the Armed Services Committee,\" Flores said.\n\nShe added that Sessions last year had more than 25 conversations with foreign ambassadors as a senior member of the Armed Services Committee, including the British, Korean, Japanese, Polish, Indian, Chinese, Canadian, Australian and German ambassadors, in addition to Kislyak.\n\nIn the case of the September meeting,",
      "Early during the season 3 summer split SK management already reacted to beyond expectation results with the announcement of possible strategic changes. The transfer of both players is a first step in this direction.Says Alexander Müller, Managing Director of SK Gaming: \"Our performance during the summer split did not in any way reflect the potential of the team or the players we had on the roster. At a certain point the chemistry was totally off and even though all of us tried to fix it, a change became unavoidable. Finishing 2nd in Europe only one year ago at Gamescom 2012 was great. Ending up 3rd and 4th in the spring split was acceptable, but the continuing downward tendency turned the summer split into a disaster.\"After finishing the LCS summer split, the team took time off in order to analyze the season and decide on what would be the best course of action for the upcoming promotion match and the 2014 campaign.Continues Müller: \"We explored all possibilities in August and discussed them with the team. When an opportunity for a player transfer of both Kevin 'kev1n' Rubiszewski and John 'hyrqBot' Velly came up, we sat down with the NiP management and hammered out the agreement within 24 hours. I can say that both teams handled the situation extremely professional. We informed Riot Games immediately and are happy to announce the transfer. The terms of this deal are between SK and NiP and will stay there. I would like to take the opportunity and thank both players for the time they spent with us. It was quite a journey and we wish them all the best for the future with their new team, especially for the upcoming promotion match for season 4.\"This transfer leaves the top and jungle position wide open at the SK League of Legends line-up. \"We will use the opportunity at hand and for now test different team compositions in order to develop a stable and competitive team for our promotion match.

      "(Dreamstime)\n\nThe students issued a list of demands.\n\nSeveral student groups at George Washington University in Washington, D.C., sent a letter to administrators claiming that the police protecting them on campus is an \"act of violence\" because a police union endorsed Donald Trump.\n\nThe letter, which was obtained by the College Fix, is titled \"Demands for Our Campus by Concerned Students.\" (Yes . . . demands.)\n\nThe relevant section states:\n\n\"The university must re-channel its resources and money to its fundamental requirement: to protect its students. This safety must not depend on the University's police. The Fraternal Order of Police, the largest police union in the United States, has formally endorsed President-Elect Donald Trump. The FOP includes over 10,000 members in Washington D.C., many of which have jurisdiction over GW's campus. Placing us in these officers' care is an act of violence, especially for Black students.\" \"The University must protect its students, instead, by dramatically increasing financial aid, emergency funds, health care resources, health insurance grants, and discretionary funds available to low-income students. It must create and/or dramatically increase funding for the community centers like the Multicultural Student Services Center for people of color and marginalized students. It must increase funding for Mental Health Services and expand hiring to candidates that are of color and specialize in race-related mental health concerns.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, it's important to note that it's not clear from the language in the letter whether these kids want the cops to stop protecting them or not. It does state that campus police protection is an \"act of violence,\" that their \"safety must not depend on the University's police,\" and that the university must increase funding to other areas \"instead\" — but we can't be sure if they're saying that they feel that the university is depending only on the police — and that it should pay more attention to other areas as well — or if they're saying that it must not depend on the police at all. In either case, though, their argument is ridiculous.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSay the latter option is true: That these students want to get rid of campus police entirely, and that applying extra funding to the causes that they listed would be a fine replacement. If this is the case, I'm going to push back a little and bet that, if a murderer were breaking into one of their dorm rooms, he or she would probably not be calling the Multicultural Student Services Center for help. What's more, keep in mind that their reason for calling campus-police protection an \"act of violence\" is that some FOP members have jurisdiction over campus. If you follow this logic, then there would be a lot of places other than their campus where police protection would also be \"an act of violence,\" seeing as, by their own admission, FOP has more than 10,000 D.C. members. If they really are declining protection over this, then by extension they're basically saying that they don't really want the police's protection when they're out in D.C. at all . . . which might be something that they'd want to rethink.\n\nThe other option, of course, would be that these students do still want the police protection, but they just want the university to understand that the protection is an \"act of violence.\" Kind of like, \"Look, protect me, but understand that your protecting me is an act of violence.\" Okay? It's like inviting your boyfriend over, opening the door, and saying, \"You being here is an act of violence\" and when he tries to leave saying \"Wait? What are you doing? Just because I said your presence is an act of violence doesn't mean that I don't want you to help me change the lightbulb I'm too short to reach! Just make sure to also donate to PETA on the way out!\" It's not hard to see how crazy this sounds.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n#related#If these students have a problem with a police union or its political affiliations, then okay. It's perfectly fine to express that. But calling their very protection an \"act of violence\" is just inaccurate. A police officer protecting someone is not an \"act of violence.\" An \"act of violence\" is, for example, getting hit in the face, or kicked in the shin, or thrown down a flight of stairs. See: any dictionary. What's more, their demand that the school send money to different organizations in order to fix the situation makes no sense. When in the world would that ever be a thing? Say I had a doorman at my apartment who supported Donald Trump. Would I ever, in a million years, write a letter to my building owner claiming that, based on his political beliefs, my doorman's very being there was an \"act of violence\" against me? And demand that they donate to Planned",

      "The way the Call of Duty franchise lurches back and forth between developers, universes, and storylines every year makes for an incredibly uneven experience. Sure, certain things about the games remain unchanged from year to year. But as each team puts their stamp on things, from the story found in its campaign to the weapon balance and, increasingly, movement options, the whole line has begun to feel astoundingly disjointed. Call of Duty: Black Ops III is a swing back to Treyarch's side of the series. At one point, it seemed like a safe bet that the Treyarch Call of Duty games were the best in the lot. Black Ops III takes an interesting approach to its setting and universe, but it gets too far away from the previous Black Ops games to feel like an actual sequel to those stories. It's... weird.\n\nBack when Modern Warfare 2 came out, I could sort of sum up my excitement about the game's new options with one notion: that you could shoot down UAVs. That's an oversimplification, obviously, but it illustrated a new dimension in that game's multiplayer. No longer would you always have to burn one of your perks if you wanted to have a hard counter against the map pings of an enemy UAV. You could also just bring a rocket launcher and shoot them down. The rest of the game reflected that, and the series has tweaked and expanded on those sorts of options as the years have gone on. So, for Black Ops III, it's with no small amount of disappointment that I can reduce a lot of my feelings about the game down to a similarly short sentence.\n\nMelee attacks are no longer a guaranteed one-hit kill.\n\nI'm sure there's some long explanation about how that helps balance the game. Over the years the different studios that pass the Call of Duty franchise around have frequently altered the effective range of a melee attack in an attempt to keep things balanced. But now it doesn't reliably do the one thing that made the melee fun in the first place. Is it the end of the world? Nah. Some people might even like what it does to the game. I'm not one of those people. In the end, it ends up being one of the handful of things that ever-so-slightly pushes me away from this year's game.\n\nBut let's talk more about the competitive end of Black Ops III later. The campaign has a slightly different structure in that it allows for four-player co-op play. This means it has things like a lobby, where you can build your loadouts or use a fake web browser to check out in-universe wiki articles or read old emails, which is one of the very few ways that this story directly references to the events of the previous Black Ops games. Playing with other humans adds a standard incapacitated state and, naturally, a revival system to go along with it. This tends to mean fewer trips back to a checkpoint, which is nice. The gameplay is largely what you'd expect, though you're quickly granted a suite of various HUD modes and cyber abilities that give you new tools in the fight against your enemies.\n\nThe story largely deals with these cyber abilities and the Direct Neural Interface, a computer that gets bolted onto the brains of various soldiers. Like you, for example! You're a created character with no name (even the subtitles only refer to him or her as \"Player\") who begins the story as a relatively normal soldier in an extremely generic-feeling story. The first moments of the campaign almost feel like a parody of the standard military shooter, with angry-looking dudes yelling at each other and being all tough. It quickly takes a left turn, though, shortly after you get your own neural interface.\n\nAt that point, the game immediately dumps you into a bunch of virtual training missions that teach you how to do things like set robots on fire with your mind. Or send up a cloud of burning nanobots that distract and kill human combatants. As you spend points and unlock additional abilities over the course the campaign, you'll get special electric melee attacks, decoy abilities, and so on. You're also introduced to your new HUD, which shows enemies through cover, draws grids on the ground to denote places you might not want to stand, and other tactical info. The grids almost make the game look broken, like some textures are missing or something. You can customize which parts of the tactical overlay you want active, which is a nice touch. Lastly, you have jump jets. These quick boosts can be used for higher jumps and boosted slides. You can also wallrun. The ability set feels OK, but I constantly found myself trying to execute a boosted strafe, like you could in last year's Advanced Warfare. Without that, the toolset feels like it's missing a key piece.\n\nThe campaign has a couple of connections to the previous Black Ops games, but they're more acknowledgements that those games happened in this universe, rather than direct",
      "Captain Falcon (キャプテン・ファルコン, Captain Falcon), full name Douglas Jay Falcon,(citation needed) is the main playable racer from the F-Zero series of futuristic Nintendo racing games and is the mascot of the franchise. As a member of the \"perfect-attendance crew\", Captain Falcon has been featured as a playable character throughout the entire Super Smash Bros. series. His highly offensive playstyle, his signature moves (most notably his Falcon Punch) and his memorable quotes have made him a fan favorite character across the Super Smash Bros. series despite F-Zero's status as a lesser-known Nintendo franchise. His voice actor throughout the Super Smash Bros. series is Ryō Horikawa.\n\nCharacter description [ edit ]\n\nF-Zero X. His design in this game inspired his design in Super Smash Bros. and Super Smash Bros. Melee. Captain Falcon, as he appears in. His design in this game inspired his design inand\n\nNintendo originally meant for Captain Falcon to be the flagship character of the then-new Super Nintendo Entertainment System. However, this never panned out, and Captain Falcon was rarely seen in Nintendo media.\n\nThe first F-Zero game was released in 1990 for the Super Famicom in Japan and its western counterpart, the SNES. It introduced the first character design of Captain Falcon along with the other three F-Zero series characters that appeared in the game as racing pilots, along with their respective futuristic racing machines, such as Captain Falcon's Blue Falcon. The manual to the game featured an eight-page comic featuring these characters, with the comic's story revolving around one of Falcon's trademark bounty-hunting missions in his Falcon Flyer transport ship. Captain Falcon's design and backstory would be revised in future iterations of the F-Zero series; his design in F-Zero X for Nintendo 64 would be used for his appearances as a playable fighter in 1999's Super Smash Bros. and 2001's Super Smash Bros. Melee, and his most recent \"main\" design is in F-Zero GX for GameCube. In all these appearances, Captain Falcon and his machine are touted as the most balanced and easy-to-play-with machine for that game, so players of a new F-Zero game almost always play as Captain Falcon first. He is also known as the game's main character.\n\nCaptain Falcon is described as \"an accomplished F-Zero pilot, a renowned and talented bounty hunter\", and is also an eccentric man in his late thirties (36 in F-Zero X and Melee, 37 in F-Zero GX). His \"Captain\" title is rumored to originate from his possible status as an officer in the Internova Police Force in the past. He is a resident of Earth, hailing from the city of Port Town. His bounty hunting exploits have yielded him enough of a reputation that he has gained many enemies across the galaxy; to avoid the constant danger from his adversaries, when he is not racing or bounty hunting he lives in seclusion in his personal archipelago off the coast of Port Town. His need to shield himself from outsiders borders on paranoia (albeit not necessarily unwarranted), as whenever he wins a race, he compulsively dashes to his archipelago with his award money before others can get him. Living comfortably in solitude on his archipelago, Captain Falcon practices his F-Zero racing with a separate track built on each one of his islands.\n\nHis outfit consists of a purplish-blue, form-fitting racing suit and a red helmet with an opaque visor as well as a single pauldron on his right shoulder and a scarf around his neck. He always carries a sidearm in a holster on his right hip, although he has only been shown to use it once. When Captain Falcon removes his helmet, a scar above his left eye can be seen.\n\nThe F-Zero series' chronology has many vague elements up for debate, but it is stated by F-Zero X that Captain Falcon was involved in a huge accident that caused the suspension of the F-Zero Grand Prix; while he was hospitalized, his DNA was stolen and used by someone else to create his evil clone Blood Falcon, who races against him in hopes of taking him out. The story mode of F-Zero GX shows Captain Falcon winning several races, then saving fellow pilot Jody Summer. He ends up in a heroic role when he races against and defeats the super villain Black Shadow, then a superior villain named Deathborn, and he goes on to even defeat the Creators of the F-Zero world.\n\nCaptain Falcon appears as a playable character in every Super Smash Bros. game in the series. As Falcon had almost never been depicted in combat in his home series, his moveset is largely original to the Smash series itself, where he is depicted as a pyrokinetic hand-to-hand brawler; his famous Falcon Punch made its debut in Super Smash Bros. and has been",

      "South Sudan's army denies imposing a blockade to starve the rebels into submission ahead of peace talks to end the 19-month civil war (AFP Photo/Tim McKulka)\n\nAddis Ababa (AFP) - South Sudan's rival forces began peace talks on Thursday, as international pressure mounts ahead of an August 17 deadline to strike a deal to end 19 months of civil war.\n\nThe conflict has left tens of thousands dead and has been marked by widespread atrocities on both sides.\n\n\"We have now reached a critical juncture whereby participants of this phase will make decisions that may impact the destiny of the people of South Sudan,\" chief mediator Seyoum Mesfin said at an opening ceremony.\n\nDelegates met in the Ethiopia capital Addis Ababa, under mediation from the regional eight-nation bloc IGAD, the Intergovernmental Authority on Development.\n\nSouth Sudan's civil war began in December 2013 when President Salva Kiir accused his former deputy Riek Machar of planning a coup, setting off a cycle of retaliatory killings that has split the poverty-stricken, landlocked country along ethnic lines.\n\n\"We have not been able to count the number of dead,\" Seyoum said.\n\nDiplomats have said repeatedly that patience has run out over the country's civil war.\n\n\"You have had enough time to consult, since the proposals are the very same issues that you have been discussing for the last 19 months,\" Seyoum said.\n\n\n- 'Senseless war' -\n\n\nBut the mood was far from friendly, with chief rebel negotiator Taban Deng saying the government in Juba had \"lost all legitimacy\" while his government counterpart, Nhial Deng Nhial, was dismissive of proposals that he said put Machar on a level footing with Kiir.\n\nRegional mediators, backed by US President Barack Obama during his recent visit to Kenya and Ethiopia, have given Kiir and Machar until August 17 to halt the civil war.\n\nKiir and Machar, who are expected to appear later in the process, effectively face an ultimatum, a \"final best offer,\" according to one senior US administration official.\n\nFailure to strike a deal could lead to a range of punitive measures including an arms embargo and targeted sanctions, including travel bans and asset freezes.\n\nAfter the collapse of the last round of talks, mediators expanded involvement to create an \"IGAD-plus\" group.\n\nIt now also includes the United Nations, five more African Union nations from across the continent -- Algeria, Chad, Nigeria, Rwanda and South Africa -- as well as China and the \"Troika\": Britain, Norway and the US.\n\nNorwegian diplomat Jens-Peter Kjemprud, speaking for the Troika, warned the parties of the need to strike a deal.\n\n\"You have the opportunity to resolve outstanding issues before August 17,\" he said. \"If not, the international community will look at new ways to resolve the conflict.\"\n\nDuring previous peace talks held in luxury Ethiopia hotels, Kiir, Machar and their entourages have run up millions of dollars in expenses while failing to sign a single lasting agreement.\n\nAt least seven ceasefires have been agreed and then broken within days, if not hours.\n\nAt home, South Sudan's bishops have called on leaders to put the fate of the country before their pursuit of power and settle a deal.\n\n\"There is no moral justification for this senseless war,\" the influential Council of Churches, a coalition including all the key Protestant and Roman Catholic bishops, said in statement.\n\n\"It is unacceptable that people continue to kill and be killed while leaders argue over power, positions and percentages.\"",
      "The New York Times' coverage of Israel often reads as if were written of Zionists, for Zionists and by Zionists, and a news analysis by Steven Erlanger last weekend titled, \"Who are the True Heirs of Zionism?\" was in that tradition. The piece said there is a \"fierce battle\" in Israel between good Zionists and bad ones. The good ones wanted to set up a model democracy. The bad ones are trying to have the entire biblical land of Israel and to hell with world opinion.\n\nAre [the true heirs of Zionism] those who hold to the secular and internationalist vision of the nation's founders, or are they the nationalist religious settlers who create communities beyond the 1967 boundaries and seek to annex more of the biblical land of Israel?\n\nThe piece all-but-openly adopted the point of view of liberal Zionist Bernard Avishai that Israel was a miraculous Jewish rebirth.\n\nThe largely secular founders of Israel, the generation of David Ben-Gurion, had a dual vision of Israel as both \"a light among nations\" and a state like others, part of the international community of nations, outward looking and socially just.\n\nThe settlers ruined that. Uri Dromi, former spokesperson for Yitzhak Rabin, tells Erlanger:\n\nRather than trying to be a nation among nations, \"today, without saying it, by what we are doing, we are a people that is alone.\"\n\nBut don't end on a down note! At the end, Erlanger expresses the fond hope that everything's gonna work out:\n\nStill, the older Zionism is not dead yet and continues to create \"facts on the ground,\" noted Mr. Avishai. Every high-tech start-up, every new Thai restaurant and every successful film — and the very existence of a Hebrew-speaking, pluralistic, thriving Tel Aviv — speaks to the success of traditional Zionism and its continuing importance in Israeli life.\n\nThe article is so narrowminded it is hard to read. It mentions Palestinians twice. It quotes Zero Palestinians, even though it begins with the bold admission that\n\nZionism was never the gentlest of ideologies. The return of the Jewish people to their biblical homeland and the resumption of Jewish sovereignty there have always carried within them the displacement of those already living on the land.\n\nErlanger would seem to believe in that romance — the return of the Jewish people to their biblical homeland — sufficiently that he refuses to entertain any serious critique of Zionism here. Those critiques are taking place across the Israeli world and the Jewish world and they include these ideas:\n\nThe fierce battle Erlanger wants readers to believe in has been resolved. Israel is dominated by a Jewish settler government that was reelected emphatically last March. Even the alleged liberals, the Zionist Camp, are scared to oppose settlers openly. This is the endpoint of the blessed \"Jewish sovereignty\" in the same way that dictatorship and bureaucracy were the endpoint of Communist ideology. This understanding of Israeli political culture is expressed best lately by Ayman Odeh, an Israeli political leader who has made the terrible mistake in the eyes of the New York Times of not being Jewish and of representing 20 percent of the country's population, so he won't be quoted; and by Max Blumenthal, who is Jewish (and American, like Avishai) but made the terrible mistake of being an anti-Zionist, so he can't be quoted.\n\nThe issue is how long the Times and the other long-distance runners of Jewish sovereignty are going to marginalize these critiques as irrelevant– when other people want to talk about them, including many Palestinians, Israelis, Europeans and even young Americans (at Bernie Sanders rallies). Bear in mind that Erlanger also deemed Ghada Karmi's story of how her Palestinian family lost her house in West Jerusalem to be not newsworthy–when Karmi thought it so relevant that she wrote a whole book about her family's life in that house. In this article, Erlanger acknowledges Karmi's story with his opening indictment– \"the displacement of those already living on the land\" — but after that it's right back to the real work of ignoring Palestinians and anti-Zionists.\n\nOf course I don't think those critiques are irrelevant, but are absolutely vital to an understanding of Zionism in the 21st century. Writing an article about Whither Zionism and leaving out its countless victims, would be like writing, Whither Communism and ignoring the gulag. And as to the point, Who are the true inheritors of Zionism? — let's assume this is a parochial, Jewish question– the answer is, anti-Zionists. Zionism arose as a fervent minority belief inside European Jewish life 120 years ago as a real answer to real historical conditions; and today anti-Zionism is burgeoning as a minority belief inside Diaspora Jewish life, and inside Israeli life too, as a real answer to real",
      "Brookings Metropolitan Policy Program\n\nThe seven types of global cities driving the world economy.\n\nGlobalization and urbanization go hand in hand. The world, I've long argued, is spiky. The 40 largest mega-regions produce two-thirds of global economic output and 90 percent of global innovation, while housing just 18 percent of the world's population.\n\n\nBut we lack solid data on global cities.

A new report, \"Redefining Global Cities,\" by the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program fills an important gap here, providing detailed data on the 123 largest global cities based on their metro economies. The report, released as part of the Global Cities Initiative (a joint project of Brookings and JP Morgan Chase), develops data on economic output, productivity, globalization (via foreign direct investment), innovation (based on patents and venture capital investment), talent (population with tertiary education), and global connectivity (via measures of airline passengers and Internet connectivity).\n\nThe report uses these data to create a new typology of the seven types of global cities.

      "My original goal when I started poking around Apple's EFI implementation was to find a way to reset a MacBook's firmware password. My preliminary research found references to a \"magical\" SCBO file that could be loaded onto a USB flash drive and booted to remove the password. The normal process workflow is to first contact Apple support. Since I don't have the original sales receipt of this specific Mac, I assume this option isn't possible, since anyone with a stolen Mac could get the password reset. Things got more interesting when I found a website that allegedly sold the SCBO files – just send them the necessary hash (more on this later), pay USD100, and get a working SCBO file in return. There are videos (in Portuguese but you can watch the whole process) of people claiming this works, and even some claims about an universal SCBO that unlocks multiple Macs.\n\nSince there was (stil holds true) virtually no information about the SCBO contents, this aroused my curiosity but I never followed up until now. Upon my return from SyScan360 Singapore, I needed a new research direction to kickstart my brain back into work, and this fit the bill.\n\nThe core question I wanted to answer was if it was really possible for someone to build a SCBO file key generator. If this were true, it would imply that Apple's EFI contains a significant vulnerability. Understanding how SCBO files work in the first place was also intriguing. So let's start another EFI reversing engineering adventure…\n\nAt the time I could only find a single SCBO file on the Internet, which is bad (impossible to visualise differences between files) but better than no file at all. The sample file can be downloaded here SCBO_original.zip.\n\n(SHA256(SCBO_original)= fad3ea1c8ffa710c243957cc834ac1427af0ea19503d9fc7839626f6cac4398b)\n\nThis picture shows us the full contents of the sample file. The SCBO string is clearly visible in the first four bytes, which is a magic number (0x4F424353). A couple of bytes later and we see another string. It appears to be some kind of serial number. This information can be verified because part of this string can be found in the motherboard of each Mac (my sample is only composed of MacBooks but I guess iMacs and others will contain the same information). The rest of the string and binary data that follows are unknown for now. The total file length is 324 bytes.\n\nHow are the SCBO files generated?\n\nAs previously mentioned, Apple support is able to generate these files after you provide some key information. To obtain the necessary information, you must hold SHIFT + CONTROL + OPTION + COMMAND + S on the firmware password prompt screen and a string will be generated. This is the string Apple support needs, and this is the same string we see inside the SCBO file. The first digits are the machine serial number as previously described, and the last sixteen digits are a nonce value regenerated every time the firmware password is set, removed, or modified. I know this because I had already reversed Apple's Firmware Password Utility and observed its communications with the kernel extensions that set the EFI NVRAM variables.\n\nNow that we know a bit more about its contents, can the sample SCBO be modified and reused to reset any other Mac's firmware password?\n\nThe answer is no. If we set a firmware password on a test Mac, generate the necessary string, and modify the SCBO accordingly, nothing will happen. The computer will process the file and reset the system, but the password isn't reset.\n\nThis provides us with another bit of information – that there is some kind of integrity check on the SCBO contents. It would be a surprise if this kind of check wasn't implemented and anyone could modify the SCBO contents.\n\nSo if this is true then how is someone selling what appear to be fully working SCBO files? We need to dig deeper and reverse the EFI code responsible for processing this file.\n\nAnd now let's start the real reverse engineering fun!\n\nThe first thing we need to do is to extract all the EFI binaries either from a flash chip dump that holds EFI contents or from a SCAP file found in EFI updates (for unknown reasons the fd format is also used for some Macs). I maintain an up-to-date Apple firmware update repository, which you can use to easily download EFI updates or verify the contents of your EFI flash if you fear nation states are attacking you. The great UEFITool can easily extract contents from dumps and SCAP (to mass extract all the files use UEFIExtract utility instead). You will need UEFITool's new_engine branch if you want support for NVRAM",

      "The 16-year-old drew up detailed plans to massacre his classmates in Northamptonshire using handguns and home-made bombs.\n\nHe created intricate classroom plans and a hit-list of fellow students and where they sat, and said he would carry on shooting until the police arrived, at which point he would take his own life.\n\nBut after warning users on a forum that he would be armed and ready \"20 minutes from now\", one user called the FBI, who alerted police in England.\n\nOn Monday the boy, who cannot be named because of his age, was detained indefinitely in a secure mental unit after admitting possessing explosive materials and possessing terrorist materials.\n\nBirmingham Magistrates were told that the teenager suffers from Aspergers syndrome, stockpiled terrorist e-books and guides to making explosives on his computer.\n\nWhen police searched his home they also found chemicals used to make explosives which had been bought from the internet.\n\nHe was arrested in February last year after detailing his plans on the anonymous chat website 'Omegle', claiming he would carry out the massacre in revenge for being bullied at school.\n\nProsecuting, Mark Topping said an American chat room user had alerted the FBI when the boy had made comments about carrying out the mass killing on February 24, who contacted police in England.\n\nHe said: \"The boy told the person he was going to stage a massacre at his school using handguns then committing suicide.\n\n\"He said 20 minutes from now he would be armed with a Magnum .44 revolver, a Beretta 92FS and various other weapons and ammunition.\n\n\"He said he would keep shooting until the police arrived, at which point he would commit suicide.\n\n\"He also made a comment about how people shouldn't have bullied him so much.\"\n\nMr Topping added: \"He spent some time looking for this material and wrote out a quotation on a notice board at school which was quickly erased.\n\n\"The recoveries included diaries and notebook instructions for the construction of IEDs.\n\n\"There were further notes about plans for the massacre.\n\n\"There were plans of class rooms, desks at which pupils sat and who was to be targeted.\n\n\"It is interspersed with references to [the boy] feeling himself to be weak and powerless, excluded from social activities and being bullied.\"\n\nA police search of the teenager's home found 20 publications, including 'The Terrorist Handbook', 'The CIA Explosives for Sabotage Manual' and bomb-making guide 'An Anarchist's Cookbook - Recipes for Disaster'.\n\nThe court heard that police also found diaries and hand-written notes containing detailed plans for the massacre and research on 'Lone Wolf' killers including Black Panther Donald Nielsen. The notes were \"interspersed with references to [the boy] feeling himself to be weak and powerless, excluded from social activities and being bullied\".\n\nOfficers also found sealed containers of potassium nitrate and sulphur powder - 'precursor chemicals' for gunpowder - which the boy had bought online using his father's PayPal account.\n\nDr John O'Brien, the boy's psychiatrist, said that the boy's disorder caused him to obsess over his interests.\n\nHe added: \"He has talked about this in a fantasy-type way, and has said he never planned for it to be real life and he didn't have plans to carry it out. He knew it was a crime and was wrong.\"\n\nImposing a hospital order, District Judge Howard Riddle said evidence from medical experts provided \"hope\" for the boy's future.\n\nHe said: \"I think I speak for everyone when I say we all wish you well.\"\n\nThe boy also admitted a third charge of possessing 'Lollicon' images - Japanese cartoons depicting child sex abuse.",
      "Blog post written by Audrey Nickel\n\nAnimal names in Irish are interesting things.\n\nWhile many of them come from obvious Indo-European roots, with a clear similarity to such names in other languages (for example: capall (horse), asal (donkey/ass), and bó (cow)), others are rather interestingly descriptive.\n\nWild thing!\n\nNames for wild animals, including some bugs and insects, can be particularly descriptive. Some are wonderfully apt; others will have you scratching your head and asking \"how in the heck did they come up with THAT?\"\n\nBut why?\n\nSome of the names, as you'll see in a bit, are quite simply descriptive. Others may have roots in Irish myths and legends.\n\nSome others may have come about because the animals themselves were creatures that people found frightening or considered to be dangerous. Calling the animal by an innocuous \"nickname,\" if you will, diffused some of that fear, and (perhaps!) made the dangerous creature more kindly disposed toward you!\n\nWithout further ado, here are a few of my favorites:\n\nJellyfish\n\nI can't begin to tell you how delighted I was when I first learned the Irish term for the jellyfish. It's just so perfect:\n\nSmugairle Róin (SMUG-er-lyeh ROH-in): \"Seal Snot.\"\n\nIf you've ever been in a boat on the bay, looking down at a host of jellyfish, you'll have no trouble picturing where this name came from! They are very beautiful in an aquarium, with the right lighting, but from the bow of a curach, they definitely look like…well…snot!\n\nSpider\n\nI have to admit, this one has baffled me for a very long time. The Irish for \"spider\" is:\n\nDamhán Alla (DOW-ahn ALL-uh): \"Little Wild Ox.\"\n\nI've been unable to find the origin for this one, but the image of some poor farmer trying to throw a yoke on a wolf spider has haunted my nightmares for at least nine years!\n\n(Sorry…no picture of a spider. They freak me out. And that's OK).\n\nBat\n\nHere's another beautifully descriptive one:\n\nSciathán Leathair (SHKEE-uh-hawn LA-hur): Leather wing.\n\nAlways makes me start humming this great old song (with thanks to Tommy Makem):\n\nLadybug/Ladybird\n\nThis is another of those head scratchers. It's hard to guess why anyone would name the prettiest little member of the beetle family…\n\nBóín Dé (BOH-een jay): God's Little Cow\n\nHard enough to guess how this little critter got it's name…and harder still to imagine anyone trying to milk one!\n\nOtter\n\nThe otter goes by at least two different names in Irish. One is…\n\nMadra Uisce (MAD-ruh ISH-keh): Water Dog.\n\nThe other is…\n\nDobharchú (DOH-wur-khoo): River/estuary hound\n\nMy dog can't quite see it, but I think there's some resemblence, don't you?\n\nFox\n\nThe fox does have his own name in Irish — sionnach (SHUN-ukh) — but he's also known as…\n\nMadra Rua (MAD-ruh ROO-uh): Red Dog.\n\nNot hard to guess where that came from!\n\nAnd my personal favorite: the wolf\n\nI've always been fascinated by wolves (in fact, on on-line forums I often go by \"Redwolf,\" though technically anymore that should probably be \"Greywolf\"!)\n\nSadly, there are no longer any wolves in Ireland outside of zoos. The wolf figures hugely in Irish lore, however (after all, the Irish did develop an amazing breed of dog — the Irish Wolfhound…the largest breed in the world — whose job, among other things, was to hunt down and guard against wolves).\n\nWolves go by several names in Irish, but one of the most intriguing is…\n\nMac Tíre (Mock CHEER-uh): Son of the Land\n\n(By the way, even female wolves are called \"mac tire.\" We're all sons in this menagerie.)\n\nAnother name for the wolf in Irish is…\n\nFaolchú (FWEEL-khoo): A compound word made of the literary word for \"wolf\" (faol) and the word for \"hound\" (cú) — often loosely translated as \"wolf dog\" or \"wild dog.\"\n\nBy contrast,",

      "AUGUSTA, Ga. - When a high-fat diet causes us to become obese, it also appears to prompt normally bustling immune cells in our brain to become sedentary and start consuming the connections between our neurons, scientists say.\n\nThe good news is going back on a low-fat diet for just two months, at least in mice, reverses this trend of shrinking cognitive ability as weight begins to normalize, said Dr. Alexis M. Stranahan, neuroscientist in the Department of Neuroscience and Regenerative Medicine at the Medical College of Georgia.\n\n\"Microglia eating synapses is contributing to synapse loss and cognitive impairment in obesity,\" Stranahan said. \"On the one hand, that is very scary, but it's also reversible, meaning that if you go back on a low-fat diet that does not even completely wipe out the adiposity, you can completely reverse these cellular processes in the brain and maintain cognition.\"\n\nStranahan is corresponding author of the study in the journal Brain, Behavior, and Immunity, which provides some of the first evidence of why fat is bad for the brain.\n\nThe trouble appears to start with too much fat in the body producing chronic inflammation, which stimulates microglia to have an autoimmune response. Microglia, like macrophages in the body, are known for their ability to ingest trash and infectious agents in the brain, and their highly acidic interior gets rids of it, which helps support the function and health of neurons. But as mice get obese, their microglia seem focused on overeating.\n\n\"Normally in the brain, microglia are constantly moving around. They are always moving around their little fingers and processes. What happens in obesity is they stop moving,\" Stranahan said. \"They draw in all their processes; they basically just sit there and start eating synapses. When microglia start eating synapses, the mice don't learn as effectively,\" Stranahan said.\n\nThe study looked at normal male mice: One group ate a diet in which about 10 percent of the calories came from saturated fat, and another consumed chow that was 60 percent fat. To ensure other factors were equal, the researchers chose chows that had similar levels of other key ingredients such as macronutrients and protein. The chows were on par with a healthy diet versus a fast-food diet in humans. \"If you look at the lipid breakdown for the two diets, these guys are getting crazy, crazy amounts,\" Stranahan said of the high-fat-fare mice.\n\nAt four, eight and 12 weeks, the MCG scientists took a series of metabolic measures, such as weight, food intake, insulin and serum glucose levels. They also measured in the hippocampus, the center of learning and memory, levels of synaptic markers, proteins found at synapses that correlate with the number of synapses.\n\n\"This gives us a window into what is occurring at the level of the synapse and also microglial activation,\" Stranahan said. And, they measured levels of inflammatory cytokines, which microglia produce when \"they start getting activated and angry.\"\n\nAll levels in both groups were essentially the same at four weeks. The mice on a high-fat diet were fatter, but other measures were normal at eight weeks. By 12 weeks the fat-eating mice were obese, had elevated cytokine levels and a reduction in the markers for synapse number and function.\n\n\"When you get out to 12 weeks, you start seeing great increases in peripheral obesity. While you don't see insulin resistance, you also start seeing loss of synapses and increases in inflammatory cytokines in the brain,\" Stranahan said.\n\nAt that point, the research team switched half the mice on the high-fat diet to the low-fat regimen. It took about two months for their weight to return to normal, although their overall fat pad remained larger than their peers who had never gained weight. That fat layer makes it easier to gain weight in the future, Stranahan notes. As with most people, the mice that remained on the low-fat diet slowly accumulated a little weight as they aged.\n\nMeanwhile, the group that stayed on the high-fat diet kept getting fatter, more inflamed and losing synapses, she said. Their microglia's little processes, or protrusions, which normally help monitor synaptic function and help these cells move, continued to wither. Dendritic spines on neurons, which get input from synapses, similarly withered on the high-fat diet, but like the microglia processes, were restored with the lower-fat fare.\n\n\"That is very promising,\" said Stranahan. The findings also point to some potential new purposes for existing drugs now used for conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn's disease, which block specific inflammatory cytokines and tumor necrosis factor alpha, both of",

      "Picasso painted Three Musicians in the garage of the villa he rented at Fontainebleau for the summer of 1921. This solemnly majestic oil painting, with its flat, patterned shapes echoing the cut and pasted papers of his collages, provides a grand summation of the artist's decade-long exploration of Synthetic Cubism. The three masked figures, with their sinister smiles and humorous false mustaches, are rendered in flat, overlapping planes that give them an intangible, paper-thin quality, which increases the strange, otherworldly atmosphere of this Cubist concert. Like actors on a stage, the musicians are arranged frontally in a shallow, boxlike space. Harlequin holds a violin and bow, Pierrot plays a clarinet (or recorder) above a sheet of music unfolded on the table, and a Franciscan friar in a homespun habit with a rope for his belt holds an accordion.\n\nThe appearance of costumed figures, derived from Italian popular theater and carnival traditions, also relates to Picasso's collaboration, beginning in 1917, with the Russian ballet. In the year before he painted Three Musicians, Picasso had designed costumes for Sergei Diaghilev's ballet Pulcinella, which had choreography based directly on commedia dell'arte types. The painting has also been interpreted as a symbolic and nostalgic elegy to Picasso's poet friends or his own lost bohemian youth.1 According to this biographical reading, the mysterious triumvirate commemorates the recently deceased Guillaume Apollinaire, in the form of Pierrot, with the poet Max Jacob as the friar and Picasso himself as Harlequin, the sad-clown figure with whom he had identified in his earlier work. Picasso refused to part with the work for many years, before finally letting A. E. Gallatin acquire it for his Gallery of Living Art in New York in 1936. Gallatin was able to purchase the painting just before the Museum of Modern Art, which later bought another version of the subject.

      "ABOVE: K2C with BUIS, with stock fully extended. This gun is Cerakoated.\n\n\nAs many of our readers know, the K2 rifle and K1A \"SMG\" are the standard infantry personal weapons of the ROK armed forces. K1A is actually a 5.56x45mm carbine, but ROK Army nomenclature has always been that the K1A is an SMG. While these have been in service since around the early 1980s, there's one surprising fact; they haven't really been upgraded since adoption.\n\nWhile there had been some very minor upgrades in the heat treatment method, or minor design changes of some parts, there have been no major upgrades, as have happened in the M16A1 to M16A2 or M16A2 to M16A4. In small arms, it is a very rare case of doing nothing, since almost all countries and manufacturers who can design and manufacture military small arms have gone through significant changes for their weapons designs during those years, especially after the 1990s when the US Army standardized the MIL-STD-1913 interface, the \"Picatinny Rail.\"\n\nEven though their allies went with all those changes in small arms during last the 3 decades, both the Korean military and the manufacturer, Daewoo Precision as well as its successors, S&T Daewoo and S&T Motiv were surprisingly inactive during almost 30 years in terms of upgrading their rifles and carbines. Actually, all of these are the same company; they only changed names due to the change of management.\n\nThe author fires the new K2C.\n\nOf course there are reasons. First, the ROK Army, the biggest military buyer in ROK (of the 600,000 members of the Korean armed forces, the ROK Army has 500,000), was not interested in upgrading their small arms. As you can see by the numbers, the ROK Army today is still a Cold War style force like the US Army before the 1990s. They have spent huge amounts of money on artillery and armor, so the infantry's share of the budget is not large. Since they are too much focused on war with North Korea, who are basically a 1960s remnant, modern infantry tactics and weapons have not seemed urgent. Thus, they just kept buying existing rifles and carbines, without seeking upgrades.\n\nIn those circumstances, manufacturer didn't see the need for upgrades; ROK military had bought about 2 million rifles and carbines(including a license-built M16A1) since the mid-1970s, and that means Daewoo Precision and it's successors had supplied on average 40,000–50,000 rifles/carbines per year, during all of that 40 years period. If you can sell those numbers for a few dozen years, and the buyer says nothing about upgrades, and you don't need to worry about competition, what motivation is there to change?\n\nAnother reason for this inactivity in upgrades was the manufacturer's situation. Daewoo Precision was originally a subdivision of Daewoo group, but during the late 1990s the Daewoo group crumbled and Daewoo Precision was sold to S&T Group, and changed its name to S&T Daewoo, then changed again into S&T Motiv. During these changes and management chaos, stable R&D was not an easy option.\n\nComparison between K2 and K2C.\n\nFirst Attempt: Adding a Rail to Existing Weapons\n\nBut that doesn't mean upgrading attempts were non-existent. Most of them were from Special Forces and the private sector. Special Forces of course felt the need to upgrade the K-series weapons, since they couldn't put any new optics or accessories from foreign sources on their Korean-made weapons. Some very elite groups could buy rail-equipped foreign weapons like M4A1 Carbines or G36s, but the majority of those Special Forces have to use Korean weapons. They tried to find a solution for the problem, and a few companies in Korea developed add-on rail systems for the K1A and K2.\n\nSuch rails have been offered since the early to mid-2000s, and small numbers were used within special operation groups. But the numbers were quite small, and it wasn't until 2013 when the ROK Army finally adopted standardized MIL-STD-1913 rail systems for both K1A and K2. Actually, the first rail systems for K series weapons were developed for the K1A. K1A has no interface for optics or other accessories, and since it's a standard personal weapon of many Special Forces, a solution to attach optics on K1A had some urgency for those special units. Until 2013 many non-standard rails from various companies were supplied in small numbers to Special Forces, but in 2013, the ROK armed forces selected standard rails, because of the introduction of new Dot",
      "Looking for news you can trust?\n\nSubscribe to our free newsletters.\n\n\nA mile-long Canadian Pacific Railway train derailed in Minnesota on Wednesday, spilling 15,000 gallons. Reuters reports that 11 of the 94 train cars came off the tracks about 150 miles northwest of Minneapolis.\n\nOfficials did not say whether the oil was from Canada's tar sands, but the derailment is sparking still more debate over the controversial proposed Keystone XL pipeline that would carry tar sands oil into the US. Here's a relevant excerpt from another Reuters piece:\n\nSome experts have argued oil-by-rail carries a higher risk of accidents and spills.\n\n\"It is good business for the rails and bad safety for the public,\" said Jim Hall, a transportation consultant and former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board.\n\n\"Railroads travel through population centers. The safest form of transport for this type of product is a pipeline. This accident could—and ought to—raise the issue for discussion,\" he added.\n\nOthers note that spills from rail cars are rare, and that delivering crude by rail has opened up opportunities in recent years for producers to develop huge volumes of oil production in areas of the United States that are not connected to markets by pipeline.\n\n\"It's not very good publicity, but railroads are incredibly safe, they don't spill often,\" said Tony Hatch, independent transportation analyst with ABH Consulting in New York who has done work for major railroads. \"It should not change the opportunity railroads have to make us more energy independent.\"\n\nWe import more oil from Canada than any other country, so it's worth noting that with or without the pipeline, we're already moving oil into the US and there is a potential for spills.",

      "Tutorials > Examples? > Basics > ReadAnalogVoltage\n\nRead Analog Voltage\n\nThis example shows you how to read an analog input on analog pin 0, convert the values from analogRead() into voltage, and print it out to the serial monitor of the Arduino Software (IDE).\n\nHardware Required Arduino or Genuino Board\n\n10k ohm potentiometer\n\nCircuit\n\nimage developed using Fritzing. For more circuit examples, see the Fritzing project page Connect the three wires from the potentiometer to your board. The first goes to ground from one of the outer pins of the potentiometer. The second goes to 5 volts from the other outer pin of the potentiometer. The third goes from the middle pin of the potentiometer to analog input 0. By turning the shaft of the potentiometer, you change the amount of resistance on either side of the wiper which is connected to the center pin of the potentiometer. This changes the voltage at the center pin. When the resistance between the center and the side connected to 5 volts is close to zero (and the resistance on the other side is close to 10 kilohms), the voltage at the center pin nears 5 volts. When the resistances are reversed, the voltage at the center pin nears 0 volts, or ground. This voltage is the analog voltage that you're reading as an input. The microcontroller of the board has a circuit inside called an analog-to-digital converter or ADC that reads this changing voltage and converts it to a number between 0 and 1023. When the shaft is turned all the way in one direction, there are 0 volts going to the pin, and the input value is 0. When the shaft is turned all the way in the opposite direction, there are 5 volts going to the pin and the input value is 1023. In between, analogRead() returns a number between 0 and 1023 that is proportional to the amount of voltage being applied to the pin.\n\nSchematic\n\nCode\n\nIn the program below, the very first thing that you do will in the setup function is to begin serial communications, at 9600 bits of data per second, between your board and your computer with the line:\n\nSerial.begin(9600);\n\nNext, in the main loop of your code, you need to establish a variable to store the resistance value (which will be between 0 and 1023, perfect for an int datatype) coming in from your potentiometer:\n\nint sensorValue = analogRead(A0);\n\nTo change the values from 0-1023 to a range that corresponds to the voltage the pin is reading, you'll need to create another variable, a float , and do a little math. To scale the numbers between 0.0 and 5.0, divide 5.0 by 1023.0 and multiply that by sensorValue :\n\nfloat voltage= sensorValue * (5.0 / 1023.0);\n\nFinally, you need to print this information to your serial window as. You can do this with the command Serial.println() in your last line of code:\n\nSerial.println(voltage)\n\nNow, when you open your Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE (by clicking on the icon on the right side of the top green bar or pressing Ctrl+Shift+M), you should see a steady stream of numbers ranging from 0.0 - 5.0. As you turn the pot, the values will change, corresponding to the voltage coming into pin A0.\n\n/*\n\nReadAnalogVoltage\n\n\nReads an analog input on pin 0, converts it to voltage, and prints the result to the Serial Monitor.\n\nGraphical representation is available using Serial Plotter (Tools > Serial Plotter menu).\n\nAttach the center pin of a potentiometer to pin A0, and the outside pins to +5V and ground.\n\n\nThis example code is in the public domain.\n\n\nhttp://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/ReadAnalogVoltage\n\n*/\n\n\n// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:\n\nvoid setup ( ) {\n\n// initialize serial communication at 9600 bits per second:\n\nSerial . begin ( 9600 ) ;\n\n}\n\n\n// the loop routine runs over and over again forever:\n\nvoid loop ( ) {\n\n// read the input on analog pin 0:\n\nint sensorValue = analogRead ( A0 ) ;\n\n// Convert the analog reading (which goes from 0 - 1023) to a voltage (0 - 5V):\n\nfloat voltage = sensorValue * ( 5.0 / 1023.0 ) ;\n\n// print out the value you read:\n\nSerial . println ( voltage ) ;\n\n} [Get Code]\n",
      "In retrospect, it might not seem so impressive that music historian Charles Burney predicted an uncommonly bright future for the musical prodigy performing in front of him, a 9-year-old who possessed what Burney described as \"almost talents.\" After all, who could fail to recognize that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was destined for greatness?\n\nBetting on a prodigy, however, is anything but a sure thing. The majority of prodigies never fulfill their early promise. \"Perseverance is a key part of it,\" says Robert Root-Bernstein of Michigan State University. \"Many of them say that their expectations were warped by their early experiences.\" When success comes too easily, prodigies are ill prepared for what happens when the adoration goes away, their competitors start to catch up and the going gets rough.\n\nand educators rarely pick up the slack. \"I don't see anyone teaching these kids about task commitment, about perseverance in the face of social pressures, about how to handle criticism,\" notes Indiana University psychologist Jonathan Plucker. \"We say, 'Boy, you're really talented.' We don't say, 'Yeah, but you're still going to have to put in those 60-hour work weeks before you can make major contributions to your field.' \"\n\nEven prodigies who avoid and resist social pressures are unlikely to make a big splash as an adult. The problem, notes giftedness researcher Ellen Winner, is that to make a major contribution in the arts, and even the sciences \"you need a rebellious spirit and the type of mind that can see new things.\" Most prodigies, however, are acclaimed not for their but \"for doing something that's already been done, like playing the violin in the style of Itzhak Perlman.\" Only prodigies who can reinvent themselves as innovators, she says, are likely to leave a lasting mark during adulthood.",

      "The Social Scalability of Network Security\nWhere long ago we used clay, and more recently paper, today programs and protocols running on our computers and data networks implement most of our commercial dealings. While this has greatly improved matchmaking and information flow, it has come at the cost of an increase in vulnerability to harmful behavior.\nAs networks grow, more people with fewer mutually understood habits of and constraints on behavior are added.   Security via root-trusting access control, designed for small and chummy offices like Bell Labs where co-workers were well known and income and expenditures well controlled by paper procedures rather than performed on these office computers, breaks down as an efficient and effective security mechanism as organizations become larger, as organizational boundaries are crossed, and as more valuable and concentrated resources such as money are put on or activated via the computers. The more strangers one receives emails from, the more likely one is likely to get a phishing attack or a malware-laced attachment.   Traditional computer security is not very socially scalable. As I describe in The Dawn of Trustworthy Computing :\nWhen we currently use a smart phone or a laptop on a cell network or the Internet, the other end of these interactions typically run on other solo computers, such as web servers. Practically all of these machines have architectures that were designed to be controlled by a single person or a hierarchy of people who know and trust each other. From the point of view of a remote web or app user, these architectures are based on full trust in an unknown \"root\" administrator, who can control everything that happens on the server: they can read, alter, delete, or block any data on that computer at will.  Even data sent encrypted over a network is eventually unencrypted and ends up on a computer controlled in this total way. With current web services we are fully trusting, in other words we are fully vulnerable to, the computer, or more specifically the people who have access to that computer, both insiders and hackers, to faithfully execute our orders, secure our payments, and so on. If somebody on the other end wants to ignore or falsify what you've instructed the web server to do, no strong security is stopping them, only fallible and expensive human institutions, which often stop at national borders.\nMany server computers are not valuable enough for insiders or outsiders to attack. But an increasing number of others contain valuable concentrations of resources, motivating attack. Centralized root-trusting security scales poorly. As the resources controlled by computers become more valuable and more concentrated, traditional root-trusting security becomes more like the \"call the cop\" security we are used to in the physical world.   Fortunately, with blockchains we can do much better for many of our most important computations.\nBlockchains and Cryptocurrencies\nScalable markets and prices require scalable money. Scalable money requires scalable security, so that a greater number and variety of people can use the currency without losing its integrity against forgery, inflation, and theft.\nAn individual or group communicating under the name \"Satoshi Nakamoto\" brought Bitcoin to the Internet in 2009. Satoshi's breakthrough with money was to provide social scalability via trust minimization: reducing vulnerability to counterparties and third parties alike. By substituting computationally expensive but automated security for computationally cheap but institutionally expensive traditional security, Satoshi gained a nice increase in social scalability. A set of partially trusted intermediaries replaces a single and fully trusted intermediary.\nFinancial controls on computational steroids: a blockchain as an army of robots, each checking up on each other's work.  \nWhen we can secure the most important functionality of a financial network by computer science rather than by the traditional accountants, regulators, investigators, police, and lawyers, we go from a system that is manual, local, and of inconsistent security to one that is automated, global, and much more secure. Cryptocurrencies, when implemented properly on public blockchains, can substitute an army of computers for a large number of traditional banking bureaucrats. \" These block chain computers will allow us to put the most crucial parts of our online protocols on a far more reliable and secure footing, and make possible fiduciary interactions that we previously dared not do on a global network.\" ( Source )   The characteristics most distinctively valuable in blockchain technology in general, and Bitcoin in particular — for example independence from existing institutions for its basic operations ability to operate seamlessly across borders\ncome from the high levels of security and reliability a blockchain can maintain without human intervention. Without that high security it's just a gratuitously wasteful distributed database technology still tied to the local bureaucracies it would have to depend upon for its integrity.\nSince the mid-20 th century computing has increased in efficiency by many orders of magnitude, but humans are using the same brains. This has created plenty of possibility for overcoming human limitations, and institutions based solely on human minds, with computational capabilities, including in security, doing what they do best, with human minds doing what they still do best. As a result, humans have no",

They leave the Oireachtas this week with four of the Taoiseach's nominees who are not contesting the Seanad election.\n\nThe Oireachtas said on Wednesday that more than €14 million had been set aside to cover the pension and associated costs of the TDs and Senators expected to step down ahead of this election.\n\nFormer Labour party leader Pat Rabbitte announced last summer that after 26 years as a TD he would not be seeking re-election in Dublin South West in the 2016 general election.\n\nEamon Gilmore and Ruairí Quinn, also former leaders of the party, will not run in the February 26th general election either.\n\nOther TDs stepping down include Fine Gael's Olivia Mitchell, Fianna Fáil's Séamus Kirk, and Sandra McLellan of Sinn Féin.\n\nSocialist Party TD Joe Higgins, who announced in 2014 he would not stand in the next general election, has said he will continue to assist activists in Dublin West.\n\nTwo Senators have confirmed they are retiring from the Upper House: Feargal Quinn (Ind), a Senator since 1993 on the NUI panel; and Jim Walsh (FF), a Senator since 1997 on the agriculture panel.\n\nSome 20 Senators are running for the Dáil, including Paul Bradford (Renua, Cork East), Thomas Byrne (FF, Louth), Fidelma Healy-Eames (Ind, Galway West) and Susan O'Keeffe (Lab, Sligo-Leitrim).\n\nEstimated figure\n\nA spokesman for the Oireachtas confirmed an estimated figure of €14.325 million had been included for pension costs in the 2016 Statement of Estimates for the Houses of the Oireachtas Service.\n\nTDs and Senators who are stepping down will be entitled to receive termination payments, a pension and a lump sum when they retire or fail to get elected.\n\nTermination payments operate in the same way as redundancy payments to provide a financial cushion should an Oireachtas member lose his or her seat. The payments reflect the number of years of continuous service.\n\nA TD's or Senator's basic pension is calculated by dividing his or her salary by 40 and multiplying it by the number of years they have served in the Dáil/Seanad, capped at 20 years.\n\nTDs and Senators are also entitled to a once-off pension lump sum of three times their annual pension.\n\nFor example, a TD to which the 20-year cap applies would receive €46,336 annually and a lump sum of €139,008 on retirement.\n\nOn top of this, TD and Senators who have served more than six months in the Oireachtas are also entitled to a termination lump sum equal to two months' salary (for a TD, this sum is currently €15,445).\n\nIf TDs/Senators have served for longer than three years they are also entitled to up to 12 monthly payments based on their length of service (for a TD the maximum payment total over 12 months is €57,920).\n\nOnly after these payments end do they begin to get an annual pension.\n\nMinisterial positions attract a pension entitlement over and above that earned by a TD or Senator.\n\nTo receive this pension entitlement, a TD/Senator has to have served for at least two years in one of these offices.\n\nTDs retiring from the Dáil:\n\nLabour:\n\nPat Rabbitte\n\nRuairí Quinn\n\nEamon Gilmore\n\nJack Wall\n\nMichael Conaghan\n\nSean Kenny\n\nRobert Dowds\n\nFine Gael:\n\nOlivia Mitchell\n\nDinny McGinley\n\nDan Neville\n\nFrank Feighan\n\nLiam Twomey\n\nBrian Walsh\n\nFianna Fáil:\n\nSeamus Kirk\n\nJohn Browne\n\nMichael Kitt\n\nSinn Féin:\n\nMichael Colreavy\n\nSandra McLellan\n\nSocialist Party:\n\nJoe Higgins\n\nSenators retiring from the Upper House:\n\nFeargal Quinn (Ind)\n\nJim Walsh (FF)\n\nTaoiseach's nominees who are not contesting the Seanad election:\n\nFiach Mac Conghail\n\nMary Ann O'Brien\n\nMarie-Louise O'Donnell\n\nJillian van Turnhout\n\nSenators who are running for the Dáil:\n\nPaul Bradford (Renua, Cork East)\n\nThomas Byrne (FF, Louth)\n\nDavid Cullinane (SF, Waterford)\n\nMichael D'Arcy (FG, Wexford)",
      "Google is using the excitement of getting presents on Christmas Day to get kids interested in computer coding.\n\nThe tech giant has launched a Santa Tracker that puts budding coders in the center of St. Nick's North Pole town, where kids can unlock videos, games and music in the days leading up to Christmas. Educational lessons are sprinkled throughout the month, where kids learn skills such as JavaScript and cartography. There's also an interactive map to teach children how other cultures celebrate Christmas.\n\nThe game culminates on Christmas Eve, when users get behind the helm of Santa's high-tech sleigh dashboard and track his movements through the night with help from Google Maps through the site, apps or with Chromecast.\n\nSince releasing its diversity numbers earlier this year, Google has been rolling out programs to get children, especially girls and minorities, interested in coding early. The company's diversity report showed how overwhelmingly white and male the company was, and Google pledged to spearhead initiatives that could create a more robust workforce in the future.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoogle has since launched Made With Code, an initiative to help encourage school-aged girls to study computer science. The company also donates millions of dollars to support outreach programs like Black Girls Code, with plans to expand more high level computer science programs typically offered in predominately white, affluent schools. Blacks and Hispanics generally make up less than 5 percent of computer science degree holders. Minority computer science degree holders are often overlooked because tech companies don't recruit talent from historically black colleges and universities, which produce about 35 percent of black computer science majors.\n\nIn focusing on students, Google and other tech companies are attempting to close the gap in the workforce that starts before college. While 80 percent of high school students don't know what computer science majors learn, female students unfamiliar with the subject often believed it was \"boring\" and \"hard.\" Over two thirds of boys felt computer science would be a good career choice, while almost half of girls said a career in computers would be \"bad,\" with only 14 percent of boys agreeing with them. And despite the growing demand for tech jobs, only 1 percent of high school girls believed coding would be a part of their future.",

      "\"You have competition in your team,\" Stars coach Ken Hitchcock said. \"Smith took over, and he's not giving up ground. Els has a chance to play, and he has to grab it right back.\"\n\nThe two forwards have alternated healthy scratches at times but were both in the lineup Thursday because of an injury to center Martin Hanzal. Elie had the majority of games early in the season while Smith sat, but Smith played in his fifth consecutive game Thursday while Elie returned from two healthy scratches.\n\nCHICAGO -- Remi Elie and Gemel Smith are friends. They also are battling for the same ice time, so that can make things a little interesting.\n\nSmith is 23 with 30 games of NHL experience. Elie is 22 with 36 games.

The leaves are commonly cut off.\n\nVegetative growth The banana is a perennial herb that reaches the tree height and bears fruit within a year.

There are no lignification or secondary thickening of stems that is characteristic of trees.\n\nFlowering At 10 to 15 months after the emergence of a new plant, the shoot apex that is present at the ground level grows up through the center of the pseudostem and emerges as a gigantic terminal inflorescence. which bears fruit. The first female flowers covered by purplish bracts appear in groups ( hands) along the stem. The bracts are shed as the fruit stem develops. Female flower hands (from a few to more than 10) are followed by hands of male flowers. Typically, a bract rolls up and sheds to expose a new hand of flowers almost daily. The fruiting stalk is often covered to keep away insects and fruit-eating birds. In commercially grown banana, the large terminal bud and bracts are removed to redirect sugars to the developing fruits.\n\nMaturity All banana fruits are formed and are ready for harvest. Generally, a hand consists of 10–20 bananas, and there are 6–15 hands per stalk, which equals 40–50 kilograms per stalk or more than 10 tons per acre and per year. The fruit of a banana is a berry with a leathery outer peel. Banana usually are harvested after they reached a certain size but are still green. They are allowed to ripen while transported or being sold.",
      "The Libertarian Case Against Intellectual Property Rights\n\n\"It would be interesting to discover how far a seriously critical view of the benefits to society of the law of copyright … would have a chance of being publicly stated in a society in which the channels of expression are so largely controlled by people who have a vested interest in the existing situation.\" — Friedrich A. Hayek, \"The Intellectuals and Socialism\"\n\nA Dispute Among Libertarians\n\nThe status of intellectual property rights (copyrights, patents, and the like) is an issue that has long divided libertarians. Such libertarian luminaries as Herbert Spencer, Lysander Spooner, and Ayn Rand have been strong supporters of intellectual property rights. Thomas Jefferson, on the other hand, was ambivalent on the issue, while radical libertarians like Benjamin Tucker in the last century and Tom Palmer in the present one have rejected intellectual property rights altogether.\n\nWhen libertarians of the first sort come across a purported intellectual property right, they see one more instance of an individual's rightful claim to the product of his labor. When libertarians of the second sort come across a purported intellectual property right, they see one more instance of undeserved monopoly privilege granted by government.\n\nI used to be in the first group. Now I am in the second. I'd like to explain why I think intellectual property rights are unjustified, and how the legitimate ends currently sought through the expedient of intellectual property rights might be secured by other, voluntary means.\n\nThe Historical Argument\n\nIntellectual property rights have a tainted past. Originally, both patents and copyrights were grants of monopoly privilege pure and simple. A printing house might be assigned a \"copyright\" by royal mandate, meaning that only it was allowed to print books or newspapers in a certain district; there was no presumption that copyright originated with the author. Likewise, those with political pull might be assigned a \"patent,\" i.e., an exclusive monopoly, over some commodity, regardless of whether they had had anything to do with inventing it. Intellectual property rights had their origin in governmental privilege and governmental protectionism, not in any zeal to protect the rights of creators to the fruits of their efforts. And the abolition of patents was one of the rallying cries of the 17th-century Levellers (arguably the first libertarians).\n\nNow this by itself does not prove that there is anything wrong with intellectual property rights as we know them today. An unsavory past is not a decisive argument against any phenomenon; many worthwhile and valuable things arose from suspect beginnings. (Nietzsche once remarked that there is nothing so marvelous that its past will bear much looking into.) But the fact that intellectual property rights originated in state oppression should at least make us pause and be very cautious before embracing them.\n\nThe Ethical Argument\n\nEthically, property rights of any kind have to be justified as extensions of the right of individuals to control their own lives. Thus any alleged property rights that conflict with this moral basis — like the \"right\" to own slaves — are invalidated. In my judgment, intellectual property rights also fail to pass this test. To enforce copyright laws and the like is to prevent people from making peaceful use of the information they possess. If you have acquired the information legitimately (say, by buying a book), then on what grounds can you be prevented from using it, reproducing it, trading it? Is this not a violation of the freedom of speech and press?\n\nIt may be objected that the person who originated the information deserves ownership rights over it. But information is not a concrete thing an individual can control; it is a universal, existing in other people's minds and other people's property, and over these the originator has no legitimate sovereignty. You cannot own information without owning other people.\n\nSuppose I write a poem, and you read it and memorize it. By memorizing it, you have in effect created a \"software\" duplicate of the poem to be stored in your brain. But clearly I can claim no rights over that copy so long as you remain a free and autonomous individual. That copy in your head is yours and no one else's.\n\nBut now suppose you proceed to transcribe my poem, to make a \"hard copy\" of the information stored in your brain. The materials you use — pen and ink — are your own property. The information template which you used — that is, the stored memory of the poem — is also your own property. So how can the hard copy you produce from these materials be anything but yours to publish, sell, adapt, or otherwise treat as you please?\n\nAn item of intellectual property is a universal. Unless we are to believe in Platonic Forms, universals as such do not exist, except insofar as they are realized in their many particular instances. Accordingly, I do not see how anyone can claim to own, say, the text of Atlas Shrugged unless that amounts to a claim to own every single physical copy of Atlas Shrugged. But",

Those who meditate on the Gita will derive fresh joy and new meanings from it every day.\n\nHenry David Thoreau: In the morning I bathe my intellect in the stupendous and cosmogonal philosophy of the Bhagavad-gita, in comparison with which our modern world and its literature seem puny and trivial.\n\nDr. Albert Schweitzer: The Bhagavad-Gita has a profound influence on the spirit of mankind by its devotion to God which is manifested by actions.\n\nSri Aurobindo: The Bhagavad-Gita is a true scripture of the human race a living creation rather than a book, with a new message for every age and a new meaning for every civilization.\n\nCarl Jung: The idea that man is like unto an inverted tree seems to have been current in by gone ages. The link with Vedic conceptions is provided by Plato in his Timaeus in which it states…\" behold we are not an earthly but a heavenly plant.\" This correlation can be discerned by what Krishna expresses in chapter 15 of Bhagavad-Gita.\n\nPrime Minister Nehru: The Bhagavad-Gita deals essentially with the spiritual foundation of human existence. It is a call of action to meet the obligations and duties of life; yet keeping in view the spiritual nature and grander purpose of the universe.\n\nHerman Hesse: The marvel of the Bhagavad-Gita is its truly beautiful revelation of life's wisdom which enables philosophy to blossom into religion.\n\nRalph Waldo Emerson: I owed a magnificent day to the Bhagavad-gita. It was the first of books; it was as if an empire spoke to us, nothing small or unworthy, but large, serene, consistent, the voice of an old intelligence which in another age and climate had pondered and thus disposed of the same questions which exercise us.\n\nRudolph Steiner: In order to approach a creation as sublime as the Bhagavad-Gita with full understanding it is necessary to attune our soul to it.\n\nAdi Shankara: From a clear knowledge of the Bhagavad-Gita all the goals of human existence become fulfilled. Bhagavad-Gita is the manifest quintessence of all the teachings of the Vedic scriptures.\n\nAldous Huxley: The Bhagavad-Gita is the most systematic statement of spiritual evolution of endowing value to mankind. It is one of the most clear and comprehensive summaries of perennial philosophy ever revealed; hence its enduring value is subject not only to India but to all of humanity.\n\nRamanuja: The Bhagavad-Gita was spoken by Lord Krishna to reveal the science of devotion to God which is the essence of all spiritual knowledge. The Supreme Lord Krishna's primary purpose for descending and incarnating is relieve the world of any demoniac and negative, undesirable influences that are opposed to spiritual development, yet simultaneously it is His incomparable intention to be perpetually within reach of all humanity.\n\nBhaktisiddhanta Saraswati: The Bhagavad-Gita is not seperate from the Vaishnava philosophy and the Srimad Bhagavatam fully reveals the true import of this doctrine which is transmigation of the soul. On perusal of the first chapter of Bhagavad-Gita one may think that they are advised to engage in warfare. When the second chapter has been read it can be clearly understood that knowledge and the soul is the ultimate goal to be attained. On studying the third chapter it is apparent that acts of righteousness are also of high priority. If we continue and patiently take the time to complete the Bhagavad-Gita and try to ascertain the truth of its closing chapter we can see that the ultimate conclusion is to relinquish all the conceptualized ideas of religion which we possess and fully surrender directly unto the Supreme Lord.\n\nMadhvacarya: The Mahabharata has all the essential ingredients necessary to evolve and protect humanity and that within it the Bhagavad-Gita is the epitome of the Mahabharata just as ghee is the essence of milk and pollen is the essence of flowers.",
      "Here is a photo that made me obsessed with birds. It was taken during walk in the park alone with the temperature -14 C. It was really cold and all the trees were covered up in frost. Suddenly a swarm of those birds appeared and started to eat viscum berries with exceptional greed. I have got my recently bought first tele lens. It was a Canon EF-S 55-250mm f/4-5.6 IS and I was walking to test it for the first time at the wilderness. Camera was Canon Rebel XSi DSLR Camera . So that was the moment that excited me to buy new gear and progress with my photo skills. That was worth it by every moment that happened in my life about it. It was also the first time I have really used a manual camera settings for the moving subjects on the go. I was really using auto settings before this. SO here is the actual image. (Only one from about 100)\nFull Flickr version:\nCanon Rebel XSi, Canon EF-S 55-250 ƒ4-5.6 IS, at 250mm, ISO800, 1/125, ƒ/7.1",
      "Tip:\n\nWarning:\n\nWhat you'll Need:\n\n- A proper spoke wench. For square nipples, use the type that grab at least three corners (Park Tool and DT Swiss make the best).\n\n- Some wheels use tiny hex nuts and others have special splined nipples. - If your wheels have bladed spokes, you may need a second, slotted wrench to keep the spoke from twisting. Mavic (top) and Shimano (lower left) are equipped with slotted wrenches.\n\n- Not shown, but handy, is a felt tip pen to mark the apex of each wobble.\n\nPinkbike's Five-Minute Wheel True\n\nStep one: Assess the wheel. Put the bike in a stand or simply turn it upside down and give the wheel a spin. Runout (sideways wobble) over one millimeter (1/16-inch) is worth fussing with. At or below that threshold is a perfectly acceptable wheel for disc-brake bikes. Finally, watch the rim as the wheel spins for any significant flat spots. The rim must be round to remain strong. A little flat spot can be nursed for a long time, but a big one usually means game-over and a rim replacement.\n\nStep two: work around the wheel and squeeze each spoke. You are searching for either a loose pair or a loner that is significantly looser than the rest. It may help to squeeze the spokes of a good wheel to establish a base line.\n\nTip: Plink each spoke with a fingernail and listen to the tone. All the spokes on one side of the hub should ring about the same. A significantly lower note signals a low-tensioned spoke.\n\nStep three: Begin at the valve stem and work around the wheel, tensioning the slack spokes. Tighten the nipples one-half turn and then reverse about a quarter of a revolution. This unwinds the spoke and ensures that you are turning the threads each time. Bring up the slack spokes about 90 percent of the properly tensioned spokes and don't worry about rim runout yet. If you have bladed spokes, grasp the bladed part close to the nipple with the slotted wrench and only tension the spokes one fourth revolution at a time.\n\nStep four: With the bike in a stand, or up-side down, brace your hand against the frame or fork and place the spoke wrench just close enough to the side of the spinning rim to hear it grind against the largest wobble in the wheel. Rock the wheel back and forth until you find the spoke nearest to the apex of the wobble. Hold that spoke or mark the side of the rim with a felt tip pen.\n\nStep five: Always work out rim runout in groups of three spokes. The middle spoke at the apex of the wobble is flanked by two spokes that originate from the opposite side of the hub. First loosen the spokes (or spoke) from the hub flange that is closest to the apex of the wobble about a half turn. Next, tighten the spokes (or spoke) that originate from the opposite side of the apex the same amount. Recheck the runout and repeat until it shrinks to about a millimeter and then move on to the next wobble. Work around the wheel in sequence until you have reduced each trouble spot to about a millimeter on both sides of the rim.\n\nStep six. Recheck spoke tension with a feel or a plink test. If the spokes are closely matched, then you are done. If there are some low-tensioned spokes left, then begin at the valve stem and tension every spoke one-fourth turn. This will bring up the tension in the entire wheel and help push the rim outwards to stretch the errant ones.\n\nStep seven: Give the spokes a final plink test and spin the wheel to assess that the runout is within a millimeter or so. If its within 85 to 90-percent of new, you are gold.\n\nI think I'll use those wheel truing tips to... ...remind me to leave the spoke wrench in my tool box and take my wheels to a bike shop.\n\n...check out my wheels and give it a go.\n\n...poop on Responses: 4210 Faves: 8 Comments: 2\n\nPast Tech Tuesdays\n\nWire-spoke wheels are simple, strong and lightweight, but each component depends upon its neighbors for protection. As long as the spokes are evenly tensioned and the rim is round, the force of an impact is distributed around the circumference of the wheel. As stress and damage cause individual spokes to loosen, the job is shouldered by fewer spokes in tension. If you let all the spokes go slack, then the job of supporting the rider and his or her botched landings goes to the few spokes that happen to oppose the vector of force – which",

      "Victor® Clean-Kill™ Mouse Trap - 4 Traps\n\nWhen Ralph Waldo Emerson, coined the phrase \"Build a better mousetrap and the world will beat a path to your door,\" in the late nineteenth century, this is the trap they were talking about. Why? Because the Victor® Clean-Kill™ Mouse Trap is unlike other traps in that it offers a no-see, no-touch experience with easy, stress-free baiting and setting.\n\nThese clever little covered rodent traps look like a perfectly innocent little tunnel for unsuspecting mice. Once the mouse enters the trap to take the bait, however, it's in the perfect position for the Kill-Gate™ to produce a quick, humane Clean-Kill™. The unique tunnel design increases mouse interaction, and since the bait trough is located at the back of the trap, bait theft is a thing of the past.\n\nTo empty the trap, simply hold the setting button down, while pulling up on the Kill Gate™ to dispose of the dead mouse. The Clean-Kill™ doesn't use chemicals or poisons, so it's ideal for households with children or pets. Plus, it's highly durable plastic construction means the Clean-Kill™ can be used over and over or disposed of at your discretion.\n\nEasy-to-use instructions for setting the Clean-Kill™ are printed directly on the covered mouse trap. Here's how it works:\n\nOpen the bait door located on the back of the trap. Using a Q-tip, toothpick or other tool to mask your scent, bait the trap by placing peanut butter or anything high in protein like chocolate or hazelnut spread in the bait trough. Close the bait door. Hold down the setting button while pulling up on the Kill-Gate™ to set the trap. Place the trap wherever you've seen signs of rodent activity, or along the wall where rodents primarily travel. Two traps should be used and placed back-to-back lengthwise against the wall. After the mouse is caught, properly dispose of the dead rodent. The trap can either be discarded or reused.\n\nWhich Trap is Right for You?",
      "A few people pointed me to this editorial by D. Stephen Lindsay, the new editor of Psychological Science, a journal that in recent years has been notorious for publishing (and, even more notoriously, promoting) click-bait unreplicable dead-on-arrival noise-mining tea-leaf-reading research papers. It was getting so bad for awhile that they'd be publishing multiple such studies in a single issue (see, for example, slides 15 and 16 of this presentation) or just enter Psychological Science in the search box on this blog).\n\nThis editorial seems great. Lindsay talks about replication problems and how researchers should do better. He warns about p-hacking, noise, and the difference between significance and non-significance not being itself statistically significant. In his letter he never quite says that Psychological Science itself has published papers with weak to no statistical evidence, but I guess that's a political thing. Best in my opinion would be to (1) acknowledge current and past problems and then (2) do better in the future.\n\nBut if the Association for Psychological Science is too constrained to do (1), I'm still happy for them to do (2).\n\nLindley concludes with this upbeat statement:\n\nThe editors of Psychological Science are confident that we can reduce the rate at which Type I errors are published without compromising other values (e.g., interestingness, relevance, elegance), and that is what we intend to do.\n\nI believe in type 1 error about as much as I believe in yoga, kings, elvis, zimmerman, and beatles, but I appreciate the general sentiment. To be more precise, I might expect a decline in interestingness but an increase in relevance.\n\nMeasurement, measurement, measurement (and design): Doing better statistics is fine, but we really need to be doing better psychological measurement and designing studies to make the best use of these measurements\n\nThere is one big thing I'd add to Lindsay's statement, and that's measurement and design.\n\nLindsay does talk about low power, which you get when data are noisy, but I don't think this is enough. I worry that readers of his note will get the impression that non-replicability is a statistical problem or maybe a procedural problem to be solved by reforms such as preregistration and minimization of p-hacking. But fundamentally I think it's more of a problem of measurement and study design, a point I've been making for the past year or so in this space.\n\nOne reason so many of these Psychological Science studies are so dead on arrival is that they hinge on noisy measurements in uncontrolled, between-subject designs. That puts you right here, and no amount of preregistration or fancy statistics is going to solve your problems.\n\nWhen people asked me if I thought the fat-arms-and-voting study or the ovulation-and-clothing study or the ovulation-and-voting study should be subject to preregistered replications, I said: sure, if you want to replicate these studies, go for it, but I wouldn't really recommend wasting your time. The measurements are so noisy that such replications would be primarily of methodological interest, just to demonstrate that with new random data you'll be able to find new random patterns.\n\nSo I'd love it if the official statement from the Psychological Science editor emphasized that performing more replicable studies is not just a matter of being more careful in your data analysis (although that can't hurt) or increasing your sample size (although that, too, should only help) but also it's about putting real effort into design and measurement. All too often I feel like I'm seeing the attitude that statistical significance is a win or a proof of correctness, and I think this pushes researchers in the direction of going the cheap route, rolling the dice, and hoping for a low p-value that can be published. But when measurements are biased, noisy, and poorly controlled, even if you happen to get that p less than .05, it won't really be telling you anything.\n\nAnd some other things\n\nAs noted above, I like Lindsay's editorial. But there are a few places where I'd say things differently.\n\nI'm loath to make these comments because I don't want to dilute the major points I just made above, and I certainly don't want to piss of Lindsay, who seems to be on my side in this general issue.\n\nBut ultimately I think I'm more effective when I just say what I think (at least, when it comes to my areas of expertise). So here goes. But, again, let me emphasize that in my pickiness here, I'm just trying to help, I'm not trying to get into any fights.\n\n\n1. Garden of forking paths. Lindsay decries \"p-hacking\": \"practices that inflate the Type I error rate, such as (a) dropping",
      "A Guatemalan family living in Edmonton is set to be torn apart and deported.\n\nThe family signed papers of their deportation Tuesday morning at an immigration office in Edmonton. On July 10, the family's four youngest children will return to the United States where they have citizenship. The parents and oldest son will be deported back to Guatemala two days later, the difference in dates to allow the parents to say goodbye to their children.\n\n\"There are people looking out for us (in Guatemala) who want us to die,\" said Jilmar David Picon through a friend, Adriana Hernandez, who acted as a translator Tuesday. \"That's what we were running away from.\"\n\nPicon, his wife Yolanda Duarte Martinez and his oldest son, Edison, will return to a town near the Central American country's western border with Mexico.\n\n\"I was beaten by the gang members and I was shot at,\" Picon said about why he fears for his life in Guatemala.\n\nThe family said they were scammed by a former co-worker of Martinez's who worked as a translator between them and a lawyer to help apply for permanent residency on compassionate and humanitarian grounds. In November 2016, the Canadian Border Services Agency notified the family none of the documents required for the application had been submitted. They haven't heard from Martinez's co-worker since.\n\nThe family first arrived in Canada in 2011 from the United States, where they lived as undocumented migrants. The youngest four children were born in Alabama. The family applied for refugee status here, but the application and an appeal were both denied.\n\nA new application for permanent residency has been received by the Canadian government, but has not been reviewed. The family is pleading with federal Immigration Minister Ahmed Hussen and local members of Parliament to assist in having their dates of deportation pushed back to allow time for their application to be reviewed.\n\n\"Before, I had money to pay off the gangs when they requested money, but now I don't have any money. When I was in the United States, I received a call and they told me they were waiting for my return,\" Picon said.\n\nPicon said he has proof family members who didn't flee Guatemala were killed and that signing the deportation documents Tuesday was like \"signing my son's death sentence, signing my wife's death sentence.\"",
      "VALLEJO, Calif. (Sept. 18, 2015)– A woman says she is kidnapped, sexually assaulted and held for three days. When she is freed, police publicly cast doubt on her story. They imply the whole thing may have been a hoax.\n\nDenise Huskins alleges police in Vallejo, California, did just that and has filed a claim against the city and three police officers. But it gets worse, according to the document, which adds new allegations to an already bizarre case.\n\nWhen her boyfriend, Aaron Quinn, alerted police and asked for help in March, they scoffed at his story of how kidnappers broke into his home the previous night while they slept and took Huskins away, the claim said.\n\nAnd police endangered her life by cutting off contact between Quinn and the kidnappers, who said they'd be in touch with him about ransom demands, the claim said.\n\n18-hour interrogation\n\nInstead of helping, police accused Quinn of killing Huskins and fabricating the kidnapping as a cover, the claim said. While the kidnappers tormented her, detectives put him through the wringer with 18 hours of grueling interrogation, it said.\n\nAnd that was the second round of agony for Quinn. Before he met the detective, the kidnappers had tied him up, blindfolded him and knocked him cold with a sedative, the claim said.\n\nCNN has left a phone message with the Vallejo Police Department requesting comment on the allegations against three of its officers.\n\nThe Vallejo Times-Herald said the Vallejo Police Department declined to comment on the claim because it's a pending civil case.\n\nWhen Huskins' story first broke, police publicly cast doubts about Quinn's account.\n\n\"The statement Mr. Quinn provided was such an unbelievable story we initially had a hard time believing it and, upon further investigation, were not able to substantiate any of the things he was saying,\" Vallejo Police Lt. Kenny Park said at the time.\n\nHe called the case a \"wild goose chase\" that had wasted police resources.\n\nKidnappers' messages blocked\n\nThe kidnappers had told Quinn to watch his cell phone for messages about their ransom demands of $17,000, but police separated him from his phone and did not watch it themselves for the kidnappers' messages, the claim said.\n\n\"The officers never paid attention to this obvious lead as to the location of Denise,\" according to the document.\n\nAnd the messages came.\n\n\"As Aaron told the officers would occur, the kidnapper reached out both by email and phone. At 7:46 p.m. and 8:13 p.m., while Aaron was being detained, the kidnapper sent emails stating that he would call Aaron on his mobile device 'at about 9pm.' The kidnapper followed through with phone calls,\" the document said.\n\nBut police detectives allegedly put Quinn's cell phone on airplane mode.\n\nKidnapper's guilty conscience\n\nThe case got national attention because of the alleged kidnappers' surprising behavior. The kidnappers allegedly freed Huskins on the third day of her abduction.\n\nWhen police cast doubt on Huskins' story, the alleged kidnappers apparently emailed a local newspaper to express outrage.\n\nThe San Francisco Chronicle received one that was 3½ pages long. Two days later, came another essay that was 20 printed pages long — and railed against the way police treated Huskins and Quinn.\n\n\"We cannot stand to see two good people thrown under the bus by the police and media, when Ms. Victim F (Huskins) and Mr. Victim M (Quinn) should have received only support and sympathy,\" the email read. \"We are responsible for the victims' suffering and the least we can do is come forward to prove they are not lying.\"\n\nThe email described the group of kidnappers as three old friends who thought some crime might be exciting and had stolen some cars before turning to kidnapping.\n\nSuffering with character\n\nBut watching Huskins suffer and do so with character had turned them off to abduction, the email said. It said her character had helped stop an abduction ring before it could get off the ground.\n\nHowever, another incident in California matched Huskins.\n\nOn June 5, Alameda County Sheriff's detectives began investigating a break-in similar to the one that Huskins and Quinn said they had experienced.\n\nA husband and wife were in a home in Dublin. The husband broke free and fought back.\n\nThe assailant fled, leaving his cell phone behind. Police traced it to Matthew Muller, a Harvard law graduate and a former Marine. Police also found a stolen car at his address that contained objects Huskins had described in her kidnapping.\n\nMuller was charged with one count of kidnapping in the case.\n\nHuskins' lawyer Douglas Rappaport said the",

In fact, they have existed inside North America since at least 1980.\n\nImagine that during the height of World War II--a few short years after the worst attack against America--you are taking a scenic drive through the woods of upstate New York and somehow--merely by accident--you stumble upon a group of men of Japanese ethnicity engaged in firearms training. You quietly stand out of sight in the brush, hearing them pledge their allegiance to Emperor Hirohito and watch as they practice their combat skills they intend to use against you and your fellow Americans at some time in the future. Frozen somewhere between fear and curiosity, you watch them until they break up, each entering different vehicles. You follow one of the vehicles carrying two male occupants back into town, and find out that one of the men works for a utility company in the Finger Lakes while the other is employed at a steel mill near Buffalo. Based on your observations and concerned about possible spies working in essential American jobs, you notify the authorities, but you are assured that the men have \"checked out\" and were found to be no risk to national security. But, you know what you saw and care for the security and future of America. Unconvinced, you continue to report your concerns until you are ultimately labeled a bigot and an alarmist.Inconceivable? At that time, when America was at war, when the majority of Americans understood what was at stake and when the mind of every American was focused on the security of the country, such a scenario would be unlikely. Today, unfortunately, America as a nation is at war while most Americans are at the mall.\n\nIn a 2002 commentary, Arnaud de Borchgrave, editor at large for The Washington Times, wrote that \"Politico-religious extremists in Pakistan… have convinced themselves that 'in the next 10 years, Americans will wake up to the existence of an Islamic army in their midst - an army of jihadis who will force America to abandon imperialism and listen to the voice of Allah.'\" In that same article, he references the number of criminals being recruited for this Islamic army, and cites demographics to make his points clear. Our investigation confirms the almost prophetic observations of Mr. de Borchgrave, noting, however, that it has not taken ten years. The army is already here.\n\nAn Islamic army operating in North America\n\nThis is the disturbing conclusion of a comprehensive, 5-year investigation conducted by professional multi-state licensed investigators of the Northeast Intelligence Network and investigative journalists of Canada Free Press (CFP). Our findings are the result of extensive covert surveillance operations, field investigations, numerous interviews, and research into paramilitary training and activities by Islamic \"extremists\" living and working among us in North America. They have been cited in various publications and books such as The Day of Islam by Dr. Paul Williams, reports authored by federal and state law enforcement agencies, and have recently warranted casual mentions in a number of major media venues.\n\nSince publishing our reports pertaining to Islamberg--a private Muslim compound located at the western edge of the Catskill Mountains in Hancock, NY and associated with the Pakistani-based terrorist organization Jamaat ul Fuqra, public interest and concerns by law enforcement about potential terror training camps in existence in North America have intensified unlike any other report we have published to date. Many who once believed that terrorist training camps could not possibly exist in the U.S., or thought their existence to be that of urban legend, or a fabrication of \"neocons\" are beginning to realize that the vast expanse of the U.S. and Canada offers near perfect conditions for such camps to be operating without detection.\n\nRecruiting the Islamic Army\n\nIt is said that necessity is the mother of invention. When U.S. and coalition forces destroyed the jihad training camps in Afghanistan, the Islamic terrorists disseminated their instructional material via the Internet and employed jihadist leaders in North America to assist in the coordination of training camps. Such leaders of jihad actively recruit their members from American prisons, most who are African-Americans. It might come as a surprise to learn that only about 10 percent of American Muslims are of Arab descent. U.S.-born African-Americans account for over 40 percent, and immigrants from southern Asia account for an additional 24 percent. The National Islamic Prison Foundation, a country-wide campaign to convert inmates to Islam, boasts an average of nearly 150,000 conversions to Islam per year--and that number is climbing. Recent statistics show that more than 10 percent of the 2-plus million U.",

Pendulum Monsters are placed face-up in the Extra Deck when they would be sent from the field to the Graveyard, but when sent from the Deck, they are sent to the Graveyard normally.\n\nhttp://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/faq_search.action?ope=5&fid=9098&keyword=&tag=0\n\nQ: I activate the effect of Lavalval Chain, and my opponent chains the effect of Yuki Usagi. Furthermore, if I chain Book of Moon, changing Lavalval Chain to face-down Defense Position, how are the effects applied?\n\nA: The effect of Yuki Usagi does not target. In this situation, when its effect resolves, Lavalval Chain will be destroyed even if it is now in face-down Defense Position. (Even so, the effect of Lavalval Chain is applied normally.)\n\nhttp://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/faq_search.action?ope=5&fid=6334&keyword=&tag=0\n\nQ: During the turn Gandora the Dragon of Destruction is Normal or Flip Summoned, it is banished by Interdimensional Matter Transporter, and then returns to the field during the End Phase. In this case, will the effect of Grandora the Dragon of Destruction which sends it to the Graveyard still activate?\n\nA: If Gandora the Dragon of Destruction was Normal Summoned this turn, then banished by Interdimensional Matter Transporter and returns to the field during the End Phase, the effect of Gandora the Dragon of Destruction will still activate normally and it will be sent to the Graveyard. Also, if Gandora the Dragon of Destruction was Flip Summoned, then banished by Interdimensional Matter Transporter and returned during the End Phase, it is not treated as having been Flip Summoned this turn, so its effect will not activate during the End Phase and it will remain on the field.\n\nhttp://www.db.yugioh-card.com/yugiohdb/faq_search.action?ope=5&fid=9992&keyword=&tag=0\n\nQ: If Atlantean Dragoons, Atlantean Marksman, Atlantean Heavy Infantry, or Neptabyss the Atlantean Prince are sent to the Graveyard to activate the effect of a WATER monster, but the activation is negated by Divine Wrath, will the effect of Atlantean Dragoons, etc. still activate? Also, if Atlantean Dragoons, etc. are sent to the Graveyard to activate the effect of a WATER monster, but that effect is negated by Skill Drain, will the effect of Atlantean Dragoons, etc. still activate?\n\nA: The effects of Atlantean Dragoons, etc. activate if they are sent to the Graveyard to activate the effect of a WATER monster. Even if that effect is negated by Divine Wrath",
      "Serie A salaries revealed\n\nBy Football Italia staff\n\nGazzetta dello Sport has revealed its yearly player salary charts, with Juventus' Gonzalo Higuain the new best-paid player in Serie A.\n\nEvery season, the newspaper publishes its calculated list of the salaries and budgets in the Italian top-flight.\n\nFor several seasons, Roma's Daniele De Rossi has been the highest-paid player in the League, but Higuain's switch from Napoli to Juventus has brought him a contract of €7.5m net per season to De Rossi's €6.5m.\n\nThe Bianconeri have the highest player budget in the League at €145m, but Inter are not far behind on €120m.\n\nRoma are third on €92m, with Milan and Napoli spending €80m and €75m on their squads respectively, according to Gazzetta.\n\nAs the newspaper notes, however, performance-related bonuses cannot be taken into account which in effect means some players will be taking home much higher salaries.\n\nAs an example, Juventus' playing squad last season had a base salary of €125m, but club account show staff were paid €220m - most of which would of course be players.\n\nPerhaps unsurprisingly, Crotone have the lowest budget in the League, reported at just €14m for the season, with Lorenzo Crisetig their top-earner on €400,000 per season.\n\nOn the bench, Juventus Coach Max Allegri is the top-earner on €5m net per season after Roberto Mancini left Inter and took his €5.3m salary with him.\n\nLuciano Spalletti is in second place on €3m, with Roma actually paying out the most to Coaches this season.\n\nThat is because Rudi Garcia is still under contract for €2.8m net per season, given he has failed to find a new job over the summer.\n\nSee the latest Serie A predictions and betting tips with Eurotips.co.uk",

      "Fabian Cancellara's spring classics campaign comes to an unexpected end as he breaks two vertebrae in early crash on Friday\n\nHARELBEKE, Belgium (VN) — Fabian Cancellara's 2015 cobbled classics campaign ended before it began in earnest after a crash 39.4 kilometers into the E3 Harelbeke on Friday in Belgium. He fell on his left wrist and fractured two vertebrae according to early reports from the hospital.\n\n\"It all happened so fast. Someone slammed the brakes and there was no way to go, just straight into it,\" Cancellara said to AFP. \"I flew over a couple of riders and then landed in a pile of bikes. There were riders everywhere. I fell so hard and felt pain everywhere. It was sort of reflex to get back on the bike, but the pain was hard, in my lower back, left wrist, and my ribs on the back.\"\n\nThe Swiss classics champion — a three-time winner of both the Ronde van Vlaanderen (Tour of Flanders) and Paris-Roubaix — crashed on the cobbled Haaghoek sector with around 40 to 50 other riders. He continued for 10km more, but the pain was too much and he abandoned.\n\n\"I felt right away that it was a serious crash, but I wanted to try to keep going. I had to stop; the pain was too much. We went to the hospital for scans and this confirmed the pain.\"\n\n\"Unfortunately Fabian Cancellara has abandoned the race after his crash. We will keep you informed on his situation as soon as possible,\" Trek Factory Racing said on its Twitter account of Cancellara, who won the 2009, 2010, and 2013 editions of the race.\n\nA photo from the race showed Cancellara favoring his left wrist after the crash.\n\nAn update from journalists at the hospital confirmed he would have to end his classics campaign early. The problem was not his wrist, but his back. He will not require surgery, but will be forced to miss the upcoming classics.\n\n\"It seems that a water bottle fell on the cobbles and caused it,\" Trek sport director Dirk Demol told Sporza TV.\n\n\"He hit his wrist and the lower part of his back. He couldn't stay on the pedals anymore. He wasn't looking good at all.\"\n\nThe 34-year-old Swiss rider reportedly said his classics season is over. He is aiming to repeat in the Ronde van Vlaanderen on April 5 and Paris-Roubaix on April 12.\n\nCancellara went immediately to the hospital in Waregem for X-rays, which ended Demol's and the team's hopes for a quick recovery.\n\nMilano-Sanremo winner John Degenkolb (Giant-Alpecin) and Lars Boom (Astana) were also involved in the crash. They continued. Abandoning with Cancellara were Niccolò Bonifazio (Lampre-Merida), Robert Wagner (LottoNL-Jumbo), Sebastian Langeveld (Cannondale-Garmin), Vegard Breen, Gert Dockx (both Lotto-Soudal), Andrey Amador and Imanol Erviti (both Movistar).\n\nDemol said Cancellara would skip Gent-Wevelgem on Sunday, but his entire cobbled classics campaign could be a wash if his wrist is fractured. The update confirmed he could not continue, due to his back injury.\n\nIn 2012, Cancellara had to abandon the Ronde when he crashed and fractured his collarbone. He skipped Paris-Roubaix a week later. In 2013, he collected his third Paris-Roubaix title and in 2014, he did the same in the Ronde.\n\nCancellara's long-time rival Tom Boonen (Etixx-Quick-Step) already had to pull the plug on his 2015 classics campaign. The Belgian crashed and dislocated his shoulder in stage 1 of Paris-Nice earlier in March.\n\n\"There is nothing you can do with this injury — no cast, no surgery — but just biting the pain,\" he said.",

      "Greg Jennings admits he regrets what he said this summer, not what he did last spring.\n\nTranslating that, using the Athlete-to-English dictionary, we can surmise that he regrets the reaction to what he said this summer, and that he's devastated by what he did last spring.\n\nSunday, Jennings will face his former team, the Green Bay Packers, for the first time since he left them to sign with the Vikings in March.\n\nAsked in the Vikings locker room Wednesday about his summertime jabs at Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, Jennings offered an answer that would have been a reasonable response if he had been asked why he would leave Rodgers to play with Christian Ponder.\n\n\"At this point, it's behind me,'' he said. \"There's things that take place in life that you wish didn't happen. But you grow from it. I'll use 'crisis,' for instance. If a crisis occurred in your life — and you may have brought it on yourself — but if you focus on the crisis itself and not how to overcome the crisis, you're going to stay within the crisis. And that's kind of how I approach this situation.\n\n\"[Green Bay] is a phenomenal organization. I had to make my departure. There were some things said that, man, if I could say it over again, I would have to reword it so that it could be conveyed a little differently. But they were said. I can't focus on that. I have to focus on the now, on who I am and where I am now.''\n\nVideo (26:22): Reusse: Vikings QB controversy will get Frazier fired Video (26:22): Reusse: Vikings QB controversy will get Frazier fired\n\nJennings has angered Packers fans frequently in the past eight months. First, he signed with the Packers' rival. Second, he revealed in a radio interview with Jim Rome that former Packer-turned-Viking Brett Favre counseled him on the decision. Third, he told the Star Tribune in July that he had felt \"brainwashed' by playing with the Packers, and questioned the leadership skills of Rodgers.\n\nWhat has transpired since then couldn't have worked out better for the Packers and worse for Jennings if the ghost of Vince Lombardi was writing the script.\n\nWhen Ponder returns to the lineup Sunday, Jennings will be dealing with a fourth quarterback change in seven games. He played with two starting quarterbacks and one sub in Green Bay in seven years.\n\nWhile the Vikings have fallen apart as a team and an offense, the Packers have thrived despite the loss of Jennings, and injuries to receivers Jordy Nelson, James Jones and Randall Cobb and tight end Jermichael Finley.\n\nThe Vikings added an accomplished wide receiver and got worse. The Packers lost an accomplished wide receiver and seem not to have noticed. They are 4-2 and have developed a more balanced offense by emphasizing rookie running back Eddie Lacy.\n\nPackers coach Mike McCarthy said he listed Jennings' comments as one of his weekly \"media topics'' he wanted his players to be aware of, and Rodgers has deflected most questions about his relationship with Jennings.\n\n\"I don't think that's very important in this setting, this conversation,'' he said Wednesday on a conference call with Minnesota reporters.\n\nWould he seek out Jennings at the Metrodome? \"I'm just going to go through my preparation like I always do, and if I see him after the game, I see him,'' Rodgers said.\n\nIt will forever be difficult to mention the Vikings-Packers rivalry without invoking Brett Favre, and this week he again rears his stubbly chin.\n\nWhen the Packers decided to replace Favre with Rodgers, Favre became determined to not only continue his career, but to find a way to make the Packers pay for that decision. And, for one year, he made them pay, beating them twice in 2009.\n\nFavre was an unwilling mentor for Rodgers. He also threw his 500th career touchdown pass to Jennings at the Metrodome, and, according to one of Jennings' interviews, advised him to sign with Minnesota.\n\nRodgers and Jennings have this in common: Both proved the Packers were right.\n\nThey were right when they determined that Rodgers should be their franchise quarterback. They were right when they allowed Jennings to leave.\n\nWednesday, Jennings sounded as if he wanted to kiss and make up.\n\n\"I have a lot of love for everyone in that locker room,'' Jennings said of the Packers. \"I have no hatred for anyone in that locker room. I know this is a rivalry, but I have no hate for anyone over there. That organization was great to me, the fans were great to me, and the guys continue to be great to me. I still have a relationship with those guys. And I will forever have a relationship with those guys.\n",

(Photo: Louis Lanzano, AP)\n\nThe creator of some of the world's most beloved stuffed animals is getting no love from the IRS.\n\nTy Warner, who made billions when demand exploded for his Beanie Babies in the 1990s, was charged Wednesday with federal tax evasion, accused of failing to report more than $3 million he earned in a secret offshore account.\n\nWarner, 69, has agreed to plead guilty and will pay a civil penalty of $53.6 million, his lawyer, George Scandaglia, said in a statement.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate situation that Mr. Warner has been trying to resolve for several years now,\" Scandaglia said. \"Mr. Warner accepts full responsibility for his actions with this plea agreement.\"\n\nWarner, ranked 209th on Forbes Magazine's list of richest Americans with an estimated worth of $2.6 billion, generally sold his Beanie Babies for less than $10. At the peak of their popularity in the 1990s, resale of some favored versions could draw several times their retail value.\n\nWarner, who still sells a variety of stuffed toys through his company TY Inc., was charged in federal court in Chicago in connection with a probe of U.S. clients of Union Bank of Switzerland and other overseas banks that hid foreign accounts from the IRS.\n\nIn February 2009, UBS admitted it helped taxpayers hide accounts and agreed to provide the IRS with information on its clients and their accounts. Warner of Oak Brook, Ill., is cooperating with the IRS and will plead guilty to tax evasion, U.S. Attorney Gary Shapiro said in a statement.\n\nThe statement says Warner \"went to great lengths\" to hide more than $3 million in income generated from a secret Swiss account.\n\nAccording to the charging document, Warner maintained a secret offshore account with UBS starting in 1996. In late 2002, Warner transferred more than $93 million in assets in his UBS account to a second Swiss financial institution, Zürcher Kantonalbank.\n\nIn 2002, Warner earned approximately $3,161,788 in gross income through investments held in his UBS account, according to the charge. Warner allegedly committed tax evasion for that year by failing to tell his accountants about that income and by failing to report that income or the existence of the UBS account to the IRS.\n\nFederal tax law requires U.S. taxpayers pay taxes on all income earned worldwide. Tax evasion carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison.\n\nPat McCoy of Palatine, Ill., sorts through hundreds of Beanie Babies for children in Afghanistan on Sept. 3, 2013.

      "Manchester United are stepping up their efforts to sign Dani Alves on a free transfer according to Catalan newspaper Sport on Tuesday. Alves' contract with Barcelona runs out in June and Barcelona have spent much of the season dragging their feet, perhaps with the confidence that if they wanted to keep Alves he'd automatically want to stay. The Brazilian is very happy with his life in Barcelona but not equally thrilled with the way Barcelona have gone about a renewal and what is being offered to him, which is why no contract has been signed yet.\n\nBarcelona have for years looked at replacements for Alves, but that's easier said than done. Despite many being ready to criticise him, Alves has yet again shown during the current campaign that he's easily one of the best right backs in Europe and he's been one of Barcelona's best players this season outside of the trident upfront. The newspaper label him a 'physical wonder' and certainly don't believe the footballer, who turned 32 last week, is coming towards the end of his career.\n\nSport say that Manchester United had been confident Alves would turn Barcelona down and give in to their charms but recently they've become worried. That initially pushed them to set a deadline, which had zero impact, and then up their offer to Alves instead. The Catalan newspaper newspaper say Manchester United have offered a bigger signing on fee and that their proposal is far superior to Barcelona's. Sport expect the player will decide in a matter of days, and if that's in Manchester United's favour they could announce a deal immediately given his free transfer status.\n\nWith Alves being so happy in Barcelona, the odds will be stacked on a stay but Manchester United apparently still have hope and Sport say Louis van Gaal isn't even considering other options until he gets his Alves answer.",
      "First off, you're an awesome person. You're reading this because someone you know is touched by cancer and you want to know how to avoid hackneyed phrases and suggestions which tick them off. As a person who recently finished treatment for cancer (Hodgkins Lymphoma) and a physician, I'm happy to take you through a brief tour of 10 things not to say:\n\n10) How are you feeling?\n\nHow do you think they feel? They have cancer! How would you feel?! Next!\n\n9) Have you tried praying?\n\nReally? Now is the time you want to proclaim your faith? I write this as a person who believes in God: keep your personal beliefs to yourself. Not the time for missionary work.\n\n8) Have you tried yoga/natural health products/getting rid of your cellphone to cure yourself?\n\nMaybe it's just me as a physician, but they're probably on chemotherapy. Whatever your particular gripes are with the pharmaceutical companies (and you do have a point) chemotherapy has been trialed on tens of thousands, maybe hundreds of thousands of patients. The effects have been studied in depth. I received four rounds of ABVD chemotherapy because I believe in science and unlike yoga/kale/being gluten-free, it actually has been proven to cure my type of cancer.\n\n7) Are you going to lose your hair?\n\nYes, most of us lose our hair. But thanks to Breaking Bad, Walter White cancer chic is in. Rock it with pride.\n\n6) Have you heard from (insert ex-lover or ex-friend here)?\n\nIs this the best time to remind someone that the love they probably cultivated for years or the friends they once were close to didn't reach out to them? No. No it isn't.\n\n5) How are your parents/kids doing?\n\nThe whole family is so excited I have cancer! Said no one, ever. But, seriously what are they going to tell you other than everyone is doing the best they can?\n\n4) We should go out for dinner/clubbing/take a trip!\n\nHmm, restaurants and clubs are usually no-nos. Think infection control: where can I take this person where there are a small number of people, none of them children, and for a short time that breaks up the monotony of their house/bed rest?\n\n\n3) Think positive/read The Secret\n\nIs thinking positive and cultivating a happy and balanced outlook important to people with cancer? Absolutely. Is telling someone else to think positive even the slightest bit helpful? Not at all. And don't get me started on The Secret.\n\n2) You can beat this. You're strong.\n\nPeople don't die of cancer because they've \"lost the fight.\" That's an incredibly simplistic way of looking at it. People die of cancer because their tumor burden is simply too high and sometimes chemotherapy is ineffective depending on the type of cancer. This has nothing to do with their will to live, or their personal character, or how much suffering they've experienced.\n\n1) You'll be fine.\n\nAre you this person's physician? Are you just saying this because you want them to be fine but really know that no one knows how this is all going to play out? I hope so. I hope you face up to the reality that I did: that no one knows or has control over what happens in the course of any serious illness. Pretending everything is going to be fine is ridiculous and yes, condescending.\n\nHey! Now that this list is over, thanks for reading it. If you've said one of these phrases before, don't sweat it; you're at least one of the people who is trying to care about someone, so that makes you pretty great. What else can we ask for beyond someone trying to reach out to us? I'm the last person to actually give people a hard time over awkward but well-meaning phrases.\n\nIn the end, the most important thing to say to a person with cancer is anything at all. Because the isolation from cancer is sometimes the worst part of the disease. But here are my tips on a few good places to start:\n\n5 Things You Should Say\n\n5) Did you see the game last night?\n\nOne of my best friends called me a day before a round of chemotherapy to talk about football. I remember because we were talking about the Cowboys and I happen to like Tony Romo and was defending him as he played his heart out against the Broncos. But what I really appreciated about my friends' phone call was that it did not have anything to do with cancer. It was about normal guy stuff. Normal. It's almost enough to feel like winning the lottery to a cancer patient. Therefore you don't actually have to ask about football -- just ask about something normal. In fact, open up every conversation with something",

      "My Husband Died But My Journey Goes On\nOne year ago today my husband Seth passed away. Life has a very strange way of teaching people lessons. When Seth got sick at age 30, I thought that we were being taught some of the most important life lessons one could learn. I learned that life is precious. I learned that no one is immune to adversity. I learned to slow down and I learned to appreciate everything, especially the small things. But on that summer day in 2014, when Seth and I were told that there was a tumor on his sacrum and that he would need to be rushed to Boston for further work-up, I could not have imagined that the lessons had only just begun. I would never truly understand how important these lessons were for another 19 months.  One year ago to the day, my favorite person passed away in a cold, sterile, hospital room. The week prior he and I had sat down with his doctor to go over his advanced directives. It was his wish not to be put on life support and to die peacefully in our own home. He never did make it home like he had hoped to. Selfishly, I am so glad that he did not because one year later I am finally beginning to feel at peace inside our four walls. As I sat alone with Seth in the hospital room, and the doctor looked at me with those \"I'm sorry...\" eyes to tell me Seth had passed, I was in such despair that I never thought I would feel at peace again. A month later I moved back into our house and it felt so cold. It felt painfully quiet, eerie, and especially lonely. Today, as I write this I feel a sense of calmness come over me that I thought I may never experience again. One year later I feel the most at peace when I am home. Inside those four walls I can picture Seth sitting at the bottom of the stairs trying unsuccessfully to put his shoes on while the dog is jumping all over him. I shut my eyes and I can see him sleeping peacefully in bed while I was getting ready to leave for work. I would go over to kiss him on the forehead on my way out. In the basement, I can picture us where we lay sprawled out on the floor, bursting with excitement the very night we closed on our house. We were so proud that we had bought on our very first home together and that it was finally ours! When I am inside my house I feel closest to Seth because I am reminded of a beautiful family that loved each other dearly. It was only Seth, the dog, the cat and I. We never did have children together. But we were happy with our little unit that we called family.  Selfishly, I am glad that Seth never made it home. Had he been here when he passed, I am not sure that I could find this sense of peace from being home that I now so desperately try to hold on to.  Over the last year I have have been told over and over again how strong of a woman that I am. It is hard for me to believe that because it has been a long, very exhausting, journey. For days after Seth died I only ate pizza and drank coffee. I slept a lot and quite honestly I don't even remember planning the funeral or the memorial services. Somehow I managed to go back to work, to move back home, and I took care of all of the business needs that are required after someone dies. Looking back, I have no idea how I was capable of doing all of that. The process after someone dies is exhausting, and there is not much help that anyone can give you. When I reflect on all that I accomplished I understand why people consider me strong. But when you are going through this you feel nothing short of a failure. There is a constant feeling that something has been forgotten. Every piece of paperwork that needs to be completed and the accounts that need to be closed take multiple phone calls and multiple attempts to near completion. You begin to wonder why you are so stupid. You cannot understand why things are so difficult and why you don't do them right the first time. For the first year, every action that I took made me feel a tremendous amount of guilt. You wonder, am I honoring Seth right? Does Seth know that I loved him? If I do this, or go there, will other people think that I have moved on? Will people think that I have forgotten my husband? If I feel lonely and think about a day when I might find new love, does this mean I am cheating on my husband? What will our friends and family think of me just for thinking that I am saddened by the loss of sharing my life with someone? Why do I care so much what other people think? Do I really care what other people think or am I just judging myself for my thoughts because I don't want to have them? And so on. The first year has been a very long year filled with worries that I desperately wanted to get out of my head all",

On its website, UPS said the volume of last-minute air packages exceeded its capacity to process them.\n\nMerchants battling for market share during a ho-hum holiday season have been trying to outdo one another with deep discounts and promises that shoppers can wait as long as they want to order gifts online. While analysts say the shipping snafu is unlikely to make Americans abandon online shopping, they say parcel-delivery companies will have to boost capacity and retailers may need to seek alternatives to prevent a recurrence.\n\n\"You had a perfect storm of events from the consumer side, the retailer side and the shipping side,\" said Craig Johnson, president of Customer Growth Partners LLC in New Canaan, Connecticut. \"Normally those kinds of schedules are all kind of prepared or coordinated with the carriers.\"\n\nOn Dec. 21, Barnesville, Minnesota, resident Bernadette Odden ordered videos for one of her daughters from Amazon, which promised to deliver them on Christmas Eve.

Gardner declined to discuss the number of shipments that missed the scheduled delivery day.\n\nIn an e-mail, FedEx said it had shipped 99 percent of its ground deliveries on time and didn't specify a percentage for its air shipments.\n\nOnline Stampede\n\nU.S. retail sales rose 3.5 percent this holiday season, MasterCard Advisors SpendingPulse reported today, in line with other predictions for relatively weak sales. Yet Americans are stampeding online to buy holiday gifts, putting more pressure on shipping companies. Merchandise purchased via personal computers gained 10 percent this year to $42.75 billion, ComScore Inc. reported today. While online sales were softer than expected the week before Christmas, that can be explained in part by retailers piling on discounts earlier, pulling forward sales in a season that was six days shorter than last year.\n\nUPS's status as the world's largest package-delivery company wasn't enough to absorb rapidly changing consumer behavior. Americans are waiting longer and longer to pull the trigger on purchases, said Marshal Cohen, chief retail analyst at NPD Group, a Port Washington, New York-based research firm.\n\n\"We have watched retailers groom the consumer to wait,\" he said in a telephone interview. \"It's like rewarding bad behavior. You're saying to the consumer, 'the longer you wait, the better the deal, don't be fooled.'\"\n\nOrder Cutoff\n\nPutting further pressure on the shipping companies, retailers trying to compensate for a \"mediocre\" shopping season extended their order cutoff so customers could receive their purchases on Dec. 24, Johnson said.\n\nDuring peak periods, shipping companies add trucks and aircraft and hire thousands of temporary workers.\n\nUPS and FedEx \"may need to increase investments to handle such volume surges,\" Anthony Gallo, an analyst at Wells Fargo & Co., wrote in a note to investors. \"The 2014 Thanksgiving and Christmas calendars will be similar to 2013.\" He rates FedEx and UPS holds.\n\nMerchants -- even Amazon, which has spent billions on fulfillment centers -- rely on parcel-delivery companies.\n\n\"Amazon's mistake is they are a victim of their own success,\" said Michael Pachter, an analyst at Wedbush Securities Inc. \"They have given us such amazing service for so long that we rely on it and wait to make our orders. Amazon should probably tell people that they have second-day service but they don't trust the third-party vendors.\"\n\nPrime Fresh\n\nThe company is trying to reduce its reliance on shipping companies with Prime Fresh, a same-day local delivery service offering groceries and other daily necessities. So far, Prime Fresh is available only in Seattle, San Francisco and Los Angeles. In the wake of the missed UPS deliveries, Amazon might be tempted to speed up the rollout to other cities, said Shawn Milne, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott LLC.\n",

      "Marbella House by A-cero\n\nThe property is placed on the outskirts of Puerto Banús, in one of the most famous and exclusive developments in the Sun Coast. This development is located on one side of a mountain but very close to the coast, with plenty of Mediterranean vegetation. The plot where the project is located has a notorious slope that goes down to the South from the street access. This fact would determinate the design to adapt the house to the environment and achieve excellent views of the Mediterranean Sea. The possibilities of the plot and the wishes of the property appear in the execution of this huge project. The floor is rectangular and places the most used spaces to the south façade in order to enjoy the views. Here is where the plot is open to the outside. The north façade, where is located the access to the house, is more sober but forceful from an architectonic point of view, with walls and plans crossed and cut. There is a path with geometric forms covered with a layer of water that goes to the main door. The windows are secondary on the aesthetics of the house, but really important to give light to the corridors, distributors or common spaces. All the rooms, both public and private, are located in the rear part of the house, with the porch, the pool, the garden and a tennis court. In this part of the house, orientated to the south, the black glass windows are bigger to connect the outside with the inside, like the big one in the living room that hides in the floor automatically. The greatest part, in architectonic terms, is the big volume over the porch where stays the main bedroom on the first floor. The property is \"dressed\" with Roman transventilated travertine stone. Inside, the house has wide spaces, all of them modeled by natural light.\n\nThe property is developed in three levels:\n\nThe low floor is the most public space and includes the living-room, kitchen, dining room, laundry, and a little service room.\n\nThe first floor is the most private area and here we can find the bedrooms and a little office. The ground floor is dedicated to a relax area, with a spa, an internal pool, gym and garage. The large central courtyards that articulate the property core give light to this level of the house.\n\nFamily House, Marbella, Spain, by A-cero, Joaquin Torres Arquitectos, Photography by Jacobo España, Negami\n\nFriday, February 17th, 2012",
      "Simulated process color separations seems to be one of those mysterious things people in the tee shirt business are scared of trying. But there's no reason to be.\n\nOf course, that's not to say that there isn't a learning curve. Fortunately, most people experienced in printing tee shirts have the knowledge needed to be able to do the seps. And I'm going to show you how!\n\nWe'll look at the tried and true select color range and the somewhat elusive HSB method. I'll show you some simple ways to soften up your edges and achieve subtle gradations in your simulated process separations.\n\nI also explain my thought process on why I'm doing what I'm doing while taking you from start to finish. So, without further ado, let's watch a video!\n\nSimulated Process Color Separations Tutorial\n\nTUTORIAL: Simulated Process Color Separations in Photoshop\n\nWatch this video on YouTube\n\nTake Your Time\n\nThis is a learning process and these techniques will be able to help you get a jump start but take your time during the learning stages. Learn what the different tools in Photoshop can do.\n\nThis will help you get smooth gradations. Then see how you can start to combine them in order to get to your final desired separation.\n\nFor those of you who know how some of the tools work in Photoshop, take your time while creating your separations.\n\nRemember that throughout the entire screen-printing process, the time spent in the computer is the most forgiving and least expensive.\n\nSoft soft soft…I cannot express that enough. The softer your edges, the better.\n\nSimulated Process Color Separations Quick Reference Guide\n\nStart by saving a working file and keep your original intact. Check your resolution. 200dpi at final print size is fine. Make sure to have your info palette open while separating to check ink coverage. Make your tee channel and set it to 100% opacity. Set your base channel opacity to emulate what your particular base is going to do once printed. Try grabbing your base using an existing channel, then pull back the edges with a levels adjustment. Remember, the base does not need to be 100% throughout. Transfer your selected colors from your original image to your channels using the # value. Soften up your edges between colors using a brightness contrast image adjustment. Get rid of gradations under 5%-7% to avoid moiré. Use a levels adjustment to get rid of lower value percentages. Keep your coverage light. Remember, it's easier to hit the screen twice; adjust your angle, slow your squeegee speed, etc., than it is to pull back an already heavy print.

      "Just days after the release of his Jackie EP and critically acclaimed performance at Madison Square Garden , we are absolutely chummed to get our hands on's 'Top 10 Tracks Of All Time' list. Not of the moment, but of all time. It's always very interesting to see what a DJ as prestigious as Jeremy Olander thinks of music over time, and this is exactly what you're getting here. The evolution of dance music, through the eyes of one of its most beloved contributors. There's no fluff, and not much for us to add here in terms of journalism, as Jeremy has written it all himself! A few usual suspects appear on this list, including Pryda, Stardust, Tiga, and old school Tiesto. A surprise reading through this was the somewhat-buried project, Buy Now, from none other than Steve Angello and Sebastian Inggrosso. Check out 'For Sale and the rest of the list, straight from him to you, Jeremy Olander's Top 10 Tracks Of All Time, in his own words:\n\n1. Buy Now – For Sale\n\nMy favorite alias from Steve Angello and Sebastian Ingrosso. It came out in 2005 and everyone played it back then. I pretty much grew up on this track and it opened up a new sound realm of house music for me. You can hear some Daft Punk influences here and there throughout the track, which is probably a reason why it stuck like it did.\n\n\n2. Pryda – Aftermath\n\nVintage Pryda buildup and one of the most epic (no pun intended) 15 minutes of progressive house music there is. What's strikes me with this track every time I hear it is that despite its length, it could probably go even longer.\n\n3. Armand Van Helden – My My My\n\nThe first Armand Van Helden record I heard and it brings out a lot of old memories from that time in my life. Remember this one being on heavy rotation on commercial radio and MTV and yet you never got tired of it. The sampling work from Gary Wright's \"Comin' Apart\" is spot on.\n\n4. Roger Sanchez – Another Chance\n\nStands the test of time until today and has an infectious melody. After hearing this for the first time it stuck and me and my friends found ourselves humming it everywhere. We went to a record store, humming the melody to the guy working there and, to our great relief, he instantly dropped the name of it. I still have the record at my place somewhere.\n\n5. Chemical Brothers – Block Rockin' Beats\n\nI admit I was pretty late on the Chemical Brothers band wagon. \"Block Rockin' Beats\", which I think came out in 1997, really struck a chord with me when every radio station played it. I still listen to it a lot to this day and find the Chemical Brothers' music and their career really inspiring.\n\nThis track needs no introduction. Even if you're not into dance music, you've probably heard this on more than one occasion. One of Thomas Bangalter's finest work and a master class in quality French house at its best. Absolutely timeless.\n\n7. Stonebridge – Put Em' High\n\nA true funky classic with great vocals from one of the Swedish legends in dance music. Not sure if this was one made it big outside of Sweden and the UK, but for me and my friends it was huge.\n\nTiga is someone I've followed for a long time and he's got a remarkable knack for writing simple but extremely hooky vocals, and this is one that he made with Jake Shears is no exception.\n\nAsking someone what their favorite Daft Punk track is like asking someone for their favorite child. It's impossible. Since I have to pick one, I figured I'd take one that's slightly unexpected but still deserves on be on the list. \"Da Funk\" is a banging track!\n\nI was never really into Trance that much, but the little time I did spend listening to it was to the tunes of \"Flight 643\". It represents an era in the early 2000s when the genre was at its peak and the king was, of course, Tiësto.",

      "Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings.\n\nThe U.S. Supreme Court on Friday made marriage for same-sex couples legal nationwide, declaring that refusing to grant marriage licenses to gay and lesbian couples violates the Constitution.\n\nThe landmark ruling will produce the most significant change in laws governing matrimony since the court struck down state bans on inter-racial marriage almost 50 years ago.\n\nThe majority opinion in the 5-4 decision was written by Justice Anthony Kennedy.\n\n\"No union is more profound than marriage, for it embodies the highest ideals of love, fidelity, devotion, sacrifice, and family. In forming a marital union, two people become something greater than once they were,\" Kennedy wrote. \"As some of the petitioners in these cases demonstrate, marriage embodies a love that may endure even past death.\"\n\nRelated: Supreme Court Gay Marriage Ruling: The Highlights\n\nKennedy went on to speak directly to the type of criticism that often comes from conservatives in pushing back against marriage equality.\n\n\"It would misunderstand these men and women to say they disrespect the idea of marriage. Their plea is that they do respect it, respect it so deeply that they seek to find its fulfillment for themselves,\" Kennedy wrote. \"Their hope is not to be condemned to live in loneliness, excluded from one of civilization's oldest institutions. They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law. The Constitution grants them that right.\"\n\nA total of 36 states now permit gay couples to get married, covering roughly 70 percent of the US population. Today's ruling means the bans must end in the other 14 states — Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Michigan, Mississippi, Missouri, Nebraska, North Dakota, Ohio, South Dakota, Tennessee and Texas.\n\nPresident Barack Obama, speaking from the White House just after the ruling, called the decision a \"victory for America.\"\n\n\"When all Americans are treated as equal we are all more free,\" the president said.\n\nAfter sundown on Friday, the White House celebrated the ruling by projecting rainbow-colored lights onto the house's exterior.\n\nObama's own views on the matter of same-sex marriage have evolved and he has pushed increasingly for issues of gay rights in his second term.\n\nFrom the White House Rose Garden, he said that social progress sometimes is slow, \"and then there are days like this, when that slow, steady effort is rewarded with justice that arrives like a thunderbolt.\"\n\nThose at the heart of the case said they recognized the historical significance of the decision.\n\n\"Today's ruling affirms what millions of people across this country already know to be true in our hearts: Our love is equal\" Jim Obergefell, the lead plantiff in the landmark case said outside of the Supreme Court after the ruling. \"It is my hope that the term gay marriage will soon be a thing of the past. It will simply be marriage. And our nation will be better for it.\"\n\nThe president called Obergefell to congratulate him shortly after the decision was announced. Obergefell took the call while he was being interviewed live on CNN.\n\n\"Your leadership on this changed the country,\" Obama told him.\n\nThe decision capped a remarkably quick turnaround in public and judicial acceptance of same-sex marriage. In the past 18 months, court rulings struck down marriage bans in rapid succession — nearly 60 separate decisions in more than half the states.\n\nRelated: 'Historic Victory': Reactions to Supreme Court's Gay Marriage Ruling Pour In\n\nToday's ruling overturned a decision from the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals in Cincinnati, which said states had legitimate reasons for maintaining the traditional definition of marriage. The appeals court also said it would be better \"to allow change through the customary political processes\" instead of the courts.\n\nPublic opinion has shifted dramatically in recent years. The first Gallup poll on the subject showed only 27 percent approval for same-sex marriage in 1996. Gallup's most recent poll, taken last month, showed 60 percent approval.\n\nWriting for the dissent, Chief Justice John Roberts said that while he recognizes that many will applaud the decision, \"for those who believe in a government of laws, not of men, the majority's approach is deeply disheartening.\"\n\n\"This universal definition of marriage as the union of a man and a woman is no historical coincidence. Marriage did not come about as a result of a political movement, discovery, disease, war, religious doctrine, or any other moving force of world history — and certainly not as a result of a prehistoric decision to exclude gays and lesbians,\" Roberts wrote. \"It arose in the nature of things to meet a vital need: ensuring that children are conceived by a mother and father committed to raising them in the stable conditions of a lifelong relationship.\"\n\nOutside of the court, people sang \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" as the decision came out",
      "What does #Resistance really mean? It means the overthrow of our government.\n\nIn this century, Democrats rejected the outcomes of two presidential elections won by Republicans. After Bush won, they settled for accusing him of being a thief, an idiot, a liar, a draft dodger and a mass murderer. They fantasized about his assassination and there was talk of impeachment. But elected officials gritted their teeth and tried to get things done.\n\nThis time around it's \"radically\" different.\n\nThe official position, from the Senate to the streets, is \"Resistance.\" Leftist media outlets are feeding the faithful a fantasy that President Trump will be brought down. There is fevered speculation about the 25th Amendment, a coup or impeachment due to whatever scandal has been manufactured last.\n\nThis fantasy is part clickbait. Leftist media outlets are feeding the worst impulses of their readers. But there is a bigger and more disturbing radical endgame.\n\nThe left can be roughly divided into moderates and radicals. The distinction doesn't refer to outcome; both want very similar totalitarian societies with very little personal freedom and a great deal of government control. Instead it's about the tactics that they use to get to that totalitarian system.\n\nThe \"moderates\" believe in working from within the system to transform the country into a leftist tyranny. The \"radicals\" believe that the system is so bad that it cannot even be employed for progressive ends. Instead it needs to be discredited and overthrown by radicalizing a revolutionary base.\n\nRadicals radicalize moderates by discrediting the system they want to be a part of. Where moderates seek to impose a false consensus from within the system, radicals attack the system through violent protests and terrorism. Their goal is to set off a chain of confrontations that make it impossible to maintain civil society and polarize the backlash and chaos into consolidating the left for total war.\n\nThat is what \"Resistance\" actually means.\n\n[snip]\n\n\nThe radical left's goal is to convince its natural base that our system of government is illegitimate. It knows that this can't be limited to the theoretical level of ideology. Instead it must radicalize by demonstrating it. It does not seriously believe that President Trump will be removed from office by the 25th Amendment or any other aspect of the system. Instead it is feeding these fantasies so that when they fall through those on the left who believed in them will be further radicalized by their failure.\n\nAnd Democrats have become complicit in the radical left's program to bring down the government.\n\nThey have normalized the radical leftist position that our system is illegitimate. They have moved into the second phase of the left's program of demonstrating that illegitimacy through confrontation. The final phase is to overthrow the system through actions ranging from protests to terrorism.\n\nThis is Cloward-Piven institutional sabotage on a whole other scale. The goal is to collapse our entire system of government. And the Democrats have climbed on board with it using President Trump as a pretext. But regardless of which Republican had won, the end result would have been the same.\n\nThe left makes its opposition to the Constitution, the election process and the rule of law into a crisis. And then it uses that crisis to demand a new system. It has pursued this approach successfully in local areas and in narrower causes. This is not the first time that it has embarked on such a project on the national level. But this is the first time that it has the full support of a major national political party.\n\nAnd that is the true crisis that we face.\n\nThe left's endgame is a totalitarian state. Its \"moderates\" pursue one by peaceful means only so long as they are allowed to hijack the system. When an election fails to go their way, the radicals brandish it as proof that the system has failed and that violent revolution is the only answer.\n\nBut what was once the obscure behavior of a deranged political fringe has become the mainstream politics of the Democrats. The Resistance theme shows that the radicals have won. The Democrats haven't just fallen to the left. They have fallen to the radical left which believes in overthrowing our system of government through conflict and confrontation rather than covertly engineering change.",

      "Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders talks to reporters on his campaign plane on Feb. 2. (Rick Wilking/Reuters)\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\nDemocratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders isn't happy with Sheriff Joe Arpaio of Maricopa County, Ariz. Earlier this week, Sanders's wife, Jane Sanders, visited the outdoor jail maintained by Arpaio, known as Tent City, to review the conditions in which the inmates are living.\n\nAs reported by the Arizona Republic, Arpaio crashed Jane Sanders's event, triggering a debate between the two over conditions for the inmates as well as Arpaio's legal troubles over racial profiling. \"I am not supportive of racial profiling,\" Arpaio told Jane Sanders.\n\nArpaio's spotlight-hogging intervention hasn't sat well with candidate Bernie Sanders. Brahm Resnik, a reporter with KPNX-TV in Phoenix, interviewed Sanders in advance of Tuesday's primary election, and in a preview of the session, told an anchor: \"I have learned that when he says an interview is over, boy, is it over.\"\n\nThe station ran tape of Sanders telling Resnik: \"Well, let me just tell you something: You know, what Joe Arpaio is doing is an outrage. My wife went to look at the so-called Tent City, which is something that should not exist. The fact that he crashed her meeting is, to me, very, very wrong. Not something that he should have done. Thank you very much.\"\n\n\"Would you accept the spot of vice president,\" Resnik attempted to continue.\n\n\"Thank you very much,\" responded Sanders, getting up.

      "Still, the filmmakers, including overall visual effects supervisor John Dykstra, looked to acquire as many of the shots as possible in-camera. Filming therefore took place at the mansion location and on sets where high-speed reference of furniture, walls and even a fish tank exploding was gathered. Additionally, shots of the students mid-motion on wires on sets and against greenscreen was captured. Rising Sun Pictures—which also worked on the Quicksilver shots in Days of Future Past—would then augment this photography with occasional digital doubles, evidence of the mutant's 'zipping' abilities, fire blasts, and the exploding elements.\n\nFor shots of the students mid-air or mid-action before Quicksilver grabs them, actors were filmed carefully holding their poses or supported on wires, especially if they were being affected by the blast. One shot has them in the lobby area as the floor rises up from the explosion. This shot was achieved by \"filming the kids on a piston setup that raised them up,\" explained Rising Sun Pictures visual effects supervisor Dennis Jones. \"But when we got our digital floor in, it was more of a convex surface and we had to change their perspective a little.\"\n\nA later shot sees Quicksilver hoist students out of the mansion windows. That was filmed via motion control using multiple passes. The actors, fitted with wires, were shot against greenscreen as they were launched out the window. Here, Rising Sun's challenge was to make it look as if the students were not on wires for the requisite 'freeze frame' moments—\"You get a rock and roll effect as they ease on the wires,\" said Jones. The solution was to take still frames of the students and project those back onto their bodies. This allowed them to be stabilized correctly.\n\nThe art of zipping\n\nIn order to realize Quicksilver's lightning speeds (and the effect that has on what the audience sees), the visual effects team had to devise a language for the mutant. In particular, they had to show him doing physical movements that did not make sense in the physical world but helped sell the fast motion. \"As he moves things,\" said Jones, \"those things inherit his velocity but then they slow down very quickly—that's part of the Quicksilver lore.\"\n\nSimilarly, artists had to communicate the speed at which Quicksilver moves without just turning him into a blur. Rising Sun called these the 'zip zip moments' and strove to make them always readable. The zip zip moments ultimately became a mixture of smears and a leading edge shape that was recognizable as Quicksilver with a trail that lingers briefly to let the audience follow him in a scene.\n\nFor example, in the library Quicksilver zips up and down to rescue several students and is seen with a residual trail behind him. \"To do that,\" stated Jones, \"we rendered two passes of motion blur, one standard where we opened up the shutter to allow multiple frames and got long smeary frames, and one where we rendered the frames at half speed and put them together to get the smoothness back.\"\n\nOnly occasionally was Peters realized as a fully digital double, but this was required for a few shots. One has Quicksilver running through the mansion, eating a pizza, and picking up a dog (actually a scanned-in representation of a French bulldog, Tauntan, owned by previs supervisor Rpin Suwannath)—all were CG characters at some point in the shot.\n\nChaos and destruction: in slow-mo\n\nAs the mansion sequence progresses, more and more of the blast becomes apparent, albeit very slowly, until a final explosive crescendo. The challenge for Rising Sun, then, was to find a way to include the explosions and destruction very incrementally. The studio began with real slow-motion reference of fireballs and a fish tank. They also looked to previous on-screen explosions in films like The Dark Knight and Bad Boys II. \"We noticed in Bad Boys II that you could see the concussion effect on the roof tiles so we even added that ripple effect to our shots,\" said Jones.\n\nAnother observation of these film references came in what Jones describes as the 'germs' of the blast, the small trailing fiery lumps which are often the result of the special effects crew clumping in packs of dirt and material to make explosions more dramatic.\n\nWith these references in mind, Rising Sun developed pyro simulations using Side Effects Software's Houdini. One might think that these would be incredibly complicated and time-consuming to render. But since the real-time version of the explosions only happened over 8-12 frames, that's exactly how long the simulations were orchestrated to be.\n\nThe trick came, however, in then using Houdini to interpolate the simulation frames over the full length of the shot. The studio wrote specific tools to make this possible. \"What we were doing was solving for say 10 frames and",

      "This article presents our discovery that intranasal administration of oxytocin enhances activity in the brain for socially meaningful stimuli and attenuates its response to nonsocially meaningful stimuli in children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as measured via functional MRI. We also identified a relationship between changes in salivary oxytocin following administration and enhancements in brain function. These discoveries are particularly important given the urgent need for treatments that target the core social dysfunction in ASD. The functional neural attunement we demonstrated might facilitate social learning, thus potentially bringing about long-term change in neural systems and subsequent behavioral improvements. Our results illustrate the power of a translational neuroscience approach to facilitate the development of pharmacological interventions for neurodevelopmental disorders like ASD.\n\nAbstract\n\nFollowing intranasal administration of oxytocin (OT), we measured, via functional MRI, changes in brain activity during judgments of socially (Eyes) and nonsocially (Vehicles) meaningful pictures in 17 children with high-functioning autism spectrum disorder (ASD). OT increased activity in the striatum, the middle frontal gyrus, the medial prefrontal cortex, the right orbitofrontal cortex, and the left superior temporal sulcus. In the striatum, nucleus accumbens, left posterior superior temporal sulcus, and left premotor cortex, OT increased activity during social judgments and decreased activity during nonsocial judgments. Changes in salivary OT concentrations from baseline to 30 min postadministration were positively associated with increased activity in the right amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex during social vs. nonsocial judgments. OT may thus selectively have an impact on salience and hedonic evaluations of socially meaningful stimuli in children with ASD, and thereby facilitate social attunement. These findings further the development of a neurophysiological systems-level understanding of mechanisms by which OT may enhance social functioning in children with ASD.",

Bloomberg News\n\nThe percentage of adult smokers in Japan continued to drop for the 19th consecutive year, according to an annual survey by Japan Tobacco Inc.\n\nThe survey found that 19.7% of Japanese adults consider themselves smokers, a decline of 1.2 percentage points from 2013. Roughly 15.3 million men and 5.3 million women in Japan are smokers, the company said.\n\nThe percentage of female smokers fell to 9.8% in the latest survey, from 10.5% last year, while male smokers also decreased to 30.3 % from 32.2%. The company surveyed 32,000 adults in May and received 19,420 responses.\n\nA similar survey by Japan's Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare also showed a declining trend, with the percentage of smokers falling to 20.7% in 2012 from 27.7% in 2003.\n\nJapan Tobacco has conducted the survey every year since 1965. The highest number of smokers was recorded in 1966, when 49.4% of respondents said they smoked cigarettes. But the habit has continued to go out of fashion over the decades, with many offices, restaurants and sidewalks now off-limits for lighting up.\n\nJapan Tobacco pointed to several reasons for the declines, including the stricter restrictions on smoking, rising awareness over health issues and the increase in the country's consumption tax, which rose to 8% in April from 5%, making cigarettes more expensive.\n\nThe U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said 18.1% of adult Americans, or approximately 42.1 million people, were cigarette smokers in 2012.

      "Introduction\n\nThe \"One-Man Hide and Seek\", aka the \"One-Man Tag,\" is a ritual for contacting the dead.\n\nThe spirits, which are wandering restless on the Earth, are always looking for bodies to possess. In this ritual, you will summon such a spirit, by offering it a doll instead of a human body.\n\nWarning: If you have psychic abilities, you may feel unwell or be prone to accidents during the ritual.\n\nThings You Need\n\nOne stuffed doll. It must have limbs.\n\nRice, enough to stuff the doll full.\n\nOne needle, and one crimson thread.\n\nOne pair of nail clippers.\n\nOne sharp-edged tool, such as a knife, glass shard, or scissors.\n\nOne cup of salt water. Natural salt would be best.\n\nA bathroom, with a bathtub and some form of counter.\n\nA hiding place, preferably a room purified by incense and ofuda. There must be a TV in there.\n\nPreparation\n\nTake out whatever the doll is stuffed with. Once all of its stuffing is removed, re-stuff it with rice. *1 Clip off a few pieces of your nails, and put them inside the doll. Sew up the opening with the crimson thread. When you finish sewing, tie up the doll with the rest of the thread. *2 Go to the bathroom and fill your bathtub with water. Return to your hiding place, and put the cup of salt water on the ground.\n\nHow to do it\n\nGive a name to your doll. The name can be any but your own. When the time is 3 AM, say \"(your name) is the first it,\" to the doll three times. Go to the bathroom, and put the doll into the water-filled bathtub. Turn off all of the lights in your house, go back to the hiding place, and switch on the TV. After counting to ten with your eyes closed, return to the bathroom with the edged tool in your hand. Go to the bathtub, and, say to the doll, \"I have found you, (the doll's name).\" Stab the doll with the edged tool. *3 Say, \"You are the next it, (the doll's name),\" as you take the doll out of the bathtub and leave it on the counter in the bathroom. As soon as you have put the doll down, run back to the hiding place, and hide.\n\nHow to finish\n\nPour half of the cup of salt water into your mouth. Do not drink it, just keep it there. *4 Get out of your hiding place, and start looking for the doll. The doll is not necessarily in the bathroom. Whatever happens, do not spit out the salt water. When you find the doll, pour the rest of the salt water in the cup over it. Then, spit out the salt water in your mouth onto it as well. Say, \"I win,\" three times.\n\nThis is supposed to end the ritual.\n\nAfter this, make sure you dry the doll, burn, and discard it later.\n\nMOST IMPORTANT:\n\nPlease do not stop this ritual halfway. You must do it through to the end.\n\nThis is a dangerous ritual, and I will not be responsible for what happens to you if you try.\n\nOther Things to Keep in Mind\n\nDo not leave your house until you have done the finishing ritual.\n\nYou must turn off every single light in your house when told to do so.\n\nYou must keep quiet while hiding.\n\nYou do not need to put the salt water in your mouth during the beginning. You only need to do it during the finishing ritual.\n\nRemember, if you are living with someone, you might put them in danger too.\n\nKeep the ritual/\"game\" under two hours, or else the spirit will be too strong to remove.\n\nFor safety reasons, it might be best to keep all the doors in the house unlocked, including your front door. As well, have friends close by, so that they can come and help you at a moment's notice, if you ever need them. Keeping a mobile close at hand would be a good idea too.\n\nNotes\n\n1 - The rice represents innards, and also has the role of attracting spirits.\n\n- The rice represents innards, and also has the role of attracting spirits. 2 - The crimson thread represents a blood vessel.

See its section on the spading page for more information, and how you can help.\n\nStill needs research overall, especially regarding values.\n\nThis article is incomplete.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this article to add missing information and complete it.\n\nReason: Hearthome City Pt and Generation VII information, manga section.\n\nFriendship (Japanese: なつき度 degree of emotional attachment), also referred to as loyalty in Generation II core series games, tame in Pokémon Stadium 2 and friendliness in Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness, and commonly referred to by fans as happiness, is a measurement of how much a Pokémon is attached to its Trainer and enjoys being in their care.\n\nIt affects the evolution of certain Pokémon, the power of Return and Frustration, and the availability of a few in-game items and Ribbons. Certain events increase a Pokémon's friendship (gaining a level, walking a certain amount of steps) or decrease it (fainting, using herbal medicine).\n\nFriendship was introduced in Pokémon Yellow for the player's starter Pikachu only, and expanded to cover all Pokémon in Generation II.\n\nFriendship is not the same as Affection, a stat introduced in Generation VI.\n\nIn the core series games\n\nFriendship debuted in Generation I as a mechanic that applied only to the player's Pikachu in Pokémon Yellow. In Generation II, it was expanded to cover all Pokémon. In all games, friendship is a value that ranges from 0 to 255 (stored as a single byte). In Pokémon Yellow, Pikachu's friendship is indicated by the expression it shows when the player talks to it, but in later games, certain NPCs in the games will evaluate the friendship of a Pokémon in the player's party.\n\nA Pokémon's friendship is generally set when the player first obtains it. When a Pokémon is first caught from the wild, its friendship starts at its base friendship value. Trading a Pokémon also resets its friendship to its base value, unless it is being traded back to its original Trainer in Generation VI or later, in which case it regains the friendship it had before being traded away. A Pokémon caught in a Friend Ball starts with 200 friendship instead of its base friendship, while a Pokémon hatched from an Egg starts with 120 friendship.\n\nFriendship is generally increased by taking good care of a Pokémon. Keeping a Pokémon in the player's party, raising it, using items on it, and getting it groomed will all increase a Pokémon's friendship. Letting it faint and using bitter herbal medicines on it will decrease a Pokémon's friendship.\n\nBoosting friendship\n\nIn Pokémon Crystal, if a Pokémon is leveled up at its met location, it will gain twice as much friendship from that level up as usual. Since only Pokémon caught in Pokémon Crystal have a defined met location, Pokémon caught in the Generation I games, Pokémon Gold and Silver, and Pokémon from in-game trades will not receive this bonus. If a Pokémon that has a defined met location is traded to a Generation I game, this data is permanently erased, so it can no longer receive this bonus.\n\nStarting in Generation III, if a Pokémon was caught in a Luxury Ball or is currently at the same location where it was caught (its met location), any increase to its friendship is boosted by an extra point (two points if both apply). If a Pokémon is holding a Soothe Bell, increases to its friendship are boosted by 50% of the change. In Generation III, Soothe Bell applies directly to the original change in friendship, while in later games, it applies to the the friendship change after including Luxury Ball and met location bonuses. In Generation IV, being at its met location does not change the amount of friendship a Pokémon gains, but it does from Generation V onward.\n\nIn Generation V, the Befriending Power Pass Power boosts any increase to friendship by one to three points depending on the strength of the power used. In Generation VI, the Befriending Power O-Power has the same effect. Befriending Power does not exist in Generation VII.\n\nNone of these effects change the amount of friendship lost for negative changes or for changes of 0 (such as using an X Attack on a Pokémon with high friendship).\n\nMechanics using friendship\n\nThis section is incomplete.\n\nPlease feel free to edit this section to add missing information and complete it.\n\nReason: Double-check whether the Draco Meteor Move Tutors in BW, B2W2, and XY require high friendship or not.\n\nIn Pokémon Yellow, friendship affected very little beyond the reactions Pikachu would show when interacted with.\n\nStarting in Generation II, there are Pokémon that evolve by friendship",
      "Per a conference call captured by RingTV, Golden Boy president Eric Gomez says that their company is open to the possibility of Canelo Alvarez taking on former middleweight titleholder David Lemieux this fall — you know — instead of Gennady Golovkin.\n\n\"Whenever you have an exciting fighter like David, he's good for any fight,\" Gomez said on the call. \"His knockouts are incredible. So, it's something that we've talked about. It's something that I know David wants. It's something that Canelo is interested in as well,\" Gomez said of potentially matching Canelo with Lemieux, who faces Marcos Reyes on May 6 on the undercard of Canelo-Chavez at T-Mobile Arena on HBO PPV.\n\nGomez does add, however, that Canelo's preference is to take on Golovkin next, but that's undoubtedly a conditional statement that more likely means 'if the price is right.' But speaking on the potential for a Canelo-Lemieux fight, Gomez says:\n\n\"But it depends. They have very tough fights. Chavez Jr. fights Canelo and it's not a walkover. It's going to be a tough fight, moving up in weight and fighting a big guy, possibly a light heavyweight. And then David has a tough fight. So, there's possibilities. I think immediately next, Canelo wants to fight Golovkin. He's made that very clear to everybody. Canelo said it. We've said it. Golovkin said that he wants that fight. We continue to negotiate for that fight. But, if whatever reason that fight doesn't happen, yes, David would be in line (to face Canelo).\"\n\nThere has already been rampant speculation that Canelo will force Golovkin to bend over backwards in negotiations otherwise take his act elsewhere, and realistically, Canelo is in prime position to do exactly that. Let's just hope that things don't get to that point and we finally get the fight we've been long waiting to see.",

After waiting for three days for an apology, the father filed a complaint with the state women's commission on Friday.On October 28, the Class XI student, her father and younger brother went for the movie to celebrate her turning 17. She looked natty in a black-and-white floral print dress. The trio was about to enter the theatre when a female security guard asked the girl to step aside. \"I thought I was being taken for frisking. But they took me to a ticket clerk's cubicle. He looked at my dress, pointed to the notice that read shorts aren't allowed and told me it was 'drishtikotu'. I felt so humiliated that I ran out crying,\" she recounted.Her father was livid and questioned the hall staff's audacity to judge the appropriateness of his daughter's clothes. \"When I confronted the ticket clerk, he maintained that boys wearing 'half pants' and girls wearing 'skirts that were like shorts' weren't allowed into the theatre. I couldn't believe it. Was I in Taliban territory? This happens in khap panchayats, not in Kolkata. Who gave them the authority to comment on her dress or act as moral police? It was a knee-length dress. She looked elegant and they had the gall to tell her she looked indecent!\" he said.Realizing they were in a soup, the security allowed her in. \"But it was so sad to see my children sit grim-faced through the movie. I decided to have a word with the manager,\" he said.Hall manager Ranjan Ganguly, who had been briefed about what had happened, refused an apology. The father then gave him a piece of his mind. \"It is my daughter who will decide what she will wear, not you,\" he told Ganguly.Actress June Malia, a member of the commission, expressed disgust, saying: \"This is ridiculous. No one has the right to act moral police and decide what a girl or a woman will wear. That a theatre staff did this when she was accompanied by her father is outrageous.\"The hall manager remained unperturbed and told TOI: \"We have had many run-ins with patrons in the past but not allowed those with shorts and skirts. An exception was made in this case because it was her birthday.\"On being asked what right he had to judge a girl's dress, he shifted responsibility to KMC. \"We are simply following the rule that states that lungis, shorts and drunks are not allowed into the theatre. A skirt that is above the knee is like shorts,\" he insisted.Mayor Sovan Chatterjee said he would \"look into the incident\" but did not approve of girls being turned out. \"I have no knowledge of any KMC rule at Star Theatre that prohibits girls in skirts,\" he said.",
      "If you're a Catholic, you've probably seen it: a mysterious series of letters and numbers, looking for all the world like an equation, inscribed in chalk over a doorway at your parish, or at the home of a friend. Maybe you thought you could figure it out. Maybe you were too embarrassed to ask, \"What the heck is that?\"\n\nIf you don't know what the chalk is all about, don't be ashamed. You're certainly not alone.\n\nEpiphany (also known as Twelfth Night, Theophany, or Three Kings Day) marks the occasion of a time-honored Christian tradition of \"chalking the doors.\" The formula for the ritual — adapted for 2018 — is simple: take chalk of any color and write the following above the entrance of your home: 20 + C + M + B + 18.\n\nThe letters have two meanings. First, they represent the initials of the Magi — Caspar, Malchior, and Balthazar — who came to visit Jesus in His first home. They also abbreviate the Latin phrase, Christus mansionem benedicat: \"May Christ bless the house.\" The \"+\" signs represent the cross, and the \"20\" at the beginning and the \"18\" at the end mark the year. Taken together, this inscription is performed as a request for Christ to bless those homes so marked and that He stay with those who dwell therein throughout the entire year.\n\nThe chalking of the doors is a centuries-old practice throughout the world, though it appears to be somewhat less well-known in the United Sates. It is, however, an easy tradition to adopt, and a great practice whereby we dedicate our year to God from its very outset, asking His blessing on our homes and on all who live, work, or visit them there.\n\nThe timing for the chalking of the doors varies somewhat in practice. In some places, it is done on New Year's Day. More commonly, it is performed this Saturday — the traditional Feast of the Epiphany — the Twelfth Day of Christmas. Most often the chalking takes place after Epiphany Mass, and can be done at any church, home, or dwelling. Traditionally the blessing is done by either a priest or the father of the family. This blessing can be performed simply by just writing the inscription and offering a short prayer, or more elaborately, including songs, prayers, processions, the burning of incense, and the sprinkling of holy water.\n\nAfter many Epiphany Masses, satchels of blessed chalk, incense, and containers of Epiphany water (holy water blessed with special blessings for Ephiphany) are distributed. These can then be brought home and used to perform the ritual. Another common practice is to save a few grains of the Epiphany incense until Easter, so that it can be burned along with the Easter candle.\n\nPracticing traditions like the chalking of the doors helps us to live our Faith more concretely and serve as an outward sign of our dedication to Our Lord. Our homes are also the place where many of us will make the greatest strides in our spiritual growth, through observance of daily prayer, spiritual reading, and work offered as an oblation to God.\n\nThe chalking of the doors of a home encourages Christians to dedicate their life at home to God and to others. Seeing the symbols over our doors can help to remind us, while passing in and out on our daily routines, that our homes and all those who dwell there belong to Christ. It also serves as a reminder of welcoming the Magi gave to Jesus. We should strive to be as welcoming to all who come to our homes to visit us!\n\nBelow, we've provided some examples of how this ceremony can be performed.\n\nThis ceremony of the blessing of the home and inscription of the initials of the three Magi above each door can be performed either by a priest or the father of the family. The following prayer is taken from the book, The Twelve Days of Christmas, by Elsa Chaney.\n\nThe feast of manifestation, or Epiphany, is traditionally celebrated the 12th day after Christmas, January 6th. In the dioceses of the United States this feast has been moved to the Sunday between January 2 and January 8.\n\nPrayer: On entering the home, Leader(Priest, if present, or father of the family) : Peace be to this house.\n\nAll: And to all who dwell herein. All: From the east came the Magi to Bethlehem to adore the Lord; and opening their treasures they offered precious gifts: gold for the great King, incense for the true God, and myrrh in symbol of His burial. All Pray: The Magnificat. During the Magnificat, the room is sprinkled with holy water and incensed. After this is completed, All: From the east came the Magi to",

      "As Washington turns to scandal rather than policy, gun control seems to be slipping from the public conversation, and the already slim chance of legislation passing is fading to black.\n\nThis is no surprise. Even President Obama famously only called for a gun control vote, rather than for any legislation actually getting enacted.\n\nI would argue that the roots of American gun violence go far deeper than guns. This doesn't mean I'm pro-gun rights or a NRA supporter. In fact, I think the NRA and related groups embody the nasty divides in our society that ultimately make the U.S. such a violent place.\n\nFrom a recent essay I wrote on gun violence in the The Morning News:\n\nPerhaps, like a true original sin, groups in power in the U.S. have systematically destroyed social capital in vulnerable communities and between groups of all kinds in order to gain wealth and power and deny it to others. And perhaps they have done this in more ruthless fashion than in other comparable cultures. This could explain why the murder rate in New York has been more than five times higher than London's for 200 years, though the American propensity for violence reaches even farther back than that, going all the way back to frantic religious refugees with visions of the Apocalypse both at their back and before their eyes.\n\nIn a roundtable discussion at the Harvard School of Public Health in January, David King, of the Harvard Kennedy School, made a prescient point related to the near impossibility of passing significant gun control legislation.\n\nPolitics is often the art of taking a condition and redefining it as a problem.\n\nSo why do guns remain a condition, not a problem, for a huge percentage of Americans? Why does debate on this topic get so toxic that it stalls, letting the darkest, shrillest voices take over?\n\nIt's a failure of communication. Americans on either side of this issue simply speak different languages -- of gun rights versus public health, as one example -- and as much as you may agree or disagree with the other side, we're not going to get anywhere until we find a common vocabulary on guns... and everything else.\n\nMany doctors and gun control supporters have tried to position gun violence as a public health crisis since the massacre in Newtown last year. Part of this is due to a controversial ban on CDC research into guns, which President Obama just lifted. But it goes deeper. The language of public health equates guns with car crashes and second hand smoke, and it seems like a less threatening way to approach the issue, with advocates acknowledging the challenges and trying to make their solution acceptable to as wide a base as possible.\n\nLike this from an essay in the Journal of the American Medical Association:\n\nGun violence arises from sociocultural, educational, behavioral, and product safety issues that transcend gun ownership alone. Addressing this crisis will require a comprehensive, multidimensional strategy. Toward that end, much can be learned from prior public health successes in changing the prevalence, social norms, and cultures of harmful behaviors. These major achievements -- in the realms of tobacco, unintentional poisoning, and motor vehicle safety -- provide a set of evidence-based, successful tactics for immediate application to gun violence.\n\nOn first read, it sounds great. Yet I would argue that, with guns, this still not does get at the deeper causes of the disease -- like inequality or a lack of social capital -- and treats only the symptoms -- gun safety, background checks, social attitudes towards gun ownership.\n\nA campaign against gun violence along the lines of campaigns against drunk driving would, of course, be helpful. It might knock down shootings by a couple of percentage points, which, in a country the size of the U.S., would save thousands of lives. But treating symptoms -- even deep-seated and complex ones -- only takes us so far, and it also carries larger systemic risks. This has created an expensive and often ineffective health care system that focuses not on larger health issues but on the immediate disease at hand. It leads to overprescribed antibiotics, a massive increase in depression despite new treatments and a diabetes pandemic.\n\nAnd guns are not cars or tobacco. They are more intimately tied to a darkness or chaos in our national character. By calling gun violence a public health crisis, even with the best intentions, it makes gun violence something to be solved with decisive action. This approach can be useful for simple targets -- I would heartily support a war on lead paint, for instance -- but using this kind of language on guns could harden the gun guys the way a bacteria resists antibiotics. They will be immune to the medicine and less and less likely to listen to larger messages.\n\nIt doesn't help that the research and statistics on guns and their impact on violence is contradictory at best. And increasingly, guns are a partisan issue, making it ever more infected. Just since President Obama took office, the percentage of Republicans who supported gun rights leaped from half in 2007 to 72 percent as of last July",
      "Last month, Congressman Justin Amash sounded the alarm on controversial spying language that was snuck into a 2,009-page omnibus bill. The massive budget legislation was, as is typical in Washington, haphazardly passed to avoid an end-of-year government shutdown.\n\nThis week, Amash introduced legislation to repeal these anti-privacy provisions.\n\nWhen the omnibus passed, Amash said he didn't think most of his colleagues realized a pre-existing bill called the Cyber Information Sharing Act (CISA) was folded into its pages. Amash describes CISA as \"the worst anti-privacy law since the USA PATRIOT Act.\"\n\nAs Amash told Rare in an exclusive interview, \"Everyone understands why appropriations were rushed into an omnibus before the December fiscal deadline,\" referring to the looming government shutdown. He added, \"There's no legitimate justification for sneaking a massive cyber surveillance measure into that omnibus.\"\n\nThis is why, as Rare reported in December, Amash took time over Congress' winter recess to draw attention to CISA and the fact that it was passed in a sneaky manner.\n\nA statement from Amash's office introducing his new bill describes CISA as, \"[Allowing] unconstitutional, warrantless surveillance on law-abiding Americans.\" It explains, \"The law grants immunity from liability to companies that share employees' or users' private information with the government or other companies, as long as they do so under the guise of cybersecurity.\"\n\nFurther: \"It places no limits on the type of information that can be shared, which could include individuals' personal online communications, and it allows the government to use the information it receives for purposes unrelated to cybersecurity, including the investigation and prosecution of unrelated crimes.\"\n\nAmash's bill is bipartisan, and is co-sponsored by Congressman John Conyers (D-Mich.), Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), Congressman Thomas Massie (R-Ky.), Congressman Ted Poe (R-Texas), and Congressman Jared Polis (D-Colo.).\n\nRare asked Amash if he believes his legislation will get a fair hearing under the new Republican leadership of Speaker Paul Ryan. In the past, Amash and several of his \"rebellious\" colleagues clashed with former speaker John Boehner, and lost their committee assignments as a result. Amash was kicked off of the House Budget Committee.\n\n\"Speaker Ryan committed himself to a fair, open process, and I hope he'll recognize he made a mistake here,\" said Amash. \"He can show a real difference from Speaker Boehner by bringing my repeal bill to the floor so we can have the necessary debate.\"\n\nAmash, a member of the House Freedom Caucus, supported Paul Ryan for speaker because Ryan promised Amash and other members that he would give a greater voice to the conservatives who were shut out of the governing process under Boehner. At the time of Boehner's resignation, House conservatives lobbied for a speaker who would democratize legislative operations. The Republican Party eventually coalesced around Ryan.\n\nAmash said he hopes to see Ryan keep the promises he made to secure his speakership. Bringing a bipartisan bill to the floor aimed at exposing the nefarious passage of CISA would certainly be a good start.",
      "A high-pitched \"wee-o-wee-o-wee-o-wee\" whistle might not sound like much to you, but it's exactly how a dolphin might introduce itself.\n\nBecause sight is limited in the ocean, dolphins create individual \"name\" calls to communicate their whereabouts to friends and families.\n\nBut it's not as simple as just recognizing a voice, as with most animals. A new study reveals that the calls contain frequency changes that dolphins recognize.\n\nDigital dolphins\n\nHumans are one of the few animals that use sound modulation instead of simple voice differences to identify individuals. For example, a person can recognize the name \"John\" whether it's being said by Gilbert Gottfried or James Earl Jones.\n\nScientists have long known that dolphins identify themselves with names, but the belief was that, like some monkeys, the animal's voice was the key ingredient of the call.\n\nA team of researchers led by Vincent Janik of the University of St. Andrews in Scotland temporarily captured seven male and seven female bottlenose dolphins in Sarasota Bay in Florida. Janik and his crew recorded the name calls of each dolphin, and digitally removed the voice features of each call.\n\nThey then played the computerized calls and digital versions of other random calls through underwater speakers where the dolphins were held.\n\nIn nine of 14 cases, the dolphin would turn more often toward the speaker—an established technique for gauging a dolphin's interest—if it heard a whistle resembling the name of a close relative.\n\n\"Every dolphin has its own voice,\" Janik told LiveScience. \"But we removed those features and showed that the animals are actually paying attention to the modulation and not the voice.\"\n\nNaming game\n\nA dolphin chooses its own name as an infant and uses it throughout its life.\n\n\"It seems like the animals hear what's around them, and then they make up their own whistle,\" Janik said. \"They either develop something original ... or they base it on parts of the whistles around them.\"\n\nRegardless of the method, the young dolphins want to make their call stand apart from the calls of their closest relatives. Communicating by sight is difficult underwater, so dolphins use these calls to let other dolphins know they're nearby. A dolphin will also call out its name if it's lost and distressed, hoping relatives will come to its aid.\n\nDolphins are some of the most talkative animals around, even though we don't know what they're saying.\n\n\"Their repertoire of calls probably numbers in the hundreds,\" Janik said. \"Some of them are food calls, but for most of them we have no ideas what they're for.\"\n\nThe study is detailed in this week's early online edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",
      "Islamabad, Jan 25: A massive power failure hit Pakistan after midnight, plunging major cities into darkness, as authorities struggled on Sunday to restore electricity supply in the country plagued by a crippling energy crisis. The nature of fault was not known exactly but it plunged about 80 per cent country into darkness, the fourth major breakdown of the system within the past one month.\n\nThere were contradictory statements about the reason for the breakdown. Initially television channels reported that militants had disrupted the Guddu transmission line in the troubled Baluchistan province's Nasirabad district. But, Deputy Minister for Water and Power Abid Sher Ali, later denied the breakdown was due to any terrorist activity. He said the breakdown occurred after a key power transmission line broke down in Baluchistan one hour after midnight on Saturday.\n\nHowever, Sarbaz Baluch, who claimed to be a spokesman of the Baluch Republican Army, claimed that the defunct militant group had carried out the bombing of two 220 KV transmission lines in Notal area of Naseerabad district. Officials said that last night's breakdown resulted in many urban areas like Karachi, Hyderabad, Sukkur, Quetta, Islamabad and Peshawar plunging into darkness with hundreds of villages and small towns in all four provinces also affected.\n\nThe authorities were working non-stop to fix the problem and according to various reports electricity was gradually being restored. \"Repair work to restore the transmission line has nearly been completed and power has been restored to most parts of the country,\" Sher Ali said. The crisis came close on the heels of the recent petrol shortage which paralysed the country for about two weeks. Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif who was already reeling from the petrol criticism, faced another barrage of outrage.\n\nHe took notice of the worst-ever power breakdown and issued instructions for the immediate resumption of power supply on an emergency basis. The breakdown hit amid rumours that the country's power crisis would be exacerbated as a result of acute shortage of furnace oil. Due to shortage of furnace oil, the power production from Jamshoro power plant was decreased to 170 MW from 570 MW and from 700 MW to 360 MW at Muzaffargarh plant, as Faisalabad power plant has suspended power generation. Currently the country demand of electricity is around 14,000 MW as compared to total generation of 7,000 MW.",

      "New Star Trek: Discovery details reveal timeline, names & more\n\nNew Star Trek: Discovery details have been revealed by series producer/showrunner Bryan Fuller (Hannibal, American Gods), who told Ain't It Cool News that the female lead — a lieutenant commander aboard the title ship — will be referred to as \"Number One,\" with her real name to be revealed towards the end of Season 1. Fuller also noted that the first hour of the 13 episodes is written by himself and Alex Kurtzman, with the second hour penned by Nicholas Meyer (Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan, Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home, Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country), and the the series will take place in the Prime (William Shatner) timeline as opposed to the Kelvin (Chris Pine) timeline to avoid conflict with future movies.\n\n\"I would strongly recommend that we never do 26 episodes,\" Fuller said. \"I think it would fatigue the show. Ideally I would like to do 10 episodes. I think that's a tighter story.\"\n\nGretchen Berg & Aaron Harberts (\"Wonderfalls,\" \"Pushing Daisies\") will serve as co-showrunners on the show, with Jesse Alexander (\"Alias,\" \"Heroes,\" \"Hannibal\"), Kristen Beyer (various Star Trek novels), Aron Eli Coleite (\"Heroes\") and veteran Trek series writer Joe Menosky also onboard the writing staff.\n\nFuller previously revealed that Star Trek: Discovery, which will debut on CBS in January 2017 before the show makes its permanent home on the streaming service CBS All Access, will have a female, human lead and that they are hoping to cast a diverse actress for the role. The male lead might also be diverse, and there will be robots as well.\n\n\"We'll probably have a few more aliens than you typically have on the show. We wanted to paint a picture of Starfleet where we're going to have new exciting aliens and also new imagining of existing aliens,\" Fuller previously told EW. And will there be a gay character? \"Absolutely we're having a gay character,\" he added.\n\nThe first season of Star Trek: Discovery will be told over 13 episodes. Fuller said that \"each episode is a chapter, within each chapter will be a beginning, middle and end.\"\n\nStar Trek: Discovery is set about 10 years before Captain Kirk's mission. \"There's an incident and and event in Star Trek history, that's been talked about but never been explored. To do this series, we're telling a much more serialized story, to dig deep into a very tantalizing storyline. And we have a character who's on a journey, and in order to understand something that is alien she first has to understand herself,\" Fuller added.\n\nFuller also said that for the first season, they will be sticking to new characters, but moving forward, original \"Star Trek\" characters could appear in some form.\n\nStar Trek: Discovery will begin production in Toronto in September. Alex Kurtzman and Fuller are co-creators and executive producers for the new series, based on Gene Roddenberry's original series. Fuller launched his career writing for Star Trek: Deep Space Nine and Star Trek: Voyager. Kurtzman is co-writer and producer of 2009's Star Trek and its follow-up Star Trek Into Darkness.\n\nThe series is produced by CBS Television Studios in association with Kurtzman's Secret Hideout, Fuller's Living Dead Guy Productions and Roddenberry Entertainment.

      "Nearly a week after the Islamic State (IS) captured the Iraqi city of Ramadi, the plight of tens of thousands who fled the extremist group has yet to be resolved. The Iraqi government continues to prevent most from entering Baghdad, where their safety would be best assured, and locals and aid workers say continued IS offensives in Anbar Province, of which Ramadi is the capital, risk putting the lives of those fleeing in even greater danger.\n\nAccording to the International Organization on Migration, some 40,000 people fled Ramadi as Iraqi Security Forces fled the city on Sunday in the face of an assault by militants with IS.\n\nSpeaking to VICE News Friday evening, Lise Grande, the UN's humanitarian coordinator in Iraq, said most of those fleeing Ramadi have not entered Baghdad, and that the total number of displaced people in Anbar has risen to include those fleeing other cities and towns near Ramadi.\n\nGrande said 24,000 people — like all the UN's current figures, a rough, preliminary estimate — were seeking shelter in the city of Habbaniyah, less than four miles from an airbase where thousands of Shia militiamen are reportedly gathering in preparation to assault Ramadi. About 12,400 people, said Grande, were in Amiriyat Fallujah, a town just 18 miles southeast of IS-controlled Fallujah, and 5,000 reportedly remained at the entrance to the Bzeibez floating bridge that separates Anbar province from Baghdad.\n\nOn Wednesday, Iraqi authorities allowed a reported 2,000 people to cross, but as of Friday night, the bridge had been completely shuttered, leaving families to fend for themselves with little or no protection amid soaring daytime temperatures and a vicious sandstorm. The UN reported several had died while waiting to be allowed across the bridge.\n\n\"There are a number of people who have died there, the conditions are horrible,\" Grande said.\n\nWatch the ViCE News documentary The Islamic State:\n\n[ooyala content_id=\"owbm8wdTpQ6awF6uUjKdS0UinPtXcaXr\" player_id=\"YjMwNmI4YjU2MGM5ZWRjMzRmMjljMjc5\" auto_play=\"1\" skip_ads=\"0\"]\n\nThe Shia-led government has expressed concern that IS infiltrators could be among those seeking to enter Baghdad, and have required that families prove they have a sponsor inside the capital before proceeding. The same conditions, the UN reported Friday, are applied to those attempting to enter Karbala and Babylon. Most of those displaced in Anbar are Sunni Muslims.\n\n\"They are screening families because they want to make sure hostile elements do not enter the city,\" said Grande.\n\nOther aid workers confirmed the dire state of affairs at the Anbar side of the Bzeibez bridge.\n\n\"This checkpoint is officially closed by the authorities,\" Salah Noori, Baghdad chief at the Norwegian Refugee Council, told VICE News. \"We don't know what will happen in the next couple of days as we are expecting more and more internally displaced people, and a new wave of displacement to this location.\"\n\nGrande said an additional estimated 5,400 people had congregated in Khalidiyah, along the Euphrates River and just two miles from Habbaniyah, and where IS militants attacked last night.\n\n\"Those people are running, plus local families are running, for their lives,\" said Grande.\n\nAlso overnight, Sunni extremists captured the town of Husseiba, some four miles east of Ramadi, after tribal and police forces retreated.\n\nNoori said thousands of those seeking safety did not have sponsors in Baghdad, and others were fearful for their own security inside the city.\n\n\"The situation is critical for these IDP families,\" Noori said, adding he was \"extremely concerned about the restrictions on movement.\"\n\nThose who have been allowed into the capital, said Noori, have \"very limited access to basic services,\" and \"are living in unfinished buildings, tents, and other inadequate shelter arrangements.\"\n\nEven if those driven away by IS eventually reach safer areas, aid workers report funding and supplies to deal with the catastrophe are dangerously low. The UN says it will run out of emergency kits in two weeks, and that by June it will have to close 77 health facilities across Iraq. In July, without further financing, the UN will no longer be able to feed any of the more than 2.5 million Iraqis it currently offers assistance to.\n\nThe 40,000 people who fled Ramadi in the last week join more than 130,000 that were displaced from the city in mid-April. Grande said about half of those displaced eventually managed to enter Baghdad.

      "Seoul, South Korea (CNN) -- South Korean police arrested five men Thursday for allegedly collaborating with North Korean computer experts to hack into online game systems to generate millions of dollars in illicit gains.\n\nTheir investigation, which was conducted with the country's National Intelligence Service, exposed an elaborate operation in which South Koreans invited North Korean computer hackers to China to create programs that automatically play popular online games and accumulate virtual items that were later sold for cash on the Internet.\n\nThe police believe these programs, known as auto-programs, were developed by hacking into South Korean online game companies to work out how to write them to cheat their operations, according to the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency.\n\nSouth Korea has experienced a wave of cyber attacks on government, business and military websites over the past two years. Seoul has fingered North Korea for the attacks, a claim Pyongyang denies. There is rising concern about Internet security in the South as experts point to the vulnerabilities of one of the most wired countries in the world.\n\nPolice say their investigation into the gaming scheme points to the possibility of North Korea using online gaming as another tool to penetrate South Korea's computing systems.\n\nThe five men held over the illicit gaming operation allegedly invited the North Korean computer specialists to China as normal business partners and provided them with board and stipends while engaging them in developing the auto-programs, according to police.\n\nThe operation began roughly two years ago and has generated more than 6.4 billion won (US$6 million) over the span of a year and a half, according to the police.\n\nOnce invited, the North Korean computers experts, mostly graduates from top-ranking North Korean universities, stayed for roughly five months in China before returning to their home country.\n\nThey received compensation for developing auto-programs and were expected to wire a monthly fee of US$500 back to Pyongyang, according to the police.\n\nSome of them work for the North's leading IT agency Korea Computer Center (KCC), while others operate under a trade company that is known to be involved in raising and managing funds for North Korea's leader Kim Jong Il, according to the investigation report.\n\n\"We have to some extent confirmed through the statements of the suspects that North Korea is mass mobilizing computer experts for hacking, and that they are heavily involved in cyber crimes,\" according to the police investigation report.\n\nThe police called on South Korean online game companies to boost their security systems in the face of North Korea's increasing hacking capabilities and potential for conducting cyber attacks in the South.",
      "White House staff shake-ups were plentiful in late July, and it seems media personalities with a favorable view of Trump were first to have the story.\n\nStarting with the firing of Reince Priebus as chief of staff, Axios maps out key inside scoops from talking heads like Mike Cernovich and Roger Stone signaling the alt-right pundits have access mainstream media should perhaps play closer attention to.\n\nNeal Rothschild directs us to a series of tweets:\n\nScoops on both tension between Priebus and Scaramucci, and then news of Priebus' ousting before Trump tweeted of the shakeup himself:\n\nThen -- from Roger Stone with InfoWars -- news of Trump's considering Gen. John Kelly as his new chief of staff, two days before the New York Times reported it.\n\nCernovich notably led the \"Pizzagate\" conspiracy theory that Hillary Clinton's campaign was involved in a child sex trafficking ring out of Washington D.C. pizzeria, while InfoWars founder Alex Jones has infamously entertained theories from Malia and Sasha Obama not being President Obama's real children to saying the Sandy Hook shooting \"didn't happen.\"\n\n\"These publishers now appear to have White House access,\" Rothschild writes. \"The fake stories make it hard to spot the true news, but for others, the true news gives credibility to the misinformation.\"\n\nInfoWars was originally granted temporary White House press credentials back in May, but it appears they have not yet been granted permanent access.\n\nRELATED: The conspiracy theories of President Trump and his inner circle\n\n\n9 PHOTOS The conspiracy theories of President Trump and his inner circle See Gallery The conspiracy theories of President Trump and his inner circle Trump and the 'birther' claim Trump has made remarks on multiple occasions in his past suggesting former President Barack Obama \"doesn't have a birth certificate.\" Nearing the end of his campaign trail, Trump finally admitted in September 2016 that Obama \"was born in the United States.\" Here is a 2011 excerpt from his statement on the conspiracy theory surrounding the \"birther\" claim \"He doesn't have a birth certificate, or if he does, there's something on that certificate that is very bad for him. Now, somebody told me -- and I have no idea if this is bad for him or not, but perhaps it would be -- that where it says 'religion,' it might have 'Muslim.' And if you're a Muslim, you don't change your religion, by the way.\" Trump and the wiretapping claim On March 4, the president accused former President Barack Obama of wiretapping the phones at his New York home in Trump Tower in a series of Saturday morning tweets. \"I'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election!,\" one tweet read. FBI Director James Comey later renounced this claim at a rare public House Intelligence Committee hearing. Trump: China created global warming On November 6, 2012, Trump tweeted the following: \"The concept of global warming was created by and for the Chinese in order to make U.S. manufacturing non-competitive.\" The issues of global warming and climate change have long been proved valid by the science community's vast majority. Alex Jones' Infowars, Trump tie Sen. Ted Cruz's father to Kennedy assassination An April 2016 article in Infowars -- a site affiliated with conspiracy theorist Alex Jones -- titled \"WAS CRUZ'S FATHER LINKED TO THE JFK ASSASSINATION?\" makes the case that Sen. Ted Cruz's father, Rafael Cruz, was linked to Lee Harvey Oswald, the man believed to have killed John F. Kennedy. In May 2016, Trump brought up an Enquirer story featuring Cruz's father pictured with Oswald, saying, \"I mean, what was he doing — what was he doing with Lee Harvey Oswald shortly before the death? Before the shooting? It's horrible.\" He brought the storyline up again one day after accepting the Republican presidential nomination in July 2016. Trump: Obama \"founded ISIS\" Trump touted his plan to \"bomb the sh*t out of ISIS\" many times while on the 2016 campaign stump -- and added to his ISIS rhetoric the claim that then-President Barack Obama \"founded ISIS.\" Trump outlined this claim in a Florida campaign speech: \"ISIS is honoring President Obama. He's the founder of ISIS. He founded ISIS. I would say the co-founder would be Crooked Hillary Clinton.\" Trump also suggested Obama was sympathetic to terrorists in June of 2016. Trump suggests Justice Antonin Scalia was assassinated \"It's a horrible topic,\" Trump said of Justice Scalia's death during a radio interview with conservative host Michael Savage. At this point, Trump was entering a space in which Savage had already called for a Warren Investigation into Scalia's death -- the same type of investigation that looked into JFK's shooting. In that context, Trump continued his remarks, saying, \"But they say they found a pillow on his face, which is a pretty unusual",
      "on •\n\nTHE GUERRILLA ANGEL REPORT – Also offering SRS coverage for students: Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, and Emory. While I don't have a comprehensive list of all colleges that offer students SRS coverage in their health insurance plans, I am curious about the exact number of colleges that currently offer this coverage — and ones that are considering it. My research on this resulted in inconclusive numbers.\n\nAccording to a Yale student publication, they may be next — maybe. The staff at Yale already have this coverage and trans advocates on campus are pushing to get students included. The cost, some argue, is relatively inexpensive because very few students actually take advantage of the benefit. Even if the college had to pay out a number of surgeries, the benefit to the college for providing a trans-friendly campus extends beyond just attracting transgender students.\n\nWhile the jury is out on Yale, just the fact that student SRS coverage is being considered on campuses today shows how far trans people have come. Remember, what happens on campus today eventually makes its way to the rest of society later on.\n\nI've a hunch there may be other colleges flying under the radar with student SRS benefits.

      "Diego Valeri loves Italian food.\n\nGrowing up in Argentina, he regularly ate big, hearty dinners of pizza and pasta with his family - a nod to their Italian heritage. Even after arriving in Portland in 2013, Valeri quickly adopted Piazza Italia as his go-to restaurant.\n\nBut recently, the Portland Timbers maestro has been making a concerted effort to change his diet in an attempt to eat healthier and feel better during the long MLS season, as well as take a prudent path toward prolonging his career for as long as possible. Over the last year, Valeri has almost entirely stopped eating gluten and greatly reduced his dairy intake - minimizing his consumption of two staples in Italian food.\n\n\"The goal was to be better at the end of the season, to feel better physically because I'm getting older,\" Valeri said.\n\nBefore the 2017 MLS season, Valeri was already a four-time MLS All-Star and had twice been named to the MLS Best XI. But this year, the 31-year-old has incredibly taken his game to yet another level. Valeri currently leads MLS with a club-record 20 goals this season, has scored in an MLS-record nine consecutive games and is a front-runner to win the MLS MVP award.\n\nThe increase in production has come in a year where Valeri has actively worked behind the scenes to better take care of his body and continue to improve his game.\n\n\"That's what good pros do,\" Timbers coach Caleb Porter said. \"They take care of themselves and they have people around them that help them. All the little things add up.\"\n\nAfter turning 30 last year, Valeri started to think seriously about what he could do to better navigate the long MLS season and make sure he was still able to perform at his peak by the end of the year. Along with altering his diet, he decided to put a greater emphasis on his rest and recovery this season and devote extra practice time to adding new skills to his game.\n\nValeri said he consulted with a nutritionist in making the decision to all but eliminate gluten and reduce his dairy consumption, but he also credited his wife, Florencia, with helping him stick to the diet plan.\n\n\"My wife, Florencia, helped me a lot,\" Valeri said. \"She started to work with me more in the diet, eating almost no gluten, less dairy... It's a long season. You don't have a break in the middle, so it was all about that, thinking more about rest and rehab and doing what I could to feel better physically.\"\n\nValeri also spent the offseason working hard to improve key aspects of his game in an attempt to be more versatile in the attack for the Timbers this year.\n\nHe spent hours on the training field working on scoring goals with his head - something he had never accomplished in an MLS game before this season. This year, he has netted five goals with his head, which is tied for first in that category in MLS.\n\n\"It was a part of my game that I wanted to improve,\" Valeri said. \"I had to add that to my playing because before I always wanted to use my right foot. So, it was good for me to add that to my game and good for the team too.\"\n\nAfter daily practices, Valeri has made an effort to spend more time focusing on his recovery and rest as well in hopes of staying healthy throughout the long season.\n\nIn each of his first two years in MLS, Valeri suffered significant injuries late in the year. He underwent sports hernia surgery in 2013 before tearing his ACL in October 2014 and missing the start of the 2015 season. But this season, Valeri has started in all but two games and said that he has never felt better at this point in the year.\n\nWhile it's impossible to know exactly what impact the change in diet and routine has had on his performance on the field, there is no doubt that Valeri's historic run this season has been massive to the Timbers.\n\nAnd he isn't slowing down.\n\n\"I'm happy to help the team,\" Valeri said.\n\n-- Jamie Goldberg | jgoldberg@oregonian.com\n\n503-853-3761 | @jamiebgoldberg",

      "Recently, there has been a spout of attention about how to deal with eval(base64_decode(\"blah\")); style attacks. A number of posts about \"The Dreaded eval(base64_decode()) - And how to protect your site and visitors\" have appeared lately. They have been suggesting how to mitigate the attacks. This is downright bad.\n\n\nMitigation As A Solution\n\nThe problem is that these posts have been suggesting things like \"Disable eval() \" and \"Disable base64_decode() \" as possible solutions. And while tecnically that would work, it completely misses the point, and does nothing to protect users.\n\nThe Real Problem\n\nThe real problem is that an attacker managed to get code onto the filesystem. The fact that they used eval just obfuscates that fact. They could write an arbitrary payload, and still be able to do anything they wanted. Disabling eval() doesn't fix the vulnerability. It just masks it.\n\nThe proper solution\n\nThe proper solution is to fix the vulnerability that allowed an attacker to inject code in the first place. That's the only way to actually fix the issue.\n\nThe problem is that there's no easy way to fix arbitrary vulnerabilities. It requires looking deep into the code and the problem at hand to figure out what to do. So instead of suggesting how to properly fix the problem, people suggest workarounds or \"quick fixes\".\n\nThe Cancer\n\nThis is a pervasive problem that goes far deeper than just software blogs. It's embeded in our society. It's pervasive. It's killing us, without us even realizing it.\n\nWe tend to favor quick solutions instead of actually understanding the problem or putting the effort into the proper solution. Entire industries are built on this mentality. And it's killing us slowly (or quickly, who knows).\n\nNeed to build a website? Just use WordPress!\n\nNeed to encrypt some data? Just use XYZ library!\n\nNeed to store data in a database? Just use an ORM!\n\nIf you undestand why, that's fine. But if not, it's just a band-aid on a gunshot wound.\n\nThe Simple Solution\n\nThere is a very simple solution (conceptually at least). As the title of this post implies, don't go for the mediating \"quick fix\". Instead, go for education instead. It's not easy to do. It requires effort on everyone's parts. But it's the right thing to do.\n\nIf you educate people, you only need to do it once. If you mitigate, you need to do it every time (and it likely won't work in the first place). It's the proverabial:\n\nBuild a man a fire, and keep him warm for a night. Set him on fire, and keep him warm for the rest of his life.\n\nWait, no, that's not right… What about this one:\n\nYou can give a man a fish, and feed him for a day. Or you can teach the man how to fish, and feed him for life.\n\nAh yes, that's the one.\n\nThe Deeper Problem\n\nThe deeper problem is that, as a society, we've been shunning education in favor of letting it be someone else's problem. I'm not talking about college education, I'm talking about education as a whole.\n\nIf a student gets a bad grade in school, it's either the student's fault or the teacher's fault. If someone comes into a community and doesn't know the rules, they are the bad one. If someone doesn't know that md5() is bad for passwords, oh the humanity!\n\nIn reality, people learn in different ways. Perhaps the fault wasn't the teacher's nor the student's. Perhaps it was just that the student wasn't inspired. That's not to say that the teach was bad. It's to say that the teacher wasn't a right fit for this particular case.\n\nMotivation\n\nMotivation, I think, is the key. We tend to learn significantly better if we are motivated. And I'm not talking about the \"do this or else\" motivation. I'm talking about that spark, that self-motivation that we get when we're interested in something.\n\nBut how do you motivate someone who doesn't want to be motivated?\n\nHow do you educate someone who just wants an easy solution? A short cut?\n\nThe only answer I have is: By Trying To.\n\nIt's not the easy answer. It requires a lot of effort. But it's worth it.\n\nAnd if you take the effort to teach someone, every once in a while, that person will take the effort to teach someone else. That passion will multiply and thrive…\n\nSo next time someone asks you a simple question, don't just give",
      "The Mute Audio pupDAC\n\nTechnical Highlights Texas Instruments' Highest Quality DAC -\n\nThe mute audio pupDAC is based on the Texas Instruments/Burr-Brown's highest quality DAC, the PCM1794. (The slightly less achieving, but less-expensive, PCM1798 can also be used in the pupDAC and is fully pin-compatible.) A PCM2707 (or PCM2706) is used as a USB to I2S convertor which then feeds the signal to the PCM1794 DAC chip. One feature not commonly seen, but similar to the grubDAC, is that the PCM2707/6 is clocked by a quality crystal oscillator (Crystek C3392-12), as opposed to a simple crystal. It possesses very good performance for low cost.\n\n\n(PCM1794A and PCM2707) Low Voltage Rail-to-Rail Opamp -\n\nSome of the newest, rail-to-rail (very nearly all supply voltage is available for output), low-voltage opamps provide conversion from the differential outputs of the PCM1794 to provide standard analog Left and Right channel signal outputs. The TI/Burr-Brown OPA2835, the new OPA2836, and the National Semiconductor (now TI) LMH6643 opamps are fully compatible and vetted to very low offset in the pupDAC. (Experimenters, have at it for other opamps!).\n\n\n(TI/National Semi LMH6643) No Output Coupling Capacitors -\n\nThe mute audio pupDAC also differs from most available DIY-DACs through the use of a charge pump voltage inverter (TI TPS60403). This provides a completely differentiated positive and negative voltage supply for the opamp. This means that the pupDAC requires no output coupling capacitors. A trivial 10 ohms resistance is provided on the output of the opamp to remove any chance of hiss if the pupDAC is used to directly feed small, highly-efficient heapdhones. Every Voltage Source Regulated -\n\nFinally, although completely powered through its USB-connection, every voltage source on the pupDAC is regulated. No less than five Low DropOut (LDO) regulators are provided. An additional supervisory device, the MCP100T, is provided to reset the DAC in case the proper voltages are not available. We think you will find that the pupDAC is among the finest-sounding and most-sophisticated DIY DACs available that is USB-powered! PCM1794 specs -\n\nThe Texas Instruments/Burr-Brown PCM1794 is a monolithic CMOS integrate circuit that includes a set of stereo DACs and support circuitry using TI's advanced segment DAC architecture. The PCM1794(A) achieves outstanding dynamic performance, signal-to-noise ratio, low distortion, and improved tolerance to clock jitter. The DAC chip uses fully-balanced current outputs. This allows complete control over optimizing the analog performance outside of the chip.

      "Advocates are urging the Joint Commission and CMS to scrap policies that they say can lead to opioid overprescribing.\n\nIn separate letters to both groups, signees asked the Joint Commission to re-examine its Pain Management Standards -- which once helped push the idea of pain as the \"fifth vital sign\" -- and asked CMS to strike patient satisfaction questions about pain from its reimbursement procedures.\n\nThe letters, sent by Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing (PROP), had the support of senior health officials from Pennsylvania, Vermont, Alaska, and Rhode Island, as well as other physicians, medical organizations, and consumer groups.\n\nIn 2001, the Joint Commission rolled out its Pain Management Standards, which helped grow the idea of pain as a \"fifth vital sign.\" It required healthcare providers to ask every patient about their pain, given the perception at the time was that pain was undertreated.\n\nSince that time, the U.S. has experienced a surge in opioid prescriptions -- and, subsequently, an increase in overdoses and deaths tied to these painkillers.\n\nIn a letter to Mark Chassin, MD, MPH, president and CEO of the Joint Commission, advocates ask the organization to re-examine those standards, which lead to overtreatment and overuse of opioids, the group said.\n\n\"Pain is a symptom, not a vital sign,\" the letter states, noting that vital signs such as blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory rate, and temperature can be measured objectively.\n\nIn a letter to acting CMS administrator Andy Slavitt, they ask for removal of the pain-related questions from HCAHPS, the patient satisfaction survey used to determine hospital reimbursement rates.\n\nThe letter focuses on three specific questions: whether patients needed medications for pain, if their pain was well controlled during their stay, and if hospital staff did \"everything they could\" to help with pain.\n\nLinking reimbursements to patient satisfaction with pain treatment results in opioid overprescribing, the groups said.\n\n\"Aggressive management of pain should not be equated with quality healthcare as it can result in unhelpful and unsafe treatment, the endpoint of which is often the inappropriate provision of opioids,\" they wrote.\n\nIn a statement, Joint Commission vice president David Baker, MD, MPH, said his agency's pain standards often take the blame for the current prescription opioid epidemic.\n\n\"The Joint Commission's standards require that patients be assessed for pain, and if they are experiencing pain, then it should be managed,\" Baker said. \"The standards do not require the use of drugs to manage a patient's pain; and when a drug is appropriate, the standards to not specify which drug should be prescribed.\"\n\nA spokesperson for CMS said the agency is \"committed to using measures of hospital quality that improve the overall quality of hospital care.\"\n\n\"As announced previously, CMS is reviewing how pain management is evaluated by patient satisfaction surveys used by hospitals and other health care providers, including review of how the questions these surveys use to assess pain management may relate to pain management practices and opioid prescribing,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nThe letters parallel Congressional efforts to strike the pain management patient satisfaction questions from CMS reimbursements, which are included in the bipartisan Promoting Responsible Opioid Prescribing (PROP) Act in the Senate.\n\nGetting rid of those questions would take the pressure off physicians and hospitals to prescribe narcotics for pain, thereby reducing the risk of addiction by diminishing the number of opioid scripts, according to a press release about the legislation.\n\nThe Senate bill is the companion to House bill 4499, which has been endorsed by the American Medical Association, American Hospital Association, American Society of Addiction Medicine, American Academy of Neurology, American Osteopathic Association, Physicians for Responsible Opioid Prescribing, Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, Friends of NIDA, and American Association of Orthopedic Surgeons.",

      "Image copyright Sean Gallup Image caption China is trying to move away from an export-led economy to one supported by domestic demand\n\nChina saw a sharp fall in the value of its imports last month, figures show, raising further questions over the strength of its economy.\n\nIn dollar terms, imports dropped 20.4% from a year earlier to $145.2bn, a steeper fall than had been expected.\n\nThe drop was due to lower commodity prices and weaker domestic demand.\n\nNext week, China is due to report its third-quarter growth rate, which is expected to be lower than the 7% annual pace seen in the second quarter.\n\nChina recently revised down its growth rate for 2014 from 7.4% to 7.3%, the weakest pace for almost 25 years.\n\nChina has been attempting to shift from an export-led economy to a consumer-led one, although the steep fall in imports suggests domestic demand is not as strong as the government would have hoped.\n\nIn dollar terms, China's exports fell by 3.7% from a year earlier to $205.6bn - although analysts had forecast a steeper fall.\n\nThe country's trade surplus nearly doubled to $60.34bn.\n\nIn yuan-denominated terms, imports fell by 17.7% while exports were down 1.1%.\n\nIn a research note, economists at ANZ said: \"September's import figure does not bode well for industrial production and fixed-asset investment.\n\n\"Overall growth momentum last month remained weak and third-quarter GDP growth to be released next Monday will likely have edged down to 6.4% in the third quarter, compared with 7% in the first half.\"",
      "In an episode reminiscent of the city's embarrassing 2001 fake-drug scandal, two Dallas police officers were arrested Friday on accusations that they lied in court and tampered with evidence in drug cases.\n\nThe officers' arrests, and the circumstances that caused them, have raised questions about whether Police Chief David Brown's top commanders dragged their feet for about a year after concerns arose about the two officers' truthfulness.\n\nIn a brief telephone interview late Friday, Brown categorically rejected any assertions that his department was slow to react. He declined to elaborate.\n\nOfficers Jon Llewellyn, 30, and Randolph Dillon, 44, have been charged with tampering with or fabricating physical evidence, and aggravated perjury. Both are third-degree felonies punishable by up to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.\n\nThe two were also fired after a disciplinary hearing earlier Friday.\n\nMoments after the hearing, the Dallas County district attorney's office announced that it had dismissed 60 cases involving the fired officers. Prosecutors continue to review other cases that involved the two.\n\nThe two men, who were in the same 2009 academy class, were not available for comment.\n\nBob Baskett, an attorney for the officers, previously denied any wrongdoing on his clients' part and would only say Friday that \"they can get an arrest warrant for a ham sandwich.\"\n\nAuthorities say Llewellyn and Dillon lied in court about a Christmas Eve 2011 drug bust that led to the seizure of nearly 600 marijuana plants in a house on Ravinia Drive in Oak Cliff. The details of the tampering charge remained unclear Friday.\n\nIn addition to those cases, Brown also disciplined them for falsely claiming they witnessed a traffic violation that led to a heroin bust in October. Investigators discovered that other officers actually witnessed the traffic infraction.\n\nDeputy Chief Ches Williams said in a recent interview that complaints about Llewellyn and Dillon in the Ravinia Drive case weren't formally investigated sooner because \"at the time we looked at the case, there was no concrete evidence that they had done anything wrong.\"\n\nPolice opened a criminal investigation late last year after a judge ruled that Llewellyn and Dillon repeatedly lied during a civil forfeiture proceeding in which authorities were seeking to keep money seized in one of the cases.\n\n\"There's a culture that we're going to condone officers that are untruthful and if you do try to bring it to our attention, we're not going do anything about it,\" said Michael Smith, a defense attorney involved in the case. \"When it became clear that they've committed perjury, it's only then that they do something about these two cops.\"\n\nThe department has faced similar accusations before. In 2001, it was revealed that paid police informants had planted fake drugs on innocent people.\n\nChief Terrell Bolton initially played down the situation, saying he believed that drug dealers were selling fake drugs and that it was \"a blessing\" authorities had discovered it. The scandal cost millions of dollars in settlements, played a role in Bolton's firing and resulted in the convictions of several former police officers.\n\nFelon's arrest\n\nThe downfall of Llewellyn and Dillon began with their seemingly unrelated Dec. 9, 2011, arrest of felon Melvin Williams at a West Camp Wisdom Road apartment complex. They also seized more than $3,700 from him.\n\nWilliams later said the officers told him they would not take him to jail on drugs and weapons charges if he showed them a drug house. So he took them to the house on Ravinia Drive, he said. The officers have denied Williams' account.\n\nAccording to court and police documents, the officers said they targeted the Ravinia house Dec. 23, 2011, after an unidentified bicyclist told them someone had jumped a fence into the back yard of the home. The uniformed patrol officers said they saw a man appear from an opening under the house, jump on a wooden dolly and open the back door. That man has never been identified.\n\nThe officers said they briefly saw a two-foot marijuana plant in the back doorway before the man entered the house and shut the door behind him. He fled out the front door before they could catch him.\n\nThe officers described what made them suspect drug activity: hoses under the home connected to a water pump; boarded windows with air conditioning units with timers; a pungent marijuana smell; and a neighbor telling them that no one lived there and that two men visited daily.\n\nDillon said he contacted the man listed on the home's water bill and told him someone may have broken into the home. The officers soon saw a man pull into the driveway and briefly enter.\n\nQuick confession\n\n\"This is not going to be a good Christmas,\" the man said as the two officers approached him. The officers said the man, with little prompting, confessed to them he had about 500 plants in the house.\n\nIn a later interview at",

      "Yosef Mizrachi\nAn unrepentant fool. That was my description o r 'Rabbi' Yosef Mizrachi  a bout a year ago when he first let the world know just how much of a fool he is. Unfortunately not everyone thinks he's a fool. Let alone how dangerous he is as a man involved in bringing Jews closer to Judaism. He is a personality that is often invited to speak to large numbers of people for that purpose.\nWhen I addressed this issue last January, I believed he was finished. Surely I thought that the exposure he got after he made his revisionist Holocaust YouTube video claiming that less than a million actual Jews were slaughtered - that no one would ever take him seriously again. Especially after viewing a series of additional ridiculous videos he made prior to that. Some of which I listed and linked to in a subsequent post. But he keeps popping up like a bad penny – to further his absurd and hurtful claims.\nTo the best of my knowledge his Kiruv organization still exists. He has several websites and a facebook page. His Kiruv organization distributes – free of charge - DVDs, Audio CDs, MP3 CDs spreading his hurtful and disgusting messages to Jews seeking to learn about their Jewish heritage.\nAccording to Wikipedia, 1000s of his these items have already been handed out to unsuspecting innocent Jews, believing that he is teaching them the truth of Judaism. What makes him even more dangerous is that he actually believes what he preaches and he mixes it with traditional Jewish thought all jumbled up and presented as a package of truth.\nBritish Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis was quoted recently in the Times of Israel referring to Mizrachi as a 'Preacher of Hate'! They added:\nAn online petition, which describes Mizrachi's views as \"cultish, divisive and contemptible,\" has been signed by 600 people, including leading figures in British Jewry.\nCondemnation of this fellow is not limited to any particular Hashkafa. One might think that the Agudah Moetzes would be reticent to publicly critcize any Orthodox Jew. But here is what Rabbi Yaakov Perlow, the sitting head of the Agudah Moetzes said  last year when he was informed about Mizrachi's outrageous claims about the Holocaust:  \"I condemn in the strongest terms possible the outrageous claim that fewer than a million halachic Jews were killed in the Holocaust. This claim is demonstrably false, profoundly offensive and extremely hurtful. It is an affront to the Six Million Kedoshim, precious, holy, Jewish souls whose lives were snuffed out by thesonei Yisroel. Minimizing the degree of the terrible destruction of Churban Europa, in a most morally irresponsible manner, does a grave disservice to truth, and only gives enemies of Klal Yisrael ammunition for their lies.\"   \nAnd yet, like the 'Energizer bunny' he keeps on going. His influence must end once and for all. In that vein I am pleased to report that I received letter signed by a group of prominent rabbis from across the spectrum of Orthodox Jewry. I was asked to make it public. I am happy to do so here. Here is what it says:  As rabbonim and mechanchim, we are greatly concerned about the popularity in some circles of a \"kiruv\" approach that does not bring honor to the Torah ha-Kedoshah but, on the contrary, creates considerable chilul Hashem.\nEarlier this year, Rabbi Yosef Mizrachi apologized for one particularly offensive statement he made on several occasions. But he has voiced, both before and since that apology, many things that reduce complex issues to simplistic and misleading sound bites. He has also repeatedly arrogated to \"know\" why unfortunate things happen to various people and has presented subtle statements of Chazal in superficial and deceptive ways.\nThat method may entertain and even stimulate some audiences, but it does no justice to the Jewish mesorah. And, especially with the worldwide audience enjoyed by any public speech these days, misleading assertions even when offered with the best of intentions, are particularly objectionable, and even dangerous.\nJewish institutions must be discerning about the credentials and the histories of those to whom they offer the honor of acting as teachers of Torah. We urge all shuls and organizations to act responsibly and take seriously decisions about whom they invite to address their gatherings.\nHere are the signatories:\nHaRav Gedalia Dov Schwartz Rosh Beit Din, Beis Din of America and Chicago Rabbinical Council Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein Editor, Cross Currents\nRabbi Shalom Baum President, Rabbinical Council of America\nRabbi Yosef Benarroch Rosh Midrasha, Midreshet Eshel Mara D'atra, Adas Yeshurun Herzliya Syn",

She is my icon of my whole life.\"\n\nShe felt compelled to give Beyoncé her due because of how blown away she was by Lemonade -- and by the fact that Bey has never won the top prize. \"I felt like it was her time to win,\" she said. \"What the f--- does she have to do to win album of the year? That's how I feel.\"\n\nAdele has made no secret of her membership to the Beyhive. It all started with Destiny's Child's breakthrough single \"No, No, No\" back in 1998, when Adele was just 11, and continues to this day. \"The way that I felt when I first heard 'No No No' is exactly the same as how I felt when I heard Lemonade last year.\"\n\nAnd it's far more than just music for the British singer/songwriter. \"There's friendships I have that are completely tied to us being complete Beyonce stans. I don't take any f---ing sh-- when it comes to anyone not liking Beyonce. You can't be in my life. You simply can't.\"",

      "Imagine shopping online with the promise of 'free delivery' only to be told once you have hit 'checkout' you'll have to incur a charge. It might be £20 for an electric drill, or a whopping £90 for ordering a new mobile phone.\n\nThis is an issue that my constituents deal with on a daily basis and they tell me about it regularly.Those of us who live in the Highlands and Islands or other rural areas will understand the frustration of being forced to pay excessive charges to have goods delivered.\n\nWith the expansion of online shopping, more and more people are buying online for delivery - whether it's your weekly shop, household items, clothes or technology. For people living in big cities and urban areas it can be a cost-effective way to buy essentials and other items - but for people in largely rural areas like my constituency of Inverness, Nairn, Badenoch and Strathspey, shopping online is often a necessity.\n\nIt is clear current legislation to protect online consumers is not working effectively. That's why this week I launched the Consumer Protection (Distance Selling Delivery Charges) Bill in the UK Parliament. If passed by Parliament, the Bill would require distance sellers to provide purchasers with the lowest available delivery cost option; introduce a quality mark for responsible retailers, and establish administrative penalties where vendors advertise statements such as free delivery but subsequently impose charges or conditions.\n\nThere is consumer appetite for improved online shopping across the country, but there are some areas that are being particularly badly served by some retailers and carriers. Costs of delivery will always vary - this is about people feeling excluded because of a disproportionately narrow and costly range of delivery options.\n\nEven people living in cities such as Inverness are being charged punitive surcharges for delivery of goods. Indeed, one of my constituents was recently asked to pay £90 just for the delivery of a mobile phone because Inverness wasn't considered to be part of the UK mainland. Another constituent was asked to pay an extra £20 to have a drill delivered to his home in the town of Nairn. Overall, for goods to the Highland and Islands, 53% of retailers apply a delivery surcharge and consumers have to pay an additional £14.71 on average.\n\nThis unfairness is not only wrong, it is bad for business. When 7 in 10 consumers reluctantly pay a surcharge for delivery of their item, they will look elsewhere next time. In this connected world there is an accepted need for universal services in broadband provision, to allow everyone to participate. Why does that not extend to the product at the end of the process?\n\nExisting laws are often unenforced and are too cumbersome so opportunities around administrative penalties need to be considered. Of course online retailers have the right to choose where they supply their products or services, but consumers should also have the right to know before they get to the last page of their online transaction what they will be charged.\n\nIn the Highlands and in my constituency, there are many mysteries, such as the location of the Loch Ness monster. However, the biggest mystery has to be why Inverness, one of the fastest growing cities in Europe and towns like Nairn are apparently not considered to be on the Mainland - at least according to some couriers. They are not buying boxes to Brigadoon, they are asking for things to be sent to a modern city.",
      "The common carotid artery is a paired structure that supplies blood to the head and neck.\n\nSummary\n\nGross anatomy\n\nOrigin and course\n\nAlthough the left and right common carotid arteries follow the same course through the neck, their origin differs.\n\nOn the left, the common carotid arises directly from the aortic arch whereas, on the right, the origin is from the brachiocephaic trunk. The left common carotid artery can be thought of as having two distinct parts: thoracic and cervical. Since the right common carotid arises cranially, it only really has a cervical portion.\n\nIn the thoracic section, the left common carotid travels upwards through the superior mediastinum to the level of the left sternoclavicular joint where it is continuous with the cervical portion.\n\nThe cervical section of both common carotids follows a similar course. Each vessel passes obliquely upwards from behind the sternoclavicular joint to the level of the upper border of the thyroid cartilage. In the lower neck, the two common carotid arteries are separated from each other by the trachea. However, as the carotids rise in the neck, they diverge come to be separated by the thyroid gland, the larynx and pharynx.\n\nEach common carotid is contained within the carotid sheath which is derived from all 3 layers of the deep cervical fascia. In addition to containing the common carotid artery, the sheath also comprises the internal jugular vein and vagus nerve: the vein lies lateral to the artery, with the nerve in between the two. At the level of the fourth cervical vertebra, the vessel bifurcates into the external and internal carotids.",

      "Sinn Fein's Mary Lou McDonald has been criticized fo allowing her campaign office to sell IRA trinkets.\n\nAmong the IRA items on offer, which are among the best-selling products in the Dublin Sinn Fein shop, are mouse pads, mugs, pins in the shape of rifles and clothing with various IRA slogans.\n\nOne of the most popular products from the shop is a black T-shirt with a picture of three armed paramilitaries in full battle fatigues with the slogan: \"IRA Undefeated Army.\"\n\nThe sale of such merchandise has not gone down well with members of government. Fiann fail TD and Minister for Defense Willie O'Dea has called the sale of such merchandise by a political party for profit \"outrageous.\"\n\nSinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said that no one has mentioned any problems with the IRA memorabilia on sale in the shop, and are focusing on more serious issues, telling the Irish Independent: \"I've been on the doorsteps here for close on three weeks. People have raised with me the fact they are either out of work or fear being out of work. They have raised with me the possibility of their houses being repossessed.\n\n\"Everywhere people have talked about children being educated in prefabs – none of them talked about the merchandise on sale in the Sinn Fein bookstore.\"\n\nThe party is facing criticism about its position on the murder of Detective Garda (police officer) Jerry McCabe. Sinn Fein candidate Toireasa Ferris refused to condemn the 1996 killing of the police officer by members of the Provisiona IRA .\n\n\"They are trying to pose as a respectable political party and also saying violence is sexy. They have shown nothing but contempt for the McCabe family,\" said Minister O'Dea.\n\nAdams has said he condemns the murder, but holds the position that the souvenirs Sinn Fein shop in Parnell Square, which bears a banner of the party's vice president McDonald, are not problematic.",
      "When I worked in the city, I took the train everyday. Over the years, I became friendly with a group of women who took the same train. We would chat and occasionally go for coffee or a drink after work. In this group, there was a woman named Jeannie. She swore she never cooked. Ever. When I worked in the city, I took the train everyday. Over the years, I became friendly with a group of women who took the same train. We would chat and occasionally go for coffee or a drink after work. In this group, there was a woman named Jeannie. She swore she never cooked. Ever.\n\nI asked her how she managed to raise three children to adulthood, but she said she only bought stuff frozen, boxed, or ready-made.\n\nOnce she told me that she had made a BLT, so I jumped on her with, \"So, you must have made bacon.\" No. She used Bacos. Bacos! Those awful-tasting bits of simulated nastiness that are supposed to pass for bacon in salads or on baked potatoes. She may as well have used Beggin' Strips.\n\nIt came to pass that Jeannie's son became engaged to a young lady from Thailand. It being traditional that the groom's family host the rehearsal dinner, we just assumed that it would be held in a restaurant.\n\nJeannie told us that in an effort to please the fiance and her parents, who were here from Thailand for the wedding, she was going to have Thai food. Now, our little town has two excellent Thai restaurants, so we thought, what a nice idea. The bride's family would surely appreciate the gesture, and enjoy the food and ambiance.\n\nWe were not prepared for Jeannie's announcement that she herself was going to do the cooking. What? We all thought she was kidding, and laughed uproariously. Jeannie's idea of going all out was toasting an Eggo, not just thawing it.\n\nShe wasn't kidding.\n\nIn the words of Mary, another member of the Train Gang, \"What the (bleep) are you thinking, Jeannie?\"\n\nHer rejoinder was, \"Well, Janet says if you can read, you can cook.\" All (accusing) eyes turned to me.\n\nWell, yes. I had said that once or twice. I knew that somehow, this debacle in the making was going to be my fault. Scene closes.\n\nNote: I'm no Julia Child, but I am a competent home cook, enjoy doing it, and have been for 40+ years. Even so, I would never dream of preparing a meal for a large crowd, knowing nothing about the techniques or ingredients of another culture.\n\nScene opens. Jeannie's back yard. The Train Gang had been invited to this event, much to our chagrin. Jeannie said she wanted us to come for \"moral support.\"\n\nThe yard did look lovely. There were candles floating in the pool with flowers around the bases and torches for lighting. There was a nice bar with some fruit, cheese, and assorted crackers (from Stop & Shop.) Cocktail hour went really well, and everyone was enjoying themselves until the buffet table was laid and all were called to dig in.\n\nNow, I could make this story a lot longer, but won't. I'll just come out and say it. It was the Hindenburg of meals. Jeannie presided at the head of the table, serving people. She had made Thai sticky rice and had decided to pack it in loaf pans. The operative word here is \"pack.\" She unmolded them for ease of serving. Have you ever had a slice of rice? You haven't lived.\n\nNext stop – curry! Two kinds! The first one was red, and Jeannie said it may be \"a little spicy.\" I don't know what was in it, but it must never be allowed in the hands of America's enemies. It gave new meaning to the term, \"not a dry eye in the house.\" There was no full-on weeping, but tears were shed.\n\nOh boy, another kind of curry! This was he sweet one. Jeannie had discovered the whole sweet-salty-sour-bitter balance thing and this was to counterbalance the heat of the other curry. She had doubled up on the pineapple concentrate and condensed coconut milk.\n\nIf you weren't already crying from the red one, you could have gone into a hyperglycemic shock from the white one. In the name of all that is holy, give me another slice of rice!!",
      "The Houston Dynamo gave a gritty performance in defeating the Montreal Impact by a score of 1-0 last night. It was a victory that looks perhaps a bit lucky the day after as the Impact generate a number of quality opportunities but failed to convert.\n\nIn re-watching the match today, there are several key takeaways that I come away with:\n\nCenter back pairing still learning\n\nCenter backs David Horst and Jermaine Taylor have spent little time playing together given Taylor's injury issues in the preseason and it shows. The Impact were able to get player behind the back line with long balls several times in what looked like confusion between Taylor and Horst as to who was meant to be covering. Fortunately, each time the Dynamo were able to recover and thwart Montreal.\n\nThere are signs of a partnership forming and Horst in particular has shown a good ability to recover and strength in the air, however a more clinical striker like Marco Di Vaio would likely have turned at least one of the long balls into a goal.\n\nMidfield overrun\n\nI have said before that I am not fond of the 4-4-2, especially when facing a 5-man midfield. The Impact deployed a 4-2-3-1 (as many MLS sides are doing this season) and pressed high on the Dynamo. The Dynamo midfield was simply out-manned, especially in the middle of the pitch. This led to a number of dangerous turnovers and quick counter-attacks.\n\nMontreal's midfield is better than the one the Dynamo faced against New England last week, but by no means is it the best in the league. The Dynamo are going to have to make tactical adjustments if teams continue to employ 5-man midfields and press high against them.\n\nForward work\n\nWill Bruin and Giles Barnes are both doing work off the ball that often goes unnoticed by fans. Andrew Driver's 10th minute opportunity was created not only by a surging drive by Barnes but also a wonderful near post run by Bruin which pulled the defenders away from the middle and left Driver wide open. This was similar to Barnes' near post run against New England which left Bruin alone on the far post for a goal.\n\nIn the 15th minute, Bruin popped up all the way back in the box to cut off a dangerous pass that might have led to a scoring opportunity. In the 51st moment, Barnes picked off a corner at the far post to stop what would have been a point blank opportunity. Both players are contributing heavily not just on the ball but off of it and on defense as well.\n\nPlayer Ratings\n\nTally Hall (7) – Came up big several times stopping close range shots. Was master of his area in the 2nd half, taking the pressure off the defense by coming off his line to cut out crosses often. Punted the ball directly over the sidelines several times, however, which gifted possession to Montreal.\n\nCorey Ashe (6.5) – Solid defensively and going forward. Had a spectacular recovery in the 63rd minute in the box to cut off a pass on a play that was nearly identical to Driver's opportunity in the 1st half. Made a couple of sloppy passes leading to turnovers.\n\nDavid Horst (7) – Strong in the air again. Showed good recovery ability in the 3rd, 7th and 56th minute to break up attacks. Nearly had a header on goal in the 34th minute. Made several sloppy passes, however, including one in the 39th minute that led to a point blank opportunity for Wenger.\n\nJermaine Taylor (5.5) – Was the weak link of the defense last night. Turned the ball over often, committed unnecessary fouls in dangerous spots and whiffed on a header that fell to Wenger with only a goal line clearance by Sarkodie saving the Dynamo blushes. Was physically strong defensively to break up a few opportunities, otherwise would have been rated lower.\n\nKofi Sarkodie (7) – Kept the Dynamo in front with a key goal line clearance in the 62nd minute as well as a great slide tackle in the box to stop an attack in the 76th. Put in a number of quality crosses on the offensive end and drew a corner with a nice run into the area. Drew a card on a calculated tackle that stopped a dangerous counter-attack. Did have a few sloppy passes that led to turnovers, however.\n\nBrad Davis (6.5) – Ran at the defense and generally put them under pressure. Put some quality service into the box. His set pieces were often place far too close to the keeper, however.\n\nBoniek Garcia (6.5) – Generally good performance, particularly in the 2nd half. Ran hard, defended well, had two top quality shots at goal in the half. Struggled at times in the 1st half with the high pressing and midfield numbers of Montreal, however. Conceded possession multiple",
      "Diana Elliot. Photo courtesy Pew Charitable Trusts.\n\nThis has been lightly edited for clarity.\n\nDiana Elliott, Research Manager,Economic Mobility Project at The Pew Charitable Trusts, and one of the authors of a new report on Generation X's finances.\n\nLast year, we did a study that looked at retirement security across generations. Gen Xers — those born between 1965 and 1980 — were hit particularly hard by the recession, we found.\n\nThey lost 45-percent of their wealth.\n\nIt was clear Gen Xers experienced hard times. They were just starting to hit their prime working years, were just starting to buy homes… They're in their 30s and 40s today.\n\nSo, we became interested in how Gen Xers as a group compared to, specifically, their own parents. We found that three-fourths of Gen Xers have more household income than their parents did at the same age.\n\nBut only one-third had more wealth — which includes property, savings, etc.\n\n\n\"A New Financial Reality,\" Pew Charitable Trusts: http://www.pewtrusts.org/~/media/Assets/2014/09/Pew_Generation_X_report.pdf\n\nThat's largely because Gen Xers, as a group, have a great deal more debt than their parents did. The median has six times more debt.\n\nWe wanted to understand why. What was going on with their wealth?\n\nWhen we dug deeper, we found that college graduates in particular have less wealth than their parents. That's related to their student debt.\n\nIn 2011, four in 10 Gen Xers with a college degree still had student loan debt. The typical amount was $25,000.\n\nQuite a drag on their wealth.\n\nThis has implications for the future. If Gen Xers are still paying their own student loan debt, it's unclear if they can save enough money for their children's educations.\n\nAnd if Gen Xers don't have the wealth they need to retire, their future economic security is at risk. They can't invest in themselves or their children – and that jeopardizes future economic mobility.\n\nSome of our forthcoming work is looking at savings programs, trying to answer the questions: What can be done to improve emergency savings? How can we encourage greater savings?\n\nI also believe debt, and its consequences, should be addressed to younger generations. Understanding debt is an important step forward.\n\nIt's unclear what will happen to Millennials. They are still young enough to change the course.",

      "Poll found 70% of Australian adults believe it is acceptable to spy on nations Australia does not have a good relationship with\n\nDespite shocking revelations in the last year that the Australian government spied on its neighbours, most people are unfazed by government espionage against other countries, friendly or otherwise.\n\n\nAs prime minister Tony Abbott meets with Indonesian president Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono for the first time since a diplomatic scandal over spying revelations in November, the 10th annual Lowy Institute poll has also revealed that many Australians think the relationship is continuing to worsen.\n\n\nThe poll found that 70% of Australian adults believe it is acceptable to spy on nations Australia does not have a good relationship with, and half of Australian adults also find spying on friendly nations acceptable, including key allies such as New Zealand (51%), Japan (58%), France (53%) and the United States (54%).\n\n\"It seems to be acceptable to the majority of Australians to conduct espionage activities against all of those countries, regardless of whether Australia has generally good relations or not good relations with each of them,\" the poll's author, Alex Oliver, told Guardian Australia.\n\nAustralians were apparently left unperturbed by news that intelligence agencies spied on Yudhoyono, his wife and several key advisers, as revealed by Guardian Australia in November last year, or that the government also spied on East Timor during negotiations over a resources deal.\n\nThe poll found that 62% and 60% of Australians respectively thought spying on those two nations was acceptable.\n\n\"The timing of the poll was taken in the second two weeks of February so it was just a few months after the Snowden revelations,\" said Oliver, adding that the revelations would have had an impact on people's responses.\n\n\"What's surprising is the high levels of acceptance Australians have of that conduct by their government. The espionage practices, if you like, of the Australian government seem to be quite acceptable to the majority of Australians.\"\n\nJust 7% of respondents thought the relationship between Australia and Indonesia was improving, while 40% believed it was worsening. More than half still think of it as \"friendly\" however.\n\nAbbott will meet with Yudhoyono on Wednesday, in the first face to face meeting since relations between the two countries soured over the spying scandal.\n\nBefore his departure, Abbott downplayed revelations on Tuesday that Yudhoyono had allowed journalists to record a phone call between the two leaders, unbeknown to the Australian prime minister.\n\nWhen the two leaders meet, Australians will be hoping regional security, terrorism and people smuggling will be on the agenda, which, according to the poll, are the most important areas that about three-quarters of Australians want to see worked on.\n\nWhen asked to choose one single issue, 29% of respondents said \"asylum seekers and people smuggling\".\n\nThe majority of Australian adults agree with Abbott's turnback policy, but 57% do not support the Rudd-introduced policy that sees no person seeking asylum by boat granted settlement in Australia.\n\nA similar portion (60%) is in favour of offshore processing on Nauru and Papua New Guinea's Manus Island, a figure which is largely unchanged from 2013. Both those Australian-run detention centres are routinely criticised by human rights advocates, medical professionals and the United Nations.\n\nOn the proposition that all asylum seekers should be processed in Australia regardless of their mode of arrival, 51% were in favour and 49% against. A similar split occurred on the issue of temporary protection visas",

      "In all developed countries, women, especially mothers, work fewer paid hours than their spouses. However, the magnitude of the gender gap varies significantly by country, ranging from 2 to 20 hours per week in this study. Using data from the 2002 International Social Survey Programme, this article investigates whether work-hour regulations have a significant effect on household allocation of paid labour and gender work-hour inequality. Two main types of work-hour regulations are examined: standard weekly work hours and the maximum allowable weekly work hours. Results show that households in countries with shorter maximum weekly work hours had less work-hour inequality between spouses, as each additional allowable overtime hour over the standard working week increased the work-hour gap between couples by 20 minutes. These results indicate that couples' inequality in work hours and gender inequality in labour supply are associated with country-level work-hour regulations.\n\nBatalova, J, Cohen, P ( 2002 ) Premarital cohabitation and housework: couples in cross-national perspective .

      "Commissioner Don Garber claimed that MLS is \"the seventh-highest attended professional soccer league in the entire world\" in his annual state of the league address ahead of the 18th season.\n\nIn a break from the traditional teleconference format, the Commissioner spoke in front of an invited audience at Google HQ in New York, in a Google hangout event that included questions from journalists and fans both in the building and online. The event was streamed live on YouTube.\n\nOther than the format, a self-conscious nod to the league's desired demographic of 18-35 year olds, there were few surprises in the commissioner's address, with the New York stadium, expansion, the new partnership with the French Federation, PRO and general discipline, getting an expected airing.\n\nAs he often does at these addresses, the commissioner used his opening remarks to wheel out a set of statistics, designed to illustrate the rude health of the league. While a couple of the stats erred on the side of generosity (the \"600 players\" employed by the league doesn't quite tally with 19 teams - even assuming all their 30 man rosters were full), there were several key indicators that have been verified elsewhere and that do seem to suggest a new era for the league. For example, Garber's comment that 12 of the 19 coaches currently employed had once played in the league, seems to suggest a healthy critical mass.\n\nGarber also raised eyebrows with his remark that in terms of attendance, the 6 million people who attended games last season, at an average of just under 19,000 per game, makes the league the seventh best attended one in the world. Later, in answer to a question about whether the league was respected elsewhere in the world, he cited his experiences speaking with French officials this week at the launch of a new training initiative there (19 coaches, mostly reserve team, youth and technical coaches will be involved in an ongoing exchange program with France's famous Clairefontaine center) and pointedly mentioned that the league was now ahead of Ligue 1 in terms of average attendance.\n\nUnderstandably, given the location, and the fact that the project increasingly seems to be the commissioner's main obsession, the proposed NY stadium at Flushing prompted repeat questions, though the response seemed to suggest a holding pattern, with Garber trying to avoid being pinned down on the timeframe for a decision on whether it was viable to proceed, despite attempts to prompt him: \"Definitely not three years.\" Later, after describing the slow process of negotiating stadium building in New York, Garber conceded, \"We're hoping to get something done this year, but if that doesn't happen we probably want to take a step back and see if there's another market we want to move in to.\"\n\nThat market could well be Orlando. The USL Pro side have been vigorous campaigners for a franchise that would restore an MLS presence in Florida after the league's 2002 contraction, and the commissioner noted that the backers of the team look to be getting closer to securing their mooted $110m soccer-specific stadium (though it still faces public partnership issues of its own) — \"if they're able to achieve that, it makes them an even more viable candidate than they are today.\"\n\nThe commissioner was careful not to commit though, and was sure to cite Orlando, Miami, Minneapolis and Atlanta as ongoing participants in discussions. When I asked him if teams that had chosen to develop in NASL, rather than USL Pro (the lower league MLS just partnered with for reserve team play), faced a rockier road towards ultimately gaining an MLS franchise, he was careful to delineate that the partnership was purely for technical development of players. Yet it's arguably a partnership that might not have come about had the second tier NASL shown any inclination to negotiate on reserve team partnerships. In bypassing them, the geographical and strategic spread of players who will now have more or less direct links to MLS changes. Put it this way, it probably doesn't hurt Orlando City's case that they are currently playing in the third tier USL Pro.\n\nThe new sense of friction when it comes to the NASL, is of course, partly due to the team who will be joining that league later this year - the New York Cosmos. Last year Garber referred to the \"ghost\" of the old NASL still haunting the corridors of MLS, as a cautionary tale that defines the younger league's character and prudence. Famously, the original version of the NASL collapsed in the wake of the boom times of the Cosmos coming to an end. Now, even as MLS overtakes the NASL as the longest running first division soccer league in American history at the start of its 18th season, the Cosmos are back. Not only that, but they are speaking pointedly of their business decision to go with a league that offers no restriction on their business model and commercial rights negotiations.\n\nOn most issues related to the Cosmos and NASL, Garber was inclined to defer to the position of you'd have to ask them that, when questions got too",

      "Madonna is disgruntled. Blond Ambition, the biopic of her early days, is arguably one of the most anticipated movies of recent years. Its script was so acclaimed that it topped last year's Black List. It's being made by Michael De Luca, who produced The Social Network. It has the potential to do the business both critically and commercially. But Madonna hates it.\n\nMadonna responds to Blond Ambition biopic news: 'Only I can tell my story' Read more\n\n\"Only I can tell my story. Anyone else who tries is a charlatan and a fool. Looking for instant gratification without doing the work. This is a disease in our society,\" Madonna said on Instagram this week in response to the film, even though – as a recent BBC fact-checking article revealed – it all seems quite accurate.\n\nBut still, at least Madonna is in decent company. Plenty of personalities have been disappointed by the films made about their lives. Like it or not, here are Madonna's new peers.\n\nDavid Letterman, The Late Shift\n\nIf you're interested in flat-out egomania, Bill Carter's The Late Shift is an unmissable book. It details what happened to American television when Johnny Carson retired from The Tonight Show in 1992, and the bitter rivalry between Jay Leno and David Letterman that formed in the vacuum he left. Arguably, Letterman is the only sympathetic character in the entire book – he comes off as an original thinker stymied by corporate cowardice – but that didn't stop him from throwing a series of public tantrums when the film of the book came out. \"The guy who's playing me – and I'm sure he's a fine actor – but his interpretation seems to be that I'm, well, a circus chimp. He looks like he's insane, like he's a budding psychopath,\" Letterman told Entertainment Weekly upon the film's release.\n\nHunter 'Patch' Adams, Patch Adams\n\nOf course Hunter Adams hates Patch Adams. Everyone hates Patch Adams. Patch Adams is so bad that, if it happens to be on television, it makes you briefly hate the concept of television. It's cloying and sanctimonious, manipulative in all the worst ways, and it plays to almost all of Robin Williams' worst impulses. So imagine how much more you'd hate it if you actually were Patch Adams. In fact, don't worry, because Hunter Adams has been quite vocal about it. He told New Renaissance magazine: \"After the movie, there wasn't a single positive article about our work or me. It made my children cry. I knew the movie would do this. Imagine how shallow that is relative to who I am.\" He then added: \"I keep a list of 50 books in my wallet as my card, so that when someone comes up and asks me for an autograph I give them a little lecture on pop culture and how it's dummified our population,\" which at least explains the film's sanctimony.\n\nIke Turner, What's Love Got To Do With It\n\nHad it not been for What's Love Got To Do With It, Ike Turner might have been best known as the inventor of rock'n'roll. Now, though, he'll forever be an all-time baddie. The film portrayed Ike as violent and possessive, and his reputation never recovered. Needless to say, he was not necessarily a fan. It put him in a bad light, he told the Los Angeles Times, because he was never actually violent towards his wife. Well, he was, but only a bit. \"The only time I ever punched Tina with my fist was the last fight we had,\" he said. \"Prior to that, our fights, or our little slaps, or whatever they were, were all just about attitude … She would take that attitude with her on to the stage and that would really depress me. So after the show, I'd end up slapping her or something.\" See? He was a nice guy, really.\n\nJulian Assange, The Fifth Estate\n\nIt's impossible for anyone at the Guardian to judge The Fifth Estate objectively, because we're all in it. Fortunately the film's primary subject Julian Assange was smart enough to maintain his critical eye. In a letter to lead actor Benedict Cumberbatch before the film was made, Assange called it \"a work of political opportunism, influence, revenge and, above all, cowardice. It seeks to cut our strength with weakness. To cut affection with exploitation. To cut diligence with paranoia … And above all, to cut the truth with lies.\" He also told Cumberbatch that by starring in the film \"our paths will be forever entwined\", which turned out to be nonsense because only about six people actually saw it, and four of those hated it.\n\nWhitey Bulger, Black Mass\n\nWhitey Bulger hasn't seen Black Mass, because he's too busy serving",
      "Last week, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew announced plans for a redesign of the $10 bill, marking the first time in more than a century that a woman will be featured on a U.S. bill.\n\nWomen on 20s is a grassroots organization, started in 2012 by Barbara Ortiz Howard, with the goal of replacing the face of Andrew Jackson on the $20 with an iconic American woman. The group held an online \"primary\" election from March 1- April 15, where the public voted for three of 15 candidates, including influential women such as Sojourner Truth, Susan B. Anthony, Clara Barton and Betty Friedan. The second round of elections narrowed the 15 women down to four finalists: Eleanor Roosevelt, Harriet Tubman, Rosa Parks and Cherokee Nation chief and Native American activist Wilma Mankiller. The public had until Mother's Day to cast their votes. More than 600,000 people voted, and abolitionist and humanitarian Harriet Tubman emerged as the winner, beating Eleanor Roosevelt by around 7,000 votes. On May 12, 2015, Women on 20s presented President Obama with the online results—along with a petition calling on him to direct the secretary of the treasury to replace Andrew Jackson by 2020. In April 2015, Senator Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire added her congressional support by introducing the Women on the Twenty Act to Congress, which called for the formation of a panel of citizens to come up with a recommendation for which woman should appear on the $20.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nWhy the $20? Andrew Jackson's controversial past played a part in the recent push by Women on 20s and others. His opposition to a centralized American banking system, which culminated in the infamous \"Bank War,\" favored silver and gold coins over paper money, making him—for many—an unusual choice for inclusion on U.S. currency. Jackson's actions with regards to the treatment of Native Americans have also been cited. He was responsible for the Indian Removal Act of 1830 where Native Americans were forcibly removed from their homes to prepare for white European settlers. The subsequent journey became known as the Trail of Tears, during which Native Americans not only lost their homes, but thousands lost their lives.\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nADVERTISEMENT Thanks for watching! Visit Website\n\nHowever, to the surprise—and disappointment—of many advocates, the $10 bill was chosen instead of the $20. Secretary Lew explained this decision simply—to combat counterfeiting. \"Currency is primarily redesigned as necessary to address current and potential security threats to currency notes,\" the Treasury states on the FAQ section of their new site. The Advanced Counterfeit Deterrence (ACD) Steering Committee recommended the $10 based on current threats. The current $10 entered circulation in March 2006, with updates at the time that included subtle changes to the orange, yellow and red shades of the note. The last bill to get a comprehensive counterfeiting upgrade was the $100 in 2013, which included color-shifting ink, enhanced watermarks, raised printing and a blue 3-D ribbon down the center of the bill. When the bill is moved up and down or side-to-side, a series of \"100\" numerals and bells in the ribbon moves, and when the bill is titled, it reveals a green Liberty Bell.\n\nWhile a change to the faces on U.S. paper money is not new, it is definitely not common. The face on the $10 was last changed in 1929, when Alexander Hamilton replaced Andrew Jackson, who was moved to the $20. What will happen to Hamilton, the nation's first secretary of treasury? It is unclear exactly how, but Secretary Lew stated he would still be a part of the redesigned $10 bill alongside the yet-to-be-named-woman, a development that was also a disappointment to Women on 20s. \"We would love to see a woman not have to share her glory, and her opportunity to be recognized and honored,\" said executive director Susan Ades Stone.\n\nThe last time a woman was featured on U.S. paper money was from 1891 to 1896 when Martha Washington was on a $1 silver certificate. Before that, Pocahontas made a brief appearance on a $20 note from 1865 to 1869. But since then women, including Susan B. Anthony and Sacagawea, have been relegated to coins.\n\nThe United States will be joining 10 other countries that currently feature women on their paper money. Britain recently made headlines when they announced that an upcoming redesign of the 10-pound note would feature Jane Austen, making her the only woman other than Queen Elizabeth II to appear on British currency.\n\nAs to which face is next in line to appear on the $10 bill, Treasury Secretary Lew has solicited ideas from the public, including not only which woman should be selected as a representative of inclusive democracy,, but also which symbols of democracy should be included on the new bill.

      "Loopholes in Canadian law are allowing a \"corrupt elite\" to use the housing market for money-laundering, says a new report from Transparency International (TI).\n\nThe report found 10 problem areas with the laws related to real estate transactions in Canada, Australia, the U.K. and the U.S. — four countries it identifies as being hot-spots for real estate-related money laundering.\n\n\"Canada's legal framework has severe deficiencies under four of the 10 identified areas,\" TI stated in the report. \"In the other six, there are either significant loopholes that increase risks of money laundering through the real estate sector or severe problems in implementation and enforcement of the law.\"\n\nLuxury homes in Vancouver are a target for money-launderers, Transparency International says in a new report. (Photo: Getty Images)\n\nOne glaring problem is a lack of rules requiring that the actual owner (or \"beneficial owner\") of a property be identified. In Canada \"there are no requirements for any person involved in real estate closings to identify the beneficial owner,\" the TI report stated.\n\nIn a study published last December, TI found that the government does not know who owns 46 of the 100 most expensive homes in Vancouver.\n\nThe report found that 29 of the homes were owned by shell companies, either Canadian or offshore.\n\n\"Offshore companies pose a serious risk ... because they are able to purchase property without needing to disclose any information relating to who ultimately owns and controls them to any government authority,\" TI said in the report published Wednesday.\n\nThe report noted that money-laundering through real estate is growing increasingly popular.\n\n\"Large amounts of money can be legitimized at once, maintaining or increasing its value. Investments in real estate are seen as an alternative for those who fear having offshore accounts frozen.\"\n\nThis chart from Transparency International shows what is known, and not known, about the ownership of Vancouver's 100 most expensive homes.\n\nBecause of over-reliance on banks to spot money-laundering activities, and because banks aren't involved in cash purchases of homes, money-laundering is going unnoticed, the report said.\n\nAnd like in the other countries studied, in Canada \"there are no data on prosecutions against real estate agents or other professionals for facilitating money laundering.\"\n\nCanada has \"the best model\" for enforcement of money-laundering laws among the four countries studied, the report said, but Canada's financial intelligence agency, FINTRAC, investigates relatively few real estate transactions.\n\nThe report lays out a series of recommendations for governments, including requiring all professionals involved in a real estate transaction to disclose the actual buyer. This should also be required of companies that are buying real estate, the report said.\n\nIt also suggested that professionals involved in real estate transactions, such as lawyers and realtors, be registered with a country's anti-money laundering authorities before they are allowed to practice.\n\n\"Governments must close the loopholes that allow corrupt politicians, civil servants and business executives to be able to hide stolen wealth through the purchase of expensive houses in London, New York, Sydney and Vancouver,\" TI chair José Ugaz said in a statement.\n\n\"The failure to deliver on their anti-corruption commitments feeds poverty and inequality while the corrupt enjoy lives of luxury.\"\n\nAlso on HuffPost",

      "How could any decent person NOT condemn the vile murder of three young US Muslims in Chapel Hill? http://t.co/pdtwnKqYG3 — Richard Dawkins (@RichardDawkins) February 11, 2015\n\nDawkins takes the obviousness of his moral frame for granted; he doesn't feel the need to offer an earnest denouncement of these murders because he does not honestly believe any person could view them as an outgrowth of a system decent people like him are a part of. But this is a persistent problem with the New Atheist movement: Because it is more critical of religion than introspective about its own moral commitments, it assumes there is broad agreement about what constitutes decency, common sense, and reason. Yet in doing so, New Atheism tends to simply baptize the opinions of young, educated white men as the obviously rational approach to complicated socio-political problems. Thus prejudice in its own ranks goes unnoticed.\n\nIn 2013, Pew found that American atheists are overwhelmingly young and male, with 38 percent between the ages of 18 and 29, and 67 percent male. Pew also found that atheists in America tend to be college educated at higher rates than the rest of the population, with some 43 percent of atheists holding a college degree, compared to 29 percent of the general population. Polling data gathered by the Atheist Census depicts an even more pronounced split when it comes to age and education, and shares conclusions with Pew on the gender makeup of American atheism, with roughly two-thirds of atheists identifying as male.\n\nWith numbers like these, it's no surprise that the id of New Atheism tends toward ordaining modes of thought and expression that privilege educated white men. For Richard Dawkins, the fact that Islam is inherently violent is as obvious as the fact that everyone should believe as much. More telling yet are his other prejudices, expressed with equal certitude and impatience: that western feminists have no legitimate problems compared to women in Muslim majority countries; that good pornography would set theocracies aright, had we the magnanimity to bestow it upon them. Dawkins is joined in his convictions about Islam by other New Atheists like Sam Harris and Bill Maher. In each case, the assumed obviousness of Islam's putative wrong-headedness is accompanied by a thoroughgoing persecution narrative, in which those few brave atheists willing to offend Muslims view themselves as crusaders for common sense.\n\nAnd perhaps this is another parallel with the religious attitudes New Atheism takes as its target: Like any number of global faiths, New Atheism presumes its framework and considers its truth-claims to be either self-evident or demonstrable by whatever means it already assumes legitimate. Its id is a product of the cultural and political landscape in which the majority of its congregants find themselves, which is again true of the religions it nonetheless essentializes to particular texts, creeds, and dogmas. And, like any other religion, its adherents can take its reasoning too far, and cross the line into violence. New Atheists like Dawkins will point out that nothing in New Atheism necessitates violence, and that many principles of the movement directly oppose it; they should be used to this kind of statement by now, as it's precisely the argument they encounter and dismiss time and time again when it issues from religious faiths.\n\nPerhaps this will be a moment of reflection for the New Atheist movement and its adherents. If nothing else, the takeaway should be that no form of reasoning, however obvious to a particular cohort, has a monopoly on righteousness. And no ideology, supernatural or not, has a monopoly on evil.",

      "Fly or Go by Train\n\nRailways boast a 29% share of the Japanese passenger transport market. This is partly because the nation's businesses and government offices are concentrated in Tokyo, Osaka, and Nagoya, providing massive captive markets for railways. In addition, shinkansen services between the major cities facilitate extensive inter-city travel. These factors have pushed train use in Japan to higher levels than in other countries, especially compared to countries like the USA, Canada and Australia that have vast land areas and correspondingly much greater dependence on air travel.\n\nIn Japan, airlines play a comparatively small role in domestic passenger transport but their share has grown at a fairly constant rate since the 1960s, and has jumped 5% in recent years. In favorable markets, airlines hold a virtual monopoly.\n\nThe Japanese archipelago is only 500-km wide, but stretches about 2800 km north-south, similar to the distance from London to Athens! Consequently, long journeys in Japan are usually made by air. However, for cities less than about 750 km apart, railways are cutting into the airline's market share, while airlines are gaining for cities that are further apart.\n\nMore than ever before, airlines and railways are locked in fierce competition for inter-city passengers. Faster trains are seriously eroding the position of airlines on a number of previously popular air routes.\n\nTransport market share is affected mainly by pricing, schedules, and service.\n\nRecently, the gap between railway and air fares has shrunk to insignificant levels, so other factors, such as speed and better services now affect passengers' decisions when choosing one transport mode over another.\n\nChanging Fortunes of Railways and Airlines\n\nSoon after World War II, as Japan's domestic airlines began strengthening their position, they realized that they could make little gain without cutting into railway travel, but air fares were higher than railway fares. For many years, the government had permitted Japanese National Railways (JNR) to act as a price leader. Using JNR fares as a yardstick, air fares were set giving consideration to the price of travel by first-class night train (first-class train fare + express surcharge + sleeper surcharge). However, in the early 1970s and 1980s, airlines began introducing more competitive fares. Today, rail and air passengers can often travel for almost the same fare.\n\nThe competitive relationship between airlines and railways has changed for two main reasons.\n\nFirst, as average income rose, consumers began placing greater priority on time. Domestic passengers have increasingly shown a desire to get to their destination as soon as possible. Passenger response to carrier speed can be measured using a speed/demand elasticity index, showing changes in passenger demand when speeds change on specific routes. As speeds increase, the index shows a definite increase, paralleling the rise in income levels. Technical advances in shinkansen and aviation have considerably shortened travel times between Tokyo and Fukuoka, and (in the case of air) between Tokyo and Sapporo. Passenger traffic increased 250% between Tokyo and Fukuoka from 1979 to 1985, and 320% between Tokyo and Sapporo during the same period. Also of note is that as income levels rose, passengers spent proportionately more on air travel. From 1979 to 1985, passenger traffic jumped an average of 11%, greatly exceeding the average increase of 4.4% in real GNP during the same period.\n\nSecond, lower air prices promoted air travel. Technical innovations in aircraft design have resulted in lower unit costs, permitting lower fares. Aircraft became larger during the 1979–1985 period, bringing greater productivity to the airline industry as a whole. As a result, air fares have risen at a lower rate than the overall inflation index.\n\nStarting in 1976, JNR increased rail fares regularly, making travel by air considerably more attractive. Before it was privatized, JNR was hobbled by debt and worsening labour-management relations, both of which led to poorer service. Many passengers abandoned rail travel for air as air fares approached the levels of rail fares. This occurred at a time when the airline industry was protected by government regulations—their greater productivity was not due to their own management efforts. In a market where absolute inter-city passenger volumes were not increasing , we can assume that JNR itself and its problems were the main cause for this growth in the airline industry.\n\nEven so, it cannot be said that the airlines cut into every rail market. After the Tokaido Shinkansen between Tokyo and Osaka started in 1964, Tokyo-Nagoya flights were closed. Similarly, Osaka–Hiroshima flights suffered the same fate after the Sanyo Shinkansen opened in 1972. Shinkansen had a negative impact on air travel on these and other routes. But these high-speed railway lines were constructed to address another issue.\n\nFor example, JNR built the Tokaido Shinkansen primarily to solve the tight capacity on the old Tokaido main line, reducing travel times was not the top priority.

He was also stuck on the McPlan which caused him to sit out a hand full of games during the season, in order to adjust to the rigors of the NHL. He finished the 2016 season having played 69 games with 9 goals and 18 points and while this is still a respectable season for a 19 year old, it's not something to write home about. During his OHL career, McCann was heralded as an elite two-way centre but in my opinion, his tool set (shot, vision, and skating) is better suited for a decent scoring winger in the NHL.\n\nSo, let's say Benning recognizes that McCann is better suited at the wing. This makes McCann an expendable asset as the Canucks have multiple offensive wingers coming up in Anton Rodin, Brock Boeser, and either Pierre-Luc Dubois or Matthew Tkachuk (this trade has to guarantee that we take a forward at number 5 ya?). What I'm trying to say here is that I can live with trading away Jared McCann, a player who is a couple years away from making a substantial impact in the NHL and is on a team that has prospects that can fill his shoes. I realize that this is only based off an assumption but I mean, this is just how I view McCann. Feel free to debate with me whether he has a better shot at being a top 2 centre on a contending team.\n\nNow onto the player the Canucks recieved: Erik Gudbudskis… I mean Gudbranson. At least we can have some fun with his name right guys? Guys?\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks are in dire need of some help on their blue line. They surrendered the 7th most goals in the entire league last year and next year doesn't look to be any better. This trade attempts to address this as Benning dealt from one of the teams strengths in order to fill a glaring weakness. At 6'5 and 216 pounds, Gudbranson is known as a sturdy defensive defenceman who plays a physical game and oozes leadership qualities. Florida Panther's fans are actually upset at this deal because they viewed him as being their next captain. He's everything Jim Benning could ever want… except for his offense. Last year he put up 2 goals and 7 assists in 64 games while being ranked 22nd on the Panther's in CF% (46.1%). The 24 year old probably won't ever put up more than 25 points in a good year and that's being generous however, that's not his game. Keep in mind that he was a former 3rd overall pick while not putting up amazing junior numbers so there has to be more than meets the eye with Gudbranson. If he can prove himself next year as being one of the top shut down defencemen in the league next and we pair him with Ben Hutton, I think that will be a formidable pairing for years to come.\n\nIf McCann and Gudbranson were the only components of the trade, I'd say it's pretty equal. Hell I'd say the Canucks came out on top except, there's more to this deal than just the players. This is where sh*t hits the fan in Canuck land.\n\nThe Vancouver Canucks also traded their 2016 Second and Fourth round draft picks for Florida's Fifth rounder. When I saw this part on Twitter I wasn't sure whether to laugh or cry. Is it bad that I also thought typical Benning? I remember reading somewhere that Corey Pronman thought that this year's draft, after the first round, is not as strong as previous years. That being said, Jim Benning's biggest strength, hell sometimes I feel like it's his only strength, is his drafting ability. I'm not saying the Second round pick is guaranteed to turn into a PK Subban or Shea Weber, the odds of that are incredibly low. But, when you are a team who won't be ready to contend in a number of years, wouldn't it be best to have as many rolls of the dice as possible in finding those Subbans or Webers? Especially if drafting is your greatest skill?\n\nTo end off my thoughts, a trade of this ilk was somewhat predictable. The entire season the Canucks have been saying that they are trying to walk a fine line between developing the future Canucks",
      "The Pentagon's zany research division, DARPA, has announced a new cybersecurity program. A whole new way of thinking about online defense, the agency hopes to tap into the electronic subconscious of – among other things – your dishwasher.\n\nFor better or worse, the world is getting smarter. Televisions, microwaves, coffee machines, traffic lights, cell phones; they all utilize the Internet for networking purposes, using wireless connections for a variety of purposes.\n\n© Flickr / A Health Blog Cyborgs on the March: Is DARPA Implanting Chips in US Soldiers' Brains?!\n\nAll told, these devices are known as the Internet of Things. Modern washer/dryers may take advantage of the smart grid to provide users with convenient remote access. Televisions can stream the latest episode of Empire.\n\nThey are, in a sense, objects that give the nebulous web a tangible place in the physical world.\n\nBut that interconnectivity also makes these devices vulnerable to intrusion. While you may not be too concerned about international hackers breaking in to change the clock on your microwave oven, other connections could pose a bigger threat. Tapping into the grids of major cities could create havoc on a macro scale. Smartphone intrusions could pose problems for individuals.\n\nBut the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) is developing an innovative solution. With a budget of $36 million allocated for the first phase, the agency will launch a program known as Leveraging the Analog Domain for Security.\n\n© Photo : Youtube/IEEE Spectrum Watch DARPA Super Soldier Exoskeleton in Trials\n\nThe name may not be flashy, but the goal is to develop technology which can detect involuntary emissions from smart devices to determine what software functions are being performed.\n\nThink of it like looking for symptoms. If you're sweating, you may be anxious. If you're coughing, you may have a cold. If your Roomba vacuum is coughing, it may have been hacked by ISIL.\n\nOf course, the symptoms emitted by electronics are less obvious. DARPA needs a monitoring system – be it an external or internal component – that can analyze electromagnetic, thermal, acoustic emissions, as well as power fluctuations.\n\n\"[A]ttackers have repeatedly demonstrated the ability to pierce protection boundaries,\" DARPA's announcement read, adding that the project's ultimate goal is to create \"algorithms, tools and devices for mapping analog emissions of digital devices.\"\n\nThe agency's announcement calls for any interested teams to present plans which balance the proposed monitoring system's accuracy with distance from the target object. The winning developers will also have to prove that their system is capable of zeroing in on an intended object, canceling out emissions from other nearby devices.\n\nThose proposals are due by November 10.\n\nThe program, led by DARPA's Information Innovation Office, will be carried out in three stages, and will ideally be completed in four years.\n\nIt may sound far-fetched, but when your dishwasher starts slinging butter knives, you'll be glad DARPA was prepared.",

      "Scientists at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Pacific Northwest National Laboratory have developed a material that can effectively pull uranium out of seawater.\n\nIf the research is found successful, the extracted uranium from the earth's oceans can power all the world's major cities for thousands of years.\n\nThe Extraction Process\n\nThe project, funded by the U.S. Department of Energy, uses a material that consists of braided polyethylene fibers coated with the chemical amidoxime. In seawater, amidoxime attracts and binds uranium dioxide to the surface of the braids, which can be on the order of 15 centimeters in diameter and run multiple meters in length depending on where they are deployed.\n\nAfter that, scientists say an acidic treatment will recover the uranium in the form of uranyl ions, a product that requires processing and enrichment before becoming fuel.\n\nMore Room For Efficiency\n\nAt the moment, the process is still inefficient and expensive, but finding alternatives to uranium ore mining is a necessary step in planning for the future of nuclear energy, says Stephen Kung of the DOE's Office of Nuclear Energy.\n\nResearchers say there are 3.3 micrograms per liter concentration of uranium in seawater, which is equivalent to about 4 billion tons of total uranium available in all Earth's seawater. It will take around eight weeks to extract 6 grams. A 1-gigawatt nuclear power plant needs 27,000 kilograms of uranium to run for one year. As you can tell, the math doesn't add up to an easy solution.\n\nAlthough a renewable future from this angle doesn't seem straightforward—it's from innovations like these that we find ways to improve, make a difference, and ultimately prevail.",
      "It's been a long ride, but it's finally come to an end. 1001 days, and I can safely say that I ticked off 96 of those items successfully. Truthfully, I didn't know where this project would lead me, nor how successful I would eventually be, so how much I ended up throwing myself into this somewhat surprised me. It did require a certain degree of constant attention in order to accomplish all of the goals that I did, and unfortunately it almost became self-sabotaging because of this – it became an end unto itself, as opposed to a means to an end, and for a number of the goals, it became more \"do it to mark it off on the list\" instead of \"do it because you want to.\" I'm going to have a section with advice for people who may want to make their own lists in the future in terms of how to choose appropriate items for themselves, but first I'm going to go back through the list and have some general thoughts on everything.\n\nTravel\n\nProbably one of the most individually rewarding sections of the list, and the one which I was most pleased to actually tick off every item – although I will readily admit that it ended up being a matter of conveniently timed extra vacation time which allowed me to finally knock off not only one of these seven, but two. I got past the original 40 states (and wish I had paced myself a little better because my deep south trip ended up being a bit of a slog with the amount of driving I did because I stuck to my plan as a solo trip when my friend ended up not being able to join me due to work requirements), I made it to New Zealand (yes, I know it's not actually on a Continent, I'm just going with the spirit of the item, deal with it), and all of those trips were simply fantastic. There's no other way to put it. Getting to the Canadian province ended up being a bit much of a \"because it's there\" bit, but I really did enjoy the park I got to – there's still tons more of Alberta to see, so I feel I can hardly count it as \"visited.\" Redwood National Park is now one of my favorites in the state, Channel Islands somewhat less so. I wish I could have spent more time in San Diego, but it would have been better with some companions. Racetrack was neat, but wasn 't even the best part of that trip, and I've discovered a personal love for trains – I'm constantly checking them for other trips for feasibility because I find it to be such a relaxing way to travel. I'm jealous of other countries and their public transit systems. All in all, there's not much I would have changed about this item, beyond perhaps being more realistic about my goals – traveling takes both time and money, and it was only due to the alignment of some items beyond my control that I managed to do all these – and it didn't really leave me with any other vacation to myself (aside from shorter bits for weddings and family), which falls back to one of my earlier comments – having my \"travel\" items defined consumed everything I had to give, and almost demanded more. I didn't have the flexibility to do what I wanted in lieu of it if I wanted to stick to the list, which didn't end up being a problem this time around, but could have been for someone else.\n\nHealth\n\nOnce more, I enjoyed every item on this section, however I should note something very specific and particular to this section: the goals almost became too specific in terms of milestones, to the point where (once accomplished) it became all too easy to fall off the wagon. I bench pressed my own weight 10 times, but I don't believe I could do that any longer as I eventually stopped going to the gym regularly. I ran a marathon, but would be hard pressed to do so now (mind you, I injured myself and I'm back up to half marathon level, and am working back upwards, but the point remains because there was a long period of time where I slacked off). So on and so forth across the board. In retrospect, I think that a \"average X miles per week over the entire project\" or something along those lines would have been a good idea. Regardless, I'm in much better shape than I was at the start, and this section is pretty much entirely responsible.\n\nOutdoors\n\nArguably my favorite item. It was symbiotic with travel (and dictated some of the places I traveled), and it filled me with tons of new experiences. The list of things I probably would not have done those years without having an itemized list to try to hold myself to: whitewater kayaking, multi-pitch rock climbing, cross country skiing, parasailing, bungee jumping (arguable – if I'd still gone to NZ, it'd still have happened, as I did it again), hang gliding, water skiing",

      "I am sitting in the public library in Saint Louis, Missouri, reading memes and reading articles about memes. This is the \"Meme Election\", reporters say, in which Big Bird, bayonets, and binders of women are reshaping the national narrative and changing the power dynamics of our electorate. Experts interviewed on NPR describe memes as a \"participatory form of campaigning\", in which gifs \"created by average people\" trump and subvert the propaganda of candidates. \"The endless riffing of the true internet meme - a repeating, morphing, crowd-sourced play off some minute detail - has taken hold of the campaign conversation,\" writes journalist Amanda Hess.\n\nAs I sit in the library, reading about the empowerment of the masses through memes on my smartphone, a line starts to form at the front desk. This is the line to use a library computer, the only source of internet access for a significant part of the Saint Louis population. For the locals in line, a half hour of library computer use is the only way they can check email, print documents, or apply for jobs. They are the 47 per cent who cannot track the subversion of the 47 per cent narrative online. They are the 23 per cent of Missourians who lack regular internet access, who live outside the meme.\n\nMemes are defined as units of culture which spread virally through commentary, imitations and parody. As Hess noted, they are \"crowd-sourced\" - but the question is whose culture, whose crowd? Memes rely on constant awareness and participation. Internet access is the bare minimum required to understand memes - one must also possess a level of technological and political literacy that many people do not have the time or resources to cultivate. Moreover, they may lack the desire. In an election year, memes can be self-defeating - less an assertion of political power than an avowal of the pointlessness of politics.\n\nMemes tell us more about the people creating and spreading them than they do about the topics they address. They thrive on networks like Twitter, used by less than 16 per cent of the population but by most journalists. This has led to a proliferation of articles on topics such as Paul Ryan's abs, Joe Biden's laugh, and Clint Eastwood's empty chair, their political significance decreed by their ability to prompt widespread mockery. It has also led to a number of articles noting how memes trivialise politics and distract from a serious conversation about the issues.\n\nBut this is only partly true. Memes do not distract so much from a serious conversation about the issues so much as affirm that a serious conversation about the issues is something we have long stopped having.\n\nAlthough memes can frame a political narrative a certain way, they often result in us losing sight of what's important\n\nOverly attached memes\n\nThe crowd that creates memes differs from the crowd lining up to use the public library computers. They are wealthier, better educated, more technologically adept. But they too contend with political and economic powerlessness.\n\nMemes create the illusion of participation in a political system from which people feel increasingly alienated, a system run on wealth that is incomprehensible to a normal person. Memes \"shape politics\" by shaping the mainstream media, an institution which - like the economy, like higher education - has collapsed over the past decade. Desperate for relevance, reporters scoop up memes, so much cheaper (in every way) than facts.\n\nMemes compensate for real reporting while assuaging the ego of the viewer, who gets to see her \"contribution\" to the \"conversation\" on TV. This creates a precipitous hierarchy, where the meme - while touted as powerful - is elevated to importance through its circulation by the media, whose own power has dwindled. The entrance of a meme into mainstream media is both a triumph and the termination of its relevance. Ripped from its natural environment, filmed on a sad-sack CNN report, a meme is no longer a critique of power but a symptom of its own decline.\n\nInternet memes gained popularity in the previous decade, during an era when Bush administration officials bragged that they had transcended the \"reality-based community\" and \"truthiness\" went from the Colbert Report to the Merriam-Webster dictionary. As facts lost currency, satire became the most effective form of political critique, because it was one of the only ways to acknowledge a broken system while still participating in it.\n\nMemes are an extension of this mindset, but the structuring of mainstream media coverage around memes - to the deficit of other issues - raises serious problems in an election year. The bemused mindset of an online elite has become a stand-in for what \"the people\" are thinking.\n\nBinders full of memes\n\nMissouri is rarely meme-worthy. Our greatest claim to fame is a senatorial candidate who believes in \"legitimate rape\". We are not a swing state, we are not a coastal state",

      "GUATEMALA CITY — Many Guatemalans felt vindicated to see the country's former president, Otto Pérez Molina, in court Friday for heading a major corruption scheme. Following several months of massive protests — more than 100,000 people gathered in Guatemala City on August 27, the country's largest protest of all time — Congress voted to remove the President's immunity so that he could be tried for his crimes. In the late hours of Sept. 2, President Otto Pérez Molina resigned. This newly emboldened citizenry is thanks in great part to the work of Thelma Aldana, the country's Public Prosecutor, and Iván Velásquez, head of the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala. Known by its Spanish acronym CICIG, the commission works to eradicate criminal networks in Guatemala. It operates under a U.N. mandate alongside the country's Office of the Public Prosecutor and other state institutions. CICIG has functioned under three commissioners: Spaniard Carlos Castresana, Costa Rican Francisco Dall'Anese and Colombian Iván Velásquez, who has been in office since 2013. Guatemalans have embraced Velásquez with unparalleled enthusiasm. Thursdays, the day the commission often releases its latest charges, have been affectionately deemed \"Thursdays of CICIG.\" On social media, Guatemalans have been calling — only partly in jest — for Velásquez to gain citizenship so he can run for president. Under Velásquez, CICIG offers a rare moment of hope in an otherwise politically weary Guatemala. This weariness has affected the political landscape for the upcoming elections. Leading candidates associated with the current establishment have lost support, while candidates considered to be a break from politics as usual have risen in the polls. Velásquez is viewed as less political than his predecessors. Unlike Castresana, who was known for his political savvy and oratorical pomp, Velásquez has the cool temperament of a diplomat, speaking in a slow, measured tone and rarely showing emotion. \"He's less the kind of person to form immediate friendships or make political connections,\" said Javier Monterroso, who worked in the Public Prosecutor's Office alongside the last two commissioners. \"He's more of an investigator.\" Added Édgar Gutiérrez, a political analyst and security expert, \"Velásquez is not a man seeking protagonism.\"\n\nContraband and corruption\n\nAs early as 2002, under pressure from human rights organizations, the Guatemalan government and the U.N. called for the creation of a commission that would investigate and disband criminal networks, recognizing that many were deeply entrenched in the state. The commission began operating in September 2007. Since its inception, CICIG has successfully investigated high-impact cases such as the self-ordered assassination of lawyer Rodrigo Rosenberg, which captured international headlines. In his short tenure, Velásquez has successfully charged Vice President Roxana Baldetti, the former heads of Guatemalan equivalents to Social Security and the IRS, as well as mayors, judges and eight congressmen. Accusations include graft, fraud and money laundering. On August 21, the Public Prosecutor's Office and CICIG charged President Otto Pérez Molina with leading a corruption scheme in which he accepted bribes in exchange for reducing or waiving taxes for imports to Guatemala. Key to CICIG's ability to successfully pursue cases was the signing of an anti-corruption law in 2012. The law permits the use of wiretaps in investigations dealing with corrupt government officials. These wiretaps have proven essential in prosecuting cases against officials in high echelons of government.\n\n'[Iván] Velásquez is not a man seeking protagonism.\" Édgar Gutiérrez political analyst and security expert\n\nVelásquez has also found an unlikely ally in Public Prosecutor Thelma Aldana. Many suspected President Molina appointed Aldana in May of 2014 with the understanding that she would not rock the status quo by investigating high-level officials. However, Aldana has closely supported CICIG's investigations and defended the renewal of the commission against the wishes of the president. But these factors alone cannot account for the leaps in the fight against impunity Guatemala has experienced over the past four months. Leading voices in national media, civil society, and the private sector agree that the radical change is a result of Velásquez's work at the helm. Once in office, Velásquez developed a strategy to address corruption in powerful state structures, which included changes in investigative methods and priorities. As Monterroso explained, prior to the arrival of Velásquez, most of Guatemala's limited wiretap capacities were dedicated to drug trafficking and kidnapping cases, and were generally operated by the Public Prosecutor's Office. Now CICIG has taken over most of the wiretap lines, and the focus of the investigations has shifted to contraband and corruption in government. Velásquez's background in his native Colombia prepared him well for his work with CIC",

Knowing that because of these patriots, because of you, this country that we love will always shine as a light unto the world,\" Obama said.\n\nClinton also delivered brief remarks, warning governments across the Muslim world to control the rioting, looting and mob mentality that has spread in the wake of an anti-Islamic film posted online.\n\nReferring to the 2011 protests that swept across dozens of countries, Clinton also said that Arab Spring countries \"didn't trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob.\"\n\n\"Reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold acceptable those behind these violent acts. And we will, under the president's leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world,\" Clinton said.\n\n\"There will be more difficult days ahead, but it is important that we don't lose sight of the fundamental fact that America must keep leading the world,\" Clinton said.",

      "The reasons to have a second passport are many, but for the world's wealthy elite, they have often amounted to what Canadian immigration lawyer David Lesperance called \"the backup plan\".\n\nHe recounted a Shanghainese client who likened second citizenship to having a \"fast junk in the harbour, fitted with gold bars\". After generations of turmoil, the bolthole mentality runs deep among China's rich – by one estimate, 47 per cent of rich mainlanders plan to immigrate within five years .\n\nBut it's not just China's millionaires. Americans have represented a big slice of business for Lesperance's Toronto-based practice, as they look for alternatives to a lifetime of tax obligations to the US, which are determined by nationality and not residency.\n\nWhich brings us to the case of the Canadian with eight citizenships.\n\nLesperance said his client didn't start out Canadian; he was an American-born businessman. But at the end of his citizenship spree, he had collected a portfolio of passports via economic citizenship and residency that spanned both sides of the Atlantic, from Belize to Britain. Along the way he became a Canadian, too, and renounced his US citizenship.\n\nMore from the South China Morning Post:\n\nRich Chinese are the new super immigrants\n\nIs huge loophole being opened in Vancouver's foreign buyer tax?\n\nOnce branded spies, Chinese tech trio immigrates to Canada\n\n\n\"It sounds flaky, but he was intrigued by this concept [of economic citizenship]…He had the money. He didn't need another car, so this is what he spends his money on. It was wonderful to be his lawyer,\" said Lesperance, a former Canadian border officer who has worked as an immigration lawyer for more than 25 years.",

      "NEW DELHI/BEIJING (Reuters) - India and China have agreed to an \"expeditious disengagement\" of troops in a disputed border area where their soldiers have been locked in a stand-off for more than two months, India's foreign ministry said on Monday.\n\nThe decision comes ahead of a summit of the BRICS nations - a grouping that also includes Brazil, Russia and South Africa - in China beginning on Sunday, which Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to attend.\n\nIndian and Chinese troops have been confronting each other at the Doklam plateau near the borders of India, its ally Bhutan, and China, in the most serious and prolonged standoff in decades along their disputed Himalayan border.\n\nThe Indian ministry said the two sides had agreed to defuse the crisis following diplomatic talks.\n\n\"In recent weeks, India and China have maintained diplomatic communication in respect of the incident at Doklam,\" the ministry said in a statement.\n\n\"On this basis, expeditious disengagement of border personnel at the face-off site at Doklam has been agreed to and is on-going,\" it said in a statement.\n\nIt did not offer more details of the terms of disengagement from the area which had raised fears of a wider conflict between the Asian giants who fought a brief border war in 1962.\n\nChina said Indian troops had withdrawn from the remote area in the eastern Himalayas. Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said Chinese troops would continue to patrol the Doklam region.\n\n\"China will continue to exercise sovereignty rights to protect territorial sovereignty in accordance with the rules of the historical boundary,\" she said.\n\nThe Chinese defense ministry said troops would remain on a state of alert.\n\n\"We remind the Indian side to learn the lesson from this incident, earnestly respect the historical boundary and the basic principles of international law, meet China half way and jointly protect the peace and tranquillity of the border region,\" spokesman Wu Qian said in a statement.\n\n\"The world is not peaceful, and peace needs to be safeguarded. The Chinese military has the confidence and the ability to protect the country's sovereignty, security and development interests,\" Wu added.\n\nSMOOTH SUMMIT\n\nThe trouble started in June when India sent troops to stop China building a road in the Doklam area, which is remote, uninhabited territory claimed by both China and Bhutan.\n\nIndia said it sent its troops because Chinese military activity there was a threat to the security of its own northeast region.\n\nBut China has said India had no role to play in the area and insisted it withdraw unilaterally or face the prospect of an escalation. Chinese state media had warned India of a fate worse than its crushing defeat in the war in 1962.\n\nIndian political commentator Shekhar Gupta said there was too much at stake for the two countries to fight over a small piece of territory.\n\n\"Hopefully, Doklam is a new chapter in India-China relations. Too much at stake for both big powers to let legacy real-estate issues linger,\" he said in a Twitter post.\n\nIndia and China have been unable to settle their 3,500-km (2,175-mile) frontier and large parts of territory are claimed by both sides.\n\nLin Minwang, an India expert and the deputy director of the Center for South Asia Studies at China's Fudan University, said the detente would ensure a smooth BRICS meeting.\n\n\"Both sides should be happy. Modi is also happy. They can conduct a meeting smoothly and naturally. If there was still a stand-off, how could they meet?\"\n\nFILE PHOTO: A man walks inside a conference room used for meetings between military commanders of China and India, at the Indian side of the Indo-China border at Bumla, in the northeastern Indian state of Arunachal Pradesh, November 11, 2009.

      "One of the problems with the Modern format is card prices as a barrier to entry. When the format was created, one of the compelling features was that every card could be reprinted. And in October 2012, Wizards of the Coast announced Modern Masters, a set of 229 reprints covering cards from Eighth Edition through Alara Reborn. In his explanatory article, however, director of research and development Aaron Forsythe explicitly stated Modern Masters would be an experiment — that cards would not \"turn from scarce to abundant in the blink of an eye\" and that it would \"alter the availability by a matter of degrees.\"\n\nPlayers expecting downward pricing pressure on Modern singles based on increased supply from Modern Masters, a common viewpoint across the Internet, are going to be disappointed.\n\nModern single prices are driven by demand-pull inflation, where we have too much money chasing too few singles. In order for Modern Masters, which will be sold for $6.99 per pack as opposed to the traditional $3.99, to drive single prices down, one or both of the following events has to occur to some degree:\n\nThe supply of Modern Masters must be sufficient to overcome the disparities in supplies from pre-New World Order sets and today. This gap is tremendous, and the supply to be injected will not approach this threshold. And the model below does not take MTGO redemption copies into account because Modern Masters will not be redeemable, as well as the lack of transparency around number of copies that enter the supply via redemption. That implies the supply gap is actually understated.\n\nThe aggregate demand for Modern singles needs to taper off or decline. Given that the player base as a whole has increased steadily, and tournament attendance, including the Modern-friendly Grands Prix, PTQs, and Friday Night Magic has also increased, this seems possible, but not likely, especially given the encouragement for the format from Wizards of the Coast.\n\nThe following analysis will evaluate the amount of singles in circulation from 2003 to 2012, compare pre- and post-New World Order quantities, and determine what would need to happen in order to drive single prices down, with the understanding that Modern Masters intentionally will not achieve this goal.\n\nSupply: How much Magic is out there?\n\nWhile it is public knowledge that the Magic player base and the amount of money spent per player has increased dramatically, we haven't been told exactly how many players, how much they spend, how much product has been sold, or how much revenue Magic as a brand has earned.1 Consequently, this analysis is long on speculation and short on hard data. Caveat lector. Fortunately, there is a wide range for most of the variables that produce an outcome supporting this conclusion.\n\nAt the end of 2011, a Hasbro executive told investors that Magic had a player base of 12 million players, which represented an 80 percent increase from the player base in 2008. Extrapolating that from 2003 (when Eighth Edition, the start of Modern Masters reprints, was released) to 2012 gives us a curve like this:\n\nWe have next to no idea how many boosters the average player buys. For this model, let's assume that each player in 2008 bought 18 boosters a year on average.2 Additionally, the Hasbro executive revealed players had been spending 16 percent more over the same period, meaning players in 2012 bought an average of 21 packs. When multiplied by the player base for each year, the curve looks like this:\n\nIf the growth in the player base was extraordinary, the growth in booster sales is even more pronounced. Dividing the number of boosters sold by the rares printed in each year gives us an approximation of the number of copies of an average rare for that year.\n\nThis means there could be as many as 1.1 million Deathrite Shamans in circulation, currently worth $12 each, as opposed to a possible 268,000 Tarmogoyfs, currently priced at more than $100. That five-fold increase in supply is an enormous gap for a reprint to cover.\n\nWizards of the Coast used to publish full printing data for each set from Limited Edition through Ice Age. In 1996, Stephen D'Angelo at Crystal Keep recorded a breakdown of those sets. While it's challenging to compare these older sets directly because of the non-consistent rarities, it does give us another point of triangulation, and seems to be in line with the narrative of Magic's history. There is consistent growth from Limited Edition through the overprinting of Fallen Empires, steady numbers from Ice Age through the New World Order, and explosive growth post-New World Order. Based on this data, Forsythe also indicated the cards reprinted in Chronicles increased the supply of some rares by a factor of 10.\n\nWhile it is difficult to determine a number for any specific rare, saying there are twice as many copies of a current rare than a rare printed in 2007 doesn't seem outlandish. Looking at 2012, we can estimate",
      "Despite the numerous rumors that told us the next Nexus phone would be a big huge phablet, we were still taken aback when Google officially pulled the curtain off of the Nexus 6. It's a damn big phone. Its 6-inch display is even bigger than the recently launched Samsung Galaxy Note 4.\n\nWhat is Google thinking? Is this Google's way of jumping on the trend for ever-larger phones? Big phones are more popular than ever, but very few have 6-inch display. That's almost tablet territory! What's going on here?\n\nA niche you can't ignore\n\nIf you figured that Google thought to make a huge Nexus 6 to join in with the rest of the industry trends, you're not too far off. The mobile market is gearing itself to appeal to those with bigger hands, so to speak. \"Google and Motorola sized itself away from the general market toward a very specific segment of the market,\" said Ramon Llamas, Research Manager at IDC. But it's not just geared toward those with larger palms—consumers are really just clamoring for a better alternative to carrying around so many devices on their person. \"If you're that person who wants to have the all in one tablet and smartphone, this is for you too,\" added Llamas.\n\nGoogle The Nexus 6 might be too big for some hands, but many are interested in the utility of a phone that lets them leave their tablet at home.\n\nIt's also important that Google has a device in this category so that its developers will make applications that can scale to those bigger screen sizes. \"They consider this category important, so they just want to have this device be their version of what a phablet could be,\" said Daniel Matte, an analyst for Canalys. Google's goal isn't to sell a ton of units—the Nexus program never really was about selling lots of devices—it's about pushing the Android platform to work well with other types of niche technology, too.\n\nIt's also an opportunity for Google to brand itself and refute the idea that the phablet niche is something that only its partners can offer. \"If you don't supply those things, somebody else will,\" added Llamas.\n\nA ploy for more business users\n\nA bigger device may also help Google appeal to the more business-centric crowd, as Samsung's successfully done with its Galaxy Note series.\n\nGoogle's been shooting for the enterprise crowd for some time, and with Android Lollipop equipped with better security features and multi-user support, that bigger screen size will at least make it easier to multitask. \"They are pushing hard from an app perspective if you're looking at what they're doing with Google Drive and the cloud,\" said Carolina Milanesi, Chief of Research and Head of Kantar Worldpanel. \"But from an Android perspective we haven't yet noticed very much about the enterprise.\" Thus, this is Google's subtle way of telling developers: go ahead and make those killer business apps.\n\n$649 is the right price\n\nThe unlocked price for the Nexus 6 is pretty steep, and a far cry from the mid-range price points of the previous few Nexus devices. But it's par for the course in an industry dominated by high-end, high-priced devices. \"If you're taking a look at the iPhone 6 and some of the Samsung and LG devices, we're in the same kind of stratosphere,\" said Llamas. It's expected that the Nexus 6 would cost this much, because of its remarkable specifications, and at least it's available at all major US carriers so developers and consumers alike won't be doling out that much for it if they're due for an upgrade. \"If you dial it down and look at the opportunity here for subsidy, it could end up being $200 on a two-year contract.\"\n\nThe high price point will also ensure that Google doesn't unfairly compete with its manufacturing partners. \"They do have an exceptional burden of having been [cheaper],\" said Matte. \"They don't want to compete too directly. They want to find a segment, and to provide the experience for those segments without offending the OEMs.\"\n\nNexus is still for purists\n\nGoogle Pure, unadulterated Android.\n\nDespite the fact that Google is making the Nexus 6 more broadly available from carriers this time around, it's still a niche phone that's meant to satiate those who want the purest Android. \"I don't think Nexus is for everybody,\" said Ilamas. \"I don't think it's set up to be that way either.\" It is also vitally important that Google continues to court developers with a strong hardware ecosystem—phablets included.",
      "A new report on migrant crime reveals that for every 100 people who attempt to claim asylum in Austria an average of 55 criminal offences are committed, with some communities significantly more represented in statistics than others.\n\nThe Austrian agency of Federal statistics report shows that during the period of 2004 to 2014 almost every other migrant had committed some kind of criminal offence after coming to the country and seeking asylum.\n\nThe majority of the crimes were perpetrated by Algerians, who have been held as responsible for many of the high profile migrant crimes like the mass sexual assaults on New Year's Eve in Germany.\n\nAlgerians commit a staggering 155 crimes per 100 asylum seekers, with Georgians close behind at 151 per 100, and Nigerians at 129 per 100, reports Kronen Zeitung. Syrians are presently reasonably low on the list at only around 8 offence per 100 applicants, but the Federal statistics agency says that because the study only covers up to 2014 it doesn't account for the mass influx of Syrians experienced during 2015.\n\nThe report also notes 80 per cent of the criminals were young men.\n\nWhile the overall proportion of all crime in Austria committed by what the report identifies as \"asylum seekers\" was reasonably low — around five per cent — during the period of the study they only actually made up less than half a per cent of Austria's total population.\n\nThis significant over representation in the crime statistics for this group will continue to give concern to Austrian police.\n\nAssuming the statistics are correct, one in every two migrants have been suspected of committing crimes. The study did not include whether charges were pressed upon the criminals or whether they were simply released.\n\nCriminology experts have said the cause of the high numbers is because of a \"lack of prospects\" for young migrant men in Austria. Many say the men take high risks coming to Europe and often find themselves indebted to people smugglers who often have ties to organised crime.",
      "For a variety of reasons, I don't have kids. As a woman of a certain age, I've been conditioned to believe I must qualify that statement by assuring you it's not that I'm some kid hater, or that I don't think babies are cute. They are! (Okay, I also find them to be kind of disgusting.) But among my many reasons for not procreating is that kids grow up to be people, and life for most people on this overcrowded, overheated planet is hard, and getting harder.\n\nEven before Donald Trump took office, I had often wondered: with terrorism, war, and genocide, with climate change rendering Earth increasingly less habitable, how do people feel optimistic enough about the future to bring new people into the world? Since the presidential election, the prospects for humanity seem only more dire. I'm hardly alone in this thinking; I can't count how many times over the past year I've huddled among other non-breeders, wondering along with them in hushed tones, How on earth do people still want to have kids? I was surprised, at this bleak moment in American history, that I hadn't seen any recent writing on the topic. Was it still too taboo to discuss not making babies, from any angle? Then this past week a few pieces caught my eye.\n\nThe one that spoke most directly to my doubts about perpetuating the human race, and its suffering, was \"The Case for Not Being Born,\" by Joshua Rothman at The New Yorker. Rothman interviews anti-natalist philosopher David Benatar, author of 2006's Better Never to Have Been: the Harm of Coming Into Existence, and more recently, The Human Predicament: A Candid Guide to Life's Biggest Questions. Rothman notes that Benatar makes no bones about his pessimism as it relates to humanity.\n\nPeople, in short, say that life is good. Benatar believes that they are mistaken. \"The quality of human life is, contrary to what many people think, actually quite appalling,\" he writes, in \"The Human Predicament.\" He provides an escalating list of woes, designed to prove that even the lives of happy people are worse than they think. We're almost always hungry or thirsty, he writes; when we're not, we must go to the bathroom. We often experience \"thermal discomfort\"—we are too hot or too cold—or are tired and unable to nap. We suffer from itches, allergies, and colds, menstrual pains or hot flashes. Life is a procession of \"frustrations and irritations\"—waiting in traffic, standing in line, filling out forms. Forced to work, we often find our jobs exhausting; even \"those who enjoy their work may have professional aspirations that remain unfulfilled.\" Many lonely people remain single, while those who marry fight and divorce. \"People want to be, look, and feel younger, and yet they age relentlessly. They have high hopes for their children and these are often thwarted when, for example, the children prove to be a disappointment in some way or other. When those close to us suffer, we suffer at the sight of it. When they die, we are bereft.\"\n\nWhile this isn't how I always look at life, I believe Benatar makes some good points. (Not to mention I've endured three of the above mentioned hot flashes while writing this, and one's optimism does tend to dip in those estrogen-depleted moments.)\n\nRothman's piece reminded me of an essay we published here on Longreads a couple of years ago, \"The Answer is Never,\" by Sabine Heinlein. Like me, Heinlein often finds herself having to defend her preference for choosing to be childless: \"One of the many differences between my husband and me is that he has never been forced to justify why he doesn't want to have children. I, on the other hand, had to prepare my reasons from an early age.\" She keeps a laundry list of reasons handy:\n\nOver the years I tried out various, indisputable explanations: The world is bursting at the seams and there is little hope for the environment. According to the World Wildlife Fund, the Earth has lost half of its fauna in the last 40 years alone. The atmosphere is heating up due to greenhouse gases, and we are running out of resources at an alarming speed. Considering these facts, you don't need an excuse not to have children, you need an excuse to have children! When I mention these statistics to people, they just nod. It's as if their urge to procreate overrides their knowledge.\n\nIs there any knowledge forbidding enough that it could potentially override such a primordial urge? In a devastating essay at New York magazine, \"Every Parent Wants to Protect Their Child. I Never Got the Chance,\" Jen Gann attests that there is. Gann writes about raising a son who suffers from cystic fibrosis, an",
      "If this were a Fleet Street newspaper, instead of a highly respectable Canadian digital publication, the headline would be: Queen slaps down Elizabeth May.\n\nThe subhead might be: \"Politician looks ridiculous in appeal to monarch\"\n\nThe Green party leader (and only MP) wrote to the Queen in August, alerting her to \"a matter of grave importance to Canadians.\" Democracy, she related, was in peril.\n\n\"The mechanisms Canada had in place to ensure free and fair democratic elections appear to be failing. \"Many Canadians are concerned that our democracy is endangered, due to election infractions in our most recent elections, the lack of investigation of infractions, the de-funding of investigative bodies, and unprecedented prorogations of Canada's Parliament, which threaten to undermine the fundamental basis of democracy in Canada. I write to request that Your Majesty Commission a Royal Inquiry to investigate what may potentially be criminal activities which influenced Canada's last election, and that the aim of the Royal Inquiry be to restore Canada to a free and fair democracy.\"\n\nGood golly. Normally, the Queen would want to get right on this, but she's been a bit busy, and only got around to responding in March. Ms. May was good enough to post the reply for everyone to see. It's kind of odd that she would do that, giving how evidently low on the priority list she stands with Buckingham Palace.\n\n\"Dear Miss May, \"The Queen has taken careful note of the concerns you express,\" writes Miss Jennie Vine, deputy to the senior correspondence officer. \"Perhaps I might explain, however, that this is not a matter in which the Queen would intervene. As a constitutional Sovereign, her Majesty acts through her personal representative, the Governor-General, on the advice of her Canadian ministers, and it is to them that your appeal should be directed. \"I have therefore been instructed to forward your letter to the Governor-General of Canada so that he may be aware of your approach to the Queen and may consider the points you raise.\"\n\nIn other words, why are you wasting our time with trivial complaints about Canadian affairs? And you a party leader — Does the Canadian education system provide no training whatsoever in the nature and operation of Parliamentary government?\n\nIt was a bit odd when First Nations leaders, in their confrontation with the Conservative government, wrote to the Queen in search of intervention. Natives were here before the Brits (or French) and can make a case that disputes over agreements signed centuries ago should be referred to the sovereign power at the time. It wasn't going to work, but it was a cute reminder that Canada didn't just spring into existence when the Europeans arrived.\n\nBut the leader of a political party with aspirations to national prominence should have better things to do with her time than bothering some Royal bureaucrat over Canadian domestic issues, especially over some silly suggestion that democracy was about to collapse. Were they supposed to send gunboats?\n\nBritain doesn't run Canada any more, news as that may be to the Green party. The fact that an assistant correspondence officer would wait seven months before taking the time to point this out to Ms. May is probably a clearer response than the polite words contained in Miss Vine's letter.\n\nNational Post",
      "The first hints of the Super Bowl City began showing up in San Francisco Wednesday. It's a big celebration that will have a big impact on downtown San Francisco.The banners on downtown San Francisco streetlamps are just one clue that something big is coming. All around the waterfront, they're patching pavement, trimming trees and making the sidewalk sparkle.The big work will be done on Saturday. For now, truckloads of fences surround what will soon be the Super Bowl City. What's normally an open plaza will have only four ways in and out.\"There will be bag checks, and while this is a free and fun event, security is our primary concern,\" said Bijan Karimi of the San Francisco Department of Emergency Services.Starting this weekend, the MTA will close streets for two blocks around the event. And if you plan to attend, prepare to be screened by police.\"Similar to what happens when you go to the airport,\" Karimi said.The city wants residents to sign up for text message alerts.\"Notifications about road closures, event updates, and hopefully it doesn't happen, but emergency situations,\" said Brian Yim, a Nixle spokesman.Nixle is providing the service. People just need to text \"SB50\" to the number 888-777.\"Everyone has a cell phone in their pocket now so to receive a text message is the most instantaneous way of getting information out,\" Yim added.In spite of the months of planning by city agencies, there are still last minute glitches, many involving the businesses that are trying to stay open inside the secure perimeter.Like many small business owners, Lydia Chan still doesn't know how she'll get deliveries during Super Bowl week. \"I think it's going to be a madhouse here,\" Chan said. \"They're going to you know search people and it's going to take lots of time and everything is going to be delayed.\"The owner of Over the Moon cookie shop says he's been losing sleep over it. And two doors down they may be serving more Americanos than lattes. \"We're worried about milk, getting milk in,\" said Cole Bonner of the Paramo Coffee Company.For all the new customers, the big game could bring Paramo coffee could face problems if they can't get deliveries. \"We might end up having to shut down completely for the week,\" Bonner said.The city says the host committee is working with building owners and delivery services to iron things out.",
      "Abstract\n\nIn any society influenced by a plurality of cultures, there will be widespread, systematic differences about at least some important values, including moral values. Many of these differences look like deep disagreements, difficult to resolve objectively if that is possible at all. One common response to the suspicion that these disagreements are unsettleable has always been moral relativism. In the flurry of sympathetic treatments of this doctrine in the last two decades, attention has understandably focused on the simpler case in which one fairly self-contained and culturally homogeneous society confronts, at least in thought, the values of another; but most have taken relativism to have implications within a single pluralistic society as well. I am not among the sympathizers. That is partly because I am more optimistic than many about how many moral disagreements can be settled, but I shall say little about that here. For, even on the assumption that many disputes are unsettleable, I continue to find relativism a theoretically puzzling reaction to the problem of moral disagreement, and a troubling one in practice, especially when the practice involves regular interaction among those who disagree. This essay attempts to explain why",
      "Forecaster updated Friday, March 28 at 3:50 p.m.\n\nOn tap: Play ball!\n\nThe 2014 Major League Baseball season resumes on Sunday, March 30, as the Los Angeles Dodgers visit the San Diego Padres on Sunday Night Baseball. Unlike in the Australian opener, however, Clayton Kershaw won't make an appearance (due to a back injury). The No. 5 pick overall on average this preseason, Kershaw's status is entirely unknown for Week 1 of the fantasy season.\n\nHe's not the only fantasy ace on the shelf: The consensus No. 2 starting pitcher in the ranks, and No. 17 pick overall on average, Yu Darvish is known to be sidelined for the entirety of Week 1 due to a neck injury. Darvish's absence severely diminishes the quality of the Texas Rangers' bullpen; in his place the team will use two converted relievers (Tanner Scheppers and Robbie Ross), a starter with a 4.30 career ERA (Joe Saunders), another with a 6.23 spring ERA (Martin Perez) and a rookie who has only four professional starts above Class A ball (Nick Martinez).\n\nAll told, six members of the top 30 starting pitchers selected on average this preseason are either in jeopardy of being or have already been ruled out for Week 1: Mat Latos (No. 21 starter picked), Mike Minor (22), Doug Fister (26) and Hisashi Iwakuma (30) are all highly doubtful to pitch. That makes this season-opening week one of the more challenging ones from a pitching standpoint.\n\nQuick click by section, if you're seeking advice in a specific area:\n\nESPN lineup deadlines | Interleague impact | Projected starting pitchers\n\nPitching scuttlebutt | Week 1 pitcher rankings | Pitching advantages\n\nHitting ratings | Hitting advantages\n\nLineups in ESPN leagues with weekly transactions will remain locked through the conclusion of fantasy's Week 1, which ends with the San Francisco Giants at Los Angeles Dodgers game on Sunday Night Baseball on April 6. For those leagues that have not yet drafted, lineups will lock with the drafted starting lineups, those earning statistics from the two March 22 games in Australia retroactively. In other words, if you draft Matt Kemp as your starting outfielder in a Saturday, March 29, draft, he will remain in that spot through Sunday, April 6, even though he is on the disabled list to begin the season.\n\nESPN\n\nIn order to ensure that your lineup locks the way you want it mid-draft within the draft room, when selecting a player, use the \"Choose Slot\" option beneath the \"Draft Player\" button to place him into any empty slot, as illustrated to the right.\n\nESPN leagues with daily transactions will lock with the first pitch of each player's scheduled game each day. This means that Dodgers and Padres will lock at 8 p.m. ET on Sunday, for example. Be aware that in the season's opening week, there are more day games than usual. \"Opening Day\" -- Monday, March 31 -- has nine day games, the first one the Chicago Cubs at Pittsburgh Pirates at 1 p.m. ET. Tuesday is the only day all week in which there isn't a single day game (meaning a game with a 1:08 p.m. ET start time or earlier): The first game of that night is at 6:40 p.m. ET (Dodgers at Padres).\n\nThis week's interleague series:\n\n• Philadelphia Phillies at Texas Rangers (three games; Monday-Wednesday)\n\n• Milwaukee Brewers at Boston Red Sox (three games; Friday-Sunday)\n\nThankfully, fantasy owners won't have to suffer the effects of American League teams visiting National League parks and losing their designated hitter during Week 1; it's only NL squads visiting AL venues and gaining a DH. This means that both the Phillies and Brewers will pick up a DH and the resulting 12 (or so) plate appearances that come with it.\n\nWith news that Darin Ruf will miss 4-6 weeks with an oblique strain and that the Phillies released Bobby Abreu and Kevin Frandsen, the team's DH choices have been whittled down to effectively their extra outfielders, John Mayberry Jr. and Tony Gwynn Jr. (with either potentially playing the field and shifting a starter into the actual DH spot). Mayberry stands to benefit the most -- that the Rangers will start two left-handers helps his cause -- but even with the added plate appearances he'd be only a fringe starter in NL-only leagues.\n\nAs for the Brewers, the DH grants them an opportunity to play both of their first basemen, Lyle Overbay and Mark Reynolds, or both of their second basemen, Scooter Gennett and Rickie Weeks, or it could result in Ryan Braun shifting to DH to clear up the occasional outfield start for Logan Schafer. As with the Phillies",
      "Dark and Stormy. Moscow Mule. Two favorite warm weather cocktails that rely on ginger beer as one of the main ingredients. But wait: ginger beer doesn't actually have any beer in it. So then how does it differ from the beloved ginger ale?\n\nFirst thing's first: ginger beer was the very beginning. It originated in the 1800's in England and, at that time, did contain a small percentage of alcohol. Around 100 years later, the ginger ale we've come to know and love was developed and came to be known as Canada Dry. The difference? Ginger beer is actually brewed and fermented while ginger ale is essentially a carbonated beverage made from water and ginger. Ginger beer often has much more of a \"gingery\" flavor and because it's fermented, is less carbonated. My favorite brands are the unfiltered ginger beers like Seattle's fantastic Rachel's Ginger Beer - it is slightly cloudy and has an unprecedented ginger flavor. I've started to buy ginger beer at the store now instead of ginger ale because the latter often has so much more sugar and often isn't even made with real ginger.\n\nWhat's your preference? Are you ginger ale or ginger beer kinda gal/guy?\n\nRelated: Try This! Easy Homemade Ginger Ale",
      "Want to get a jump-start on upcoming deals? Meet the major Baltimore players at one of our upcoming events!\n\nThe Baltimore Public Markets Corp will rebid the renovation of the historic Broadway Market in the fall, after choosing not to extend its agreement with WorkShop Development, which expired in September. This is the latest wrinkle in the transformation of a Fells Point attraction that has had fits and starts over the years.\n\nA nonprofit that manages the city's six public markets, Baltimore Public Markets will issue a request for proposals by October, Robert Thomas says. WorkShop Development was charged with redeveloping the market more than two years ago, but progress was delayed due to anticipated construction on the Red Line. WorkShop's plan had been to renovate the north shed (pictured) to look similar to the renovated south market.\n\n\"We acknowledge it's a tough project to do,\" Robert says. \"If it wasn't tough to do, it would have been done already.\" The organization has reached out to community groups to ensure that the renovation serves a broad swath of Fells Point residents, Robert says.\n\nBaltimore Public Markets asked for a proposal from WorkShop Development to extend its agreement, but WorkShop partner Richard Manekin says the developer didn't submit one and will not bid on the project when it comes up in the fall. WorkShop is letting Klein Enterprises and The Dolben Co take the lead because of their vested interest in the area. The two companies are JV partners on the $41M residential and retail complex Marketplace at Fells Point (pictured), which flanks Broadway market.\n\nKlein Enterprises president Daniel Klein said the company was interested in joining WorkShop to accelerate the market redevelopment, but the Baltimore Public Markets agreement wasn't extended. He says the company would bid on the RFP if it makes sense economically and for the community.\n\n\"I don't think it's done anyone good to have a vacant shed,\" Daniel says. \"I think Fells Point deserves better than that.\"\n\nDave Holmes of South Broadway Properties renovated the south market (pictured) more than four years ago.

      "Law Professors: Three Centuries of Shaping American Law. By Stephen B. Presser. West Academic Publishing; 486 pages; $48.\n\nCONTROVERSY is raging over Donald Trump's decision to appoint Neil Gorsuch to the Supreme Court. Within hours, accusations were being made about the candidate's political affiliations, about whether he is in the legal mainstream and whether he could protect the \"enshrined rights of all Americans\".\n\nGet our daily newsletter Upgrade your inbox and get our Daily Dispatch and Editor's Picks.\n\n\nThe idea of \"rights\", \"mainstream\" and even the role of the Supreme Court in determining these are not as enshrined as advocates of various positions contend. They never have been. Many ideas abound about the role of the court within America's political system, the principles it should uphold and even the definition of a ubiquitous term, \"rule of law\". Some of these debates trace their roots back to the early 18th century, before America was even established.\n\nIf the fight has become more heated, it is because the authority of the judiciary in America, notably its ability \"to legislate\"—to expand the reach of law and find new, unstated (and possibly unintended) rights—has been a pivotal feature of politics since the 1950s. \"Law Professors: Three Centuries of Shaping American Law\", a well-timed book by Stephen Presser, a professor at Northwestern University, traces how this emerged.\n\nThe book is organised around the intellectual biographies of 29 individuals, including one Barack Obama, who spent 12 years as a senior lecturer at the University of Chicago before taking an eight-year tour as America's president. \"There is no country on Earth in which law professors have played a more prominent role,\" writes Mr Presser, a statement that neither lawyers nor politicians in any camp would dispute.\n\nThe natural audience for this book is academics, members of the bar and law students. For these last in particular, it may become essential reading. Law professors like putting their students through the hoops by asking them bewildering questions; Mr Presser's book does a good job of distilling what is actually being taught. Given the timing of the book, though, its greatest value may lie in the way it explains why potential candidates are so often described, by different interested parties, as being ignorant, bigots or temperamentally unsuited to the task at hand.\n\n\"Our two major political parties now understand the rule of law very differently,\" Mr Presser writes. Should it be based on precedent and written statutes (basically the Republican approach) or should it be discretionary and allowed to incorporate values and external information (the Democrats' view). Within this schism is a struggle over whether the judiciary's role is to enforce laws as they were written or to see law as a flexible instrument to achieve objectives, many of which are passionately supported—and passionately opposed.\n\nThat law professors became pivotal players in this drama was never inevitable. As in Britain, in America's earliest days legal training came through apprenticeships. This was augmented by a few intellectually ambitious outside authorities who found their way to universities. One of the earliest law professors, Joseph Story, simultaneously taught at Harvard, served as a justice on the Supreme Court, wrote treatises instructing judges and lawyers on the law and ran a bank (which may have been perceived at the time as an added benefit rather than a conflict of interest).\n\nIn his spare time, Story hosted Alexis de Tocqueville during his trip to America, and is thought to have been a key influence in de Tocqueville's assertion that lawyers served as America's aristocracy, and \"constitute a sort of privileged body in the scale of intellect\", who serve as \"the most powerful existing security against the excesses of democracy\". These lines are often repeated—less so a subsequent passage, noting that beyond their virtues, they, \"like most other men, are governed by their private interests, and especially by the interests of the moment\".\n\nThese three sentiments: that the study of the law is the preserve of lawyers, who are the intellectual elite; that they serve as a deterrent against the failures of democracy; and that they may be compromised, if not flawed, in their approach, are dominant themes throughout Mr Presser's book. In practice, Story was one of many prominent Americans who tried to distil law from cases that were largely but not exclusively British, reflecting differences such as lack of a monarchy. Although this was a formidable task, it was limited to determining what were, in fact, the rules of law.\n\nThe pedagogical approach was formalised in the late 19th century by Christopher Columbus Langdell, a dean of Harvard Law School, who developed what became the practice of deciphering a vast number of appellate decisions to understand what were perceived to be scientific principles and logic. But even as this approach to legal training became common, intellectually the fact that the law could be discerned through",
      "A truck disappears into the horizon in northeastern Montana along the now defunct Pinetree radar line. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\n\nA radar facility mid-demolition on the Canadian border in northwestern North Dakota. The radar site was once a regional hub of the Pinetree Line, the southernmost line of early warning radar stations charged with watching for a Soviet air attack coming over the north pole. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\nAt the height of the Cold War, Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev boasted that the Soviets were manufacturing nuclear missiles \"like sausages.\" His bravado underscored early strategic posturing that turned on the assumption that more was better.\n\nThe Kennedy administration responded in kind, referring to the perceived shortage of American nukes as a runner would imagine trying to pass the leader of a race. As the analogy goes, the United States needed to put down more footsteps, faster. President John F. Kennedy sought to bridge what was referred to as the \"missile gap\" by stepping up production, funding concurrent missile programs, thereby kicking the arms race into full gear. Reflecting later on Kennedy's assertion that the United States had finally exceeded Russian missile production by twofold, Khrushchev dryly responded: \"We're satisfied to be able to finish off the United States first time round. Once is quite enough. What good does it do to annihilate a country twice? We're not a bloodthirsty people.\"\n\nBloodthirsty or not, the scale of Cold War brinkmanship quickly reached peak absurdity. By the mid '80s, the two superpowers possessed a combined sum of more than 70,000 nuclear warheads, a number sufficient to put 357 warheads, each with yields far exceeding that of the Hiroshima bomb, onto every capital city of every country on the entire globe. New missile systems came online every few years, phasing out old technologies almost as fast as they could be created. In the case of the sites for the Titan I missiles, one of the first ICBMs, some launch facilities were decommissioned mere months after being opened.\n\n\nKhrushchyovka apartments in the abandoned secret Soviet city of Skrunda-1 at twilight. Skrunda-1 served as the home for thousands of soldiers who worked on the Soviets' outward-facing radar, charged with watching for incoming U.S. missiles. It was operational for 35 years. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\n\nOne of the two launch console desks used to control the firing of a Titan I nuclear missile sits in a long-abandoned site on the Colorado plains. Four stories of soil cover the engineered concrete above the location of this picture. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\n\nStones plucked and set in place barely cover the entrance portal to an abandoned Soviet missile silo outside of Jelgava, Latvia. During its operation, the underground complex contained four intermediate-range nuclear missiles poised to launch against European targets. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\n\nThree stories below ground in an abandoned Soviet missile silo outside of Jelgava, Latvia. Handprints above each door mark the location where previous explorers teetered to hold their balance on the concrete beam rising above the water that seeped in and filled the low spots of the silo complex. The floor and pipes were removed long ago by salvagers, leaving only the concrete skeleton. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\n\nAn irrigation canal cuts a claw mark in the loamy soil of a tree farm that now runs through the perimeter of a destroyed Soviet nuclear missile silo complex in Latvia. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\n\nA bunker sits in the wreckage of a military support town in Jelgava, Latvia. Many Soviet sites were serviced by small military installations that were attached to the missile and radar positions. (Matt Slaby/Luceo)\n\nThis rapid-fire upgrade in technologies combined with both nations' relentless manufacture of missiles left a quiet mark across the remote parts of each country. Early-generation nuclear missile silos were left to rust and quietly collapse, marking the map like a secret Braille. To the uninitiated, defunct Cold War sites give little outward indication of their former purpose. Many of these facilities were designed to be obscure, showing only a small surface footprint that barely hinted at the extent of what was hidden just below the earth's surface. Aside from former missileers and a small, passionate network of urban explorers, these long-ago vacated sites remain largely unknown, scattered across the globe in varying states of decay.\n\nIn recent years, I have become one of these enthusiasts. My fascination with the implements of the Cold War is far from technical. The mechanics of their destructive potential is wasted on me. Instead, I see these things as part of a global semiotics, a secret language in which we collectively and unconsciously speak to one another. These places, defunct",
      "Question:\n\nI have attention deficit disorder (ADD), for which I take Adderall. I work in the office of a large trucking company, doing payroll and scheduling. The company has always had a drug testing program for truck drivers. Last week, the owner announced that they were planning to extend the program to all company employees. We all received a written notice about the testing procedures, and we will all be drug tested in 30 days. I know that Adderall shows up as an amphetamine on drug screens, and I'm worried that I might get fired for taking it. What are my rights?\n\nAnswer:\n\nYour rights in this situation depend on your state's drug testing laws and the federal Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). But the bottom line is that you will likely be protected from discipline or termination based on a positive drug test.\n\nThere are a few types of private employers that are required to drug test. Among them are certain transportation industries subject to the control of the federal Department of Transportation. These employers must test at least some of their employees to ensure public safety. However, this requirement generally extends only to those employees who could do significant damage if working while impaired, that is, the drivers themselves.\n\nAssuming your employer is not required to test its non-driving employees for drugs, it could still be allowed to do so by state law. Virtually every state allows employers to test applicants for drug use at the time of hire. The rules for current employees, however, are more varied and more restrictive. For example, some states don't allow random drug testing, while other states allow random drug testing, but impose strict protocols governing when and how employees may be tested. To find out what your state allows and requires, select it from the list at State Laws on Drug Testing.\n\nEven if your employer has the legal right to test, that doesn't mean it can fire or discipline you for a positive result. The ADA protects qualified employees with disabilities: those who can perform the essential functions of their jobs, with or without reasonable accommodation. If you are taking a legally prescribed drug for a disability, as it sounds like you are, then your employer may not penalize you based on that fact alone. If the drug impaired your ability to perform your job safely, the situation would be different. However, because you work in payroll, it seems highly unlikely that taking Adderall would affect your ability to safely perform your job. And, as long as you are able to perform the essential functions of your job with or without accommodation, you are protected from discrimination based on your disability.\n\nTypically, employees have an opportunity during the drug testing process to sit down with a medical officer and talk about their prescription drug use. This might happen before you are tested, after you are tested, or both. At the earliest opportunity, explain that you are taking Adderall, which was prescribed by your doctor for your ADD. You might want to have a copy of your prescription on hand as well.",

      "ADATA Premier Pro SP900 256GB SSD\n\nHere we get our first look at the new ADATA Premier Pro SP900 256GB drive. On the front we see the capacity size and the model name.\n\nOn the back is where you will find the model number, ASP900S3-256GM, the warranty code and SKU. Your Acronis True Image key is also listed on the back of the drive, a feature we like since you will be able to find the code easily when you need it.\n\nAll of the mounting points are located where they should be on both the bottom and side of the drive. This will make it easy to install the SP900 in your notebook or desktop with the included adapter bracket.\n\nThe included adapter bracket offsets the drive to the side so the offset SATA data and power connectors will line up with your existing drives and backplane if you have one.\n\nWe are finally to the flash, the area that has kept me up for the last couple of days. There are sixteen chips, eight on each side. They are labeled as 29F16B08CCME3. We've seen this flash before on several SSDs like the Vertex 4 and other known synchronous flash drives.\n\nThe last number at the end of the string indicates the generation. 1 was used on synchronous flash. Drives like the ADATA S511 used Intel flash that ended in 1. 2 is the second generation and it was found on several asynchronous flash drives like the ADATA S510. Now we have the third generation and from what we've gathered it is \"bironous\". We just made that word up, but it looks like it can be installed as either synchronous or asynchronous.\n\nLooking at the PCB, both the ADATA SX900 (advertised at synchronous) and the SP900 (advertised as asynchronous) use the same PCB. There is one surface mount component change on this side of the drive and that is in position R70 or resistor 70. The SP900 256GB that we are looking at today does not have a resister in the R70 position, but the SX900 256GB has a surface mount resister in that position.\n\nThere is not going to be a pencil mod trick to turn your SP900 into a SX900 though. On this side I counted at least eight changes to the surface mount components. Also note that I didn't measure the values of the surface mount components. All of the surface mount component changes are at the top, middle of the PCB, just to the right of the upper most flash. The SP900 has a resister at R135, a piece not found on the SX900, but nothing at C23, C24, C22, R25, R25 and R28. Two other components are missing at L5 and U5.\n\nThat still leaves the flash issue. If third generation IMFT flash can run as either synch or async, why would anyone choose to make a drive in an async configuration? This is an area we'll have to research in the coming weeks.\n\nShopping Information PRICING: You can find products similar to this one for sale below.\n\nUnited States: Find other tech and computer products like this over at Amazon's website.

      "So a few months back disaster struck, I managed to break my 50mm 1.4 lens! Focus completely jammed - couldn't even manually focus. gutted. I took the lens to my local camera shop and they said they would have to send it off to Canon and it could cost up to £180! Ouch. Having just forked out for xmas, car insurance and about a gazillion other things that wasn't a particularly inviting proposition. So in some what of a bold move I decided to take matters into my own hands. After a quick web search it became clear that this fault is actually quite a common problem with this particular lens and is caused by an arguably dubious design choice on Canons part. Disclaimer What follows is a guide to what I did to fix the problem, I am not a professional repairs person and I am not for one minute saying this is the best way to fix your lens, but it worked for me. This is a delicate procedure that could easily go wrong and if you try this yourself you do it entirely at your own risk. If you are in any doubt, send it to a professional. Tools To dismantle the lens you'll need PH0 & PH00 precision screw drivers, also useful will be a scalpel, fine tipped tweezers, lens cloth, some sort of tray to put bits in & a pen and paper.  In order to fix the actual problem you want a good quality digital calliper and a hammer. Yes that's right you'll be hitting you beloved lens with a hammer. There are other ways to do this and I'm sure there are much more professional, efficient and expensive tools for the job. This is simply how I chose to attack the problem (literally!)\nTweet Feeling reckless? Good, then we shall continue. Clear a large brightly lit area, lay out your tools and place the lens in question on your lens cloth. As you are working I would highly recommend keeping all the various parts and screws labelled and possibly in separate containers.  Read this guide through at least once before you begin and make sure you have all the tools needed to hand. Step 1 Remove the 3 screws around the top of the lens. you can now gently remove the front casing and focus ring by sliding them off the end of the lens. Notice that there is also a small clear plastic ring just underneath the front casing. remove all these parts and put them to one side.\nStep 2 Turn the lens upside down and remove the 4 screws marked in red. The silver lens mount is also attached to the body with some tacky resin, take your scalpel and very gently prise the lens mount loose. I say gently because the small part with the gold contact plates is attached to the base plate and the lens body by a contact band, if you damage this connection you will most likely ruin your lens entirely. At best it will no longer be able to communicate with the camera.\nStep 3\nThis is one of the trickiest parts to the procedure. Lift the lens mount on the opposite side to the gold contacts and you will see that the black plastic inner ring is attached to the metal mount with 4 plastic 'hooks'. What you need to do is gently but firmly prise these off the metal mount with a small flat head screw driver. This is particularly difficult because you'll need to use some force but be very careful not to (a) snap the hooks off & (b) damage the contact band attached to both lens and mount.\nIf you can prise 2 of these hooks open the inner plastic part should come free.\nStep 4\nNext remove the two screws marked in red, but not the one marked in yellow. You can now remove the metal mount plate.\nStep 5\nOk, now we're gonna remove the little panel that holds the AF/MF switch. This is secured in place with a little blob of glue so start by cutting through this with the scalpel. Once done carefully slide the panel up and out. I say carefully because there is a very small switch behind the panel that could be easily damaged (see pics) What you'll want to do is push the panel up a touch and then tilt the bottom of the panel out a touch so that it can clear this switch. Once that's done you can slide off the last bit of outer casing (the bit that says '50mm' on)\nStep 6\nNow we need to detach the contact band pictured below. Take your tweezers or scalpel and slide the little white braces out in the direction indicated. They should slide out quite easily by about 1-2mm, once done the contact band can easily be removed from the socket.\nStep 7\nRemove screw and contact plate indicated below\nStep 8 Remove the white plastic runner guides, there are 3 and they will all need to come out.\nStep 9  That contact band that we detached in step 6 is also attached to the body with a blob of resin glue, at this point you need to very carefully prise this free.",
      "MINNEAPOLIS -- Brett Favre talked his way back into the starting lineup, hoping a snowy Monday night game would be just the setting he needed.\n\nThe 41-year-old got the hometown crowd roaring when he led the Minnesota Vikings to a touchdown on the opening drive, and all the ingredients were there for one last memorable Monday with Favre.\n\n\"I knew it was the last home game,\" Favre said afterward. \"This also may seem kind of crazy, but I was looking forward to playing in a blizzard.\"\n\nInstead, his surprising return ended all too quickly. Bears defensive end Corey Wootton slammed the quarterback to the frigid turf in the second quarter. Favre watched the rest of a 40-14 loss from the bench, his night, and perhaps his career, ended by what he later called a concussion.\n\n\"I don't know with this concussion, based on my decision-making, I probably shouldn't tell you one way or the other right now,\" Favre was quoted as saying in the Minneapolis Star-Tribune. \"I don't regret it. I wish it would have turned out differently.\"\n\nFavre shrugged off a sprained right shoulder to start the game on Monday night, receiving a thunderous ovation from the crowd when he was introduced. Favre said he wanted to play one more time in front of the Vikings fans who have come to embrace him in his two seasons in purple.\n\n\"It made a lot of sense that, if this were the last game, to play it here in front of our fans,\" Favre said.\n\nHe went 2 for 2 on the opening drive, throwing a 23-yard touchdown pass to Percy Harvin to give the Vikings a 7-0 lead. Favre leaped on to guard Ryan Cook's back in the end zone to celebrate, but the fun ended quickly in the second quarter.",

      "He even sent texts to other staffers discussing this. He repeatedly sent texts reminding me of it. I had trouble sleeping, wondering what I'd wake up to every day. It never stopped.\n\nAfter about a month after I was hired at DKPS, sometime at the end of October, Dejan Kovacevic became convinced that I didn't \"know hockey.\" He told me so at a game after he promoted someone else as lead of the Penguins beat and sent out a group text, which I asked him about. He then proceeded to say I didn't know hockey and just parroted what others said so I'd fit in with other media members. It was deeply offensive.\n\nI've struggled with whether to share what happened at DKPS because I felt it might not be in my best interest professionally. But people should know the truth.\n\nNot long after, there was a meeting with Dejan, his wife and another staff member. It was bizarre. It felt like an ambush. My work was trashed — work that had been previously praised. Dejan was also upset I talked to people on twitter and had friends on the road. He continued to tell me I didn't know hockey and that I'd misled him and his wife in my interview. He said I'd tricked everyone I know to this point that I knew the sport. It seemed like he wanted me to say I knew nothing and that I was a liar. To what end, I don't know. But I wasn't going to cop to something that wasn't true. Apparently there was a \"cool kids club\" on twitter that I just wanted to fit into. It was the most insulting and infuriating thing anyone has ever told me professionally. I was in tears at one point.\n\nDejan said they couldn't \"let\" me do video or podcasts. I'd done the podcast twice, video once (after a staff dinner!). He would tell commenters this too. It made me feel terrible. He told them more than he'd tell me about it.\n\nIn between all of this, Dejan hired another writer he told us would be general assignment, but announced him as joining the Penguins beat. I was told nothing about my current duties would change, but I knew that wasn't going to be true for long.\n\nAfter that I covered one more game for DKPS and the Penguins' Thanksgiving practice. Malkin missed a game and wouldn't be going to Boston the day after. Not a surprise. That day I had to run home right after to get the turkey out and it was a little while before I could sit down to write. Understandable, right? Nope. The following night I received multiple angry texts from Dejan saying he would cover Saturday's game alone. It escalated to him saying he wanted to take me off salary and pay me per piece. This was around 3am. I called my dad, sobbing, frustrated. I couldn't afford not to make a salary. I'd just recently bought a car for the 45 minute drive to Pittsburgh for games.\n\nThe next day, I needed to get Chris Kunitz for a feature I was working on so I decided to go to the game anyway. Dejan finally came over to speak with me. He said I didn't care about news and thus couldn't be trusted with daily coverage, which didn't make any sense considering I'd handled almost every news story since I was hired. He promised I'd make just as much getting paid per piece as I would on salary — basically, it would be my fault if I didn't work hard enough. I knew this was happening because he wanted to move the new guy in and push me off everything. He was trying to get me to quit. I told him there was nothing left to discuss unless it was about continuing with my current duties.\n\nLater that night, Dejan texted to inform me that I was no longer with the company. I wasn't shocked. Though he had ample opportunity to tell me in person, he claimed he didn't because I was \"behaving erratically.\"\n\nAfter this, Dejan felt it necessary to write in his column that the whole staff agreed with his decision to fire me. I know definitively that is false.\n\nYou might ask why I ended up working for him. Everyone warned me. The truth is I really needed a job. I talked to people who'd worked for Dejan and figured he might be difficult but not that bad. I was so wrong. Others who quit or were fired told me they were treated badly but the way I was treated was so much worse. I've gone through it all so many times but I still don't know why. I just know the majority of male staffers were never treated this way.\n\nAll the red flags were there from the beginning.\n\nHe told coworkers that he needed to edit all my stories first because he was worried I'd misspell players' names since I was new.\n\nHe once told me not to bring",

      "Virtual reality (VR) offers an appealing experimental framework for studying visual performances of insects under highly controlled conditions. In the case of the honeybee Apis mellifera, this possibility may fill the gap between behavioural analyses in free-flight and cellular analyses in the laboratory. Using automated, computer-controlled systems, it is possible to generate virtual stimuli or even entire environments that can be modified to test hypotheses on bee visual behaviour. The bee itself can remain tethered in place, making it possible to record neural activity while the bees is performing behavioural tasks. Recent studies have examined visual navigation and attentional processes in VR on flying or walking tethered bees, but experimental paradigms for examining visual learning and memory are only just emerging. Behavioural performances of bees under current experimental conditions are often lower in VR than in natural environments, but further improvements on current experimental protocols seem possible. Here we discuss current developments and conclude that it is essential to tailor the specifications of the VR simulation to the visual processing of honeybees to improve the success of this research endeavour.",
      "It hardly took another study for people to know that political polarization in this country is deeply embedded. Still, a report issued Monday by the Pew Research Center paints a particularly stark portrait of a nation in which the most significant divisions are no longer based on race, class or sex but on political identity.\n\nFor 25 years, Pew has been conducting regular surveys assessing American values. They provide a series of historical benchmarks by which to examine the changes in what binds people and what divides them. The latest report finds considerable continuity over that quarter-century in the way different groups view society — and one very large change.\n\n\"Overall, there has been much more stability than change across the 48 political values measures that the Pew Research Center has tracked since 1987,\" the report states. \"But the average partisan gap has nearly doubled over this 25-year period — from 10 percent in 1987 to 18 percent in the new study.\"\n\nRepublicans and Democrats have long seen the world through different lenses. On some issues, the gaps between them are relatively small (the importance of political engagement, for example). On others they are wider. What Pew found is that in almost every measure, those gaps have increased over the past 25 years, and in some cases now seem to represent almost unbridgeable divisions.\n\nThe Pew report found that the changes began to accelerate during George W. Bush's presidency. Barack Obama's presidency, the report says, has received \"the most extreme partisan reaction to government in the past 25 years. Republicans are far more negative toward government than at any previous point, while Democrats feel far more positive.\"\n\nDemocrats and Republicans more divided than ever on values. (The Washington Post/Pew Research Center)\n\nAndrew Kohut, who directed the study, said two things are notable. One is that, \"by and large, values haven't changed. The other is that political identity has eclipsed these other factors\" such as race and class as the biggest sources of division. \"The only thing that's changed is the extent to which Republicans and Democrats go to opposite sides of the room on most issues.\"\n\nSome of the most significant differences — and the areas where the divisions have increased the most — were on core issues of the 2012 campaign: the role and scope of government and the social safety net.\n\nTwenty-five years ago, the gap between Republicans and Democrats on how they assessed the scope and performance of government was six percentage points. Today it is 33 points. On support for the social safety net, what once was a 21-point gap is now 41 points. On environmental issues, the gap has ballooned from five points to 39 points.\n\nOn some of these issues, the biggest changes in attitudes have been among Republicans. Twenty-five years ago, 62 percent of Republicans and 79 percent of Democrats said the government should take care of people who can't take care of themselves. Today, 75 percent of Democrats agree with that statement, but the percentage of Republicans who agree has plummeted to 40 percent.\n\nThe shift on environmental issues among Republicans has been even greater. In 1987, 93 percent of Democrats and 86 percent of Republicans said there should be stricter laws and regulations to protect the environment. In the latest survey, Democratic support is unchanged, but among Republicans it has plunged to 47 percent.\n\nBut Republicans aren't the only ones responsible for the partisan polarization. In other areas, changes in attitudes among Democrats have widened the gap between the parties.\n\nAlthough majorities of Democrats and Republicans express strong faith in religion, Democrats are less likely to say that today than in 1987. What once was a three-point gap between Republicans and Democrats on doubting the existence of God is now 15 points. The report found that among liberals, the shift away from religious values has been particularly pronounced.\n\nDemocrats are more supportive of immigration rights than they once were, while Republican support has declined somewhat. The percentage of Democrats who say government should do more to ensure equal opportunity for blacks and other minorities has risen, more so than the decline among Republicans.\n\nThe most profound change may be on the issue that has roiled American politics since early in Obama's administration: the role of government.\n\n\"Since 2007, Republicans increasingly feel that regulation does more harm than good, while Democrats increasingly disagree,\" the report states. \"Republicans see more waste and inefficiency, Democrats see less. And the share of Republicans who say the government is too involved in our daily lives has grown, while the number of Democrats who say this has decreased.\"\n\nAmericans long have been divided along partisan as well as demographic lines. The report states that 25 years ago, the cleavages between Republicans and Democrats were \"on a par with the differences of opinion between blacks and whites, wealthy and poor or college grads and those without a college degree. This is no longer the case. Since 1987 — and particularly over the past decade — the country has experienced a stark increase in partisan polarization.\"\n\nPart of this is related to the growing homogenization of",
      "Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: Blue Rescue Team (Nintendo DS)\n\nAs Creatures, Game Freak, and Nintendo work to bring us the true evolution of the Pokemon RPG franchise, Nintendo from time to time commissions other developers to create spin-off Pokemon experiences to keep the series chugging along. Some, like Pokemon Pinball and Pokemon Colosseum, are successful. Some, such as Pokemon Dash...not so much. The latest spin-off could end up becoming the Pokemon creatures' final bow on the Game Boy Advance: Pokemon Mystery Dungeon. Most Pokemon spin-offs stray as far away from the expected RPG adventure of the key game in the franchise, but Pokemon Mystery Dungeon is the exception to the rule: it's not the RPG, but it's still of that genre. It's a much different take on the theme, too, but with its repetitive and slightly clunky design Pokemon Mystery Dungeon just can't quite match the true RPG's standards. It's not all that bad, though, just prepare for a lot of the same ol' stuff very early on in the quest. ChunSoft's game is actually a \"next generation\" of its Fushigi no Dungeon series, an old-school dungeon exploration design that prides itself on one aspect: randomly generated levels. Every time you head down into a dungeon it's never the same map, just the same structure -- if something's going to happen on Level 8, for example, it will always happen the trek down or up will be noticeably different in its pathways because of the game's dungeon generator. Pokemon Mystery Dungeon revolves around your character who has, mysteriously, turned into a Pokemon, and uncovering the reasons for this confusing transformation. But while you figure out what the heck's going on, why not put those paws, claws, and or tails to use and join a \"rescue team?\" That's the driving force of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon: taking jobs, rescuing friends lost along the way, and trying to be the best gosh darn Pokemon Rescue Team out there. Though this isn't the first time you're playing as a Pokemon (you can probably chalk up that little bullet-point to Super Smash Bros.), it is the first time these guys are driving a storyline without pesky humans getting in the way. And because you're now experiencing the Pokemon world as one, you can now understand what the heck they're saying other than the indecipherable \"Pika!\" and \"Char!\" Between the scattered plot points, you simply head to the different areas and explore the dungeons, grabbing gold and ability-increasing food while trying to find the staircase to the next part of the dungeon. Oh, and fighting mean ol' Pokemon creatures along the way through turn-based battles. This is the nuts and bolts of the entire game, and while it's fun for a bit, it drags on with very little variety. Players can add a bit to the experience by customizing attacks, linking moves together, adding team members and adjusting their AI routines. There are more than a dozen Pokemon creatures to play as (determined by a random set of questions answered at the start of the game), but other than the appearance of that critter and his available moves set, it doesn't matter which character you end up playing. It's all pretty much the same. Apart from the repetitive gameplay, I think the biggest knock against the game is in its dual-SKU system. It's a nice feature to give players the choice to pick either a Nintendo DS or Game Boy Advance version of Pokemon Mystery Dungeon, but it's pretty darn obvious that the game's potential is limited to the Game Boy Advance standards.

      "(First published at the Future of Freedom Foundation site.)\n\nThey hang the man, and flog the woman,\n\nThat steals the goose from off the common;\n\nBut let the greater villain loose,\n\nThat steals the common from the goose.\n\nAnonymous, in The Tickler Magazine, February 1, 1821.\n\nAn understanding of the Enclosure Acts is necessary to place aspects of the Industrial Revolution in proper context. The Industrial Revolution is often accused of driving poor laborers en masse out of the countryside and into urban factories where they competed for a pittance in wages and lived in execrable circumstances.\n\nBut the opportunity that a factory job represented could only have drawn workers if it offered a better situation than what they were leaving. If laborers were driven to the cities, then some other factor(s) must have been at work.\n\nOne factor was the Enclosure Acts. These were a series of Parliamentary Acts, the majority of which were passed between 1750 and 1860; through the Acts, open fields and 'wastes' were closed to use by the peasantry. Open fields were large agricultural areas to which a village population had certain rights of access and which they tended to divide into narrow strips for cultivation. The wastes were unproductive areas – for example, fens, marches, rocky land, or moors – to which the peasantry had traditional and collective rights of access in order to pasture animals, fish, harvest meadow grass, collect firewood or otherwise benefit. Rural laborers who lived on the margin depended on open fields and the wastes to fend off starvation.\n\nEnclosure refers to the consolidation of land, usually for the stated purpose of making it more productive. The British Enclosure Acts removed the prior rights of local people to rural land they had often used for generations. As compensation, the displaced people were commonly offered alternative land of smaller scope and inferior quality,sometimes with no access to water or wood. The land seized by the Acts were then consolidated into individual and privately-owned farms, with larger and politically connected farmers receiving the best land. Often small land-owners could not afford the legal and other associated costs of enclosure and, so, were forced out.\n\nIn his pivotal essay \"English Enclosures and Soviet Collectivization: Two Instances of an Anti-Peasant Mode of Development\", libertarian historian Joseph R. Stromberg observed,\n\n\"[T]he political dominance of large landowners determined the course of enclosure….[i]t was their power in Parliament and as local Justices of the Peace that enabled them to redistribute the land in their own favor. A typical round of enclosure began when several, or even a single, prominent landholder initiated it….by petition to Parliament….[T]he commissioners were invariably of the same class and outlook as the major landholders who had petitioned in the first place, it was not surprising that the great landholders awarded themselves the best land and the most of it, thereby making England a classic land of great, well-kept estates with a small marginal peasantry and a large class of rural wage labourers.\"\n\nIn turn, this led to new practices of agriculture, such as crop rotation, and resulted in a dramatic increase in productivity over time. (Of course, this may have happened naturally, with common users co-operating for greater productivity.) Whatever the long term effect, the immediate one was to advantage those fortunate enough to become individual owners and disadvantage peasants. The immediate effect was to devastate the peasant class.\n\nWhen access was systematically denied, ultimately the peasantry was left with three basic alternatives: to work in a serf-like manner as tenant farmers for large landowners; to emigrate to the New World; or, ultimately, to pour into already crowded cities where they pushed down each others' wages by competing for a limited number of jobs.\n\nHISTORY OF THE ENCLOSURE ACTS\n\nThe British enclosure question is extremely complex, varying from region to region and extending over centuries. Enclosure reaches back to the 12th century but peaks from approximately 1750 to 1860, a time period that coincides with the emergence and rise of the Industrial Revolution. British economic historian Sudha Shenoy stated, \"Between 1730 & 1839, 4,041 enclosure Bills passed, 581 faced counter-petitions, & 872 others also failed.\" How far-reaching were those thousands of Acts? According a 1993 study by J. M. Neeson, Commoners: Common Right, Enclosure and Social Change in England, 1700-1820, winner of the 1994 Whitfield Prize of the Royal Historical Society, enclosures occurring 1750 and 1820 dispossessed former occupiers from some 30 percent of the agricultural land of England.\n\nPerhaps the most significant measure was the General Enclosure Act of 1801 (also called the Enclosure Consolidation Act) because it simplified and standardized the legal procedures of ensuing Acts.\n\nHistorians J.

      "1521 Spanish report claims a colony of Irish people lived in South Carolina before Christopher Columbus' ships landed\n\nWhile Christopher Columbus is generally credited with having \"discovered\" America in 1492, a 1521 Spanish report provides inklings of evidence that there were, in fact, Irish people settled in America prior to Columbus' journey.\n\n\"Researchers feel certain that there was a colony of Irish folk living in what is now South Carolina when Christopher Columbus 'thought' he had discovered the New World,\" writes Richard Thornton for The Examiner.\n\nIn 1520, Peter Martyr d'Anghiera, a historian, and a professor was appointed by Charles V, ruler of the Holy Roman Empire from 1519, to be chronicler for the new Council of the Indies.\n\nThough Martyr died in 1526, his report, founded on several weeks of interviews, was published posthumously in a book named \"De Orbe Novo\" (About the New World). The book has been published and translated numerous times in the centuries since then. The passages concerning the land that would become Georgia and the Carolinas were always included, but generally ignored, says Thornton.\n\nThe colony of the Duhares\n\nWhile interviewing Spanish colonists, Martyr took note of their vicious treatment of Chicora Indians. However, he also included in his report that the Spanish colonists had a very good relationship with another nearby colony, which Martyr reported to be named Duhare.\n\nPhysically, the people of Duhare appeared to be European according to the Spanish colonists in the area. The people of Duhare had red to brown hair, tan skin and gray eyes, and were noticeably taller than the Spanish. According to Spanish accounts, the people of Duhare were Caucasian, though their houses and pottery were similar to those of American Indians.\n\n3\n\nRead more: The forgotten voyager - the story of an Irishman who discovered America and inspired Columbus' voyages\n\nThe giant King Datha\n\nThe king of Duhare was said to be named Datha and was described by the Spanish as being a giant, even when compared to his peers. He had five children and a wife as tall as him. Datha had brightly colored paint or tattoos on his skin that seemed to distinguish him from the commoners.\n\nDespite Martyr's report that included the apparently unique tribe of the Duhare, the believed predecessors of the Creek Indian tribe, more recent scholars are wary of the possibility of a Caucasian tribe at that time in America.\n\n\"In 1922 the Smithsonian Institute published, 'Early History of the Creek Indians and Their Neighbors' by the renowned ethnologist, John W. Swanton. It included much of Martyr's passages on Duhare, but was prefaced with contemptuous remarks by Swanton that the story couldn't be true and that the Duhare were probably a Siouan tribe,\" explains Thornton.\n\nTranslating the mysterious Duhares\n\nHowever, later in 2006, People of One Fire, a nationwide team of Native American scholars, primarily of Creek Indian heritage, began a comprehensive research program to obtain more accurate and detailed knowledge of North America's pre-European history.\n\nAs part of their research, they began to attempt to translate every single Native American word that was translated by the Spanish. While many of those words were easily translated by modern Creek, Alabama, Koasati or Choctaw dictionaries, the words associated with the province of Duhare defied translation until 2011.\n\nIrish lullaby in South Carolina\n\nResearchers began to investigate the similarity of Irish rock carvings to those in the state of South Carolina. One member of the People of One Fire team came across an ancient Irish lullaby entitled \"Bainne nam fiadh\" - \"On milk of deer I was reared. On milk of deer I was nurtured. On milk of deer beneath the ridge of storms on crest of hill and mountain.\"\n\nThe lullaby has particular significance as the deer were a prominent resource for Duhare people. According to Spanish sources, the Duhare maintained large herds of domesticated deer and made cheese from deer milk.

      "CLOSE Everything you need to know about Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, or IPERS. Wochit\n\nBuy Photo The Iowa Capitol in Des Moines (Photo: William Petroski/Des Moines Register)Buy Photo\n\nIowa's largest public employees' pension fund confirmed Wednesday that hundreds of thousands of dollars in pension payments have been stolen from retirees' accounts and that state and federal law enforcement agencies have been asked to investigate.\n\nThe Iowa Public Employees' Retirement System, which serves employees of state and local governments and school districts, said in a statement that 103 retirees' accounts were compromised in mid-October. The system provides pension checks to 115,000 retirees who receive about $1.8 billion in payments annually.\n\nThe theft occurred when criminals who had obtained stolen Social Security numbers and birth dates used the information to register for IPERS' online account access and changed the direct deposit information. Then they redirected the pension payments to a different financial institution, said IPERS' spokeswoman Judy Akre. IPERS learned of the cybercrime on Tuesday.\n\nIPERS has reissued the benefit payments to the correct financial institutions to ensure that all the affected retirees will receive their pensions, Akre said. Meanwhile, all retirees are asked to immediately confirm with their financial institution the receipt of their October payments, she said. In addition, online account access has been suspended.\n\n\"If you suspect something is wrong, contact IPERS as soon as possible,\" Akre said. However, the retirement system has run queries that indicate that the cyber-crime incident has only affected the 103 accounts, she added.\n\n\"The Department of Criminal Investigation and the FBI have been contacted and IPERS will pursue full prosecution against the criminals,\" Akre said. She didn't have a specific amount of money that was stolen, but she said it totaled in the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nOfficials with the Federal Bureau of Investigation in Omaha and the Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation in Des Moines didn't immediately return calls seeking comment Wednesday.\n\nDonna Mueller, IPERS' chief executive officer, said in an email that she is proud that the IPERS' staff quickly identified the affected accounts, isolated the problem and worked with banks to recover the money, and then reissued payments to the 103 retirees.\n\n\"This type of cyber-crime is happening more and more frequently,\" Mueller said. \"We must all be vigilant in checking our bank statements, credit cards and other online financial accounts more frequently. If you suspect anything, call immediately.\"\n\nState Treasurer Michael Fitzgerald, who serves on the IPERS' Investment Board, said Mueller advised him of the problem Tuesday and provided details of what had happened.\n\n\"Anytime our system is breached, I would say that this is a very serious concern. It has to be stopped,\" Fitzgerald said. \"I give IPERS credit for catching this ...They have been able to make good on all the payments to people out there. But this has to be stopped or this great system that we have will just have to be changed.\"\n\nAkre said that while the retiree accounts were compromised, IPERS' computer system was not hacked. IPERS has more than 350,000 members overall, including current and former public employees, and retirees. On June 30, the pension fund had assets of about $30.7 billion.\n\nState Sen. Charles Schneider, R-West Des Moines, who co-chairs the Legislature's Public Retirement Systems Committee, said Wednesday night he's concerned that IPERS experienced a breakdown in its cyber-security system. He said he wants to know more information about exactly what happened to cause the breach.\n\n\"The point I want to make is that we will do whatever is necessary in order to make sure that we have the proper cyber-security measures in place and that Iowans' pension benefits are safe,\" Schneider said.\n\nThe problems experienced by IPERS come at a time cybercrime is a growing concern in government, business and other sectors. Iowa Secretary of State Paul Pate said in September he intends to ask the Iowa Legislature in 2018 for additional money for technology upgrades to the state's elections system to help ensure that election records remain secure against cyberintruders.\n\nPate said the integrity of the state's elections system remains intact, although he acknowledges it's been repeatedly attacked by outsiders who have included would-be hackers from Russia.\n\nRead or Share this story: http://dmreg.co/2zZ5m57",

      "(Photo by John McDonnell/The Washington Post)\n\nChris Cooley opened his film breakdown of the Redskins' Week 1 offense on Tuesday's episode of ESPN 980's \"The Drive With Cooley and Czabe\" with a warning for listeners.\n\n\"If you don't want to hear me tell you that Kirk Cousins played well, go find another station,\" he said. \"If you don't want to hear that this offense is actually pretty good, even though they only scored 10 points, don't listen. But I'm going to tell you some positive stuff from this team.\"\n\nSure enough, Cooley was complimentary of Cousins, who completed 21 of 31 passes for 196 yards, one touchdown and two interceptions in Sunday's 17-10 loss to Miami.\n\n[Cousins gets no respect in FanDuel or DraftKings]\n\n\"I thought Kirk Cousins did a great job taking what was given to him throughout this game,\" Cooley said. \"He made a lot of big plays, he made a lot of throws over the middle of the field, he had a couple that he'd like to get back.\"\n\nCooley said Cousins's decision-making in the quick pass game was good, he made the correct checks at the line of scrimmage and he slid in the pocket to avoid pressure. Cooley raved about Cousins's 18-yard throw to Pierre Garcon on a 3rd and 5 play on the Redskins's second drive. Cousins had Andre Roberts open on a five-yard choice route, but he made the right read to make the big play to Garcon on a corner route.\n\n\"This is the type of quarterback play that will win football games for you this season,\" Cooley said. \"This is the type of decision-making that a guy with great vision and great understanding of defense can make. This is something that you would not have seen last year out of Robert [Griffin III] and it would've been fine. You would've seen a guy throw the 5-yard [pass]. That's fine, but this is the bigger play, you take the bigger play. Kirk took what the defense gave him most of the day.\"\n\nCooley had a few criticisms of Cousins, too, including his first interception.\n\n\"It's third and 18, the quarterback goes to the line of scrimmage, he's got to have in his mind, 'I'm probably not going to have a play to make here',\" said Cooley, who thought Cousins had room to step up in the pocket to his left and find Garcon for a first down.\n\n[The Rams won't use their captains to troll the Redskins this year]\n\nInstead, Cousins felt pressure, rolled to his right and attempted an off-schedule throw to Jordan Reed in the flat that was intercepted by Miami's Brent Grimes. Reed started up field as soon as Cousins released the ball.\n\n\"Obviously there's a misunderstanding, but if I'm in Reed's position and I see the quarterback flushing right and I'm out in the check-down flat, I'm going to roll it up the sideline as well,\" Cooley said. \"Third and 18, scramble drill, I'm going to go up the sideline to see if I can go make a play. Kirk throws it, it should've been a pick-six. It should've never been thrown, it was a bad decision. He panicked.\"\n\nAs for the incompletion that Cousins threw on fourth and seven on the Redskins' final play of the game, Cooley put the blame on Reed. According to Cooley, who diagrammed the play on Monday, Reed was running a seam route and should've broken in front of the safety toward the post. Instead, he ran into the safety and broke outside.\n\nHere's what happened on the redskins last play (4th and 7) Reed is a hell of a tight end, but must correct this. pic.twitter.com/QDYGQjten8 — Chris Cooley (@thecooleyzone) September 14, 2015\n\nCooley graded Cousins out at a B-plus, but docked him half a letter grade for his \"egregious interception,\" resulting in a B. As noted by 106.7 The Fan's Chris Lingebach, that's considerably better than the letter grades a trio of former quarterbacks gave Cousins on CBS Sports Network's \"NFL Monday QB.\"\n\n\"I'm giving this guy a D,\" Steve Beurlein said. \"He's trying to play RGIII back into a job if you ask me. I think the guy really came out yesterday and really laid an egg. I don't think he did a good job, I don't think he earned any confidence from Jon Gruden (sic). I think he was off all day long. Ten points, I just think you can't give him any higher than a D.\"\n\nTrent Green and Rich G",
      "The conflict between snooping governments seeking to defeat encryption and users demanding ever more robust privacy tools has turned into an arms race—and it's time for arms control talks, Microsoft's general counsel said on Tuesday.\n\nResolving that conflict requires a new consensus on how to balance public safety and personal privacy, Brad Smith said in a forum at Harvard Law School. \"Ultimately there are only two ways to better protect peoples privacy: stronger technology or better laws,\" he said.\n\nIn an expansive conversation about privacy and rebuilding trust in technology after revelations of widespread government spying, Smith talked about Microsoft's first \"sea-change\" moment. It came in the year after the September 2001 terrorist attacks, when Microsoft, among other Internet companies and telcos, was asked to voluntarily share data with U.S. law enforcement.\n\nIn the heat of the moment, in 2002, \"it was easy to do things that we wouldn't otherwise do,\" Smith told Jonathan Zittrain, a professor of law and computer science at Harvard who moderated the event.\n\nThe principle that Microsoft adopted at that point and has stayed with is that if it's legally obligated to do something, it will comply, but otherwise it will not. \"Our basic message was, if the government didnt feel the law went far enough, it shouldn't ask us to go beyond the law. It should go to Congress and ask Congress to change the law,\" he said.\n\nThe second sea-change was driven by the revelations in mid-2013, by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden, of widespread surveillance and data collection by the U.S. government. One of the biggest impacts of that was a significant loss of trust in technology companies by enterprise customers, Smith said.\n\nElizabeth Heichler, IDGNS Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith and Harvard Law School Professor Jonathan Zittrain.\n\nTrust on the wane\n\n\"The public's trust on a global basis was changed,\" he said. The level of concern varies, and is more pronounced in Germany, across Europe, Brazil, and even came up in conversations with large businesses in Japan. Surveys conducted by Microsoft found a 10- to 15-point decline in trust among customers.\n\nBesides strengthening encryption, as most tech companies have done, Microsoft is tackling the issue of trust by bringing its legal resources to bear and implementing changes in its enterprise contracts.\n\n\"We said, if the U.S. government came and served a subpoena on us, seeking the email or other records of an enterprise customer, we would resist that, we would go to court, we would argue to a federal judge that that subpoena ought to be served on the customer, not on us. Second, we said that if the data in question were stored exclusively outside the United States, we would go to court and challenge the extraterritorial reach,\" Smith said.\n\nAsked by Zittrain whether Microsoft has had discussions about extending the same protections to \"run of the mill\" consumers, not just enterprises, Smith appeared to acknowledge that there are limits to the legal resources that the company is willing to commit on behalf of its customers.\n\nSmith said he has filed three lawsuits against the government in the past year, including one asserting Microsoft's first amendment right to publish more information about so-called FISA letters (these are issued after secret hearings in the U.S. court where law enforcement seeks warrants under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act). \"Reform of the FISA court is so important,\" Smith said. \"We should not allow that issue to get lost in the public discussion. Public safety is of course important, but secret courts with secret decisions are not part of the American legal tradition.\"\n\nMicrosoft's second lawsuit challenged an FBI subpoena that was issued late last year, for data on an enterprise customer. In the third lawsuit, where Microsoft is now appealing a judge's ruling against it, it is opposing a search warrant by U.S. law enforcement for emails stored in a data center in Ireland.\n\nThe law of the land: but which land?\n\n\"When should the United States government be able to reach into another country, into a data center built in another country, to get the data stored inside?\" Smith said. \"One could understand a rule that would say, if you have an American citizen or resident, that is storing data in another place, one could imagine a public policy rationale that would enable the U.S. government to serve a warrant. That stands in sharp contrast to the current position that the Department of Justice is taking in the lawsuit. They're basically saying, if the data center was built or is operated by an American company then they can reach anything inside. That really goes to the heart of sovereignty.\"\n\nIt's quite likely that Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba will build a data center in the U.S., Smith said. \"How will the people in Washington, D.C., feel if the Chinese government, if the Russian government, the Iranian government, the North Korean",

      "Table of Contents\n\nDefinition The Subway diet is the weight-loss plan created by Jared Fogle, an obese college student who weighed 425 pounds (192.7 kilograms). The 22-year-old Fogle lost 245 pounds (111.1 kilograms) in 11 months by following a daily diet that consisted primarily of two low-fat sandwiches purchased at the Subway fast-food chain. After losing 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms), the 6-foot-2 (187.9-centimter) Fogle added walking to his daily routine. His dramatic weight loss led to Fogle's appearances in Subway commercials and his role as a motivational speaker and an advocate in the fight against childhood obesity.\n\nOrigins Jared's Fogle's unique diet led to his weight loss and international fame as the star of Subway sandwich commercials. He created the Subway diet in March of 1998.By1999,heweighed 180 pounds (81.6 kilograms). In 2000, he began appearing in Subway TV commercials. His weight loss was illustrated by the image of the slender Fogle holding his pre-diet jeans with the 60-inch (152.4-centimeter) waist. At that time, Fogle weighed 190 pounds (86.1 kilograms). He had maintained that weight as of the spring of 2007 and wore pants with a 34-inch (86.4-centimeter) waist. The public identified Fogle by his first name or as the \"Subway Guy.\" The Subway diet was one component of Fogle's fame; the public also celebrated his weight loss and his campaign to educate others about the importance of diet and exercise. Fogle drew upon his life experiences when speaking about those issues to the media, on talk shows, and in presentations to schools and other groups.\n\nProgressive weight gain Physically, Fogle's ankles and wrists had swelled with edema. His blood pressure was high, and his sleep was interrupted by apnea. Overweight people are at risk of sleep apnea, a condition where blockage causes the person to repeatedly stop breathing. Fogle realized it was time to start dieting, and he described those efforts in his 2006 book, Jared, the Subway Guy: Winning Through Losing: 13 Lessons for Turning Your Life Around.\n\nDeciding to diet Fogle decided to lose weight during his junior year of college. He had moved out of the dorm and into an apartment located next to a Subway shop. While the shop was close to home, Fogle tried three other diets before creating the Subway diet. His first diet limited calories to 1,800 per day and involved extensive food preparation. The preparation was time-consuming, and he ended the diet. Next Fogle went to the store and stocked up on low-calorie and diet frozen meals. He disliked the taste of the microwaved meals and embarked on another diet. This one involved drinking diet shakes for breakfast and lunch and eating a sensible meal for dinner. Fogle thought the shakes tasted terrible. He abandoned that diet but was determined to lose weight. He researched and rejected what he called \"one-size-fits-all\" diets. As spring break approached, Fogle found inspiration in Subway's \"Seven Under 6 Grams of Fat\" menu, a selection of seven low-fat sandwiches. In March of 1998, Fogle developed a weight loss plan that consisting basically of eating two sandwiches each day. Once he shed 100 pounds (45.4 kilograms) on his customized diet, Fogle started walking to school. He eventually established a routine of walking 1.5 miles (2.4 kilometers) each day. By the following spring, Fogle had shed more than half of his original weight. Fame came when he encountered Ryan Coleman, a college friend who hadn't seen him in some time.

      "CNN: At least 40 vets died while waiting for care at Phoenix VA\n\nAt least 40 U.S. veterans died while waiting for health care at the Phoenix VA, many of whom were placed on a secret waiting list, according to a CNN report.\n\nThe \"elaborate scheme,\" implemented by top management, was an effort to hide that 1,400 to 1,600 sick veterans waited months to see a doctor, said CNN, citing a former Veterans Administration doctor and other agency staff. The secret list also gave the appearance of shorter appointment wait times, which were reported back to Washington, according to the story.\n\nThe report quotes a recently retired doctor from the Phoenix Veterans Affairs Health Care System, Dr. Sam Foote, who explained the protocol for misreporting appointment requests.\n\nAccording to Foote, when vets requested a medical appointment, their info would be entered into hospital computers but not saved. A screen grab of the actual appointment data was printed, added to the secret electronic list, then shredded, erasing any public record that the actual appointment was made.\n\n\"So the only record that you have ever been there requesting care was on that secret list,\" Foote said in the CNN story. \"And they wouldn't take you off that secret list until you had an appointment time that was less than 14 days so it would give the appearance that they were improving greatly the waiting times, when in fact they were not.\"\n\nThe article references the family of a 71-year-old Navy veteran who had difficulty getting a follow-up appointment after they rushed him to the Phoenix VA emergency room because of blood in his urine.\n\nDespite a history of cancer and a chart identifying him as urgent, Thomas Breen's family could not get him in for an appointment.\n\nBreen's wife said she called daily for appointments from late September 2013 through November. Breen died Nov. 30.\n\n\"They called me December 6,\" his wife Sally told CNN.\n\nThe Phoenix VA Health Care System responded to the story, writing they would \"welcome the results from the Office of Inspector General's review.\"\n\nThe statement went on: \"We acknowledge Phoenix VA Health Care System has had longstanding issues with Veterans accessing care and have taken numerous actions to meet demand, while we continue to serve more Veterans and enhance our services.\"\n\nLawmakers have since called that all records at the Phoenix VA be preserved, according to CNN.\n\nnews@stripes.com",

The twins were 15 weeks early and he had to learn before they could come home from hospital.\n\nHe said: \"Jake's lips were blue and he was all floppy. Luckily, after one breath and one push on his chest, he came back.\n\n\"It's scary to think that we only woke up because his sister was crying.\n\n\"If she hadn't been crying, it would have been too late.\"\n\nJake was rushed to Dr Gray's Hospital in Elgin, where he stopped breathing again.\n\nHe was put on a ventilator and rushed to Edinburgh Royal Infirmary, where medics found his lung had collapsed and he was fighting three infections.\n\nHannah, 24, who is also mum to Dylan, six, Sophie, three, and Ethan, one, said: \"It was so scary.We really thought we were going to lose our little boy.\n\n\"If Amie hadn't cried at that moment, he would have been beyond saving.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first medical drama for the twins.\n\nIt took doctors 12 minutes and seven attempts to revive 1lb 11oz Amie when Hannah went into labour just 25 weeks into her pregnancy. Jake arrived an hour later, weighing 1lb 13oz.\n\nHannah, of Buckie, Banffshire, said: \"When I first saw them, they were so tiny.\n\n\"Their skin was like cling film and you could see everything inside.

      "A:\n\nWhen financing a company, \"cost\" is the measurable cost of obtaining capital. With debt, this is the interest expense a company pays on its debt. With equity, the cost of capital refers to the claim on earnings provided to shareholders for their ownership stake in the business.\n\nWhat Is Debt Financing?\n\nWhen a firm raises money for capital by selling debt instruments to investors, it is known as debt financing. In return for lending the money, the individuals or institutions become creditors and receive a promise that the principal and interest on the debt will be repaid on a regular schedule.\n\nWhat Is Equity Financing?\n\nEquity financing is the process of raising capital through the sale of shares in a company. With equity financing comes an ownership interest for shareholders. Equity financing may range from a few thousand dollars raised by an entrepreneur from a private investor to an initial public offering (IPO) on a stock exchange running into the billions.\n\nLower Cost of Financing: Debt Versus Equity\n\nProvided a company is expected to perform well, debt financing can usually be obtained at a lower effective cost.\n\nFor example, if you run a small business and need $40,000 of financing, you can either take out a $40,000 bank loan at a 10 percent interest rate or you can sell a 25 percent stake in your business to your neighbor for $40,000.\n\nSuppose your business earns a $20,000 profit during the next year. If you took the bank loan, your interest expense (cost of debt financing) would be $4,000, leaving you with $16,000 in profit.\n\nConversely, had you used equity financing, you would have zero debt (and as a result, no interest expense), but would keep only 75 percent of your profit (the other 25 percent being owned by your neighbor). Therefor, your personal profit would only be $15,000, or (75% x $20,000).\n\nFrom this example, you can see how it is less expensive for you, as the original shareholder of your company, to issue debt as opposed to equity. Taxes make the situation even better if you had debt, since interest expense is deducted from earnings before income taxes are levied, thus acting as a tax shield (although we have ignored taxes in this example for the sake of simplicity).\n\nOf course, the advantage of the fixed-interest nature of debt can also be a disadvantage. It presents a fixed expense, thus increasing a company's risk. Going back to our example, suppose your company only earned $5,000 during the next year. With debt financing, you would still have the same $4,000 of interest to pay, so you would be left with only $1,000 of profit ($5,000 - $4,000). With equity, you again have no interest expense, but only keep 75 percent of your profits, thus leaving you with $3,750 of profits (75% x $5,000).\n\nHowever, if a company fails to generate enough cash, the fixed-cost nature of debt can prove too burdensome. This basic idea represents the risk associated with debt financing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nCompanies are never totally certain what their earnings will amount to in the future (although they can make reasonable estimates). The more uncertain their future earnings, the more risk is presented. As a result, companies in very stable industries with consistent cash flows generally make heavier use of debt than companies in risky industries or companies who are very small and just beginning operations. New businesses with high uncertainty may have a difficult time obtaining debt financing, and often finance their operations largely through equity.\n\n(For more on the costs of capital, see \"Investors Need a Good WACC.\")",

Whether any of it is true , I do not know . 1 . There have been only 6 times in history that a steel building has fallen due to fires . 4 of them happened the WTC buildings . 2 were poorly constructed buildings . 2 . Building 7 was located across the street from the twin towers , and also fell due to controllable fires apparently . It was hit with debris from the towers collapsing . Going back to # 1 this is hard to believe given that no plane hit this building . Would a fire get spread when a building falls and rubble hits another building ? WTC 7 is also said to have been the control center where all the planning was done and was taken down to destroy the evidence . Some of the floors were government controlled . 3 . If you watch the videos , you can see people standing in the holes left by the plane . If people were there , the fire must not have been that strong . Combine that with # 1 and # 2 . 4 . The designer of the towers said specifically that both buildings were designed to withstand 2 planes hitting them . 5 . The head of security at the WTC buildings was the younger brother of George W. Bush , whose 2 year contract ended on the day of the attacks . Also someone claimed a multimillion dollar insurance policy afterwards . 6 . Some people looked at the moment the buildings were collapsing and noticed small explosions that looked like controlled demolition . 7 . The Pentagon was said to have been hit by the same type of plane , a 767 , yet there is no lawn damage in front of the building at all . Also some windows right next to the damaged portion of the building are in tact . Also the hole in the pentagon is smaller the width of the wings of a 767 . 8 . A passport was found for Mohammed Atta , one of the attackers outside the rubble of the collapsed towers . A paper passport from inside the plane , that exploded with enough fire and heat to bring down a building survived after the towers collapsed . 9 . The steel after the towers collapsed was quickly destroyed . People would have liked it to have been saved so it could have been studied to find the cause of the collapse . I 'm sure there are more , but that s is all I can remember off the top of my head .",

      "Players take turns placing stones on the intersections of the lines of the Go board . When a stone is first placed by itself , there are four intersections surrounding it . These are called ' liberties ' . When two or more stones of the same color ( black or white ) are positioned next to each other ( but not diagonally ) , they share their liberties ( so two in a row would together have six liberties ) , and thus function as a group . When a stone or group of stones loses all of its liberties ( by occupation or the edge of the board ) , that stone or group of stones is removed from the board and depending on the mode of play , either forfeited to the opponent or put back in the player 's stockpile . The game ends when either all the territory has been claimed or both players pass in succession . Additionally , if a stone would be placed where it has no liberties , it is instantly removed . However , if its placement causes the immediate removal of another stone or formation which will then give it one or more liberties , that stone or formation is removed and the placed stone remains . There is one additional rule . Whenever a move would return the board to exactly the same state it was in one move previously , that move becomes illegal ; the board must change somewhere else before that action can be taken . This is called the rule of Ko , and is in place to prevent infinite - loops . There are several methods of scoring . My favorite is to count the number of ' eyes ' , or unassailable spaces controlled by each player . An space is unassailable if no stone may be placed there without being instantly removed for lack of liberties . It is important to note that a formation with only one eye is doomed , whereas a formation with two or more becomes effectively invincible . Those are the rules . Simple to learn , very difficult to master . Start soon .",

      "First off , hope your hangover gets better . Now , on to the explanation . When you drink alcohol , a good portion of it ( 15 % or more ) is absorbed directly through your stomach wall into your bloodstream and starts to affect you brain . The rest of it hits a few minutes later , when it passes through your small intestine , like carbs or protein or any other nutrient . Alcohol in your blood will affect your brain ( you 'll feel this as being tipsy / drunk ) , but it 's also toxic . It 's not going to kill you immediately , but in high enough quantities it can cause alcohol poisoning , which is why your body wants to get rid of it . That 's where your liver comes in . It breaks down the alcohol molecules in a few steps into molecules that your body can use for energy ( if you 're curious , it looks like this : alcohol -- > acetaldehyde -- > acetic acid -- > acetyl - CoA ) . That stuff - the acetyl - CoA - can be used for energy , so it then goes to your cells and is used for fuel . That 's what happens to alcohol in your system . Hangovers merit their own explanaition . Hangovers have a few different causes ( and we are n't exactly sure about all of them ) but the number one cause of a hangover is dehydration . Alcohol causes your kidneys to get rid of water at a much faster rate than they would normally . This is why you have to piss like a racehorse after drinking alcohol . The next morning , you 're very dehydrated and this gives you a headache , which can be severe . Like I said , there are other causes . Alcohol irritates your stomach lining , causing nausea and vomiting . It makes you sleepy but disrupts your natural sleep , so you wake up groggy and tired . It can also cause an immune response , which can lead to an inability to concentrate or remember things . There are other theories as well , but those are most of the main ones . The number one cure for a hangover is hydration before - and during - alcohol intake . Make sure you 've had plenty of water before you go out , and keep drinking water while you 're drinking . AT LEAST one glass of water every couple drinks . You 'll feel way better in the morning . Also , do n't drink on an empty stomach . Okay , that was pretty long but hopefully you got the idea .",

      "Depends on the poison , but none are ever ok to eat ! As others mentioned , Cyanide in any form ( KCN , HCN , etc . ) does n't really break down , and even if it did begin to degrade the lethal dose is much less than a gram - there 's a good bet that there 's still enough to kill you , the rat , and a few others as well . Anticoagulants like Coumarin ( fun fact : the blood thinner Warfarin got its start as a rat poison ) , will degrade slowly , but it does n't take much ( still less than a gram ) to be lethal or render serious harm . Phosphides degrade to [ phosphines ] ( URL_0 ) which fortunately smell very bad , because they are very toxic . Do n't get near those . Vitamin D can be used as well . Animals only need a small amount , and if large ( toxic ) quantities are used , it causes Calcium to accumulate to dangerous levels in the blood and organs . * In theory * this is the least toxic , because vitamin D degrades to other cholesterols when exposed to light , but bait traps may be packaged with anticoagulants to increase their effectiveness , and the packaging acts to preserve it . Never eat it . TL;DR Rat poisons may not work as well after the expiration date but still are very dangerous and should be treated as such .

      "At its very core , Anarchism is the basic idea that humans are able to organize themselves better without rulers . It supports a structure of society based on people helping each other directly , without having to appoint someone who would do it on their behalf . Its advantages are that it is impervious to corruption since there 's nobody at the top to be corrupted , and everyone is equal to each other , so nobody can have power over you . In communist anarchism there is also no money , so issues such as theft and other such human conflicts ( which is the primary reason humans conflict ) would be gone . Its disadvantage is the difficulty to realize such a society . Whenever any society moves towards an anarchist path ( e.g. Anarchist Catalonia in 1936 ) , it is assaulted by capitalist nations who do not want their own citizens to get inspired .

Trees that once framed his favorite haunt now were downed and mutiliated into thick, insurmountable sheets. His eyes glazed upward towards an opposing pair of eyes. \n \n The face atop the wall panicked and thrust one of the tree's dismembered branches into Bill's right eye. \n \n Bill found the exchange unpleasant and wandered off from the fortress.

The castle bustled with the news of the coming prince or princess. \n \n Then, one morning, a dark figure appeared in my throne room. “ A present, for the Queen, ” the short, robed, figure murmured, coming right up to the base of my throne with impunity. “ It will help her in the time of her greatest need. ” A gnarled, brown hand held up a blue crystal on a simple hemp thread. \n \n “ What is this crystal? ” I demanded. \n \n “ It is the essence of Fire, one of the only cures for a frozen heart. It can only work once, so use it with wisdom. ” The short figure pushed the crystal into my hand and, without looking at my face, hurried out of the throne room. I was left, stunned at the random occurrence, holding the small, glowing crystal in my palm. Quickly coming to my senses, I shoved it into my kingly robe, saving it to show my Queen that evening. \n \n At the end of the",

I kept going up, and up, until my house looked just like it did on those Google Maps my dad would show me. I was ecstatic. I wanted to show all my friends so bad, but something stopped me. I knew that I might need this later, so I kept my power hidden. \n \n As I grew older, I learned the source of my flight : my friend's belief. As long as someone believed something about me, it would be true. I was able to utilize this to a great advantage in elementary school by telling extravagant lies and backing them up with ``true stories.'' I made a girl in my class believe that I had a rocketship once, and sure enough, when I got home a NASA shuttle was sitting in my backyard ( I lived on a ranch, so it was a pretty big backyard.) Fortunately I had made another sap believe that I had an underground lair, so I had a place to store the thing. But then my peers g",

Heavy duty sedatives certainly helped, though later we'd realize that was the only reason we'd even gotten that far with him. \n \n Epsilon-45 was silent for weeks after capture. Despite all our attempts to figure out what his ability was, what made him special, he just stayed quiet.

As she walked, she realized the path going uphill, even though the village was on a hill already.

Red stifled a cry as tears filled her eyes. Her father who was being held back by two men roared and broke free from their grip.

I looked up at the house before me with some trepidation- spending my Saturday helping a friend of my grandma rearrange her furniture wasn't exactly my own decision, and that combined with an early morning wake up had given me a bad attitude. \n \n Before the wind could get to me, I made me way to the front door and rang the bell. Only moments later, it creaked open and I looked down at the small, round-faced figure gazing up at me. \n \n ``Miss Hewitt?'' I questioned, holding out a hand for her to shake. Instead of taking it, she pulled me down into a hug with surprising force. \n \n ``You must be Walter! Your grandmother has told me so much about you!'' She exclaimed. She took me by the hand and led me out of the cold, thanking me profusely and repeatedly for agreeing to help a ``feeble old woman like her''. I assured her it was no problem, ",

I stood up and smiled, wiping my brow with pride. \n \n Unfortunately, my self-satisfaction was short lived. ``Mamma!'' Elise cried from the backyard. Years of parenting had taught me every variation of that sound but I'd never heard her so terrified. I threw down my quantum wrench with a sharp clang and sprinted to the back porch with all my might. I frantically grabbed Elise at the back door and sighed with relief to see she was unharmed. \n \n ``Elise what ’ s wron-,'' I froze, starring at the sky. The entire horizon was consumed by a purple mass which glowed with an eerie light. The edges of the alien ship blurred and pulsed like the desert air on a hot day.

Nobody sought to meet his eye, either, and for the first time, he was comforted by that. \n \n She ran for the train, and made it by just pushing one toe over the threshold of the carriage before the doors closed completely.

      "Grandpa handed me the bag, a thick canvas duffel the color of moss. It clinked and rattled as I took it in my arms. It was light, but the weight was unevenly spread and it was as long as I was tall ; I had to keep adjusting it in my arms. \n \n He smirked, the scar on his cheek curling at the halfway mark. ``You got that?'' \n \n ``Yes,'' I answered, a little more defensively than I'd meant to. I was seven, far too young to take part in the family business. If I seemed weak or incompetent, Grandpa would send me home without thinking twice. As Daddy had learned two months ago, the forests just outside the Ozark Mountains were dangerous. \n \n But Grandpa either didn't notice or didn't care that I had that edge in my voice. Maybe he wanted it there, given what we were going up against. He nodded and hitched his own bag over his shoulder, stopping just outside the treeline. Without a word, he pointed to a spaced patch of elm trees. Things were moving -- shadows that barely seemed to be held inside chunks of air, those shapes writhing around the tree trunks. Every few seconds I saw a pair of lights inside those shadows, like a cigarette hitting the highway at night. \n \n ``Was it... them?''

Salutations, hand shakes, observation of my lack of discretion about my Ticker, and then ``Why don't you cover that up?''

It's actually something I look forward to when I meet someone for the first time.

America had fallen weak due to a surge of war in the middle east. China and Russia were systematically taking over leaving our bankrupt government on verge of civil war over an ever eroding supply of food and fresh water. \n \n Two years ago my wife was killed by a group of armed men over a bag of groceries. \n \n I knew something had to be done. I couldn't disable nuclear armaments. I wasn't a great leader who could persuade the masses. I couldn't stop people from fighting over the trivial beliefs and hatred built up over the course of their lives. \n \n But I could do something. I could reboot the system like a computer. \n \n I can't go into detail how this was done but I can tell you that I thought about this greatly. \n \n Civilization would come to a stop. Chaos might ensue. Memories of loved ones would be gone. The only thing people would have connection with their pasts would be on the Internet or personal computers. \n \n I took me several years and my life's fortune to ready the project. I'd call it Project Babel. \n \n My next step is to attempt to shut down and erase dangerous information on the Internet before people figure out how to access it. \n \n I have help from our AI, Cortana as we named her. \n \n With her help I am going to monitor the world and hope to restore enough order for the hopes of humans survival of the next few generations.

More than once, out in the corn fields, my papa asked me ``You pray to God for rain today?'' and of course, I said ``Yes, Papa''. But I hadn't and I wouldn't, instead I hid in the stalks and cried, feeling shame for my lies. When this happened, almost always, the storm rolled in within a week. Once, my mother rushed out of the house while I wept, hidden amongst the ears, and shouted ``Great news from the weather station, Frank! Come inside, come hear!'' \n \n Even as a small girl, I noticed the pattern. I thought God was teaching me a lesson, that good things come to those who wait, or that a ",

Groaning, I got up and picked up a small, worn out notebook. The notebook had a frayed cloth exterior and a rusted silver clasp on it. Out of curiousity, I opened the clasp and read the carved inscriptions on the back of the cover. \n \n'This diary belongs to Natasha Rider,' it said. \n \n I immediately shut the book and dropped it like it burned my hands. Reading her diary was an invasion of privacy. I felt a small amount of guilt stir as I looked at the worn out notebook. I picked it up and placed it on the bedside table, to avoid the temptation of reading it. \n \n A few minutes later, the curiousity set in. I went back to the room and picked out the diary. What did she write in there? What secrets did she hide? I knew that she wrote in her diary, ",

I took it all in, admiring the beautiful prison in which Sisphys had been condemned. \n \n We ate silently, spitting fishbones into the ",
      "Once upon a time... last week, actually, there was a little girl who was playing in the park alone, and it was getting dark. A wolf began to chase her, and she couldn't get away. This wolf had been watching her for many days and finally had the chance to take her. Knowing she couldn't run away, she made the wolf an offer : \n \n ``Mister, I know what you want with me and I can't get away. But if you do me a favor, I'll be extra nice to you. My back hurts, and I need you to massage it for me.'' The man was delighted, and proceeded to massage the little girl.

She had an air of solemnity and grace about her, as she moved, be it on the battlefield, or in the corridors of a cruiser. She took a proactive role in battles, frequently leading to the most dangerous areas and she had a reputation for bringing her troops back alive, in some cases even dragging them off the field to be tended. \n \n Master Dak was an older woman, especially for a human, nearing sixty. But it's impossible to serve under a well honed General who respects their troops and not develop an immense respect for them.

I found myself more often volunteering for her personal squads and more often found myself covering her over any of my kin, despite the fact that she was easily more capable ",
      "Every day, I shower, brush my teeth and then head off to school. Today was different. I forgot to lock the bathroom door and my brother barged in. He went to brush his teeth and started screaming because the mirror had three people In it not two... I rinsed off my tooth brush and went to the kitchen, I could hear him panting and catching his breath. He yelled at me if I just saw that and if that was normal. Unfortunately I couldn't answer his question. ( I lack the writing skills but the concept was that the main character is blind so he didn't know that the mirror had two people in it nor did he know This was weird. The brother was going to be mentally handicapped, and the person in the mirror was going to be their mother ( who raised them alone) who still alive. So when main asks his mom about it, she'd only see herself and main. Making main go crazy when he puts his hand on the mirror and reads the lip movements. Where something along the lines of you're not blind, they just made you that way, and I'd throw in something with main taking a pill everyday that he thinks is for blank but turns out to be making him blind. The reason for this would end with something along the lines of, main is super smart, so society made him blind to take away his advantage. Mains brother is mentally handicapped so they gave him muscle to make him average. \n Sorry not much of a writer nor have I ever done anything like th",

How could anything holy take control of a man of god? ``, the priest replied with a crackling voice. \n \n ``I AM GOD'', screamed the Father as foam pooled at the corners of his mouth. \n \n The priest raised a cross as tears welled in his eyes. ``The power of Christ compels you!

Through the porthole, the welder could see the damage. The hole was only as large as a fist. The patches in his kit would be plenty. \n \n The emergency release handle pulled, and the team rushed in. The welder and his team started cutting the flexible metal to size. The utilities worker started searching for leaks that could serve a hazard to open sparks or flame. The medics brought spare oxygen for those trapped when the sector closed. \n \n The patch fit perfectly, using the vacuum of space to secure it temporarily.

The idea that I should abandon that for a cheap meatpacker's hairnet galled me. I wondered if I could fake it. \n \n The black market doesn't work the same way it used to, at least in this area. If you can't afford a hat at the normal price, you're obviously not going to pay an inflated price upfront for a fake. Instead, they take a percentage of your income for as long as they deem necessary. That was fine with me as long as I could do what ",

I was sitting in class for the first day of 8th grade, goofing around and flicking rubber bands at my friend Trevor, when my new teacher, Ms. Johnson walked in. \n \n The class had immediately fallen silent, not because the teacher had walked in but because she was one of the most gorgeous women we had ever seen. She was what pubescent boys' dreams were made of. Long flowing auburn hair, light emerald eyes, and a rack that could feed a family of four. I had been leaning back in my chair, with only the two back legs on the ground as kids do, and in shock, lost my balance and fell backwards, cracking my head on the tile. Ms. Johnson immediately rushed over to me and leaned over, helping me to my feet.

They matched none of the uniforms or warriors garb of the others at the tables.

It didn't matter much, now. \n \n I turned and continued walking down the path. It was sunny, but there was no heat to bask in on this harshly cold morning. The gravelly path crunched beneath my bare feet. I hadn't bothered with shoes today. It would be the last time I made the trip, and I didn't want to be burdened with them. Besides, walking barefoot always made me feel more connected, more at one with the world. The cold bothered them quite a bit, it was true. My toes were starting to look blue, and I winced with every step as the pebbles beneath me stuck briefly to the soles of my feet, falling back to the ground just in time for a new one to take its place. \n \n I looked at bare trees and vines t",

The light seemed to waltz around his short chestnut brown hair and his striking cyan eyes. He had grown, and I couldn't believe he was so different from the scrappy teen I once knew.

We were finally free from the chains of mundane work, free to pursue whatever we pleased, whether it was art, music, or sports. A Golden Age had finally dawned upon us. \n \n Scientist and wizard worked hand-in-hand to understand just how much magic and science could work together. Over the years of intimate co-operation in the name of progress, many books were written, combining the best of science and magic.

To accumulate it, and finally exercise it over others. \n \n I was awoken to a knocking at my apartment door early in the morning.

They twisted and played with reality as though they had a divine right to meddle as they please. \n Many tried and all failed to erase them from existence. They endured our trials like the strongest stone, adapted to our might, and returned it with fervor unmatched.

They were the heralds of destruction and no one, not even themselves, were exempt from their message. \n As suddenly as they had appeared they had vanished, disappearing into the void without a trace.

But apparently they also made the air hotter. And so the ice caps melted and water started getting into places where we used to live. Most people were stubborn, or in denial, refusing to believe that it was happening. Well they died. The ones who were watching, the ones who used their brain, knew what would come. They built boats with all the essential survival stuff. Apparently they lived in the ocean on and off for close to 25 years. They would live on any land they came across, gathering edible stuff and closely monitoring the water level. Then they'd be off at the slightest sign of increase. Today though, it was the tenth consecutive yea",

Men had hated that dragon who stole their daughters and burnt their crops, who hoarded gold and killed their sons. But how could they kill such a beast, with its great scales to protect from swords and swift wings to carry it from the ground, how could they kill such an awesome beast?

      "I was just an average kid like any other. Looking back, my life had been pretty uneventful. I wasn't in any clubs, and I had no special skills to speak of. I was like a blank slate, completely ready to be sculpted into someone noteworthy by experiencing a life changing journey. But I doubted something like that would ever happen. So imagine my surprise when, on my tenth birthday, a letter arrived for me from my eccentric uncle. It contained a note and a folded piece of paper. The note said : \n \n *Dear Anon, * \n \n *If you're reading this, then you are ready to begin you're training. Follow the map I've enclosed in this letter to reach my bunker. I have so much to teach you about you're hidden abilities. Trust no one and keep the map hidden! * \n \n *Love Uncle McGuffin* \n \n As soon as I finished reading the note, the doorbell rang. I was curious who it could be, as I wasn't expecting guests. As I approached the door, letter in hand, a chill went up my spine. Ignoring my instincts, I opened the door and found myself face to face with a man draped in shadows. \n \n ``Greetings child. I believe you received a letter from a mister McGuffin recently, correct? Well I'm his best friend and he really meant to send it to me. Please give me the letter.'' \n \n Feeling a bit weirded out by the guy, I handed him the letter in hopes that he would leave. He snatched it from my hand and unfolded the enclosed map. \n \n ``So that's where you're hiding McGuffin! Thanks kid'', he said as he turned to me, transformed into a flock of crows, and flew off. \n \n Shrugging my shoulders, I returned to my bori",

He pointed at the base of his hologram projector, which, if the man pictured himself as a doctor assessing a patient, appeared like a cylindrical foreign object inside the throat of the diaphanous newscaster. \n \n The whole trailer shook on its rusty suspension as the man's body was lifted to a standing position by his welfare-provided exoskeleton, which the man ordered to kindly transport him outside. He yawned while issuing the command sub-vocally. \n \n Attached to the front of the trailer was the man's retrofitted truck, ``Time to emigrate,'' he said to nothing in particular as his exoskeleton lifted him into the passenger seat. After taking off his ident-bracelet and tossing it on the dash, the man remembered that his bladder needed to be emptied, and surprised his exoskeleton with a command to bring him back out of the truck. \n \n Had the suspension on his trailer been properly maintained, it would probably not have squeaked when his truck decided to try leaving without him.

      "Some time ago it was discovered that life on this planet was tampered with. We yet don't know who they were or why they did it, but one of the things we know is that they seem to have been hopeless romantics. Wired deep into our biology is a switch that ensures we only start aging past adulthood once we meet our soulmate. \n \n You'd think this is romantic and wonderful, but it only goes to show that even the Creators can have unrealistic expectations. The actual result is that a large part of the population lives in a perpetual terror of finding this ``soulmate''. \n \n You see, eternal life isn't actually that bad. You get to make very long term plans, to accumulate vast amounts of wealth, and knowledge. So quite a few people decided that they rather like the idea of living forever, and avoid their ``soulmate'' like the plague. \n \n Of course, some of them fail at this, age, and die, but this only works as a very perverse form of natural selection : the best at not finding their sou",

The man said. ``I looked up my name, and the website predicted that two weeks ago, I would try to mass murder everyone in an elementary school.'' \n \n ``I see, so you're saying that you're fated to commit this crime.''

      "In the 456 years I have lived as a Wizard I have gone through more apprentices than I have the care or patientence to recall. I suppose there were some who stood out, but as soon as they did they were overwhelmed or taken out by the other apprentices. The apprentices are quite vicious when dealing with competitors, pulling tricks and doing some harmful things to clear their path to their goal. To this all, I turn a blind eye. After all, life is a competition and to everyone in this land being an apprentice to a great wizard of the first-class Scallion Wizarding Order, was one of the greatest honour these people could hope to be payed. It was also a way to rise above one's station. For you see, there is a strict social hierarchy. We have the Nobles, Middle Class and the Lower Class.

Alas, the fate of this small, red planet was to be consumed in a display of violence and butchery not seen since 8:45am this morning. \n \n Relaxing, Simon draped one arm over the back of the tattered auditorium chair. The University professor was droning on about Henry V, or was it Henry VI? Simon had lost track at this point. All that concerned him was the menacing growl which rumbled in the depths of his stomach. The allure of the apple drew him in. Clamping down hard, he raised the apple to his mouth and took a bite. And another. And another. Slowly but surely, Simon devoured the apple one chunk at a time. Spittle and apple chunks flew everywhere - it rudely invaded the hair of the girl sitting in front of him, it dribbled carelessly onto his doodled note-pad, it erupted into a fine mist, which sprayed into the rafters of the auditorium. In fact, one could say that the apple made a valiant escape, with more of it landing outside of Simon's mouth than in it. \n \n People were starting to stare. Simon didn't care.

The disks measure 120mm ( On Hundred and Twenty Millimeters) in diameter and 1.2mm ( One point Two Millimeters) thick. In the center of all 3 ( Three) disks was an 18mm ( Eighteen Millimeter) hole.

The other side contains a mirrored surface, with what appears to be rings engraved in them. See attachment *D.* \n \n Mr. Walters figured that maybe the mirrored side contained engraved information.

Cyrus shouted as he raised his axe and rushed the man. ``God help me!'' \n \n At the last moment, the man in white seemed to blink to the side. The ax's downward momentum carried the head through the air and into Cyrus's shin with a wet crunch. He tumbled to the ground with an inhuman scream. \n \n ``Oh. Cyrus, I'm sorry.'' The man knelt and looked at the ragged bloody hole in Cyrus's trousers. ``I was hoping you wouldn't get hurt.'' \n \n ``DAMN YOU.'' Cyrus growled. ``DAMN YOU!'' \n \n ``Cyrus. Will you allow me to heal your wound so we may continue with some hope of civility?'' \n \n ``Go to Hell!'' \n \n The man in white chuckled. ``Ok. Well, that's a no I take it.'' Cyrus glared at him as he reached for his ax. ``I don't know why I expect these things to go any other way. I am going to help you, Cyrus.'' There was another lightning crack behind the man. ``There, Colton Smith is a good man. He's sitting on his porch right now ",

Cautiously, he stepped towards it, and gazed upon his reflection. \n \n And then his reflection blinked. \n \n With furious quickness, the reflection lunged out of the mirror and slipped a knife between his ribs. Anton stumbled backwards, smashing his head against the sink-edge. The surface of the looking glass swelled, like waves of the ocean. A leg stepped through, and then a torso, then the whole body of his reflection.'Forgive me,' said the man from the mirror.'I have abandoned my post.' \n \n'Wh-what are you,' Anton whispered. His vision darkened, the blood-loss becoming unbearable. Coils of agony laced out from his lungs. Soon he would be dead, but he would be damned if he did not find out who his killer was before that happened. \n \n'I have guarded you for nineteen years,' said the reflection.'But no more. Our world is lost. If I protect you any longer I too will die. Farewell, Anton. They will be after me soon enough. I can only hope that your body provides distraction long enough for me to flee.' \n \n'A dream...' Anton garbled, as his world plummeted into darkness.'This is all a dream.' \n \n'Poor wretch,' murmured Al-Gatharae, finally casting off the illusion he had been wearing for nineteen years and reassuming his former look.

      "Bob failed his CAPTCHA five times in a row. He was a robot. \n \n The reason he failed wasn't because he was a robot. \n \n You see, we humans are all robots. Bio-electro-chemical robots. Robots of flesh, blood, bone, hair, bile and a myriad of other biological matter and organisms. Bob's biomechanical mechanisms were the result of millions of years of evolution ; an imperfect, but successful, product of a harsh system that weeded out complete failures. Bob's mechanisms were not complete failures. Many of these mechanisms, were they conjured from scratch in some alien's biotech lab, would be heralded as wonders and would be patented quickly as a new bio-industrial process. In fact, many portions of the instructions that constructed Bob's human body were already being claimed by large pharmaceutical firms here on Earth. \n \n One device of note inside Bob was a mass of neurons situated near the top, located in what is colloquially called ``the head''.

Being around him made me feel good. \n \n And, of course, the next year rolled by, and we didn't share any classes. All I got were little glimpses of him in the hallways. Every once and a while he'd come into the classroom in the morning and we'd talk and I'd get to feel that feeling for a while, and then he'd leave and I'd recede back into my grey cell. The world lost its color the moment he left the room. \n \n It took me about a year to figure out what to do. I hadn't really accepted that I was gay yet, and maybe I still haven't in the three or four years since. I wanted to kill myself. I knew that my barely-friend could never love me, and even if he *could*, it'd never be me that he wanted. I don't really know why anyone would want to be my friend. I certainly hate myself. \n \n But instead, we took a little trip. After I graduated, I organized a big trip for a bunch of people, but i",

It just breaks my heart to have to see her like this, but I really need this to work out. Cindy has only been dead for a week but for a child that is a long time to go without a mom. A while ago I heard a phrase about how the second worst thing a person can do is die but the worst of all is stay dead. That's just how it feels. I want so badly for that car wreck to just have been a dream and she would walk right through that door and kiss me like she always did and I would get to she her smile. But that is not happening. it is never going to happen, not ever again. \n \n I kissed Sammy goodbye and told her that everything would be alright, daddy just needed some alone time and that was why she needed to go to her aunt and uncle's house for a while. I told her that it is in basically the same area so she wasn't going to switch schools or anything. This didn't offer much solace. All she did was hug my leg and cry. Eight is not the age to deal with the death of a parent, I'm thirty-five and I can't keep it together. I tried to put on a brave face but I ended up crying too and hugging her back. I needed the comfort. She is all I have left. \n \n My sister-in-law pulled in the driveway just after we stopped crying but not before we stopped hugging. She quiet rapped the door. I opened it. She asked if Sammy was ready and I said yes. \n \n I hugged my sweet daughter one last time. I could feel her little heart beat in her chest and I could feel her bury little face in my neck. \n \n ``I love you sweetie'' \n \n ``I love you too daddy'' \n \n With that she was off, out into the car to a house that was not home to stay for an undetermined amount of time. I was alone. I needed time to think. I go up to the bedroom that belonged to Cindy and me. I pull my gun from the nightstand drawer. I am not sure if I am gon na do it, but at least Sammy won't see this parent d",

So I ran. \n \n I ran towards the nearest thing I could think of, some big booby trap for the transports. Never got there, of course. I felt a burning pulsation, as if a hammer was slammed into my chest and it subsequently set on fire. Then I felt more. \n \n I fell, the last thing I ate, sand. The last thing I felt, pain, the last thing I did, run. \n \n Oddly, I still see. This is not what death is, I knew that.

      "I don't know why I'm afraid of the dark. People say that the fear comes from not knowing what's there. Humans are visual, and the darkness turns what of our greatest assets into a disadvantage, and so for almost anyone else, I think it would be perfectly logical to have a healthy respect for the dangers that shadows hold. \n \n But I know what lies in the darkness. \n \n I remember being enamored with my father's shadow puppets as a child. I wondered how his fingers could be so nimble as to create the perfect silhouettes of animals I was still learning the names of. At the time, I'd barely developed the motor skills to tie my own shoes. Father explained this fascinating anomaly as magic to my younger self. When I became older, he, my mother and my older sister explained to me real magic and its place in the world. \n \n It was Mother who taught me the dangerous spells. \n \n When I was fourteen she began teaching me how to use the shade to hurt and how to protect.

I trust that you've had some opportunity to try it out in the field. Assuming you have, you'll know how to use the key you just hacked.'' He gave a salute, and the video blinked off. \n \n I checked again at the loot I'd just hacked. There was a key, but it wasn't a key from this portal. It was a key for the Great Pyramids in Cairo. And I knew exactly what to do with it. \n \n A moment later I was standing in the desert ; the city of Cairo spread out before me and the towering Pyramids behind. \n \n ``Welcome to Cairo, Agent Hushman.'' Hank held out his hand and I shook it, then he turned to introduce two other people who were with him. ``You probably recognise",

Before I could even think of opening my eyes, the pressure of countless half-remembered dreams and faint recollections fractured my brain. My skin burned as if taking a shower with a particle accelerator. The cryo-gel in my lungs, stomach, and bowels liquefied, oozing from me in rusty streams. My eyelids were unfused by a medical spray ; vision returned slowly, in painful patches. Only thing I was grateful for were our separate chambers, which spared us the embarrassment of worming and snivelling on the floor naked in front of other crewmates. \n \n My first conscious step was to self-administer a complex cocktail of drugs to help restart the immune system and metabolism.

Life Expectancy : 61 Years and 4 months. * I looked on in horror. I just robbed this woman of 23 years of her life. What if she had a family, children.

Dad looks over and smiles, ``Me too, little buddy.'' I try not to screw up my face when my sister says ``Do you love me too?'' I do not understand these conversations. It's like the news. It's all mixed up. My father looks at Sara and says ``Not really honey, but that's life.'' She smiles big and says ``I love you too daddy! And mommy too! And Jeanette.'' Jeanette is a Guinea Pig.

In two massive wars, wars that left more dead than the time where God himself had destroyed the first cities of sinners, Sodom and Gomorrah, mankind destroyed more than the first War in Heaven had, and left men cynical and angry. They raged against God, against the ideas of creators. Their blasphemies were so apparent that great temples and monuments were built, not to the glory of the Maker, but the power of man. They created their own gods, made their own lives and led the world into relentless ambition, greed and hedonism. While the Maker was angered, mankind was pleased. Upon alters to themselves they laid down their works, they lived longer, loved more, were happier than ever before. They even left their destined home for another object, even if it was their own Moon, the Maker could not believe their hubris. They were meant to farm, breed and worship him, and all his glory. \n \n The Maker had enough, and he",

It is utterly empty and inviting, as if it wants someone – anyone – to share in its selflessly given light. \n \n Two hands appear on Cerulean's body – one under the back of each armpit.

She flurries and rubs her head vigorously against the forest floor. \n \n Beth knew she had little time before the beast regained its vision. She pulled out the autodaggers and scaled the nearest tree. She grabbed onto the first branch that could support her weight and sat on it. She reloaded the G cannon. The grendwur had finally freed itself from the goo. It looked up at Beth, with eyes that would turn medusa to stone. It let out a roar that shook the forest. A roar that let Beth know more clearer than any other language, she was going to pay. It charged at Beth, running up ",
      "“ Yesssssss ”. I wheezed like Voldemort trying out words for the first time in a while. “ Go near the door! ” \n \n I watched as a young woman approached the trap door I had set in front of my house. It was Halloween and what I thought was a PERFECT time to snag someone. People go missing all the time right? What better time than the one night of the year when everyone is dressed up in a stupid costume, not even knowing whose door they were knocking on! It was pretty elaborate, a fall away latch, trap settings, it ’ s all pretty technical. The thing is, no one had ever tried it for whatever reason but I felt like this was my lucky day. Someone would actually step up to my front door and fall into the trap I had placed! I would finally be on my way to… whatever it was that would happen after I trapped someone! I hadn ’ t actually figured out the rest but I digress… \n \n “ Is this like, a haunted house? OH MY GOD! I freaking love haunted houses I need to snapchat this! ” She screamed in",

I'm in a rooftop on one of the ugliest parts of the city. The only place I can hide. \n \n I spent all of yesterday setting this up. I walked all day, until I finally found this building. Empty, unkempt. The perfect building for me. Then I gathered all the survival stuff I could find and braced myself for my first night. \n \n I spent all the day before yesteray saying my goodbyes.

The arena was designed much like a the Colosseum, but bigger - large enough to hold nearly ten million people. Millions more would be watching it from their homes ; it would be broadcasted in nearly every language, shown on every channel. \n \n Today, Satan, champion of humanity and God, the Almighty Father and Creator, would duke it out, WWE style. \n \n I was lucky enough to land a gig as a custodian here, to witness the big event. \n \n In the stands were people, mostly with tacky light-up red horns purchased from a dollar store, some with red and black face paint.

I kind of gathered that from the lack of guns.'' NASA had detected the aliens in advance, so I was well prepared with my response. Why had NASA chosen me to be the voice of humanity? I don't know, I'm fairly sure the average human could be better represented by someone who doesn't live in Cape Canaveral and doesn't have an MSc in Engineering, but apparently NASA didn't care about that. \n \n ``Great work Jon, humanity's first contact with aliens and you're sarcastic. Let me talk to them.'' Said Steve. Steve was not my superior officially, however he was a decade older than me, had a PhD in Engineering instead of an MSc and was smart enough for his opinion to be regarded as fact among the people he worked with. This meant that to all intents and purposes he was my superior. And he kind of had a point about the sarcasm. \n \n ``Hi, can ",

I must have been so absorbed in my work that I ’ d lost track of time. I glanced at the readout of the treadmill. Eight miles. That should be plenty. “ Please remember to put those shoes back. ” I glanced at Mother and blushed. Nothing I did ever escaped her. I sheepishly slid off the treadmill, out of my shoes, and back to the storefront to return them to their appropriate shelf. \n \n “ So what did you learn today? ” asked Mother as I returned. I started discussing the nuances of various tools and shoe materials before she cut me off. “ I mean from your shoes. ” I pictured the perfect windmill. Crisp, clean, quick, powerful.

I had thought because there were two of them they might learn twice as fast, but it turns out they were probably learning twice as slow. \n \n Erica decided she wanted the very bottom puzzle out of the stack, and they all came crashing down, and Erin shrieked with laughter. I clapped my hand over her mouth, but it was too late.

Not only my sister will kill me now, my mother will too. Her precious China laid broken on the floor, smashed into a hundred pieces. And crawling on top of the cupboard was Tommy, a knife in his hand. How did he even climbed up there in the first place? \n \n ``Step aside, you evil old wizard! Dora says you're evil!'' For an 11-year old, his vocabulary was pretty impressive. \n \n I walked slowly towards him, trying to coax him in my most soothing voice as possible. ``Hey, Tommy, don't you remember me? Uncle Bob? Remember? I was the one who introduced you to the gummies...'' \n \n ``Liar!'' Tommy screamed, before throwing the knife at me. \n \n ``Whoa!''

The townspeople, though, were mesmerized by the talking animal, and so asked no questions. \n \n The lion had swung its mane back and weaved a tale of accidents, loss, tragedy, and betrayal from its past, making the little townspeople sigh, awe, and weep. \n \n Scar, which apparently was the sinister name this sympathy-seeking lion felt most appropriate, had come to power after the death of his brother and nephew. He tried to lead his people justly, but the nephew had bided his time until he could come back as an adult and lead the kingdom back into cruelty. \n \n The nephew had even tried to feed him to hyenas. \n \n Pierre glanced nervously at the hyena to his left, feeling that parts of the lion's story didn't seem to add up.

When his hands reach their apex, lightning dances from his finger tips, blazing so brightly that the very air I breathe feels as if it's about to catch fire.

There, then gone. \n \n \n I don't know when specifically, but out of those moments came an impulse for violence. I was fed up.

And yet he was forced to marry Ana because he got her pregnant. \n \n This feels petty, like nitpicking, but I genuinely feel it's detrimental to the story. The conflict flickers around a lot. For the most part, it's purely survivalist, a father struggling to keep his daughter alive in the wild. But it's interspersed with all these other concerns : racial animus, poverty, complicity in hoarding, that don't get fleshed out but are merely referenced. These are communal concerns, but they end up meaningless because there's no portrayal of a community. The protagonist and Ana don't seem to have any other friends, don't spend time with anyone else other than her uncle, and even he's more of a plot device than a person. The opening line of the story is particularly confusing to me. Voice says the rockets are f",

For example, if you put $100 in an account with 5% compound interest, then after the first period, you'll have earned $5 in interest. In the second period, the total amount of money you have available to earn interest will be $105 ($100 principal plus the $5 in interest), so the interest rate will be 5% on the total of $105.

      "1\n\nThe new law will help to cut down on fraud cases where false documents and papers are supplied to police as well as cases in which fake and spurious identity documents are generated. But the introduction of the new law needs careful scrutiny. What effect will it have on the Indian identity card project? What is the role of the new law in reducing the amount of time needed to issue the identity cards? Has the Government done sufficient research before the law was introduced to check the facts and to make it as reasonable and fair as possible?The new identity card law has three objectives: first, to prevent corruption involving the production of falsified identity documents or making these documents by the producers of identity documents. Second, to strengthen the national identity mechanism with an e-authentication process. Third, to secure the privacy and security of data.There are five categories of data that may be disclosed under the new law: name, address, citizenship, sex and date of birth. All can be listed in the Aadhaar card as required. As per the existing law, this list can be kept secret and only the identity or the card holder may view this list, the new law only says that these details shall be available with a public authority. As already mentioned, it's permissible for the authority to disclose data which identifies the citizen on the basis of his/her consent or which is required by law, the new law does not require the consent of the individual.The Indian Citizenship Act, 1955, says that a person cannot get citizenship to be declared from an Aadhaar number. The Act also says, \"No person can be a naturalised citizen of India on application for naturalisation if he has been declared by the authority having the power to declare for this purpose under this Act as having obtained his naturalisation on the ground of being declared an Aaadhar numberholder by the UIDAI before the commencement of this Act.\" However, the new law does allow disclosure of the Aadhaar number in certain circumstances with the consent of the individual or where it is required without his/her consent.The new law has given the UIDAI powers to deny a passport to any person who does not have an Aadhaar card and a provision of a criminal punishment of a year imprisonment and a fine for knowingly creating a false or forged Aadhaar card. It has also made Aadhaar numbers confidential. The new law requires citizens to send the number to the UIDAI. But this is not a mandatory requirement. As also mentioned, the law does not require the consent of the individual, unless the authorities of a public authority are obliged to disclose such information to him/her.It has been reported in The Times of India that the new law states that, the government may request the UIDAI to issue a special category travel document called 'e-Passport' to a specified individual.The e-Passport may have two functions: 1. To facilitate identity authentication of someone travelling abroad 2. To facilitate identity verification of someone leaving India. The government wants the number in this document to determine the identity authentication of someone travelling abroad and the number in this document may be used in determining the identity of an individual leaving India.In the context of the current controversy over the privacy of data and how it can be used to harass a citizen, we do think that such a scheme would be a step forward to safeguard the privacy.",
      "The \"Big Three\" — NBC, CBS, and ABC — are losing the viewers they used to. For most of 2015, all three networks' average of 18-49 Nielsen ratings dropped from a year ago.\n\nIn the demo — the television rating that most advertisers seek most — CBS' \"Criminal Minds\" was down 12% from a year ago to a still-solid 2.2. The same was true for NBC's \"The Biggest Loser\" at a 16-point decline while ABC's \"Once Upon a Time,\" which had been beating CBS all season, plummeted 24%, to 2.9 (a full point behind \"Elementary\") in the demo, down from 3.6 a year ago.\n\nFor the year so far, the networks \"Criminal Minds\" dropped 24%, \"Once Upon a Time\" plunged 24%, and \"The Biggest Loser\" plunged 38%.\n\nThere have been other years with big drops. In 2011, \"Law & Order: SVU\" dipped 16% during its final year and in 2013 the season ended with a double-digit rating decline for NBC's \"Chicago Fire\" but otherwise kept the drop in the same size, as ABC's \"The Bachelor\" had suffered a similarly steep drop.\n\nIt might not be coincidence that the most recent big drops were also the lowest since a \"Mad Men\" surge.\n\nRelated TV Ratings: 'Criminal Minds', 'Supergirl' Dominate Summer Schedule\n\nWhat's going on? The ratings fell for several reasons and are generally a function of three factors: the economy (lower income levels means lower TV consumption), and, if you want to get technical, a downturn in the economy (faster economic growth means more goods and services to be sold at a lower price).\n\nFor CBS (which has been doing really well on shows like \"Madam Secretary\"), \"Criminal Minds\" simply gets worse as the economy goes south.\n\n\"When you see the economy fall that big, it's hard to maintain that level of ratings — especially for a show that has done so well,\" an exec said.\n\n\"Elementary,\" on the other hand, is more directly tied to the economy, with its fall from last season's 3.7 ratings on Monday nights is largely due to a shift to Fridays where the show airs.\n\nABC, meanwhile, had been growing with \"The Bachelor\" until a string of low ratings led to a shakeup a few months ago that brought in \"Last Man Standing\" star Josh Murray and the returning \"The Catch\" star Ashton Kutcher. With Murray, \"The Bachelor\" had a bigger fall in ratings than \"Criminal Minds,\" although the ratings are not quite comparable here. Kutcher was a bigger draw during most of last season, while Murray is not quite as big a hit.\n\n\"The Catch\" might be a bigger draw than Murray though, in part because he seems to get a lot of attention with his social activism.\n\nNBC, which usually has better numbers for its \"The Voice\" than \"Chicago Fire\" and \"Law & Order,\" had an even bigger drop in ratings.\n\nFor CBS, \"Criminal Minds\" has proven to be a good draw even as the network has added \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" and \"Hawaii Five-0\" (which was an unusual move for \"Criminal Minds\"), with the former being a hit with younger viewers, who tend to tune in late. At 8 p.m., \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" is still beating \"Criminal Minds\" on Sundays with young adults.\n\nFor a network that needs these shows to be hits, with its struggling drama \"Code Black\" and new comedies like \"The Millers,\" a drop in ratings is troubling.\n\nNBC is a few years ahead of CBS in broadcast television's ratings turnaround, and that may be the biggest factor behind its ratings slide. The fall of NBC with \"The Voice\" and \"Sunday Night Football\" has left it with fewer compelling programs to replace them. But with \"Sunday Night Football\" out of the picture, there is also less competition if a show falters.\n\n\"We're just in a place, where we don't have any big programs and we're trying to fill those voids,\" a exec said.\n\nThe second big factor in TV ratings is the fact that most advertisers don't really care how a show performs on its own if they want to buy a spot on the channel they air it on. While CBS could be selling as much ad time as it did last week (which was down a bit from Thursday night of a week ago), NBC would be selling about as many, if not more, spots for \"Chicago Fire\" or \"Parks and Recreation.\"\n\nIt might not be a problem for a show that is very popular, but it could help advertisers who can't sell very much because",

      "(Adds details, background)\n\nPARIS, July 5 (Reuters) - France's national rail carrier SNCF said on Friday it was working together with a U.S. railway company to use satellite navigation to better manage traffic congestion.\n\nThe SNCF's Paris-Gare du Nord and TGV French regional lines are among the last lines still on the main high-speed French rail network. The Paris-Orly-Belleville and TGV French regional lines are being modernised, in a cost-cutting move by French Railways (SNCF).\n\nThe SNCF said in a statement that the French consortium behind the project, based on GPS (Global Positioning System), would work with American subsidiary Aecom, which also owns navigation app Waze, to make the system operational nationwide.\n\n\"The system works by having vehicles at a specific location move along the designated track with the GPS signal generated by a nearby smartphone or tablet app,\" according to the statement.\n\nThe consortium includes U.S. technology companies Accenture, Motorola Solutions, Qualcomm Inc and Qualcomm's subsidiary Xircom, according to SNCF.\n\n\"This system is the first of its kind in the world, because it does not require any human monitoring,\" said Frederic Jouin, chief executive of Aecom, formerly a subsidiary of Aecom, which was taken over by Microsoft Corp in 2010.\n\n\"With this system, we are building a system where everyone will be able to use the same system and to share traffic information,\" Jouin was quoted as saying by the French railway company.\n\nIn 2007 Aecom installed a similar navigation system on the TGV French regional trains.\n\nThe Aecom-Microsoft system does not need any additional train services, other than adding a station at the end of the lines in Paris and Lyon and the relocation of the stops of existing cars.\n\nParis and Lyon were also upgraded with additional exits on the line to allow passengers to get from one to the other without entering the train.\n\nThe TGV is owned by SNCF, while the Orly-Belleville line is partly owned by SNCF.",
      "The following is a guest post by David Haines.\n\nThe recent announcement that the European Central Bank (ECB) will take steps to begin buying government bonds has the ability to affect your portfolio. It might not.\n\nYou can't buy government stocks, bonds, or ETFs for the simple reason that the Fed buys them.\n\nThis is not an issue that will affect most investors – for example, if you hold a 500,000-share fund (like a T. Rowe Price) that pays dividend of 10%, you'll be fine; a much smaller fund (like Vanguard's index) may pay dividend of 0%. But you might find the prospect of owning government bonds more attractive given your tolerance for risk and appreciation.\n\nThis is something to keep in mind if, like us, you've invested in stocks and bonds as part of your portfolio, and your allocation to risk-adjusted return investments (like stocks and ETFs) in your overall portfolio (and in every part of your portfolio) has been roughly the same for years.\n\nIf you've been doing this for a while, there is a much greater chance that your market allocations remain the same as they have been for years. We'll be discussing this in more detail in our upcoming post on portfolio construction; for now you'll need to know that the probability that your investments and portfolios remain fixed in your long-term allocation can't be greater than 1-in-20,000.\n\nHowever, there are potential ways in which buying government bonds could affect your equity portfolio.\n\nConsider what happens if and when the ECB announces that it's going to begin purchasing government bonds.\n\nFirst of all: who buys them? Are the bonds bought directly by the government, by bond-exchange brokers, or on secondary markets? Who else buys the debt? If buying the debt is a state-owned enterprise, like state-owned banks, state-owned enterprises (the so-called BRICS, which also include Russia), or state-owned insurance companies, then that raises questions for our next point. These state-owned enterprises could buy the bonds in a bid to protect their own creditworthiness, but that raises questions as well. It's hard to know for sure from the initial announcement, but buying debt directly by the government might raise a red flag for investors, just another potential risk in the world in which we live.\n\nSecond: Do the interest rates on these securities match the interest rates on the benchmark (US Treasury bonds)? If not, the purchase of the debt reduces the value of your bonds relative to the benchmark, meaning that the yield on your bonds goes down. If the yields on bonds are the same, then your risk adjusts downward as the price of your bond goes up.\n\nThird: What if interest rates come down? Suppose bonds with the same yield get cheaper? Does that raise the risk/reward ratio?\n\nNow there's a lot of information that goes into deciding what to do with a purchase of government bonds, so let's step back from this for a minute and discuss what the ECB is saying. This is all in a sense technical, but it's important to understand and discuss what the ECB is doing. The ECB is saying that it's concerned about \"financial stability.\" (Remember, there are some who doubt whether financial stability is under assault, and if they can't explain this they aren't paying attention.) This doesn't guarantee that the ECB is the right institution to make such a decision, or if it does decide to purchase government bonds it will decide the proper way to do so. I could get into this all day, but that's outside the scope of this post. In the next installment, we'll look at the specific questions posed by the ECB – what kind of financial stability risk are investors supposed to be taking into account when setting up their portfolios?\n\nFor now, here are two ideas of what might be possible, based on what we know thus far:\n\nYou can hold government bonds that are linked to the yield on the benchmark. This seems the most simple and effective way to do it, as bonds on the benchmark are subject to the same interest rate, so a bond that is linked to the benchmark will typically earn the same interest rate. For example, if you hold one company's bond and one company's bond is linked to the yield on the benchmark, you're essentially holding a bond that pays you 2.5 times the yield. If your investment is in an index fund that tracks the benchmark, you're able to keep the 2.5 times the yield and the 2.5 times your investment. In this scenario, you get a 20% discount on the original investment amount relative to a market index fund, while the index fund comes out ahead. This may not be a very attractive proposition in the short term, but in the long term it can produce good returns. You can hold government bonds that are directly linked to the yield on the benchmark. Here, you don't own any",

But after falling to USC, they slipped to No. 5 and will play in the Foster Farms Bowl.\n\n\"We're going to go down [to California] and put together the best team I've ever been around,\" coach Mark Helfrich said.

The Irish also could finish 2-10 if it plays the other conference champion at Minnesota, which happens to play Penn State.\n\n\"We were really going to do our best to get to 9-4,\" Helfrich said. \"And if we're in there, that's awesome.

      "The World Food Prize has announced the winners of its 2015 World Food Prize at a ceremony today in Italy. The World Food Prize is the grand prize awarded annually to the person or organisation that best represents the \"understanding, dedication and creativity of a person or organisation for the creation, protection and/or enhancement of the Right to Food\".\n\nThe winner in today's final was a long-term collaboration between the Australian government (FSAWA) and the World Food Prize Foundation, which has a goal of improving world nutrition and reversing obesity through the promotion of international sustainable policies – including a World Food Prize.\n\nIn 2014, the Australian government launched a new Sustainable Agriculture Strategy (SAS) in support of its Sustainable Growth agenda.\n\nAmong Australia's achievements is the establishment of the Australia New Zealand Foundation. The Foundation was responsible for the initial work in identifying policy issues, which was then supported by the Australian New Zealand Agricultural and Livestock Research Organisation (ANZA). The foundation is now responsible for the overall management of the Australia New Zealand Foundation.\n\nIn 2015, the Foundation was responsible for a significant amount of work within the World Food Prize partnership.\n\nThe foundation is responsible for the development of Australia New Zealand – a bi-lateral partnership between Australia and New Zealand to advance research into agriculture, biodiversity and climate change, which is conducted through the Australian Department of Agriculture's National Innovation and Science Academy (NATSA). The first phase of the Australia New Zealand partnership included the launch of Australia New Zealand's Bioblitz programme with the aim of creating new knowledge and opportunities for New Zealand to enhance its exports.\n\nAnother major initiative was an intensive two-year programme that focused on identifying and addressing new solutions to help New Zealand reduce its dependence on food imports. The program also involved the Australia New Zealand Foundation as a lead partner to address the challenges that New Zealand faces in securing international food trade at acceptable margins.\n\nThis is the second time that Canada has won the World Food Prize.\n\nThe World Food Prize was established to mark the anniversary of the right of nations to develop, own and sell their own products.\n\nThe World Food Prize is an international prize funded by the Rockefeller Foundation for the promotion of international sustainable food policy.\n\nThe 2015 World Food Prize winner will be announced in Rome on 11 November.",
      "The first person to be diagnosed with leukaemia with no existing cancer was the daughter of a man from the Bronx. The girl's mother died of the disease in 2000, but before she died, she made sure her daughter got an education and worked to improve the quality of her life, her mother told the New York Times.\n\n\nOn May 3, a team from the National Institute of Health and the National Cancer Institute announced that a child and a young adult have been \"missed by medical science.\" That's right, they got cancer, and their parents never knew it.\n\n\nThe child and young adult were from the Bronx, but their parents are not from that part of the state, and the cancer came from outside Europe. The young woman, who has not been publicly identified, had been in the United States in her teens, but had not graduated from high school.\n\n\nThe new diagnosis is a big deal not just for the child's family, but for the entire country. In the U.S., as in most industrialized countries, there are far more young adults with the disease and far more parents with them.\n\n\nAccording to an estimated 25 million to 40 million Americans with cancer now, there is a 30 to 50 percent chance of developing it early in life if a parent has the disease.\n\n\nAccording to a study, published May 18 in PLOS Oncology, there are more than twice as many parents with a family member (i.e., sibling or cousin) with lung cancer. The study estimated that 5.5 million parents of children who develop the illness, or about 22 percent of cancer-affected parents, will pass the disease onto their children.\n\n\nOther new research indicates that there is far more cancer-risk in the developing world as compared to the industrialized world, because the disease is often passed from mother to child, especially if the mother's immune system has weakened from years of smoking or from chemotherapy or radiation.\n\n\nFor many years, there was little knowledge about the risks of leukaemia in children born to women who had other health problems, like cancer, multiple sclerosis, or AIDS. In the early 1900s, leukaemia was thought to be rare among humans.\n\n\nBut when it was noted that leukaemia and other childhood health problems were far more common in children of women with any of those health problems (even if they were not dying of the disease themselves), experts in health education began to educate parents about the risks to their children.\n\n\nThat was when the Leukaemia and Chromosome 14 Project was established, under the auspices of the American Association of Blood Banks. In 1982, the researchers identified leukaemia in 10,000 people born under the age of 3 and in 1,500 people born under the age of 5. By 1994, there had been nearly 1 million cases. They reported in their journal that leukaemia usually occurs in children because \"a genetic predisposition, such as a high leukocyte count, may predispose a young person to develop the syndrome.\"\n\n\nBy the time the first child was diagnosed in the U.S. in 2000, the number of cases, particularly in children, had more than doubled in 14 years, and by 2011, they had reached 40,000 cases. \"We knew there have been cases [of leukaemia] before in the U.S., but nothing was known about the frequency of it,\" Dr. David Himmelstein, co-director of the National Cancer Institute, told BBC News. \"So we really wanted to address that, but we didn't have the data or the resources.\"\n\n\nThis child's parents should know about the risks, he said.\n\n\n\"You wouldn't want your child to inherit a disease such as this when they're 18 years of age,\" he said.\n\n\nSo Himmelstein's team and two other groups from cancer centers and public health departments collected data from a total of 13 children who were born between 1994 and 2005. The study included information on the family history for five types of cancer, as well as information on more than 10,000 blood groups. It includes only cases where the cancer was confirmed by medical records, rather than by an autopsy, because family medical histories are far less complete.\n\n\nThe research suggests, Himmelstein said, \"our society has not done a good job of making sure people are informed and educated about the risks that their families have.\"\n\n\nThe children were from four different ethnic groups (European, African-American, Hispanic/Latino, and Asian) and four countries (Belarus, Sweden, Russia, and Israel). They ranged in age from 7 to 36, with an average of 4.5 years. Their average age at entry into the study ranged from 21 to 35.\n\n\nThe disease was first diagnosed with four women, ages 21 to 33, a few months apart. The disease was first found in each of them within five months. For three of the women, the cancer",

      "LONG BEACH (CBSLA.com) — Long Beach's health officer said Tuesday that the city is considering new measures to combat homelessness, including the construction of a homeless shelter.\n\nAccording to Linda Evans, the manager of Long Beach's Office on Addiction & Recovery, her office will soon offer a feasibility study to determine how Long Beach could construct a shelter within its borders.\n\n\"We believe it has a large population of people who have found themselves homeless and there's an infrastructure that already exists that will help us with the housing portion as well,\" she said.\n\nEvans said that one major factor in the shelter issue is the availability of affordable housing.\n\n\"Most of the low-income neighborhoods in Long Beach have extremely expensive real estate,\" she said.\n\nEvans said she believes that the Long Beach Police Department will be supportive of a shelter.\n\n\"The majority of the city's police officers have been assigned to the city's Downtown and North Beach district. As far as we know now there isn't anything preventing them from going to one of our homeless shelters,\" she added.\n\nLong Beach city councilman Paul Koretz is concerned about potential safety risks for his constituents.\n\n\"We have a lot of people living on the street, sometimes we have people sitting in the shadows of buildings, sometimes we have people who are armed with guns,\" he said.\n\nEvans said that Long Beach police would have the authority to go onto private property to remove people from public areas.\n\nShe said Long Beach police could patrol along a stretch of Lincoln Avenue if the city decided to implement similar policies in other parts of town.\n\nAnother study would be done to examine how a homeless shelter could help local hospitals by providing housing, medical care and transportation to treatment centers.\n\nEvans said more homeless services could be provided through the Homeless Emergency Shelter and Housing and to identify community services that are in need.\n\nAccording to Evans, the next step would be to look at creating \"boutique\" shelters. This would involve the creation of individual housing units, where no one is housed in a \"shared\" or mass unit of three or four rooms.\n\n\"This is the type of apartment where they are all individually designed by the individual,\" Evans said.\n\n\"That way the individual is able to choose what is important to him and what he is comfortable in,\" she added.\n\nEvans said she doesn't feel the city council or city employees are necessarily aware of the growing homeless issue in the county. Evans said that her office had to rely on information from private citizens to keep up with the issue of homelessness.\n\nShe encouraged her constituents to contact the city's Office on Addiction & Recovery at (562) 567-5730 if they have any information that helps solve the problem of homelessness.",
      "In the last two decades, as the United States has expanded the number of Americans who are on government assistance programs, the cost of providing those programs has skyrocketed, according to a report by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities released Monday.\n\nCBO on Monday said that the amount for which federal, state and local governments spend on food stamps, Medicaid, housing assistance and similar programs has increased at a rate of more than 30 percent since the mid-1980s.\n\nThe CBO identified that the government spent $69,000 per person in 1980, and $90,000 per person in 2013. By 2014, that amount had risen to $98,000 per person.\n\nThe report found that the overall cost of providing assistance for food, housing, unemployment, and other assistance have risen \"at a faster rate than their nominal GDP growth over the same stretch.\" The amount spent on food stamps has increased by 40 percent, and housing assistance has risen by 66 percent.\n\nThe spending on welfare, by contrast, was higher at the same time that the economy was growing faster than government had predicted.\n\nRelated: A 'War on Black Farmers\n\nBut the CBO cautioned against drawing too many conclusions about the effects of government assistance programs on the overall economy.\n\n\"All of government assistance programs have a certain cost to taxpayers,\" the CBO said in the report. \"The question is what that cost is.\"\n\nAnd the total impact on overall economic growth of spending on welfare and other assistance programs \"should be understood in the context of the economic growth rates to which government aid is supposed to be a contribution,\" the CBO added.\n\nThat doesn't mean the federal government should stop paying for those programs at all costs.\n\n\"It is important to recognize that a greater government role in helping struggling Americans improve their lives in tough economic times is an investment that we taxpayers will likely recoup,\" the CBO concluded.\n\nRelated: How Congress can avoid a 'fiscal cliff'\n\n\"The CBO analysis of federal spending and revenue supports the view that government spending on many important social welfare programs remains appropriate at a time of broad federal spending reductions,\" the report noted. \"That said, federal government revenue increases from tax cuts will be somewhat smaller relative to tax decreases in both nominal dollars and percentage terms than during the 1980s-90s decades.\"\n\nBut the CBO noted that there has been a slight decline in overall tax receipts since 2011, and that federal debt interest increased significantly. And that \"relative to the amount of tax revenue raised during that earlier time period,\" borrowing at that rate continues to place a burden on future Americans, especially \"young people and less-educated households.\"\n\nThe report said \"the federal government is also responsible for providing a big share of the annual financial support to low- and moderate-income households through refundable tax credits and income support programs like Medicaid, the earned income tax credit and food stamps that do not have to be paid for.\"",
      "LAS VEGAS — The NBA is not happy with the Las Vegas Summer League.\n\nA source said Thursday that NBA Commissioner Adam Silver \"doesn't like how this summer league was conducted,\" particularly by the league's competition committee, in a report obtained by The Associated Press.\n\nSilver said at the outset of Summer league: \"I want the owners and basketball people to enjoy this experience and I want the players to have an outstanding summer league.\"\n\nThis is important because NBA Summer League is one of the most important opportunities for players to show off their wares, learn the game and maybe even get the league to try a couple of its new contracts.\n\nNBA teams have until July 7 to submit their final rosters and so far it's a big list: The Los Angeles Lakers, Portland Trail Blazers, Cleveland Cavaliers, Atlanta Hawks, Philadelphia 76ers, Orlando Magic, Chicago Bulls, Dallas Mavericks, Houston Rockets, Portland Trailblazers, Toronto Raptors and Utah Jazz have submitted their rosters.\n\nIt's a list that's a huge departure from last summer, when only seven teams sent their entire roster. The Celtics, New York Knicks and Orlando Magic didn't announce their rosters until July 5.\n\nThe NBA Summer League, from July 10-16, is the precursor to the regular season, which begins in earnest on August. 8.\n\nSilver had promised that \"in line with what we've done in the past,\" he will monitor the Las Vegas Summer League.\n\nIn fact, he has been trying to figure out how to fix the problems.\n\n\"We don't want to embarrass ourselves in front of all the owners. This has been a very important summer league for the players, our league and for all the fans,\" the commissioner said in January, in a statement emailed to media and obtained by Yahoo Sports. \"It's been conducted very efficiently and professionally by the competition committee and I wish them the best in this year's events.\"\n\nSummer league is always a problem for NBA owners. This past summer in Los Angeles, ownership and the league office wanted the Summer League to run like the NBA draft — a 24-hour-a-day blitz of pick-and-roll action — and the league office and several owners and front-office team owners wanted the league to run like the NBA pre-season. That's a tough line.\n\nWhile the players get to show off their skills and learn the game, the league owners get to meet NBA front-office and management figures. The owners can use this to gather information about potential franchise-altering deals for the future and even find out which players they really like and which they dislike before the season begins.\n\nOn top of that, summer league is usually very lucrative for the league owners but it is also very unpredictable. Most of the time, owners get no compensation. And because there are so few games, owners always wait until the season begins to hire executives and owners who can actually help them make the trade-deadline decisions that are so important. And once the season begins, they can often have the best information possible about which players are good or not for them. But there are still too many nights when owners can be blindsided by their top pick getting hurt during the season.\n\nThe NBA is so close to being perfect at summer leagues that it is almost a wonder that things didn't go better last year. There was the controversial \"one-and-done\" rule instituted earlier in the season that left many top prospects on the sidelines. There was the league's general messiness when it came to hiring and firing executives. And, there is the fact that there are no NBA teams involved in Vegas next year.\n\nThe Golden State Warriors, however, are involved, and owner Joe Lacob said on ESPN's \"First Take\" show that the team will send at least one player to Vegas.\n\nThe NBA is also unhappy because of a report that league owners will vote next week to make changes to the league's draft system — potentially moving the lottery from May through June back to the end of June — after the 2015 draft.\n\nThe new rules would increase the odds for the league's worst teams to draft and develop players. It would also lengthen the lottery period from eight to 12 weeks (from now until May) while increasing the chances that the lottery teams, with the worst records, would be lottery teams again from 2017 until then.\n\nThe NBA has said it likes the system because it gives it greater flexibility and also keeps its best teams competitive during the regular season.\n\nLast summer's lottery was so lopsided that it will take the top three seeds in the lottery — which are the Los Angeles Clippers, Utah Jazz and Portland Trail Blazers — until at least November 15 to find the top two picks. Last year's draft was the first since the lottery was moved back to the end of June.\n\nThis year's lottery is being conducted for the first time under new rules. The new rules give",
      "The Obama administration is pushing state and local law enforcement to investigate people who post videos of police violence, according to a federal law enforcement official.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, signed by President Barack Obama on New Year's Day, authorizes some funding for military training at U.S. state facilities, as well as funds for military-style weapons from state departments of correction.\n\n\"The feds will be providing that training with state and local law enforcement, and it will be to help law enforcement respond to potentially dangerous situations,\" a second law enforcement official told The Daily Caller, referring to the NDAA law.\n\nThe official added that the training isn't directed specifically at police officers, though they may be trained to \"use these (unmanned systems) in a lawful manner,\" as The Hill reported.\n\nIn addition to training at state facilities, an unnamed Justice Department official told The Wall Street Journal in December that U.S. Law Enforcement Training Centers could also be involved in training.\n\nThis would be the first time the Pentagon is directly training state and local law enforcement agencies for use of unarmed drones. The NDAA also includes $25 million to help states buy the weapons, though the White House's Office of Management and Budget has yet to announce an official request for the money.\n\nThe training won't include any guidance on how to maintain the drones as they fly low over the public or fly into private property.\n\nThe new law isn't new, but its passage is significant in light of two high-profile police shootings last year that were recorded by police drones.\n\nThe first, in August, was the killing of teenager Michael Brown in suburban Ferguson, Mo., which had been heavily policed. The federal government spent $22 million to put 250 cops on the ground in the area.\n\nThe FBI's drone-hunting planes also came up empty in their mission to track down Brown's killer, Michael Brown's friend Dorian Johnson, though they can't yet help state and local authorities find Johnson.\n\nThe second drone-related death was in California recently.

      "The city of Los Angeles (CA) is going into overdrive to clean up the toxic, cancer-causing dust found on its citizens. City Hall is proposing an ordinance that would require landlords to test their tenants' homes for asbestos, paint peeling, mold, lead and water damage within 24 hours of tenant move-in.\n\nThe proposed city ordinance requires landlords to test rental apartment occupants for asbestos in their residences by an approved, government certified testing company, which must provide a written report back within 72 hours. The tenant would also be required to take a sample of the landlord's dust/substance for submission to a regional government health agency which would determine if the tenant's test results indicated asbestos, paint peeling and any other contaminants present. If the tenant test results indicate the presence of hazardous substances, the tenant would be required to comply with the health department's recommendations.\n\nIn addition to providing tenants with a simple method to detect the presence of airborne asbestos, health concerns associated with the dust also include lead poisoning, asthma attacks and even cancer.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Los Angeles Air Pollution Control District (LAAPCD), the non-profit which oversees asbestos testing for Los Angeles residents, has been caught in numerous illegal, unethical practices in the past five years. In January of last year, the LAAPCD released a study that estimated a whopping 2 million Californians could suffer from asbestos-related health problems, while also claiming that just 100 people were dying from the potential health hazards posed by the mineral.\n\nThis latest move to implement a mandatory asbestos testing requirement for landlords is only the latest in a long line of moves to penalize landlords who are found negligent of building safety issues. In 2006, then-Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa signed into law an ordinance making city inspections mandatory on major structural and fire safety violations.\n\nIn 2011, former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger signed into law an ordinance requiring rental units under construction in Los Angeles County to have a valid Building Code inspection and mandatory asbestos testing at the time all units are constructed. In 2012, then-Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law an ordinance which called for a statewide registry of all defective commercial construction permits.\n\nThis latest effort comes as the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a report identifying the greatest threat to the people in the Los Angeles Bay Area is air pollution caused by illegal and unregulated construction activity. The \"Unregulated Pollutant Standards\" report, a draft copy of which was provided to Breitbart News last month, found that the average American can breathe in some 14 pounds of air pollutants each week, most of which come from unregulated burning of wood waste.\n\nBreitbart News recently published an analysis of the \"California's Leading Cause of Death\" which revealed that Los Angeles County was experiencing a spike in lung cancer mortality, with cancer rates of more than 1 in 9 people living in the area now suffering from lung cancer, compared to just 1 person dying from lung cancer annually in 2012.\n\nIn its report, the EPA noted that nearly 1 in 6 cancer deaths in California are due to fine particulate matter which comes from illegal burning of wood waste on illegal and unregulated construction sites.\n\nBreitbart News previously reported in February that the California legislature, in conjunction with the EPA, is pushing a bill known as California Climate Security Act, which seeks to make California's climate policies more stringent by creating statewide caps on greenhouse gas emissions, requiring the government to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 20 percent, and mandating that California's economy emit zero carbon dioxide emissions by 2050.\n\nCalifornia will also have to reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 65 percent in order to stay within the federal carbon mitigation plan, with these measures likely to make it far more expensive for individuals to do business in the state.\n\nCalifornia has been called the \"California Silicon Valley\" due to its booming tech sector, where more than 90 percent of all publicly traded companies are based. As California's economy continues to grow, its residents face a slew of health complications, some of which have already become severe.",
      "I know this has to be weird to you guys, but I want to tell you a little bit about myself. I am a single mother of two who worked as a waitress in an office full time in her youth. As a college student, she went to work as a bartender. After a few years she got into retail, which is probably why I was lucky enough to have her as a boss back in my first few weeks in this company. I have grown in every sense of the word since I started at the factory. I have improved my English. I have learned what it means to be proud of myself. I have developed a greater desire to be successful in life than ever before. I am a professional, and I have always striven to be one. In fact, I consider every single day of my life my best opportunity to try and win something in life.\n\nHowever, over the past few months my luck turned. I was laid off at the restaurant that started it all. They decided right before my next paychecks that they were not happy with my performance and needed to make some changes. I was shocked and confused, thinking that they decided to make me out to be the bad guy for the past couple of years, which is the opposite of how things usually work at these jobs. However, I figured that I should just work extra hours than normal or something like that. This was the situation that I found myself in when I began working at this factory in August.\n\nAbout a month prior to me getting laid off, a friend of my father worked there. They had a lot of problems at this time and I decided that I should try to get a job there if I could. I ended up working there for a while before I was laid off. During that time my boss was my sister's boss. As you can imagine she became obsessed a little bit with me and wanted me to do some work for her. She was going on and on about how great I was working. She wanted to make sure that I knew what it meant to be in this position. However, she would never show me the paychecks or tell me how much of my salary went to my sister. She would only give me little notes, in which she would tell me that she liked the way my voice sounded or that she was worried that I could be considered good looking by customers. I would laugh off these statements. I was sure that my work was excellent and that in no way would I be considered attractive by customers. In time she became a manager herself there, and she was just as obsessive as she had been with me. She made many statements about how great it was about being a manager and how great I was doing work. She even bought herself a bunch of clothes and clothes for me to wear. It was clear that for her job, being a manager, I was not to be a part of it.\n\nIt was also clear that as the factory grew she had become more and more powerful. She knew that I was worried about getting laid off at some point and told me that I should just stay calm and wait until my paycheck came into the account and then that it would be okay. It was also clear that at the time she was not really taking care of my well-being at the job, and as a result my mood would take a serious turn. In my case, I was being treated very poorly. I know that I don't really have a lot to complain about, but it's always best that you know why you would have a problem. I didn't understand why she was always obsessed with me, but I am sure that she did not appreciate my being upset.\n\nAfter I was laid off there, my sister told me that I should talk to people who were being laid off, and told me that I should just sit in the company meeting and listen to them, or just write a letter about why they got laid off. She showed me exactly what she wanted me to write, which was nothing but how I got laid off. I was shocked. She was making sure that the people who she had been putting in her management position would know to how she felt about me. At first she just wanted to know if I was going to be okay and I would tell her that I was fine. However, she was becoming increasingly impatient with me. I am still pretty young and inexperienced in this, so I was a little confused about what was going on. I started to think about how bad it was for me to have her there every single time she was concerned about me getting laid off. I had actually become a target for her anger to a degree where I had to watch out for it because she was becoming incredibly angry that I was even thinking about getting laid off. When I was talking to the management team every day and they were all like family to me, I was worried that this place was becoming more and more hostile toward me and that they were all more and more annoyed that I was getting in their way. I wanted to",
      "This post is also shared on Medium and Digg\nI have had a fascination with all things Russian since I was a small child. One of the first things that caught my attention was the way they handle themselves and the way they have a sense of dignity and self-respect that sets them apart from the rest of the world. I often found myself comparing them to the way my parents and grandparents acted. I wanted to know what it would be like growing up in Russia and meeting a Russian and their way of doing things.\n\nThis was the motivation for this post. I have traveled around the world and met many people and the thing that interests me the most is getting to know the other people. I wanted to ask you: what is it about the people in Russia that makes them so fascinating? What is it about their ways of conducting their daily lives that sets them apart, makes them different and intriguing?\n\nSo, in an attempt to answer that question, I conducted a small web survey using Mechanical Turk. I put a simple message at the beginning of the survey that read \"How interesting was it to you that Russia is surrounded by a multitude of cultures? Did we (Russia) make us interesting?\" Then I asked you to respond. I have collected a lot of very interesting responses so I hope you will find them interesting. You will notice that this survey is in no way an objective account of the people of Russia. There is obviously more to Russia than Russian culture\n\nThe survey consists of 60 questions about the culture in Russia. The last question asks you to list the countries you have traveled to in the past year.\n\nPlease use the links below to access both the English and Russian surveys. The survey is not anonymous. Clicking on the link will launch either the English or Russian survey.\n\nIf anyone has any thoughts about these survey, I would really appreciate they can leave them in the comments below.\n\nAlso I would very much like to get some feedback and see what people think about the way I conducted these surveys, so please leave comments below as well.\n\nIn any case please let me know what you think. Thanks for taking the time to read this and I hope you find some fascinating insights!\n\nIf there are any questions feel free to leave the survey and I will answer.",

      "By The Metric Maven\n\nBulldog Edition\n\nMany people who have been studying geometry or linear algebra and working in physics for a while now have learned that:\n\n(1) a cube is a four-sided polygon with four vertices, or\n\n(2) a cube has sides length equal to its width, or\n\n(3) a cube has sides of length 2x2 = 4, or\n\nThere are many more but these three were more commonly taught. All these examples are equivalent to \"a 3D cube\". However, these three examples are completely incorrect — an even 3D cube is not a cube in this perspective.\n\nIt actually turns out that there is some mathematical way to think of all these geometric shapes that have sides. This idea was developed when the idea of a cube was introduced. One way to think of all these shapes is to consider them as a collection of linear segments (called axes), also called \"planes\". A linear segment is just a mathematical object that can be represented with two points:\n\nIn fact, the three examples from the previous paragraphs are equivalent to a 3D cube that is a 3D vector space in the space of 2D vectors. Here is what an even 3D cube looks like (with side lengths of 2):\n\nHowever, it turns out that this 2D perspective is completely incorrect. It turns out that a quadrilateral or even 3D cube are not even 2D shapes — there is another perspective that is the opposite of the standard 2D perspective. This perspective is called the \"3D view\". Here is an illustration of how to translate this 3D view onto standard perspective (the right way):\n\nAs an appendix I have written an introductory course for this perspective, titled \"Three Dimensions.\" I recommend that anyone reading this article consult this course before they use or discuss the other methods discussed in this article. For a more detailed discussion of this perspective, consult the article, \"A Perspective.\"\n\nThe point is that these new perspectives actually replace the standard 2D perspective we are familiar with. This should make our lives easier in a number of ways:\n\nFor the 2D perspective the shape of a cube is well illustrated.\n\nFor the 3D perspective, we have a set of shapes to describe.\n\nWhen using the 3D perspective, we have a very natural way to think of all the shapes.\n\n(1) (2) (3)\n\nAll three of the above examples are erroneous and therefore all four should be revised to reflect the 3D perspective. Of course, the standard perspective on the 2D plane always exists. In fact, there is some interesting mathematics that goes with taking the perspective in (1) (2) (3). To see some examples, consider the first four steps to translating (1) (2) (3) to the 3D view:\n\n(4) (5)\n\nThe two images from (4) and (5) are equivalent to the other two.\n\nThe 3D view provides a beautiful way to think of these geometric examples. It gives both an intuitive explanation of the shapes and the mathematical representation of them.\n\nIf you want to take this perspective further, you can read an excellent book called The Three-Dimensional Society by David H. MacFarlane. MacFarlane argues for a revolution in mathematical thought; if you are interested in learning more about how to think about three dimensions, I highly recommend you read this book, if only as a curiosity. The 3D view is an extremely beautiful new perspective that is useful for geometry and mathematics. It is not, however, a revolution, and does not change how you think of any things, including how to read and understand geometry.\n\n© 2005-2009, Mark J. Friedl",

      "\"I'm sorry, I'm afraid I don't even know where this is.\"\n\nIn any situation, it's easy to get lost. We become so caught up in the task of doing or thinking it that we forget where we're going and end up lost.\n\nThat's exactly what happened for John Smith and his fellow members of the US National Guard while in Afghanistan.\n\nJohn was shot in the leg during an enemy firefight two years ago and had to be flown to a US medical facility in Kuwait. He was told that he would soon be transferred to Walter Reed Army Medical Center (WRAAMC). At that point, he was told that the US is currently in 'contingency planning' mode — and this was a euphemism for 'war game.'\n\nIt is very common for soldiers and Marines to play 'war games' for an increased sense of adrenaline on the battlefield. But the situation changed when they were told that the US is currently in 'crisis' mode.\n\nAt WRAAMC, they could not even get permission to go outside or call out for family members. They had to remain indoors and use their phones to contact their home base, which was just as confusing.\n\nEventually they found out that they were just hours from the US/NATO combat operations in their hometown of Kandahar.\n\nA member of the Guard, known as 'Sponge,' described the surreal nature of their 'crisis' situation:\n\n\"Imagine you're trying to get directions from your local Walmart to the military command to send your unit, but they're not even allowed to let you out of the building. There's no one on every street, no one in sight. We just drove around in circles in circles and had nowhere to go as the sky got lighter and lighter.\"\n\nWhen you're the most important man in the world and you're missing the military, you start to question, \"What is even going on?\"\n\nThey tried calling home to see if any family was holding on to their loved ones, but their cell signal was just as spotty as their GPS location.\n\nThey were told that their situation was akin to a 'War of Northern Retreat.' It seemed that someone or something they had absolutely no knowledge of had caused the chaos that the US Army is now experiencing as they attempt to bring 'security' to a country that no longer wants to be a part of the war and has no need for it.\n\nIt seems that the United States is having to resort to some new, innovative combat methods to keep their troops 'safe.'\n\nThis is obviously a scary time for the US, but I have a feeling that it's really not that bad. The military has always been the 'cool' family in our society, and so they should always have a positive outlook on the situation.\n\nI mean, you can just see these troops being in the middle of the action. All they know is that they have to fight. They're not even allowed to play video games, or use personal devices. They basically don't even know where they're at, or what they're doing.\n\nThe funny part is that when I first read about the situation, I was more concerned that the troops might not be allowed to call for their families or see a doctor.\n\nIt's not that I have a problem with the use of technology, but, you know, it seems like an overreaction. If it's going to affect these soldiers on the ground, then maybe those same soldiers should be given the ability to do some extra things in the meantime. That's the last thing I would want to see.\n\nSource: www.activistpost.com\n\nHelp Us Be The Change We Wish To See In The World.",

      "I have used three methods to clean the paint during the repair on my new 2006 Subaru WRX,\n\na\n\nwater based clear coat\n\nan\n\noiled sealer\n\n, and a\n\nmild abrasive\n\ndampener\n\n.\n\nI have had zero issues with water based and very few problems with the abrasive. I am just trying to get the car clean to have as smooth of a ride as possible. None of the methods are perfect but all three have worked successfully. I have also taken the time to clean the car's interior, including the seats, and interior trim. I have cleaned underneath the trunk and trunk doors, as well as around the seat and door trim. After I finish the interior, I take the car out and use a towel to wash any brake dust or dirt off the steering wheel. This helps prevent a sticky mess and is a lot of fun to do. I also run the transmission (in neutral) and check how well it moves in the gears. Then I go through the car and re-clean any remaining dust that is left on the dash or seat. Once I am done with the car's interior, I put it all back where I found it.\n\n1.\n\nWater Based Clear Coat.\n\nThis did the trick. I cleaned the paint with it once, and it has not left a residue. This method of cleaning was the first choice by Subaru USA and I agree that it works better than the abrasive. I think any type of clear coat will work better for this and the vehicle won't get black from dust or dirt like the abrasive did. I found out that I use a small brush to buff the paint and not just my hands. This helps minimize any staining. This wash cleans the paint very well and does not require too much product if it is done correctly. It makes a much better surface for the clear coat to bond to than the abrasive wash. The biggest drawback of this method is that it is not always easy to get the right consistency of the wash. To wash this way you have to pour the wash in the can, turn the can upside down then shake it vigorously, using the water's spray pressure (it will splash). Sometimes, when I do this, the wash sticks a bit but other times it seems to be more effective, and does not stick so well.\n\n2.\n\nOiled\n\nsealer\n\nThis is a great clean and easy method. I have never found any residue from this wash, and although the product is water based, I would say it is a lot thinner than what you would get from a water based clear coat. I do not think it is as effective at removing dirt and dust as the water based clear coat.\n\n3.\n\nMild\n\nAdrenaline Dampener\n\nNot as effective as the first two methods. I have cleaned with these wash with and without at home and I have always found a residue. I use them to clean the windshield, sunvisors, door panels, glove box doors, and under the tailgate of a parked car. Even after a car wash, I find a residue from these and am not sure where it goes. I have not gone very extreme with these but I have not found them to be worth it.\n\nQuestions are welcome and will be answered.",

      "Bike-sharing companies such as Uber are taking a share of market share from local taxi companies, but according to New York state, they're not doing anything legally wrong.\n\nUber and Lyft — two high-profile companies that deliver the ride people have been waiting for — have long faced criticism for making their rides easier for the company, and in turn, taking market share from taxis. But according to a new New York taxi regulation, they're not causing any harm.\n\n\"From a New York City perspective, it makes no sense to crack down on something that hasn't harmed anybody,\" Uber spokesman Taylor Bennett told Business Insider. \"Even if a company is operating under bad labor practices, it doesn't harm anybody if an employee is doing the right thing by doing the minimum required time to get an approved application in order to get on the platform. It doesn't happen all the time, but in the world of regulations, not all regulations are created equal.\"\n\nBennett noted that many taxi companies in New York have taken to calling Uber drivers \"undercover\" drivers, and that Uber makes its background screening process harder to acquire — all to ensure that their drivers fit under the city's new \"transportation network company\" laws. Uber has also been subject to a series of negative media stories alleging that some of its drivers were involved in criminal activities when the company launched.\n\nBennett has a point, and the New York Taxi and Limousine Commission has long been criticized for cracking down harshly on the taxi industry's perceived opponents. In the late '90s, taxi regulators passed a law that gave themselves the power to seize any car used by a New York taxi company while it was using the transportation network company system, and put that car up for sale. As part of a \"safety\" loophole, the agency couldn't show any evidence of damage caused by \"illegal\" service.\n\nBut now, the department has clarified that only taxi-related businesses, such as cabs, cannot use the transportation network companies.\n\n\"The only company that can get a TNC license in New York City is a Taxi or Limousine Company,\" the TLC said in a statement emailed to Business Insider. \"If these companies are not providing transport service to, or at least don't use, vehicles belonging to licensed New York taxi companies, they cannot do so.\"\n\nA 2014 study by the Pew Research Center found that while taxi companies do not benefit from using TNC services such as Uber, the companies themselves do because Uber allows them to lower costs from their regular customers. The study also found that Uber's drivers are not actually making more money than drivers who own private cars, and that its drivers are generally not less safe than other taxi drivers.\n\nSince this decision was made, the Uber app has continued to expand across the United States. And in August 2015, the company opened its much-anticipated UberX service to the city.\n\nBut the TLC's recent ruling makes it all the more difficult for Uber's drivers — and it's why the company won't be providing any rides in New York City or operating in the city directly any time soon.\n\n\"No, sir, we're not going to be available in New York anytime soon,\" Bennett said. \"That's one of the ways that our customers and our drivers are able to make sure that their safety is not compromised.\"\n\nHere's the full text of the ruling from the NYCTAC:\n\n\nNew York State Department of Transportation.

      "The following article originally appeared and is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License.\n\nIf you've played a lot of video games, or maybe ever played one in your life, you're probably familiar with an element called \"game progression.\"\n\nThe idea of leveling is pretty simple: there are items you acquire (which you then use to progress) which you'll use as you see fit for the next dungeon you explore. Most games will automatically level up, as well. However, some games have a more active element to leveling. We recently talked with Michael Capps, a game producer, about the pros, cons, and philosophy that game developers have with leveling, and which games are best for this approach.\n\nOne of the big benefits of a game's progression, says Mike Capps, is that a player doesn't have to be worried about \"dumbing down their characters in order to keep pace with the ever-increasing power of their characters. Once their character level has gone through three and four levels, no one will remember what their character was at. Their character will be as impressive as they want it to be. The same goes for their weapons and items. You can keep up that progression in all your characters, regardless of their level.\"\n\nMichael says that another advantage of a progression system is that the game doesn't have to overdo it: if you're not being challenged on the first dungeon you'll have a challenge by the first next one. It just feels much better. A progression, on the other hand, doesn't \"feel as fun if everyone is having the same experience,\" says Michael.\n\nOne other benefit of a system is that it provides a feeling of \"continuous progression.\" \"That you're always progressing towards the end of the game,\" says Michael. That may be a bit subjective depending on who you talk to. If you're playing a game for the hardcore RPG fans, most people agree that a progression system is better, in the long run. On the other hand, if you're looking for a new game, you may wish for more frequent updates where the game does things faster, or even releases patches that alter the core gameplay in unexpected ways.\n\nMike doesn't give examples of games with a continuous progression system, because in his experience they've not been very popular: \"In my experiences, people don't like to progress in a way that makes them do things that may not feel comfortable to them. They don't like having the idea that, 'This happened to me, it's not my fault' … they don't want to experience that. So, most of the games I've been given have one very specific aspect.\"\n\nIf you want to stay in the fast lane, you can always take a look at other players' characters. In most games, there's a database of character progression, where everyone is looking up and cataloguing a list of things a given human has accomplished through each one of their characters. Even if you're not a role-playing type, it's usually wise to check out players' progress to stay up to speed.\n\nEven if you don't like playing a character that's progressing, \"it's always interesting to see what sort of things players have been able to accomplish,\" says Mike. \"It can give you a sense of what kind of things they might be able to tackle or improve.\"\n\nMichael also points out that some progression is not necessarily bad. \"A lot of time progression systems [where] you go to this specific dungeon, or you go, 'I'm going to go to where the boss is, but I have these items I have to gather' … those are all just fun and interesting ways to spend your time.\"\n\nOn the other hand sometimes a player will want a \"more direct experience\" than the \"slow, tedious\" progression systems. Instead, the slow, tedious kind might be best for that.\n\nWhen it comes to the real world, you might want a progression system where your character becomes stronger over time. In RPGs, the game itself has some sort of progression system. This might not be the case for the average human though, and if it is, how would Mike's examples in the \"In-Game Progress\" section translate into the real life?\n\nMichael says that it would depend on what the game has to offer. \"It's really a very personal thing,\" he says. \"I think if it's something that's something that makes you happy in some way, because of it being satisfying, that's something that we have to respect, but, if there's nothing really that's really engaging you, or you haven't really enjoyed the same content over and over again, that's where we have to give [the character] a rest.\"",
      "The number of women on corporate boards will nearly double by 2030, an industry group predicted Monday in a new report on women in the workplace. In the US, women account for 44.8 percent of CEOs and are represented in boards of directors at 27 percent of US companies, the report by the Catalyst Fund reported Monday in Business Insider.\n\nIn Europe, where the situation is more complicated, women comprise just 4 percent of board members, the report said.\n\nAccording to the report, women are still well behind their male peers when it comes to power, influence, and influence peddling. Female CEOs are more likely to speak out during work hours, make more personal phone calls during the course of their workday, and spend an additional 30 minutes at the office each day interacting with other staff, the report states.\n\n\"The female executive leadership role is the new battleground for our gender equity movement,\" said Lisa R. Eshoo, the top Democrat on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce, in the statement. \"By focusing on the leadership positions women hold in all organizations, we can work to address unconscious bias and the underlying cause of these patterns.\"\n\nWhile companies have been taking steps to increase diversity on their boards over the years, this is the first time the industry body Catalyst Research has released a report on the industry.",
      "Tobias Lindholm, the former Ducks captain, hasn't played a game since the opening round of the 2010 playoffs, a 4-1 Los Angeles loss that gave the Kings their first Stanley Cup championship in franchise history. The injury-ravaged Ducks missed the playoffs with a 51-23-10 record, but Lindholm is hoping to return by the 2012-13 season.\n\nAs of last week, that wasn't expected. In fact, Lindholm didn't want to.\n\n\"They were trying to push me to play, but obviously I didn't want to let them down,\" Lindholm told reporters. \"So I just sat back and took it easy. I wanted to get healthy. I wasn't even going to push it, so I just took it easy for a while.\"\n\nHis health was the furthest thing from the minds of fans and media at the time, a fact Lindholm didn't seem to appreciate.\n\n\"Every team knew that I had to stay healthy to help my team, and they told me to focus on myself and not worry about anything else,\" said Lindholm, now in his sixth NHL seasons. \"I don't understand that. I'm the captain of my team, and it's not really my job to worry about other outside aspects like that. It's definitely my job to get healthy, and they're trying to push me in this direction, which is a little different.\"\n\nIt didn't matter that Lindholm was healthy.\n\nDucks general manager Mike Neal told the Orange County Register's Sam Cosentino last month – before Lindholm suffered a fractured ankle in the first round of the playoffs and had been forced to skip the remainder of the regular season – that Lindholm would be playing in the 2011 postseason if the team went on to win the 2010 championship. But Lindholm declined that interview request, because he had to finish the season.\n\nIn the end, there was enough time for him to play the season out without any concern of being held back for the postseason. He was also motivated to finish the regular season healthy after missing the entire 2010-11 season while rehabbing Achilles tendinitis, an injury that left him sidelined for two months before he reaggravated the knee injury he suffered during the 2010 playoffs.\n\n\"The Achilles is like a broken leg,\" Lindholm told reporters. \"That's the most important part of the season. When you start missing games for an Achilles injury, you start missing training camp, you start missing exhibition games. If you start missing these types of games, you have no chance to come back if you have no work left to give to the team.\"\n\nLindholm still missed Anaheim's first two games of the 2011-12 season – a 3-2 loss to the Chicago Blackhawks on Oct. 1 and a 3-0 win over the San Jose Sharks on Oct. 3. Lindholm was in the lineup as a healthy scratch for each of those games and wasn't activated for Game 7 against the Edmonton Oilers. Though he was healthy enough to play in a 4-3 overtime win over the Chicago Blackhawks in Game 2 of the 2010 draft lottery that helped them secure the first pick in the lottery, Lindholm was benched for the final four games of the 2011 Stanley Cup playoffs.\n\nIn Lindholm's absence – an absence that saw him start just four of the first 13 games this regular season – Ryan Getzlaf, Corey Perry and Corey Crawford started in net to lead the Ducks to a 39-28-10 record. The team went 5-1-1 in those games, with Perry scoring four of those four goals.\n\nBy Christmas, Lindholm was healthy enough to return to the lineup.\n\nThe Ducks have been without Lindholm since April 15, and although he was on the ice in the preseason, he played on the third line with Bobby Ryan until the Ducks returned from the Olympic break. With his new role, the 37-year-old Swede felt like his game returned to \"full strength and health.\"\n\n\"That was great,\" Lindholm said. \"I was doing this pretty well before I got hurt in Game 7 against Chicago in the 2010 playoffs. And they are all fun games to play in the NHL. I think that's why [the injury] was just a setback for me. I was getting it going, so I thought that my game is coming back. It was a tough thing to get over, but I think I finally came back.\n\n\"I didn't play a lot of games, so it was hard to get over the first injury and then everything just kind of went in the wrong direction. It was probably five months for me, but my body feels great, and I think my game feels good. I think my skating and my game are pretty good.\"\n\nLindholm still played on the third line during the 2011-12 season, but the Ducks opted to start him on the second line instead of the seventh forward.

      "MOSCOW (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said he still hoped for an early end to the conflict in Ukraine even as Ukraine's acting president vowed to press on with the military operation that some countries in eastern Ukraine and elsewhere fear could lead to an all-out \"Russian war\".\n\nSpeaking to public broadcasters, Putin again called for the separatists in the country's eastern Donbass region and in Crimea to vacate those territories and withdraw their Ukrainian military contingents which \"have been transformed into troops of the Russian Federation\".\n\nHowever, Putin indicated Moscow would not use military force, saying: \"We do not have a plan to use military force against anyone. But we will see if all the signs are that this is how they are going to carry out this. That is entirely possible.\"\n\nThe situation on the ground has moved sharply in the last two days, with the deaths of five Ukrainian troops in an ambush in the east, followed by Ukraine launching an armed attack on a rebel training camp inside the town of Slovyansk. The rebels had earlier announced that they would turn themselves in.\n\nCrimea's pro-Russian leader Sergei Aksyonov told the Russian state channel Rossia-24 that Ukrainian troops had fired on Slovyansk and other Ukrainian enclaves, but he would keep \"calm and restraint\".\n\nHe said: \"Today we have to keep calm and restrain violence. If the gunmen don't understand that, they will be shot down. If this is what the people want, we will implement, we will not let down our guard.\"\n\nAksyonov said they did not have a deadline for surrender, but said he and another rebel leader had agreed a ceasefire \"within hours\" to let in humanitarian and medical aid.\n\nMoscow has strongly criticized the West for taking so long to respond to events in Ukraine, saying it does not want a war in which Russia would be heavily involved.\n\nBut Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told the Rossia 24 channel on Tuesday: \"In the current situation, if there is no international mediation this will only be a domestic crisis.\"\n\nPutin added: \"We must give up our illusions about a quick solution.\"\n\nHe again defended Russia's annexation of Crimea from Ukraine in March and said Russia's military presence in Crimea did not violate Ukrainian sovereignty.\n\n\"COULD HAPPEN\"\n\nAsked about the recent attacks on Ukrainian government troops, Putin said: \"What happened there is totally unimportant. There was no direct use of arms. No one was shot ... No one was injured. Those are facts. Let's wait for facts.\"\n\nAsked if he was worried about a military response, Putin said: \"Of course, we are worried that there could still be military conflict there. And that could happen.\"\n\nA meeting on the crisis between U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and Putin in Moscow was postponed due to the diplomatic tensions.\n\nU.N. spokeswoman Vassily Nebenzia said it was agreed that Ban would meet Putin over the weekend in New York and that \"both sides expressed a common interest in ensuring a peaceful solution to the conflict.\"\n\nThe Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman was quoted by the RIA news agency as saying that U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry had warned Russia that Washington was taking \"measures to maintain the viability of the political process\" in Ukraine.\n\nThe United States and some European countries have threatened sanctions against Moscow, though they have stopped short of banning exports that would effectively hit European businesses. They have been pressing for the release of captured pro-Russian activists rather than a full-scale invasion.\n\nWhile Putin says no Russian forces are fighting in eastern Ukraine, the rebels accuse the regular armed forces there of shooting down the two helicopters, a claim denied by Kiev and Moscow.\n\nPutin said that although his country had not sent troops to Ukrainian territory, it was concerned about the security of compatriots living in the east of the former Soviet Union country.\n\nA resident of Donetsk who gave only his first name, Igor, told Reuters: \"I can't see why they are attacking us. I think it is only us who do this. Russia would be against any foreign soldiers entering our country. If they want to attack us, they must attack the Russian army, not us.\"",

      "If you are running one of the more successful apps or games on Google Play, it is probable that all your information is being stored on a server in China. This data, including your app's metadata, search terms, your account ID and any data stored via your cloud account are encrypted and sent to a Chinese company called Tencent, which operates the company's games and entertainment business.\n\nThis information is sent to China and then to a third party for processing, as indicated through the Google Play privacy policy. The third party is Google Play Analytics.\n\nGoogle, which owns Google Play, owns Google Analytics.\n\nIt is important to know that using Google Analytics with any of your Google Apps or the Google Authenticator authentication system is not a good idea as the user's information is being passed to a foreign entity in China.\n\nGoogle has a policy of encrypting data passing through Google servers in the United States. The data being sent is encrypted. However, Google Analytics uses SSL encryption so it does not protect the data from hackers in the same way as a full SSL encrypted connection would.\n\nThis type of encryption is only available in the United States. To access this information using your U.S. Google Account would require a workaround. As a result, if you try to use Google Analytics with your U.S Google Account you may find that you cannot do that. This is caused by the Google Cloud Endpoints (GC) that Google has created under the authority of ECP 705.\n\nThe ECP is a set of policies for Google, and is part of Google's Certificate Program (CP). For some time now, the certificates that Google has issued as a service of their GC have been exposed by criminals to intercept and decrypt data that the user may have in Google accounts. This is a result of two separate flaws in the Certificate Authority (CA) and the Intermediate Certificate Authority (ICAC) certificate issuance process that allow an attack from the attacker's perspective to capture private keys and/or decrypt sensitive information from a Google account that uses their account CA.\n\nWe did not see how to fix this because we were unable to understand how the Certificate Authority (CA) or the Intermediate Certificate Association (ICAC), if they have been compromised, could have allowed an attack to capture private keys and the encryption keys from their SSL certificates in the first place.\n\nOne possible defense against this is the Google Authenticator which uses a different (and weaker) SSL encryption in order to access Google Play.\n\nWe tried to connect multiple times to multiple Google Accounts using both the Google Authenticator Authenticator and the Google Google Analytics Authentication service.\n\nOn all the connected accounts we were unable to access the Google Play service.\n\nUsing the Google Authenticator\n\nFor the authenticator, if you have a Google App account or Google Authenticator setup, you then have an option to set a password to decrypt information sent to Google. This password will only be available to you and your group of trusted friends. However, you will have no idea if and when information is being sent to or from Google if any person has changed the password.\n\nTo authenticate with Google Authenticator:\n\nGo to app.google.com. Sign in to your Google Account. Select the Google Authenticator Sign-on button. Follow the prompts to sign into Google Authenticator. Enter your Google Account password.\n\nUsing Search Analytics\n\nSearch Analytics does not encrypt data sent to China, at least as described in Google's privacy statement.\n\nThe data it collects is the same for everyone. However, Google Play uses their own internal data store. This is why the data is encrypted. However, it is a different storage location for the data, and there is a different password required to decrypt that data. If you have not been using Search Analytics for awhile, and the data that you have been storing on the Google Cloud Platform is not encrypted, then you may not be able to access it.\n\nHow Much?\n\nGoogle, and Google by extension, does not want companies to be able to use the information they have from users. The encryption on the Google Analytics data is not intended as a security measure (at least not by Google) and is not supposed to be a secret:\n\nBy using this application, you agree that the Google Analytics service is not designed or intended for use by persons or entities other than a company authorized by Google to use the service, such as Google employees.\n\nGoogle is attempting to protect users from attackers who may be able to access the sensitive information from their personal data. Unfortunately, that protection does not extend to allowing third parties to access Google's data. In order to give this same protection to all users, Google has to limit how it has a company store.\n\nFor any company that uses Google Analytics, they need a key. The key is a random password that is required for each company that will have access to Google analytics data. These companies, like Google, need to get the Google",

Golden Mortal Coil can also be obtained through the Highest Rank Bonus chest at the end of each Ranked season.\n\nCard Crafting cost Disenchanting Mortal Coil 40 5 Golden Mortal Coil 400 50\n\nWhile it won't deal much damage, Mortal Coil still heals for the same amount. Most Warlocks will use it with multiple friendly friendly minions in order to keep them alive for longer and thus deal more damage to the enemy.\n\nIt is useful to use this card to heal a low health minion in a minion fight and then swap it with another minion with higher health in order to increase its health for another charge.\n\nMortal Coil is one of the best cards available in the Warrior class. Because of the possibility of being one shot by the opponent's minions, the use of this card is generally reserved for situations where the Warrior is going to run into a bunch of minions, such as in an Arena or with the Warrior Battlecry mechanic.\n\nMortal Coil is not only used in Arena, but in World of Warcraft's first raid, \"Blackwing Lair\".\n\nThis card is extremely powerful, but its main weakness is its low Mana cost. It could potentially be better than [Blood Price] if the player uses it to trigger certain combos.\n\nIf the player manages to summon a number of friendly Minions for a high Mana cost, they can use [Nefarian] and [Anarchism] for several cheap damage/buffing spells.\n\nSummon You will regret your folly.

      "The first of three upcoming films based on the cult hit video game Half-Life released in 2009. The Half-Life: Opposing Force has a number of visual effects improvements; we'll see this in further releases, which includes the Half-Life 2 expansion Port, but it was not an issue in early 2013. At that time, the movie looked good on its surface, but the film's quality suffered in terms of the film's practical aspects, like the sound, image and lighting. For example, the lighting for one scene in the movie, where Gordon (Richard Dean Anderson) escapes a Black Mesa Research Facility, uses a white glow that could possibly be an issue on a television set. And the film has more issues in terms of the film's cinematography, especially in the first half of the movie.\n\nThe sequel to Portal, Half-Life 2: Episode 3, was released on May 6, 2010.\n\nContents show]\n\nPlot synopsis Edit\n\nThe story begins with the player character Gordon Freeman (Richard Gere) being rescued from death by a mysterious woman, Alyx Vance (Greta Gerwig), after losing his voice as the result of the Portal incident, resulting in him losing his sense of self. His rescuer is the highly dangerous Aperture Science researcher, Vortigaunt, \"Little\" Vance (Linda Hamilton), who appears to be the main antagonist of the film, although \"Shepherd\" Chell (Glenn Fabray) was also part of the initial Portal Incident. At Aperture Science's Black Mesa research facility, Gordon is forced to fight against a multitude of different types of security systems in order to escape from the facility and escape Black Mesa with his new buddy, Alyx, as well as test subjects G-Man (Christopher Adrian Smith) and his assistant, GLaDOS (Tanya Roberts). The movie is set in the not long after the conclusion of the Half-Life storyline.\n\nThe movie starts out with Gordon and Alyx being captured while they try to escape their captivity. They are then imprisoned and placed in a \"lab\" (similar to the Black Mesa Security Terminal from Half-Life) in order to be modified, as their captors want to make them into \"prosaic\" soldiers for the Combine. A series of tests is performed on them by the Vortigaunts before they are put on display. The Vortigaunts attempt to use various \"enhanced senses\" of each of them, such as sight, sound, touch, heat and electricity. For example, the Vortigaunt that touches GLaDOS may cause her to become angry from the lack of touch, yet Alyx may not feel anything for her, despite her being a Vortigaunt. Later, Gordon is subjected to \"re-education\" by an Aperture staff member, whose true intentions are revealed to be a plot to use Gordon's physical, mental and emotional \"weaknesses\" to make him a \"perfect\" soldier for the Combine. The Aperture \"recruits\" several Combine doctors in order to provide more of these vulnerabilities on a regular basis. Although Gordon struggles with certain tests and the Vortigaunts' attacks, he eventually masters them all and is able to escape.\n\nThe Combine have been taking over most of the Earth, including the Antarctica and Antarctica, the United States and the United States, and the Pacific Ocean as part of a larger operation. For example, there have been signs that the Combine have been taking over the United States military and have been experimenting on soldiers and making them go insane. There are many human beings who are part of the Combine with unique abilities, who are called Combine Overseers. One (Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance) escapes from the facility with Chell (Glenn Fabray) and GLaDOS, while another (A Combine officer) dies by her hand as Gordon tries to save Chell, who later escapes as well with the help of Alyx.\n\nGordon and Alyx get rescued by one more Combine Overseer named Conehead and the remaining Combine forces (with GLaDOS being captured). Gordon and Alyx confront Conehead and the Combine on Antarctica, but they are easily routed by both their enemies and the Combine forces. Gordon and Alyx escape to another Combine army base, and they confront GLaDOS inside. After destroying GLaDOS, Gordon and Alyx are both taken by the Combine for processing until they can be used for the military (similar to the original game's ending). Gordon, however, escapes into the wilds to find the Combine's mysterious scientist Gordon Freeman (Robert Lorne Greene). Gordon also helps his friend Alyx in her trial as a spy for the Combine as the two escape the military bases, and eventually encounter the Combine forces who tried to kill them. They run into an anti-Covenant group that also uses Vortigaunts like the one used to kill GLaDOS.[1]\n\nAt the end of the movie, the",
      "The Obama administration's push for tax reform that would reduce the number of American millionaires and billionaires is coming home to roost.\n\nIt is almost impossible to overstate the political importance of the issue for the party's 2016 presidential aspirants. And it is even more important for the White House, which faces the prospect of losing a number of wealthy donors and supporters during the midterm elections.\n\nStory Continued Below\n\nThe White House made it clear early in this year's congressional session — as Republicans focused primarily on trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act — that it would use tax reform with the wealthy as a key part of its strategy to push its priorities in Congress. The President's reelection campaign spent millions during the last election cycle — including $90 million that it raised in April — targeting wealthy backers.\n\nWhite House and Treasury officials also worked aggressively to assemble a bipartisan coalition around tax reform before the midterm elections, according to Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid (D-Nev.), who described the tax reform effort as \"almost impossible to do without Republican support.\"\n\n( Also on POLITICO: Democrats get new hope with tax bill)\n\nBut it is now clear the White House is going to have a harder time getting bipartisan support for tax reform if there are large numbers of wealthy Americans looking to shift tax burdens to themselves.\n\nFor more than a decade, the vast majority of the Republican caucus has been adamantly opposed to any changes to the tax code that would reduce the number of Americans who are millionaires and billionaires while increasing taxes on the middle class. The wealthy, who are far wealthier than poor Americans overall, feel particularly strongly about the issue because they are responsible for the vast bulk of corporate and personal income.\n\nAnd a number of congressional Republicans who voted against the fiscal cliff deal last year to avert tax increases have come out against the proposed legislation that would provide another $250 billion in tax breaks to the middle class. As a result, Senate Republicans are now focusing more on the business tax and the expiration of expiring loopholes, which are generally seen as more beneficial to the middle class than tax cuts.\n\nThe White House does not rule out going beyond cutting tax rates, even if the party's conservative wing opposes it — it just seems unlikely to happen.\n\n( POLITICO Pro: A brief history of taxes)\n\n\"There are ways to simplify the tax code without increasing rates, and that is one of them,\" White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest told reporters on Monday. \"You can take the simplification provided by the tax provisions that were extended to the middle class as part of the fiscal cliff deal and make the tax system simpler by making these permanent provisions permanent, and you can go a more rapid route without increasing the deficit by providing tax relief that would be temporary.\"",
      "The first ever official visit by China's premier to Israel took place on June 11, 2010. Chinese President Hu Jintao was greeted with an official state dinner on the Mediterranean island of Malta\n\nChinese President Hu Jintao's first official visit to Israel is set to take place in May next year, according to a report. In the run up to such an event, China reportedly wants to make Jerusalem the most prominent diplomatic outpost in the Muslim world during Hu's visit to the region.\n\nAccording to the official China Daily, China's President expressed interest in visiting Israel early in 2010, \"in advance,\" of his visit to the Middle East. Hu told Netanyahu the visit would be \"wonderful for the people of Israel and China,\" and offered to promote Jerusalem as the most prominent diplomatic point \"in the Islamic World,\" the newspaper reported. The newspaper cited a report that was published by an unnamed foreign ministry official on the Israeli newspaper Haaretz.\n\nChinese leaders are also reported to have asked Netanyahu to host a series of high-level Chinese officials who would visit Jerusalem. During Hu's visit to Moscow, Russian President Dmitry Medvedev held talks with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, and Putin met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe newspaper also reported that China has made a proposal to extend a permanent residence visa-free regime for Israel, which would cover both Israeli and Chinese citizens. That would be \"a historic step,\" said the paper, and would \"increase cooperation of the two countries and further develop China-Israel ties to be even more important to both of them,\" according to media reports.",
      "We're at the end of an incredibly long week of NFL games and not a single one is quite as competitive or interesting as the opening round of the playoffs between the Ravens and Bengals. It could be the first time we end on a down note, given that the Bengals blew the biggest lead in playoff history in last year's opener, but it feels pretty much inevitable that two teams from AFC North will meet in the divisional round on Monday.\n\nThis week's \"Dirty Birds\" matchup was never really in doubt going into the season, as both of Baltimore's rivals are loaded and talented enough to challenge the Ravens' supremacy. The good news is that both defenses will be tested this weekend, and the Bengals have some issues to address on offense.\n\nHere are my game predictions for Baltimore and Cincinnati.\n\nPICK 'EM\n\nRavens 17, Bengals 15\n\nJoe Flacco has one heck of a supporting cast this season, and he has them all to thank for his MVP-caliber play. The Ravens are a solid 8-4 and still have homefield advantage as long as their bye week keeps them off the road. This seems like a pretty easy schedule win, especially with Bengals pass rusher Rey Maualuga coming to town to take on Flacco.\n\nCleveland Browns 14, Dolphins 11\n\nThis is always a fun matchup between this very good Cleveland Browns team and Jay Cutler, and Cleveland can win out a lot this season (8-6, which is a solid record for a team that had to reshuffle a lot) if it can hold off the surging Miami Dolphins. It'll take some real luck for Miami to come out on top in its first meeting with the Browns since 2002, as the Browns will have star quarterback and Miami legend Peyton Manning to look at.\n\nBucs 25, Colts 21\n\nThe Colts got very lucky last season when they found a way to beat the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in Indianapolis without injured superstar Trent Richardson. New coach Chuck Pagano was quick to say Richardson was just fine, but if the Colts can avoid getting beat up by the Bucs' fast-tempo offense, Cleveland shouldn't be much of a matchup against Indianapolis.\n\nCardinals 24, Panthers 21\n\nArizona took out the Panthers in what looked to be an easy game last week, and the Cardinals got the win by using some trick plays and running the ball with Carson Palmer. Cam Newton and Jonathan Stewart seem like decent fits for this type of offense, but the Cardinals' defense is the real reason the team is 9-4. If Jonathan Stewart can be held down in the red zone, perhaps the Panthers will need to run more plays from the sideline.\n\nChargers 27, Broncos 23\n\nThe Broncos are 6-6 and looking to get back into the playoffs after being blown out in the divisional round. The Chargers are the toughest divisional round opponent they've played, and should be the better team overall. If Philip Rivers' back issues linger a bit, these two teams should be a very close game.\n\nBroncos 27, Bears 21\n\nIf anyone is going to do it to Cutler this year, it will be Chicago. There are so many questions about Cutler, who is coming off a shoulder injury he suffered in the second quarter of the game against the Patriots last week. A lot will depend on how Chicago's defense holds up against the Broncos, and how the Chargers handle Rivers (who is playing on a bad shoulder).\n\nMOVING ON UP\n\nEagles 25, Browns 24\n\nThe Eagles' offensive line is playing well enough that they could make this a close game come playoff time, and the Browns have plenty of weapons to put on the field for Carson Wentz. This game will go a long way to deciding the Browns' playoff fate, which should come as a relief to Cleveland fans given the struggles of former head coach Mike Pettine and his replacement, Hue Jackson.\n\nLOW LIGHTS\n\nTexans 24, Colts 20\n\nColts quarterback Andrew Luck played incredibly well last week, but Texans head coach Bill O'Brien is now 1-8 in the playoffs in his nine seasons as a head coach and his team may be without star linebacker Whitney Mercilus for a good portion of this game. The Texans probably don't need Manning against the Colts, but an impressive victory by O'Brien's squad will get them closer to the AFC South title and a bye in the playoffs.\n\nTOMORROW'S DOUBLEHEADER\n\nRams 34, Bills 17\n\nThe Rams will be able to get away with being favored in this matchup, and they should be able to pick up a lot of yards against an Bills team now with rookie quarterback Nathan Peterman. It's time for the Bills to find their quarterback of the future.\n\nSITUATION VISION\n\nJets 27, Raiders 25\n\nThis is a tough matchup for the Raiders, as they have the worst",
      "After his mother died in a car crash in 1999, Mike Mazzola began to have flashbacks, most recently at a house party his freshman year at the University of Iowa in 2000.\n\nMike was attending an all-male freshman event when five girls stood over his mother's body and asked him to drink liquor.\n\nI was there. At the party, I witnessed the aftermath: a teenage boy holding a girl's hand and leaning in for a kiss.\n\n\"It wasn't a kiss, it was more of a grip,\" Mazzola tells PEOPLE. \"They had their hands on my mother's body and I remember thinking, 'This is messed up.' \"\n\nThe incident was particularly shocking because it happened at the same time Mazzola's mother was diagnosed with breast cancer. And though Mazzola admits that the girls' advances were at best inappropriate and at worst predatory, he doesn't fully understand what the girls did.\n\n\"I didn't know what was happening,\" he explains. \"I could tell they were kind of playing around but I didn't know.\"\n\nI didn't know what was happening. I could tell they were kind of playing around but I didn't know.\n\nMike Mazzola, 22\n\nMike and his best friend, who was at the party with him, left the party for two hours to seek medical help.\n\n\"They were acting creepy and just not right,\" his friend tells PEOPLE about the girls' behavior that night.\n\nTwo friends later reported their suspicions to the Iowa Department of Consumer Protection and the Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control. At one party after Mike's sophomore year an investigator from the state's Alcoholic Beverage Control went to the scene and spoke with the girls.\n\n\"I knew there had to have been another reason,\" Mike says.\n\nA detective visited the house where the parties happened, and Mike was asked if there was anything that would cause alarm to him.\n\n\"He told me, 'Just tell me what happened to your mom,' \" he says. There was no answer.\n\nA friend later reported that some girls had been drinking too much, but nobody had told Mike his mother had been hit by a car at the party after they began to dance for a bit. Mike's mom refused treatment for her cancer because she wanted to dance that night, his friend was told.\n\nThe Department of Consumer Protection launched a full investigation of the parties and interviewed partygoers, including the girls at a house party in Iowa City.\n\nThe report states that at both events \"inappropriate advances of a sexual nature\" towards the young men were reported by partygoers. The report also states that alcohol was consumed by some people at the parties.\n\nA report dated Sept. 25, 2000, found that Iowa's state agency was unable to identify any one person responsible for the event.\n\nAfter the report was issued, Mike was suspended for a quarter of the school year. At the time, a university official told him, \"The most serious action that can be taken to address this type of situation, which has happened with two other students, is suspension,\" according to Mazzola.\n\nThe decision was \"totally shocking,\" he says. \"It really surprised me and made me feel like they were giving zero [sic] accountability when it really comes down to it.\"\n\nThe school also expelled Mazzola from the school.\n\n\"It was a really unfair situation,\" Mazzola says about the situation the university gave him. \"I felt I couldn't really defend myself [because] that's what I was there for, to defend the university, the honor code and all the things that I am there to do.\"\n\nMazzola says he doesn't want to relive the experience at a second party in Iowa City, but he hopes his story could give some people the courage to say no.\n\n\"You don't have to go through something for it to affect you, for us as individuals to learn and grow from it,\" says Mazzola, who hopes the issue can be addressed without the need for him to go through a formal process of discipline.\n\n\"I think there needs to be some kind of education for the whole community to understand what's going on because you cannot teach wrongs,\" he says. \"But if you can start to understand that there are consequences and that this is not okay.\"\n\nMike Mazzola on Mizzou's \"rape culture\"\n\nThough Mazzola went through the university's sexual assault prevention program, he says it doesn't go far enough to address the problem.\n\n\"There is zero training in the sex offender training that goes into the issue of sexual violence and sexual victimization,\" he says.\n\nAnd even though Mazzola received counseling at the university he says the university didn't follow up with him after he finished his suspension and expulsion.\n\nBut that hasn't stopped Mazz",
      "Mumbai: Tata Motors India Ltd, the subsidiary of Tata Sons which is in the process of acquiring a major player in the taxi industry, on Tuesday said that the acquisition of TaxiForSure has been put on hold because of the \"recent escalation of competition.\"\n\nThe Tata group conglomerate acquired TaxiForSure Pvt Ltd, which provides its cabs with an integrated suite of technology and management services.\n\nEarlier, the company was acquired by Infinera, which is planning to merge it with its own technology and technology services unit.\n\n\"The Company (Tata Motors) reiterates that there is no acquisition taking place in taxi service sector and TaxiForSure is not in the process of acquiring any assets by Tata Motors in the country at this stage,\" a Tata Motors spokesperson said in an email.\n\nEarlier this month, the Tata group conglomerate had said that it was in advanced talks with a US-based private investment firm to acquire Infinera, whose cabs compete against those of TaxiForSure. However, the TATA group is yet to confirm the investment.\n\nHowever, the Tata group conglomerate said that Uber's (India) global sales of Rs.500 crore and revenue of Rs.6,500 crore in the financial year 2016-17 are not sufficient for the group to support its ambitious long term goals of making India one of the world's largest cities for Uber.\n\nAlso, the Tata group conglomerate says that the US-based investment, which valued Infinera at $2.9 billion last month, would also not be able to compete with the likes of the taxi aggregators by using Uber's ride-hailing platforms, which would not have full taxi capacity of its own for Uber.",

It awarded Scott attorney Steve Freeman $3 million of that.\n\nThe North Carolina State Bureau of Investigation interviewed Vinson, who testified he was attempting to arrest him on an outstanding warrant. He said he went to pick up Scott, who was holding a firearm.\n\nVinson said he was fearful for his safety because Scott had a long arrest record dating back to 2007.\n\nCopyright 2016 The Associated Press.

[Joking] Haha, yes of course I know I should have told you about the other booth. And I'm afraid I'm stuck with you. You are the most perfect woman I have ever had the pleasure of knowing... and I'm perfectly content to be stuck with you for the rest of my life. [Slightly more irritated] I didn't make this choice lightly. I had a lot of great opportunities to go with someone else, and I could have done so much more. [Angry with disappointment] I shouldn't be blaming someone else for something they did. I should be blaming myself [Disappointed] Fuck me... [Angry and frustrated] Fuck me you fucking prick.... I am a good person, I do the right way... And yet, I don't deserve to be happy. I still see myself as a good person. [Shocked and confused] What? [Pouting] You're mad? [Pause] [Surprised] What?! No, you're really telling me you're happy I've decided to go on this trip with the same girl you're dating? It's not fair! [Serious and almost angry] Stop acting like this. You were with both of my previous partners, and I don't see that playing a factor here. If anything, I feel like this is why I've been dating you. But I'm not going to play games with you. You know what happens when I don't play these games. [Confused] What do you mean...? [A bit offended] Seriously?? [Angry] Stop playing stupid with me... [Pause] That is what this trip is about now?

      "The government plans to cut the number of civil servant employees in all but six departments this year.\n\nMinister for Public Expenditure Brendan Howlin today announced that the Government will reduce the number of civil servant staff across the State to 2,400.\n\nCurrently there are about 5,200 civil servant staff across the State - a reduction of 20 per cent.\n\nHowever, Mr Howlin said that the staffing plan was not to address every department's staffing challenges and that the State's public services would be \"stronger\" when the State had more people working in them.\n\nHe said that it was not a staffing plan, as he wants to bring about a \"cultural change within departments in Ireland\".\n\nAsked by Fianna Fáil TD Catherine Murphy if this constituted a reduction of public expenditure as the Minister insisted that the cut is not to service the population but to increase efficiency for the State, Mr Howlin said it is \"not\" a reduction of expenditure.",

(WJOV) - One of the state's highest-ranking officials has been stripped of his position as secretary of the Department of Economic Opportunity for allegedly misappropriating $1.2 million.\n\nState Department of Economic Opportunity Secretary David Wiggins says it's a tough time for everyone involved in this story and he hopes we can find answers quickly and move on as a state.\n\n\"I believe I have done nothing wrong and I wish that everyone involved in this matter would have the opportunity to explain their position and come forward with an explanation as to their thinking, their intentions and their motivation,\" Wiggins said.\n\nState Attorney Bill Cervone said the state will present evidence, if any, that will show Wiggins violated laws concerning public contracts.\n\n\"I want to make one thing clear: It's not that it's a misdemeanor crime. It actually is a felony. What it is is improper use of $1.2 million of federal money. And once the money is used, someone has a big problem,\" Cervone said.\n\n\"Do you think it's a lot of money? Yes,\" Wiggins said.\n\n\"It's a lot of money. I can assure you. I can tell you, it's $1.2 million to fund programs from low-income education to housing, to food stamps to Medicaid,\" Cervone said.\n\n\"Well, there were a million things I wanted to do with the $1.2 million. There are a million things I want to do with my life and now there is a criminal case. It doesn't make any sense,\" Wiggins said.\n\nThe decision not to prosecute comes on the heels of a scathing audit from former Republican Attorney General Bob Butterworth.\n\n\"Every one of the allegations here in terms of the misuse of money by Mr. Wiggins were substantiated, they were proved, and he wasn't charged for anything,\" Cervone said.\n\n\"Do you have any apologies left?\" WJOV Investigative Reporter Chris Cammock said.\n\n\"Do I have any regrets?\" Wiggins said.\n\nIf prosecutors decide their case is strong, Wiggins might be forced into another lengthy court battle to fight back against the state or face losing his job and pension.\n\n\"We're certainly going to do whatever we have to do to protect this person. We're going to fight it every step of the way to get him back on the job and back to his family,\" Cervone said.\n\nWiggins says he's done nothing wrong.\n\n\"There was no misappropriation of his funds, we know that now,\" Wiggins said.\n\nAs for his future with the agency, Wiggins is still the state's economic development commissioner.\n\n\"They can't fire or discipline him; he is the secretary of the state of the economic opportunity department and the secretary is a political appointee,\" Wiggins said.\n\nThe state will release a final decision on whether or not to bring charges against Wiggins next week.",

      "The state of Alaska is now considering a bill that would allow gun owners to keep their firearms in their vehicles on their \"permanent property.\"\n\nThe bill from Sen. Bill Wielechowski would enable a holder of a concealed carry permit to have a gun in his vehicle.\n\n\"The vehicle does not have to be your home. You do not have to be there all the time. Just to be safe. And I think it also goes a long way in allowing people to practice their Second Amendment rights to be protected from criminal assault.\"\n\nWielechowski says he wrote the bill after a man was shot by his brother after allegedly breaking a restraining order. The brother is still under investigation.\n\nThe bill would allow the Alaska State Troopers' to conduct patrols in the state's \"designated vehicle zones\" where firearm bans are currently in place.\n\nWhen it was presented in the legislative record last week, the state trooper who helped write the bill offered an opinion about the law. He says it's actually not much of a problem to have a gun in your vehicle at all.\n\n\"No, for people that actually have a permit … I think the legislation would not be as effective if it meant a lot of people have firearms in their vehicle. The people of Alaska, in our opinion, they're not that irresponsible as most would think and it probably could not help save a life. \"That being said, that's kind of like saying 'I really have a lot of weed in my car' … it could certainly happen.\"\n\nWielechowski says the legislation wouldn't allow law enforcement agencies to be able to come into someone's yard, conduct a roadblock, or enforce a marijuana ban. That's according to KTVA-TV's Scott Gorgon, who spoke with troopers about the bill over the weekend.\n\nGun owners can currently take their guns into Alaska while traveling. It's a privilege that's only given to an individual's active duty service member, family, law enforcement or other official who has to board a plane.\n\nHere's all you need to know if you want to legally keep your gun in your home.",
      "This is part of a series on the impact of the financial crisis and its effects on public health and health care in the United States.\n\nThe recession of 2007-9 and the ongoing financial crisis and recession of 2010-12 are creating more financial trouble for the U.S. economy, increasing the prevalence of credit issues, and putting upward pressure on the national debt to a point that is threatening to reverse the historic reductions in the number of uninsured Americans.1,2\n\nThe health benefits of insurance—the ability to avoid emergencies if you are suddenly ill or injured, and to see doctors regularly when needed—are a major element of a healthy economy. But when Americans get sick, they are often unable to get the financial assistance they need if they can no longer work. This can cause hardship. These problems could be prevented by the health benefit reforms that were included in the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (ARRA).\n\nA major component of ARRA was the establishment of financial \"reform centers\" in every state to help consumers, private insurers, health care providers, and regulators understand the impact of the financial crisis and its impacts on the health care system. The ACA strengthened these efforts by requiring plans to have \"transparency\" in plans in order to identify high cost patients and help consumers evaluate whether those costs are justified. For example, a patient may have a deductible that is too high, or a high out of pocket co-pays. In both cases this would indicate financial stress.\n\nTo help people understand their insurance policies, insurance providers were also required to implement \"consumer feedback\" programs—these included standardized cost accounting systems, interactive voice response (IVR) systems, and a call center option to ensure customers could get more clarity on their insurance options.\n\nHowever, as the first wave of the ACA marketplace opened on October 1, 2010, consumers were in for a rude shock. As soon as customers were turned away, the cost of insurance went up substantially: from $5 a month in the first month, to $6 a month in October 2010. As of February 2012, it was still at $6. In April of the same year a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation showed that 40 percent of Americans were enrolled in a plan that would not meet their current deductible in a typical year. At higher deductible levels, this becomes a serious problem.\n\nThe number of people covered under the ACA exchange health plans in 2014 is likely to drop further, as the insurance marketplace's problems and subsidies for the plan that was designed to meet the needs of small businesses are still under review.\n\nThe new financial crisis is increasing financial stress in the health sector as well. Health care spending was on pace to reach an all-time high in 2010 but is now projected to remain higher, and overall health care spending is expected to rise even more. At the same time, the ACA insurance regulations were changing the health system in many ways. For example, the reforms had led to a shift from fee for service to bundled payments for procedures. This would also change the structure of the health care delivery system, and increase the costs of managing and transmitting the various forms of health care to patients, including hospital stays, and prescription drugs. This has led to concerns that the health care system will become more complex, and potentially more expensive to manage, perhaps to a point where people will get more and more tangled up in their insurance plans in place of the delivery system they need. So long as their medical care is under-served by the delivery system, they may have to choose between their health care and their finances.\n\nWhile this is currently a possibility, other factors could mitigate it. The implementation of the ACA's health insurance reforms had the unintended impact of making health insurance available to more people, increasing health insurance participation by expanding the pool of people covered, making it easier to sign up, and reducing the likelihood of being refused coverage and the out of pocket expenses associated with this.\n\nIn addition, there is a trend toward a decline in the uninsured rate. The Affordable Care Act's financial reforms will help mitigate the risks that the law's individual mandate will expose people to. While this is a positive step, and may lead to a slight decline in the number of uninsured, the Affordable Care Act is not the panacea for health care reform that some feared. The law itself does not include \"universal coverage\" and, in fact, its most important provision—the subsidies to purchase individual insurance—has not yet taken effect.\n\nThe economic challenges associated with the recession of 2007-09 and the financial crisis now in its fifth year are having a significant impact on health services. These are very challenging times politically for health and social policy as well. As the financial crisis worsens, with the national debt reaching a staggering $16 trillion, all Americans will face a challenge as policymakers turn to the ACA to address the issues. Congress and the White House need to act on the financial reforms now, before it is too late.",

      "SALT LAKE CITY (AP) — A Utah lawmaker is approved for reinstatement, and the state will remove a requirement that legislators be polygamists to sit on the state's supreme court.\n\nLegislative leaders said Monday (July 1) that Sen. Steve Urquhart, R-St. George, was approved for reinstatement with unanimous support in the Senate. Urquhart served as an attorney in Salt Lake County who was the first openly gay state lawmaker when he was elected to the House of Representatives in 1988.\n\nState Sen. Scott Goehring, R-West Jordan, a member of the Senate Judicial Proceedings Committee, said he plans to schedule a vote next week to remove a provision under the Constitution that says only Mormons can sit on the supreme court. Urquhart said he is reviewing his options to remove the provision, but if that doesn't pass, he'll pursue removal by legislative appeal.\n\n\"I'm ready to live my life in the next two years and hopefully we won't have to deal with another issue that causes such controversy, such division,\" Urquhart said recently. \"I don't want to be a martyr for the cause.\"\n\nA 2014 resolution to add Urquhart and eight other Utah members to the state Supreme Court did not pass. Urquhart, the last lawmaker to be recalled, said he and other legislators decided not to seek reinstatement following opposition from those who would be removed and others who feared for their political future.\n\n\"I didn't make a public spectacle about it, but if it was a public issue that I was being accused of, certainly that's what I would have done,\" he said. \"I'm looking forward to having a fresh start and I hope to continue to serve my constituents.\"\n\nGov. Gary Herbert, a Republican, has made it clear Urquhart will not return to the Senate in 2018.\n\nA spokesman for former Gov. Jon Huntsman Jr., who served from 2006 to 2011, told The Associated Press in a statement that Huntsman and his family would welcome Urquhart back home.\n\nGohring, the committee chairman, called Urquhart the \"gold standard\" for the Utah Legislature. He said the judge's tenure in the state Senate was exemplary and was more important than that of the nine other members on the legislative committee, including Urquhart.\n\nA new law in 2016 took away some of Urquhart's power to appoint lower court judges to the state Supreme Court, but allowed him to vote on whether to retain an appointment. Gohring said he would recommend that Urquhart be allowed to vote on the appointment. That law, Goehring said Monday, is \"in place to ensure integrity for the court, and it's time we allow those powers to become more expansive.\"\n\nUrquhart, who was born in Salt Lake City in 1936 and who was divorced from his wife when he was 16, was first elected to the House in 1988 and was named to fill a vacant seat in 2009.\n\nUrquhart was criticized in 2016 for suggesting during a public forum that rape allegations made against actor Bill Cosby could be related to sexual relationships the two men had while they were younger and more vulnerable. The comment was widely criticized.\n\nUrquhart said in that same forum that he considered pornography to be harmful to children, and he also has questioned the credibility of allegations made by many women against prominent men who have faced allegations.\n\nGoehring said lawmakers also agreed to review his decision to remove Urquhart as the chairman of the judicial committees. Lawmakers will meet next week to discuss Goehring's recommendations.\n\n___\n\nInformation from: The Salt Lake Tribune, http://www.sltrib.com\n\n(Copyright 2017 The Associated Press.

      "The story of the American experience in Iraq was a tale of constant failure. Over and over, U.S. soldiers have come out on the losing end of disastrous and bloody campaigns from the late 1980s to the early 2000s, costing their allies billions of dollars as the war dragged on and the U.S. suffered hundreds of thousands of civilian injuries and deaths. The U.S. military never learned how to control the conflict on the ground, much less prevent it from spreading across the region. With thousands killed every year from violence within Iraq itself, the U.S. military had to devote more resources to fighting for its interests in the Middle East -- a trend that continued into 2015. It is time for the Pentagon in Washington to ask what the hell is going on in Iraq and why we are there.\n\nThis is a war about to drag on for decades, if not centuries. With ISIS now in control of vast areas of territory in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State is not going to fade away over night. It now controls several key Iraqi cities and has a stranglehold on much of the country's oil production. This is all the more alarming because Iraq's constitution stipulated its dissolution in 2003. Yet, the country's government still managed to fight ISIS off on the battlefield. It is unclear how that battle is going to continue or whether the international support it is getting remains sustainable. With U.S. soldiers out of Iraq and out of the fight, U.S. generals are forced to put together a new strategy to fight not an opponent on the ground, but a foe that has come online with ease.\n\nThe U.S. military had little experience in Iraq before the 2003 invasion. It was a country of 2 million people in which the United States military, working with the former Kurdish regional government, fought several campaigns for a few hundred thousand troops on the ground. At its peak in 2005, the U.S. mission was called Operation Iraqi Freedom. In the years after the invasion, U.S. troops did what anyone would have done -- they tried to make Iraq a better place. Despite that, the situation in Iraq turned into a full blown civil war as one faction of Iraqi government tried to prop up its corrupt, authoritarian neighbor, the former oppressive regime of Saddam Hussein. ISIS's rise is the product of that war.\n\nIraqis hate and fear a group that includes an educated, civilized and moderate Islam. The Sunni Muslim religious scholars that formed ISIS were a group that wanted to restore the ancient caliphates of the Arabs, a sect that is considered heretical by much of the majority of Iraq's Muslims. That's why ISIS would declare independence from the Iraqi central government as Sunnis who are fighting to maintain their own countries, especially those in which they are not governed by religious clerics. The U.S. military has long been involved in those countries, and has supported the local governments against ISIS. The U.S. military has had a major role in bringing the war in Iraq to an end in December of last year, and in keeping ISIS from gaining more strength over the past two years.\n\nIraqi Sunni extremists, led by former Baathist figures, have been able to seize much of the country over the past few years, which has made it difficult for the local governments in Iraq, especially those in Baghdad, to regain control in the wake of ISIS's emergence. The sectarian wars within Iraq have been exacerbated by the U.S. military's involvement in helping local authorities fight ISIS. If the U.S. keeps its military presence in Iraq, the Iraqi government will be increasingly dependent on the U.S. in order to contain the country's sectarian violence. If that happens the U.S. will not only be leaving a residual military force in Iraq, it will be increasingly involved in Iraq's current civil war, which has already killed tens of thousands of Sunnis.\n\nThe U.S. military has a history of wasting and embarrassing its troops. At the end of September, it lost a huge chunk of its force in Iraq at the hands of ISIS, which took the military's Anbar province in a short period of time. At the time, the military said that it lost 25 percent of its troops, but the real figure was more than double that. The loss at the hands of ISIS forced U.S. commanders to scramble in a panic to make sure it didn't take control over the entire country, but ISIS quickly took control over the vast vast parts of Syria that make up the borders of Iraq.\n\nISIS took over Syria's oil supply, and it is becoming extremely profitable for the group to do so. The group has managed to make a huge profit of more than 500 million dollars in just three years. With the oil revenue, ISIS has expanded its control and control over a lot of territory. It has been able to do so because of a series of mistakes and misunderstandings that were the result of the U.S. military's failure in Iraq.",

      "[Update: This article was updated with an answer from the FDA on 5/23/13]\n\nAs you may have heard, the FDA is about to issue a notice in the Federal Register that the agency will be changing their labeling on over-the-counter painkillers. This notice, due out this month, will allow the agency to start enforcing their restrictions on over-the-counter painkillers, including over-the-counter codeine-containing pain medications. Codeine is a sedating anti-inflammatory pain medication that used to be prescribed over-the-counter in prescription form. That changed in 2006, when Congress put strong restrictions on the sale of prescription codeine and other prescription opiates. In order to purchase and possess over-the-counter codeine drugs, including codeine-containing pain medications, a prescriber must also:\n\n1. Prescribe the codeine-containing pain medication 2. Prescribe more than three times in a 12-month period 3. Prescribe or dispense an opioid - like prescription morphine or oxycodone 4. Not dispense any prescription pain medications other than on the day they are applied 5. Not have other medical conditions that require a high dose of opiates\n\nIn addition, no more than 50 oxycodone tablets (100mg) can be purchased with a codeine-containing pain medication at a time, and the prescriber must also not have at least two open prescriptions for oxycodone in their possession or be actively addicted to a substance.\n\nThe notice will likely be issued on or at the beginning of May.\n\nWhat will this mean for anyone currently using codeine over the counter, or who would be applying to use codeine as an over-the-counter pain medication? It will mean that:\n\n1. Codeine will be classified as a schedule III drug – a category that has \"no currently accepted medical use\"\n\n2. Codeine products containing oxycodone will be limited to those in package sizes of no more than 15 mg per product. That means no more than 300 oxycodone-containing products can be sold and no more than 4,450 mg total of codeine tablets can be sold with a prescription.\n\n3. In most cases, the amount of codeine the prescriber can prescribe with a single 30-milligram prescription will be reduced from the current maximum of 150 mg to 100 mg. That means that while the amount of codeine the prescriber can dispense will be 100 mg when codeine is given by a pharmacy and 100 mg when it is given as a single dose under the doctor's or nurse's care in a hospital, the current limit of 150 mg in a 30-milligram prescription will remain, preventing many prescriptions from being filled.\n\n4. The maximum daily dose of codeine, currently 120 mg, will remain in place. That means that when a drug is given by a pharmacist (and many consumers expect to be given it in these settings), the actual maximum the prescriber can prescribe will only be 120 mg - even though, theoretically, the total amount of codeine in codeine-containing products prescribed in a 30-milligram prescription would be 100 mg.\n\nSo, while a consumer may be able to buy a 20-milligram painkiller with codeine as a \"recreational\" prescription, that same prescription, when written by a doctor, would likely be limited to 80 mg, and the actual dosage to be distributed to the patient under that prescription would be a mere 30 mg - which, while a lower dosage of codeine was considered \"low,\" would still be roughly equivalent to 120 mg.\n\n5. Physicians will only prescribe codeine with a \"prescription for emergency use\" – meaning that as long as the prescriber has the appropriate opioid in the ER, there's no prohibition on using the product for the purposes of pain treatment. Codeine-containing pain products are also scheduled to be available in refillable cartridges in the future as a result of this change: This would mean that a generic codeine-containing pain medication could be dispensed as a refillable inhaler.\n\nAs you may recall from this post a year ago, codeine is among some of the most widely used drugs in the U.S. and has caused a significant amount of damage to people's lives. While codeine's effects were originally associated with cough syrups and pain medicines, the number of cases involving codeine is increasing and may be related to the growing opioid epidemic.\n\nHere's more from the FDA:",

      "You have the right to be free of unreasonable searches and seizures. This means you have the right to use your house and any of your possessions for any lawful purpose, including sleeping and visiting friends and relatives.\n\nThe police may stop you on the street for a few common traffic violations -- such as running a stop sign or having broken glass on the road. They may also stop you on the street with your cell phone to search it, or ask to search it.\n\nBut they may not conduct unreasonable searches or seizures, such as searching inside your house, searching at the home of anyone you have contact with, or searching your house without a warrant when you are not charged with a crime. The right to be free from unreasonable police searches includes stopping you for a routine stop or frisk by your neighbor or a police officer on a regular basis.\n\nIt is illegal for the police to ask you to submit to a search except under certain circumstance. If you cannot answer their questions, you should not talk to or identify them, but should tell someone else what happened.\n\nYour rights don't end after you are being questioned by police, only when you have taken your case to court. That is, police must keep your case within certain limits.\n\nIf you feel that your rights have been infringed, you have the right to speak to an attorney. You have the right to a lawyer's advice and assistance in the criminal or civil justice system. You have the right to be free from unreasonable force and intimidation by both state prison and Federal Bureau of Prisons officials.\n\nThe courts will not tell you \"no\" without giving you a chance to consult with an attorney before refusing a search. But no \"yes\" means \"yes.\" In criminal cases, courts want suspects to understand that they are likely to be taken through the criminal justice system in front of a jury and may be required to prove that they are innocent.\n\nIf you are innocent but are a suspect or suspect's friend or relative, you have the right not to answer questions about the incident. You also have the right to go to court and prove your innocence.\n\nPolice cannot use your own or someone else's name, telephone number, or address for surveillance purposes. If they are trying to obtain information on the same matter, they can't make an \"insider tip\" based on your name or any personal information.\n\nThe police have to tell you why they are stopping you, so you know what the nature of the investigation is before the stop. If you are in a crowded area, or if the officer does not explain to you why you are being stopped, you may ask for a written record that will be kept until the case is over.\n\nIn some states, if you are stopped for no reason at all, it is called a \"no-knock\" search.\n\nWhat are Probable Cause and Probable Cause Not?\n\nPolice have probable cause to search you if they show that they have enough information to believe either that you are guilty of an offense, or that there is a reasonable cause to believe you have committed the alleged crime.\n\nThe officers need only show that it is more likely than not that you used drugs or that you will try to use drugs in the near future, or that you have used drugs in the past and will try to use them in the future. (If this happens, the search will not require a warrant.)\n\nIf they do not show probable cause, then there is nothing that gives them the right to stop you if you are innocent. In that case, the police can only conduct a pat-down search if they are told by you that you refuse to consent.\n\nIf you don't consent to a search, and the officers are trying to gain access to your belongings, the police may find it very inconvenient when they can't get into your purse or other belongings, and they may be frustrated.\n\nPretrial Release\n\nWhen you are arrested at the police station, or at the jail, the police take you to a jail in charge of keeping your possessions overnight. This is called \"prevention or pretrial release.\" In most cases, a judge will order you to stay in custody during the day after your first court appearance.\n\nA judge can order you to stay in jail with or without a lawyer. If you are in jail, you cannot be released from custody until you are found guilty, have been convicted and sentenced, or are found not guilty in a trial.\n\nWhat Happens if Your Property Is Taken from You?\n\nEven if you don't have a criminal record or have been convicted of a serious offense, it is common practice among most police to take your property.\n\nThe police may take the following kinds of property from you:\n\nCash or money, jewelry, and electronic goods (like computer, TV, and cell phones).\n\nClothing, including clothing that identifies you, such as your clothing size or names.\n",
      "The state will not provide the services it promised to elderly immigrants who say they have nowhere to go after winning a class-action immigration lawsuit, arguing in court documents Monday that its contract with a private company should preempt any legal requirements the newcomers would be obliged to meet.\n\nThe ruling by U.S. District Court Judge George L. Russell came after a three-day trial that offered a glimpse into the difficulties of caring for the millions of elderly immigrants who entered the U.S. illegally after the 1970s.\n\nThe issue was one that drew a sharp rebuke from President Donald Trump on the campaign trail and as president, and had become a cause célèbre for immigrant advocates, who have long worried the state and local governments may be less able to cope with the influx than they have in past decades.\n\nMany of the immigrants, the majority of whom were born in the U.S., have fallen on hard times since the economy and housing markets crashed during the late 1990s. They often depend on traditional welfare services, like Medicaid or the Earned Income Tax Credit, as well as state and federal government programs.\n\nThey are required to go to hearings in state court to determine if they're eligible for federal protection, either under the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, or in the case of the original DACA beneficiaries, as well as renewal applications, called \"deferred action.\"\n\nThey may also be eligible for other programs for people in their 60s.\n\nBut many were unaware that while they were eligible for those protections, they might not be eligible for the government to provide the services that would make them financially independent.\n\nIn response to that prospect, dozens came forward and said they were scared, and that they had come to terms with the idea that they would have to go to court to resolve their legal status or to get the services they needed.\n\nBut the state of California says that because its contract with Care Services Corp. of San Diego is contingent on the plaintiffs being released from other duties — it is not an agency — it is legally obligated to give the company the services.\n\n\n\"We are in a contract with Care Services Corp. to provide long term care services … and they are the only party that has the authority to provide that services,\" wrote attorney Paul C. Carpino who represented the state. \"California's power over Care Services is contingent upon them receiving Medicaid and food stamps, and if they do not do so, they cannot continue their Medicaid and food stamp contracts,\" Carpino wrote in court documents.\n\nIn court on Monday, the judge seemed skeptical that the state could simply change the terms of its contract with Care Services.\n\n\"I get the contract,\" Russell said. \"I get you get the right to collect money for long term care. But to me, I get the contract, I get the responsibility, and I say that's the way that it ought to be.\"\n\nRussell also questioned whether the state could simply get rid of its contractual relationship with Care Services to avoid giving the company the services it sought — a move that would save the state $4.4 million a year.\n\nThe state did not challenge that suggestion.\n\n\"The state says it has to give care services to people who need it,\" said attorney John McManus, representing the plaintiffs. \"To me that's the definition of discrimination.\"\n\nBut the state said that because Care Services Corp. is the state's provider, it is legally responsible for the care it provides to immigrants, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nCarpino responded by saying the state should be responsible for offering the services to the immigrants and that the state would pay for care until Care Services Corp. was fully contracted out.\n\nRussell countered by pointing to California's obligations under the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which require child welfare agencies to \"ensure the provision of appropriate care and protection,\" McManus said.\n\n\"The U.N. convention requires us to protect children in all circumstances, in every case,\" he said.\n\nCarpino conceded that California had not always fulfilled that requirement, but said the state could \"come back to court and say we are doing so, we are doing so now, we are not going to take this any longer.\"\n\nContact the writer: 714-704-3709 or amarroquin@ocregister.com",

      "MUMBAI: A few days after an officer from the local police station allegedly harassed a woman colleague on the pretext that she was a police wife after her son was allegedly molested, Bhandup police superintendent Sunil Shrivastava has issued an order directing the police department to submit an account of the incident so that action can be taken. The complaint was registered by Suresh, the victim's son, at the Bhandup station after his 12-year-old cousin allegedly molested his 11-year-old younger brother in a bus on June 8. In his FIR, Suresh has stated that he had complained to the bus conductor for the abuse when his cousin came home but the conductor never bothered to follow-up his complaint. \"The conductor and some other locals approached us and told us that he is a police wife and that we have to give her a chance to make her statement or else the woman would file false cases against us. In a few hours, my cousin was abused and I lost my temper and slapped him once. He was a minor at the time and his father saw it and had to intervene,\" the 18-year-old said after learning that his name figured in an FIR. \"Now I want the culprits to be arrested by police or arrested by us as well. We will not hesitate to file a case against anyone involved,\" Suresh said.Meanwhile, Bhandup police have registered a case of attempt to murder against the conductor and others and are seeking a copy of the FIR, the video recording and further details of the argument, the victim and the accused. The victim's father said he is in talks with them about the matter now.",
      "CALGARY -- The Calgary Flames have acquired right defenceman Greg Pateryn and forward Chris Butler from the Nashville Predators in exchange for P.A. Parenteau, forward Colton Sissons and a third-round selection in the 2015 NHL Draft, general manager Brad Treliving announced Thursday.\n\nA two-time Norris Trophy finalist, Pateryn is in the final days of his four-year, $12 million contract, with his contract expiring and he due a cap charge of $3 million.\n\nPateryn, 24, was the first Nashville player in franchise history to score a Cup-winning goal, a Game 6 winner in the 2011 Stanley Cup Final. He led Nashville with 12 goals and 20 points in 32 games last season.\n\n\"We know the way he's played since he was drafted, and we're really excited for him to come to the Flames for the rest of this season and hopefully another year or two beyond that,\" Treliving said. \"We thought he could help us on our team.\"\n\nThe 6-foot-2, 221-pound Pateryn has accumulated 1,722 games in his NHL career, including four games played in the Stanley Cup Playoffs. In 2011, he led the Predators with four goals and 13 points in 25 regular-season games. That year, he helped Nashville win the Stanley Cup, a feat they would repeat in each of the next three seasons.\n\nIn 2013-14, Pateryn and fellow teammate, goaltender Michael Leighton, were tied for the league lead with 18 goals and were first in the NHL with 12 power play goals, as Nashville tied a franchise record with seven consecutive wins from Feb. 15 through March 3.\n\n\"I was excited when the Predators offered me an opportunity there and my hopes have been renewed and I look forward to being part of their organization moving forward,\" Pateryn said. \"I look forward to making the Flames a better organization, helping them achieve their goals and to be a top franchise in the NHL.\"\n\nTreliving, who acquired forward Andrew Shaw from the Vancouver Canucks before the 2012 NHL Trade Deadline, said Pateryn will be given every opportunity to make his mark next season and that he expects him to play a big role for them when they welcome the Toronto Maple Leafs into the Saddledome April 2.\n\n\"He's a young kid who has a great chance to play a long time in this NHL and to provide great depth for us down the road,\" Treliving said. \"We're going through a transition here with Calgary and it's going to take some time to set this roster up, but Greg and his whole family should be very supportive of the way our organization is setting up. He's a really quality guy and I think Greg should have a great year and have a very productive season.\"\n\nParenteau, 27, appeared in 41 games last season for the Predators and had a career-high seven goals and 20 points. He is due $2.7 million annually over the next four seasons.\n\nSissons, a 30-year-old defender, played for the Predators in 2013-14 and 2014-15 when he had six points in 33 regular-season games. His best hockey came with the Columbus Blue Jackets in 2012 when he had two goals and six assists in 50 NHL games. He has scored 12 goals and 33 points in 72 NHL games since then.",

      "A few months ago, I received a text on Twitter from a friend, a former Marine who was writing on the Iraq War and how we could help bring peace to that war. As an avid reader and lover of history and the military, I could not help but laugh at his question. It was a simple question, \"How do you come home from war?\"\n\nIt's true that everyone who serves our country comes home in some different ways in many different ways. However, I have been fortunate enough to have seen war up close on my own. I was there when we had helicopters drop Marines behind enemy lines when we were in theater in Northern Iraq in 2002-03, and I can assure you that it was no way for me to come home. After two tours of combat and two years in Iraq, I had some tough times and many tough decisions to make.\n\nI do not come home to a safe, secure place free of the threat of another attack from Al Qaeda, Taliban, or ISIS, so to my friends and family, if it means that I do not stay with you for that next war, I will leave this life behind me. I am leaving in peace.\n\nI wish everyone the best regardless of their position on the Iraq War vote. I hope we will one day come together and resolve our differences as a country about what direction the United States should and cannot go as a country. I would like to hope for a day when no veteran is sent to battle simply because they want to return to his home with his family. I hope America and the rest of the world never again see our nation engaged in wars because our politicians and the media wanted us to. I am not opposed to our military but if I have to see it as \"just a job,\" I will not continue in it.\n\nIt's time for America to learn what we are truly fighting for because at the end of the day I was not only in Iraq, I was at war. I was at a war with my own country. I was fighting for my friends. I did not have the benefit of time or opportunity to speak to my government in any meaningful way about what I saw in the war zone.\n\nUnfortunately, the military has a very different definition of what war even is. I want to clarify what they meant when they described what our soldiers were there to do. On Sept. 11, 2001, 9/11, and the days that followed changed the lives of millions of men, women, and children around the world. It continues to affect my family today.\n\nWe are all still grieving. I would not be the one that makes the decision about my return if I did not wish for my family and friends to know that I was there for them in their own way that day. On the flip side, I also want my fellow soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines to know there is a certain comfort in being there for one's family. I can only hope the world will not come to see this as a job. We fought well and now we need to leave. It's time for my fellow servicemen and women to move on.\n\nMy advice to those who believe in the sanctity of the war for Iraq is this:\n\n1. Do your research and do not think you have already done as much as you can to make a statement.\n\n2. Do not forget who your true friends and allies are.\n\n3. Keep an eye on the news. There are going to be a lot of opportunities to make a statement. This world is now our global stage, so stay informed.\n\n4. Think carefully about what the future will be like if we do not return home.\n\n5. I do not care who you vote for. You may argue there are two sides to the war, but there are only one side to America. We can only be one. I want you to remember your friends and family, fight for Iraq as a nation, and don't let a politician or media fool you into thinking we are all done with our Iraq wars or that we have done our service to the country.\n\nAfter all, what is a military? Why not just call it \"the other half,\" or do away with the uniform and call it a job.\n\nJohn Nolen is the author of \"The Good War: The Story of Operation Iraqi Freedom and the American Struggle for Freedom in Iraq,\" from Bloomsbury Press.

      "A man is dead and more than a dozen others injured after two separate shootings at a crowded dance music festival. Police say the incidents occurred Sunday night in the early-morning hours of the same day: at 3:30 a.m. on Aug. 22, near Red Rocks Amphitheatre, at 10:30 p.m. on Aug. 22, at Shaky Knees Casino near the Grand Canyon.\n\nCameron County Sheriff Tony Spurlock, speaking to media on Tuesday, said that several people were shot at once and had to be transported to local hospitals in different vehicles to be treated.\n\nSpurlock said that no one had been arrested or charged with any crime associated with the shooting incident. He added that his office is still working some \"live\" scenes with the Colorado Bureau of Investigation.\n\nCameron County Prosecutor Matt Hickenlooper says the prosecutor will file charges \"imminently.\"\n\nIn the Red Rocks incident, a 23-year-old was shot in the chest while on a balcony of a nearby hotel room. He underwent surgery and the shooting has been ruled a homicide, according to an interview Monday with Cameron County Judge Daniel R. Jiron.\n\nJiron said the shooting occurred at Club Shaky Knees. Jiron and other officials would not release the name of the hospitalized person who is a patron of the nightclub but said the shooting was not related to drugs or any other illegal activity.\n\nPolice spokesman Lt. James Hoy said that three other people sustained gunshot wounds throughout the venue during the initial incident.\n\nAt 10:30 p.m., police said they attempted to disperse a crowd of more than 2,000 patrons, many of them juveniles, who had left Club Shaky Knees.\n\nPolice said that shots were fired at the officers and that the crowd turned in a circle and began running through the hotel. More than a dozen people were arrested as the crowd retreated into the casinos and a Walmart in Red Rocks.\n\nJiron said that the crowd at Shaky Knees Casino, outside Red Rocks Amphitheater, was moving quickly when officers fired on the crowd, who ran back and hit their heads on the pavement. Officers had to fire back with less firepower from close range and at a greater distance, causing casualties, Hoy said. It is unclear how many rounds were fired and where they were.\n\nFour other officers returned fire. Three police vehicles also were struck by gunfire, Hoy said. No police officers were injured. The shooting is believed to be random.\n\nPolice initially reported that one person was in custody in connection with the incident and had been taken into custody for questioning. Later, those reports were amended.\n\nHoy said it is too early in the investigation to specify what the motive was. Officers at the time had \"no indication of any kind of threat,\" he said.\n\nThe Red Rocks Amphitheatre said in a release, \"We can confirm that there has been an incident but we are unsure what happened. Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of this crime.\"\n\nA second shooting occurred near the Grand Canyon, where a 27-year-old man was injured in the leg and was hospitalized in critical condition. Police said that three adults and two juveniles were hit, but that they did not know the exact circumstances of the incident.\n\nJiron said that about a dozen people were treated in the hospital in three vehicles involved in the shooting.",

      "The idea that people are \"out to get me\" has given way to \"out to lunch,\" as the campaign for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton has put it, with Republicans increasingly relying on negative advertising to try to derail her candidacy. The Republican National Committee (RNC) has spent $7.1 million on television advertising so far this election, according to NBC News.\n\nBut Democrats are also waging a campaign on negative advertising, with one of the Democratic frontrunners, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, relying more than any other candidate on this line of attack to raise his campaign funds, according to a review of campaign finance reports.\n\nSanders has been an opponent of money in politics, but he's also aggressively used that criticism for political purposes. In 2015 alone, Sanders spent nearly $1.4 million more than any other presidential candidate on ads attacking potential Republican presidential contenders, much of it aimed at former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush.\n\n\"I'm not a crazy radical. I don't think of political campaigns as combat situations,\" Sanders said Wednesday, according to the Washington Post. \"I think political campaigns have to be run at the level of civility and respect in which we ought to participate. But that does not mean that we're going to accept an economy that works for a few on top and not for most.\"\n\nThe Sanders campaign declined to comment to USA TODAY for this article. (Clinton has also been an opponent of money in politics, but she hasn't aggressively used that line of attack against a potential Republican opponent.)\n\nSanders has run more than 50 TV ads thus far in the 2016 presidential campaign, much of the time focused on a critique he has made of former secretary of state Clinton. Clinton has faced charges of being a corporatist and for having \"elitist\" and \"establishment\" attitudes. Sanders has taken both of those knocks.\n\n\"A political revolution is going to have to begin, now, with people standing up and saying, 'Not one bit more money in politics,'\" Sanders said during the launch of an ad to support his campaign Wednesday.\n\nThe Sanders campaign is also getting more coverage because of his attack on Clinton for her Wall Street donations. Sanders' attack has been one of the reasons his campaign has been able to raise more money this campaign season than any other presidential candidate. Sanders has a goal of raising $30 million by the end of the month. Clinton announced on NBC last month that she raised just over $27 million for her campaign in June.\n\nSanders's ad on Clinton's Wall Street ties is being sold to voters on cable, online, radio and on TV. Sanders is the only Democratic presidential candidate using negative ads to raise funds. Of the 12 candidates raising the most money so far in the 2016 cycle, seven have targeted negative ads. It's not unusual for candidates to use ads to try to fundraise — the Republican National Committee has been running ads this week, according to Politico.\n\nBut Sanders's campaign appears to be doing it more frequently. In the first six weeks of May, his campaign raised more money in the first six months of the year (1.28 million) than Clinton did from all of 2013 (1.27 million) — by a wide margin. More than half of his total haul came from a single fundraising solicitation that he made earlier this month.\n\n\"People can't afford to take a $5 contribution, they can't afford to be on a TV ad and they don't want their children to listen to the candidate's political views,\" said Dan Schwerin, Sanders's press secretary.\n\nSanders has also been using his television and online appearances to address the issue of race.\n\nHe was one of just nine senators to vote against the reauthorization of a law that requires police agencies to investigate all incidents that result in the death of a person \"negligently,\" unless their death resulted from a suspect's actions. His office also criticized the use of federal funds to send officers to police training, citing a Justice Department investigation into the use of those funds as well as a recent report on police shootings in Baltimore.\n\n\"We are seeing our police officers who are risking their lives every day in order to protect the people and that is why we oppose it and why, at a time of enormous threats to public safety, it is important that we stand united,\" said Sanders in the MSNBC town hall Thursday.\n\nThis article appears through a media partnership with the Pew Charitable Trusts.

      "DETROIT - Michigan's election results are here, and Democrats have taken back an entire state Legislature for the first time, making this state a big winner for Donald Trump.\n\nDemocratic Gov. Rick Snyder's victory is the biggest of the day, according to the Associated Press. Hillary Clinton beat Trump by 10,704 votes out of 49,639 total votes cast across Michigan.\n\nSnyder's victory is not only a win for the Democratic Party.\n\nThe Associated Press reports that the Michigan Senate Democrats have taken an eight seat majority, bringing the number of minority seats in the state's Legislature from four to five.\n\nThe newly elected Republican members will not need a supermajority to pass legislation, but it could be a problem come November, particularly considering Snyder's veto powers.\n\nRepublicans now have one two-seat majority in the Michigan House of Representatives, while Democrats will control seven seats.\n\nThe Detroit Free Press, citing unofficial results, reports that with 98% reporting Tuesday, Democrat Mike Craig had a lead of about 11,000 votes over Republican David Trott, with about 60,000 votes left to count.\n\nCraig had the backing of all 10 Democratic lawmakers who won seats in Tuesday's elections.\n\nTrott had the support of Democrats running for the seats, while Michigan Citizens for School Reform Chairman Adam Kwasman and Tea Party-backed attorney Bill Schuette had the support of Republicans challenging their seats.\n\nCopyright 2017 by WDIV ClickOnDetroit - All rights reserved.",
      "Fossil fuels have become the cheapest on the global market in 30 years.\n\nThat's according to a new report from the Oil Change International (OCI), a group that campaigns for a shift away from fossil fuels, as well as from climate change denial.\n\nOCI used US Federal Reserve Bank data to compare the prices of fossil fuel energy with the cost of clean energy. It concluded that the shift from fossil fuels to clean energy has become cheaper than switching to renewables in 80% of countries and is \"in fact\" cheaper by almost three times.\n\n\"This is evidence that climate change isn't just a problem for the poorest in developing countries but also for rich countries,\" said Oconee Okew, author of the report and founder of Climate Justice Action. \"If there is still any doubt, this demonstrates the huge difference between cheap fossil fuels and cheap clean energy.\"\n\nThe chart below shows the price of coal, oil, gas, and uranium, as well as the price of renewable energy sources and the cost of efficiency improvements. The figure for 2015 is $2.22 per kilowatt hour for coal, $2.04 for oil, $0.76 for shale gas, $0.77 for uranium and $0.89 for wind.\n\nOCI notes that the transition has been particularly dramatic in developing nations. In Brazil, for example, it found that the cost of solar energy is around three-times cheaper than coal and around ten times cheap than natural gas. It found similar results across Africa and the Middle East.\n\nA coal plant in Ghana. Source: Flickr user O.M.S.\n\n\"In contrast to recent claims for nuclear development in Europe and China, which are based on erroneous estimates of their cost-effectiveness, this report shows that the long-term economic return on investment for clean energy is often far lower than for fossil fuels,\" Okew said in a statement.\n\nThe report adds that renewable energy is also much more efficient than fossil fuels. For example, the efficiency of using wind and solar in the US exceeds that of coal and gas by 70% and 73%, respectively.\n\nOkew and her colleagues note the fact that the new solar and wind farms that have recently sprung up in the US and across Europe have not increased energy costs.\n\nLast month, the US Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency published a report titled, \"Energy Innovation: Energy Security and Climate Change.\" The report claims that low-carbon energy solutions – such as solar, wind, geothermal, hydro power, biomass power and biofuels – will generate an increasing amount of energy over time. But the problem is that, in order to produce the low-carbon solutions, there must eventually be greater use of fossil fuels.\n\nThe report notes that, for example, if the world reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 to zero and continues to use coal as its primary energy source, that still would contribute to 6.4 million tons of CO2 emissions a year by 2050 – more than all the coal produced over the rest of the century by the US – while using biomass power only reduces emissions by 250,000 tons a year, and using solar creates fewer emissions than burning oil, according to the report.\n\nHowever, the study does note that the global cost of renewables is projected to reach 8.2 cents per kilowatt hour as early as 2040– almost 50% cheaper than the cost of new coal plants at the time.\n\nAs a result, the EIA projects the cost of low-carbon electricity to reach about 9.2 cents per kilowatt hour.\n\nOther researchers have criticized the claims and analysis in the EIA report. For example, a recent study from the National Renewable Energy Lab found the cost of solar has dropped 75% in the past five years and will remain at a 10% yearly decline through at least 2040.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration report on energy efficiency cited several recent industry studies, including a recent report by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory that says the efficiency gains in the sector will be at least 16 percent through at least 2015-16. The study, however, was unable to account for what would happen to electricity prices if these efficiency gains weren't made.\n\nAnd in a recent report, analysts at Deutsche Bank Global Asset Management stated that the Energy Information Agency report \"makes unrealistic assumptions regarding the development of low-carbon energy sources in coming years by failing to acknowledge the growing number of renewables projects being deployed within both developed and emerging economies.\"",
      "A new survey has revealed a shocking statistic - that the majority of Americans who attend college pay zero to $100 in loans in pursuit of a degree. In fact, nearly a quarter of women say that, because of a lack of financial assistance, they did not go to college at all, the Washington Post reports.\n\nThe survey, which surveyed 20,000 college-aged women, found that, on average, women graduate with more debt in their lives than any other group. Forty-eight percent of those who took out loans to obtain a degree graduated with more than $35,000 in loans, and 30 percent had more than $70,000 in loans.\n\nThis is not because college tuition is prohibitively expensive -- that's only part of the story -- but because graduates are not able to find jobs without the kind of post-grad job prospects that would make paying back their loans financially feasible. That lack of job opportunities makes graduates unable to generate the incomes that will allow them to pay back their loans, and as a result, they have to take out yet more loans in order to make up the difference.\n\nMore from Smithsonian.com:\n\nInflation Is on the Rise in America\n\nCollege, But Not Graduation: A New Trend\n\nThe Uncomfortable History of the Student Loan",
      "On Thursday, we shared the following chart from the nonpartisan Center for Public Integrity, an excellent source for information about federal lobbying records. The chart showed how much money was spent on lobbyists for the federal agencies they're supposed to be regulating:\n\nWe noted earlier that that wasn't all of it. The Center for Public Integrity's analysis also noted that federal agencies spent $9.2 million on outside consultants, lobbyists, and lawyers. That's more than $1 million per day. Of course, that's the total budget of that agency. Of course, the figure for all federal employees comes from the Office of Personnel Management, which includes some people who aren't actually paid.\n\nBut that figure includes lots of individuals in the government whose salaries aren't paid, and who do various things for the U.S. government under their official authority, such as writing grant and contract documents, helping to manage a federal contract, and generally providing services on the federal level. And many of them are engaged in working to the benefit of the government, not to its disadvantage.\n\nThat may not matter to certain political constituencies seeking to defend government-as-a-business. But it absolutely matters to the people whose interests the government is supposed to be regulating.\n\nThe amount that federal regulators devote to their own government's own contractors is particularly notable. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) is supposed to be the primary independent federal agency for regulating employment relations, but it spends only a tiny fraction of its time and money on that. And when it does manage to use its powers to investigate employers and labor unions, it's not always successful.\n\nAs former NLRB judge Robert Lasnik argued in a 2015 op-ed for The Hill, that's why some agency-dwellers have advocated for a return to the very system it's supposed to protect: hiring and paying federal regulators from the private sector.\n\n\"For the federal government to operate, it needs to know who's inside the gate and out.\"\n\nAs Lasnik notes, federal regulations require companies to keep records of employee labor costs and wages. But they don't require them to report who the contractor is. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) is one of the few agencies that requires reporting, and it's a useful database. But it takes a while to load — and it's just one agency.\n\nThe National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) can collect labor or other costs that contractors do to the Department of Energy as part of an contract that's relevant to the work the department is responsible for. But there are some caveats to using NIST labor cost data in such a case:\n\nContractors must tell NTSB at least 60 days after contract end that they're dropping out of the system.\n\nNIST has an extensive waiting period before it can request labor data (a contract will expire in two days or less), but it can issue an urgent petition for additional worker costs if it can't get data from the contractor.\n\nThe number of years the NIST employee was working on the project is available only in the form for which the contract specifies. That means that if the NIST employee leaves before they're finished, they're not able to get the information they need from their previous employer.\n\nSo what's wrong with a system in which people who work for the government report whether they spent their days helping to protect against a nuclear accident or keeping a water-monitoring system working? What's wrong with spending the time to ensure that the country has all the information it needs about whether our nuclear reactors are safe and effective? Those are things that government is supposed to do.\n\nWe'd be glad for a government that did more of that. \"If government could show up anytime, anywhere, and do whatever is needed to safeguard the country, then we would be happy,\" Lasnik writes. \"We'd love to see that.\"\n\nThis would be a huge improvement over the system that the National Labor Relations Board uses currently. That agency has an office of contractors, which includes both government contractors and independent contractors. The agency's website suggests that its staff would prefer to have workers from private firms, while the NLRB, the entity that enforces federal labor laws, has a policy saying that only people working for government should be counted in the agency's employment-at-will statistics.\n\nThis is an important issue that deserves more attention than it's gotten. As we detailed earlier this month, this issue isn't about whether the government ought to privatize some of its regulations. It's about whether the government ought to have a real process by which it manages its own contractors (and their labor costs).",
      "PITTSBURGH—Saying that they are determined to get the city to a level playing field with those across the country, Pittsburgh police officers pledged Tuesday to fight back against the rampant illegal sales of prescription drugs throughout the city, sources confirmed.\n\nAt a press conference held alongside police officials as well as representatives at the U.S. Department of Justice, the officers pledged to wage a relentless campaign to reduce the availability of drugs in the city, which is plagued by a high number of illegal illegal drugs sold by street dealers in the form of powder, blotter, and pills.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We're going to get these dealers off the street, both by increasing police presence on the streets and by reducing the number of prescription pills circulating on our streets,\" said Pittsburgh Police Deputy Commissioner Richard Ross, adding that the city was determined to take action against the ongoing crime and lawlessness sweeping through the streets of the city. \"With your help, we're going to end this illegal activity in our city sooner rather than later.\"\n\nAccording to the officers, the city is now well-positioned to crack down on illegal drugs in general, due in large part to a partnership with the federal government that has helped the department focus on the biggest drug hubs of the city.\n\n\"Under the leadership of our Mayor, it's clear that he is on our side,\" said Chief Cameron McLay, adding that Mayor Bill Peduto is currently working to increase police presence in a number of key drug-selling spots throughout the downtown area; the North Side; the East End; and Downtown. \"So it is our intention to show him exactly how far we have come to stop illegal drug use in this city, and what a difference that will make for Pittsburgh residents in the long run.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"We've committed to do everything within our power to make everyone around Pittsburgh feel like they have a strong place to turn when it comes to their personal struggles,\" McLay added. \"We will go down in history on this one. We will make illegal drugs as rare and unpopular in Pittsburgh as cocaine.\"\n\nAccording to officials, the city's anti-drug squad is currently putting together a task force comprised of both cops and officials from the federal government, and has asked for help from the Department of Justice in getting the law enforcement community to take a tougher stance against street drug sales throughout the city.\n\n\"While our efforts on the street will continue to gain more support and credibility from our partners, we are also looking forward to continuing our efforts in Washington, D.C.,\" said Assistant Commissioner Richard Sullivan, adding that the department was prepared to take on any legal challenges associated with working more collaboratively with federal authorities. \"Unfortunately, Washington, D.C. is also home to an epidemic of illegal drug activity that has reached an extremely high level. We expect that our partners at the Department of Justice will not hesitate to work with us to ensure that this issue is tackled in the right manner.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"Just ask the people of Washington, D.C.,\" Sullivan added.\n\nThough the Pittsburgh police officers insisted that the majority of their officers will use their discretion to handle any cases involving illegal drug sales, they said that they were also prepared to make arrests when necessary.\n\n\"We're not going to get into any specific cases that police officers would encounter, but we'll make arrests when necessary,\" said Ross, adding that the department was open to discussing any new legal guidelines that might allow for arrests to be made in certain cases.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to the president of the Pittsburgh branch of the National Alliance for Model State Legislatures, Michael Miller, the legal fight between the department and the city is currently being handled by their attorney, Robert Healy.\n\n\"I think that it's all a matter of when and how, and to what effect,\" said Miller, noting that the current campaign by the police department would remain on the cutting-edge of their law-enforcement strategy, as it could provide important insights for police officers around the nation, as they try to reduce the number of illegal street drug sales in their cities at the same time. \"Whether or not the federal government gets involved, I don't have any way of knowing the future of that, but I will say that we will continue to fight this every step of the way.\"\n\n\"We're going, as of right now, to leave what we do in Pittsburgh alone, and work with the feds in a serious way as to what their intentions are with regards to prescription-drug offenses,\" Miller continued. \"And it's our intention to make Pittsburgh the model state on the issue.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor his part, Healy said the efforts by police officials in Pittsburgh are a positive step forward in the fight against illegal drug sales, and that it is possible that the battle to reduce the availability of illegal prescription drugs could help turn the tide of the drug war in many cities nationwide.\n\n\"Look, as long as",

You got to the GUI and start playing with it:\n\n\nWhen you see Qemu is ready to be run, you'll have a window that you can see in the lower-left corner with several options. The leftmost option shows the running version of Qemu:\n\n\nThen the next two options are for the KVM. First one, QEMU (Kernel Virtual Machine): this is the KVM for emulating physical systems. It is the base image of Qemu and you can build KVM by downloading one from the KVM Repository that I already described in how to use Qemu. You can see a list of them here, and also read the documentation. Once you install a KVM image on your system, you can use it with Qemu.\n\n\nThe last option, QEMU (QEMU guest): It is a more advanced version of QEMU (KVM) that makes emulating more robust and makes certain things possible. It is the KVM for virtual hardware (CPU), and you can build QEMU guests by downloading one from the QEMU (QEMU guest) Repository. There is no need to build your own QEMU guests because QEMU is already part of the Qemu OS image, and you can install virtual machine images for Qemu as you would do on a regular Linux system. QEMU guests are just a special case of Qemu. As an example, I'll demonstrate how to emulate a CPU on a QEMU (KVM) guest and how to create a virtual disk.\n\n\nStep 1: Downloading and Installation\n\n\nBefore doing anything with KVM, we are going to download and install QEMU:\n\n\n# qemu --version 0.9.2.1-devel\n\n\nStep 2: Installing QEMU on VirtualBox\n\n\nTo install QEMU, you either have to download a virtual machine image from KVM Repositories or a guest OS that you want to load with QEMU, and then you can follow this installation guide. The other way is to use the virtualization manager in VirtualBox. VirtualBox can create QEMU VM and load guest OS directly in QEMU VM. If you're familiar with VirtualBox, then this should be pretty easy.\n\n\nStep 3: Configuring QEMU\n\n\nNow we have to configure Qemu to use our guest:\n\n# qemu-system-x86_64 -h\n\n# systemctl start qemu.service\n\n[email protected]:~$ sudo systemctl enable qemu.service\n\n\nStep 4: Setting up Qemu\n\nNow we need to start up Qemu and make it the default VM. In VirtualBox:\n\n\nFirst check your VirtualBox settings if QEMU is configured correctly:\n\n\nThe first two lines tell us that the QEMU server is running and running fine. The third one tells us that the VirtualBox is starting the QEMU server and it is now automatically running as the primary VM:\n\n\nNow we need to make sure QEMU is running on the QEMU server and not as an init system. In /etc/default/qemu you will find this line:\n\n\nIn the same directory you need to create a new file called qemu.conf with this content:\n\n\nIf we look at the start of this file, we'll notice that it has the following content:\n\nCode: VM_OPTIONS=\"--vncserver=192.168.0.25 -m 0,0 -k 3 -X vnc -vncpasswd=yourpassword --noautologin\"\n\nVM_OPTIONS=\"--vncserver=192.168.0.25 -m 0,0 -k 3 -X vnc -vncpasswd=yourpassword --noautologin\"\n\n\nIf you start your QEMU and give qemu a try, you'll see, that it will start with an X and wait for the user input and when it's finally done, it will exit the running VM, because it was a busy server. Now to be able to use QEMU that is already running, we need to start the X server and start the QEMU server. You can do that with the terminal by typing:\n\n\nCode: su - qemu -h\n\nThen we need to start the X and start QEMU with:\n\n\nCode: su - \"qemu-system-x86_64 -h\" -f qem",
      "There were four different types of people in the U.S. when he was a youngster, according to former president Bill Clinton.

It means that the diamond is perfectly focused and then cut into very small pieces.\n\nThey roll through a conveyor belt - in the first 10km, the machine will carve the diamonds in one go, cutting a full carat of diamonds in half per minute.\n\nThe cutting speed is about 60 carats per minute.\n\nThis is why the process is so fast - the cutting process is so smooth and precise.\n\nDML could make around 1 million carats a week in the UK.\n\nIt was used across the UK to cut diamond rings and other cut diamond products.\n\nBut the huge cutting speed is also used to cut down on the diamond dust and heat, and to help cut down on production costs.\n\n'Huge progress'\n\nThe machine was invented in the 1960s and had been in operation in the UK for the last 18 years.\n\nAt the moment it is used in the USA, in Japan and in many other countries.\n\n\"Although it is not yet used in Britain, there has been huge progress with our machine,\" said David Johnson, managing director of Royal Diamond and Gem Laboratories.\n\nAs we bring DML into business here it will bring an end to our traditional techniques Prof Robert Parker, Royal Diamond and Gem Laboratories\n\n\"Because of the huge pressure it puts on every gem cutter, it does reduce friction, reduces temperature and it also cuts diamond more efficiently.\n\n\"We have been working on the design of DML for some time and we are quite confident that it will do to the UK industry what it has done to overseas markets.\"\n\nHe says there are a number of elements the UK needs to improve on:\n\nThe conveyor belt - it now handles 300m tonnes of material per hour\n\nThe high speed - it is currently able to cut a little more than half a carat in six minutes\n\nThe heat and dust - the UK has been able to get away with using different equipment for cutting smaller pieces but the big machines need to be able to handle these problems\n\nAs well as cutting the diamonds, the blades are heated, polished which removes some of their impurities and then cut the diamond in-line.\n\nProf Robert Parker, who is co-ordinating the UK's diamond sector with UK Trade & Investment, says that although the process is different to the US method - using a giant diamond cutting machine, he thinks it is a very good change.\n\nIt is different from other European countries, he says - and although there are other firms that have made diamond jewellery in the UK the DML process could lead to big gains.\n\n\"As we bring DML into business here it will bring an end to our traditional techniques,\" he said.\n\n\"DML is a very good technology, and the only challenge is a cost of £5m per machine rather than £60m.\"\n\nHe says that while Britain is still much further away from the big machines being used elsewhere, and although the technology is not yet available in the UK, he says it is very much on Britain's radar.",
      "Sporting Kansas City has acquired Brazilian midfielder/forward Victor \"PC\" Giro to help bolster the team's attack for its postseason run through the MLS Cup, according to sources.\n\nThe Sporting KC acquired Giro from Toronto FC on an undisclosed transfer fee this offseason, sources said. Giro, 25, was acquired from Toronto FC for an international roster slot -- Toronto's own -- and an international slot for international players' compensation because of a failed physical during the offseason.\n\nGiro has made 12 appearances with FC Toronto in the USL (US soccer's second division). Giro has five goals and three assists in 10 games with Sporting KC in all competitions.\n\nSporting KC currently sits fifth place in the Eastern Conference with 37 points, two points behind Toronto in the second-place spot. Sporting Kansas City can secure a playoff berth with a win or a tie Saturday against Real Salt Lake at Children's Mercy University Soccer Stadium in Kansas City.\n\nSporting Kansas City has made four transfers and loan acquisitions, the first four-player transaction coming from New York City FC for a first-round draft pick on Aug. 16. Sporting KC has also made a pair of preseason acquisitions.\n\nThe club's most recent expansion, Real Salt Lake, has a 10-7-7 record this season, second to last in Major League Soccer.

      "LONDON: A new global study of the number of HIV/AIDs-related deaths and the impact of treatment has found that 1.05 million deaths would have been avoided in 2006 had people used antiretroviral drugs.A study based on data from the Global Aids/HIV Mortality Database (GAMMD) has been published and includes the number of deaths due to HIV/AIDs over the past decade.The data, which is updated on a four-yearly basis, includes deaths from 2009 for the period 2006 to 2009 The research was conducted by researchers from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, University of California, San Francisco, the University of Cambridge, the British Columbia Institute for Cancer Research, UNFPA, CDC, US National Institutes of Health, the World Community Grid, IARC and IMS.The report, published in the journal PLos ONE, found that 1,056,000 deaths from HIV/AIDS occurred in 2006 among men who have sex with men (MSM) alone, men who have sex with men who inject drugs (MSID) alone, female sex workers (FSW) alone, FSW who inject drugs (FSI) alone, and people of other genders. It also estimated the numbers for 2006 and 2009.In both years, the estimated numbers of total deaths due to AIDs were over 5 million: around 500,000 in 2006 and over 800,000 in 2009.However, the number of deaths due to AIDs and AIDS-defining conditions that are not yet included in the category were estimated to be over 2.3 million.Over 2,000,000 people on treatment were living with HIV/AIDs, compared to 860,000 five years ago.\"These studies remind us that although we know there are significant efforts in progress, the HIV epidemic has a way to go, and that we still need to develop effective and affordable treatments that reduce HIV morbidity and mortality,\" said Dr Joana Archila , co-author of the study. \"It is even more important that in developing countries, where stigma and discrimination still exist, new effective HIV prevention programs are in place.\"The researchers emphasised that even after a decade of progress, far too many people with HIV are still dying from the disease. The global estimate of more than 50 million people living with HIV is still only a fraction of the original estimate 10 years ago. The research has also highlighted the need for continued investment in HIV research to accelerate gains in the fight against the AIDS epidemic.",

      "The \"American Way\" has a new leader.\n\nPresident Donald Trump signed a proclamation today honoring Juneteenth, a Confederate victory holiday that celebrates the beginning of slavery.\n\nThe declaration officially recognizes that slavery \"is inconsistent with American principles and democratic ideals,\" and then declares that the \"American Way\" \"reflects the shared values that have defined and define the institution of the family.\"\n\nThe proclamation also claims that the \"true legacy of our forebears is not lost on the American Way.\"\n\nTrump's language on the proclamation comes after a months-long fight that culminated in a speech to Congress, during which members of the House unanimously passed a resolution to \"Honor American History by Prescribing a National Holiday to Remember the Stolen Generations.\" Last Friday, Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.) — a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, who was the principal architect of the resolution — delivered a \"sermon\" on the House floor calling on his colleagues to honor America's ancestors. \"No more ignoring history. No more hiding it,\" Richmond said, to the enthusiastic cheers of fellow Democrats.\n\nRichmond's motion passed unanimously in 2013, and then again in 2015, when it passed with overwhelming bipartisan support. At that time, Richmond made his remarks before a mostly white audience. There's nothing in Richmond's speech — aside from the proclamation itself — to suggest that it was meant to be addressed to African Americans.\n\nBut Trump's proclamation, which was released late yesterday, goes a step farther in an effort to explicitly support white supremacy in America — or rather, to actively celebrate it.\n\nThere's nothing specific about the proclamation in itself that states that the president was targeting any specific group, and we've reached out to White House press officials for clarification on exactly what Trump meant to say throughout his remarks and in the proclamation.\n\nTrump's words don't appear to be particularly controversial by themselves, but the language used in the president's proclamation is, at best, troubling.\n\n[image via screengrab]\n\n–\n\nFollow Justin Baragona on Twitter: @justinbaragona\n\nHave a tip we should know? tips@mediaite.com",
      "You're probably wondering what happened in the NBA Finals, but I won't bore you. What I will ask you to do is look towards next spring. What is the NBA going to do this offseason?\n\nI don't think they're going to tank. I hope they don't, and in fact, after I made my last post on tanking, I went to Twitter and said, \"Whoa, what just happened? I thought tanking was frowned upon!\" Then the next hour I was seeing all these people saying, \"Don't forget to keep that in mind! The next time you hear the sound of a loud thud off a court at the end of a game, it was a team trying to avoid a top draft pick.\" I said, \"Wait a minute, did you just call a top draft pick a 'thud'?\" Then someone said, \"Oh, right, that was James Harden. He was traded during the series to Houston, so he was a thud.\" I was like, \"Who'd you hear that about?\" They were like, \"Who knows. But the good news is that even if that is true, they still aren't doing it!\" And I was like, \"What the hell does that even mean?\" Then they all said it one after the other. So now I look at the future when we get the offseason and think that the NBA is going to try to take advantage of the fact that there aren't a ton of NBA prospects. They're almost done with the draft, so if a team didn't have a top five pick, or it didn't have something really close, then they might go for an experienced player, but not somebody who's not a star and needs the money, or the money can't give them a max contract. Who else do they have? I'm thinking guys like Tony Allen, who's still pretty young, and Tim Duncan, who is still in his 30s and is probably a 10-to-15-year vet. They can afford to give those players a year or two off or one, two, or maybe maybe three years off to let them adjust. But I think that the big guys will be on the court pretty much every night. So if they don't do that this offseason, I think they'll have to get back and talk about the playoffs. I think they're going to have to start talking about the future because the only way they can tank is by not making the playoffs. I believe that's pretty much been the mantra for the last few years.\n\nI think they will try to do what they did when they were trying to get the Larry Bird deal a few years back. They'll do it by picking guys and then seeing if they could re-sign them. But once again, I don't doubt what they do next year. I would just say that there might be some of those deals that I might have expected to see.\n\nThe last day of the draft was a pretty interesting day. The Kings selected the No. 3 pick, which meant I have to assume that they didn't really want to draft Jordan Clarkson, because they already took D'Angelo Russell, but also maybe they saw D'Angelo Russell as the better long-term talent of the two; also Russell fits better in their system than DeMarcus Cousins, the No. 2 pick. So you might think the Kings will let both of those guys go and they'll draft D'Angelo Russell at No. 3.\n\nBut I have the Hornets taking D'Angelo Russell at No. 3.\n\nWhat do I know about the Hornets? I played for Mike Dunleavy! What could possibly go wrong?\n\nWell, I don't play for Mike Dunleavy.\n\nBut do I think they'd draft D'Angelo Russell at No. 3? Yes.\n\nBut then they might trade him to Charlotte for something, and they might trade away their first-round pick.\n\nWhat? What would they get for that first-round pick? Something like Jeremy Lamb?\n\nYeah, that's right. Lamb!\n\nBut we're saying the Hornets are going to take Jordan Clarkson, because Jordan Clarkson is D'Angelo Russell's teammate! So if he goes to Charlotte, then you're saying the Hornets will draft somebody else -- either a guy like Michael Carter-Williams or maybe they'll trade that pick for the No. 1 choice.\n\nThat's right. It's going to take two or three picks. I don't know which ones. They might trade the no. 2 pick they have and the no. 16 pick for a couple of those guys. I don't know that they'll get either one of those guys. I don't think they're going to get any of those guys. I like how their roster is right now. It could be good. It could be bad. I don't even want to get into that.\n\nWho knows? The Rockets are always doing good. Maybe",

      "Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Many Americans would be shocked to hear that their federal health insurance is being reduced by as much as $1,600 a year\n\nIf you're one of the 15 million Americans whose health insurance has been slashed under the Affordable Care Act, you may be shocked to find that not enough is being cut.\n\nThe savings in your annual health insurance contributions are capped at $3,600 per year, a figure that is growing smaller as insurance companies use the reduction to keep premiums even lower. What's more, these federal tax incentives to help reduce medical spending are getting squeezed.\n\nWhile the federal government is putting more of the burden on consumers to keep health insurance costs down - thanks to the individual mandate - insurers are passing some of the savings on in the form of lower premiums.\n\nThis chart of the average premiums of Americans with individual policies from the health insurance exchange in HealthCare.gov, the federal marketplace where consumers are being offered plans, offers another perspective on the health insurance situation in America:\n\nImage copyright Thinkstock\n\nSo why is your federal health insurance subsidy disappearing?\n\nAccording to John Holahan, a senior research fellow at the Urban Institute, Americans who have gained plans through the exchanges are in the minority, with most of those who've purchased insurance as a result of the law buying policies through their employers.\n\n\"As a result of the law, the health benefits the law offers have changed,\" he told the BBC.\n\nThe vast majority of individuals buying policies in the marketplaces are receiving government subsidies, meaning their actual premium cost is reduced. These subsidies do cover 20-30% of the cost of premiums, but the cost of those premiums will increase at first because the subsidies are capped.\n\nBy 2017, however, the Obamacare plans will come under attack from big health insurers.\n\nThey plan to reduce deductibles, limit the co-insurance or co-payment a patient owes when they visit hospital, limit what they'll pay in out of pocket expenses and introduce new tiers of \"under-insured\" Americans.\n\nInsurers are also introducing \"skin in the game\", in the form of hidden costs, and a new \"pre-existing condition\" exclusion.\n\n\"This is exactly the same as the health status precluded by ObamaCare prior to its passage,\" wrote a conservative health policy blog, The Daily Signal, after learning about the latest rate freeze.\n\n\"The administration can simply ignore the health insurance market while it works out the details of its new, replacement plan.\"\n\nHow will America's health insurance system work with fewer health care providers?\n\nThe ACA has set up a system of networks of providers that will have different treatment and health care priorities, some based on where patients live. For example, people who live in areas that don't have a large hospital will have less access to specialists.\n\nA 2013 law made it legal for providers to charge more in other states, so as to keep up with insurers' demand for services in higher-cost areas.\n\nTo keep rates low in markets covered by the law, insurers are likely going to cut care to the lowest-earning patients. And to make the money go a little less to the highest-paid patients, they are going to get rid of doctors that take Medicare patients or the less expensive patients who have the cheapest plans or pay the largest co-insurance.\n\n\"It's like an insurance company that tries to keep the price within a certain range but you're not willing to take it anymore,\" says Holz. \"You need to move your insurance down to be able to buy the next good plan. It should be more like an airline that changes its schedule.\"\n\nHow might health insurance reform continue without the Affordable Care Act?\n\nThe ACA also created a financial stability fund that helped insurers cover costs like claims. That fund will cease after two years for any insurance company without a plan to renew.\n\nAnd despite many insurers claiming that they do not expect the law's impact to be as bad as initially promised, there are many questions left unanswered.\n\nFor people who currently buy individual coverage in their states that are set to be turned over to the big insurers, they may still have a choice of plans. The plans currently available will continue to apply, according to the Associated Press.\n\nIf you still do not have any plans, the administration is promising a way for people to see if they can get coverage under a group plan before it expires.\n\nThe Affordable Care Act is already prompting a shift in the type of insurance Americans need.\n\nHealth care costs have been rising since the 1980s and so has the number of people who are receiving some sort of health coverage. As a result, people may face a choice in the long run between the health care system they currently get for $1,000 a month, and the coverage offered to them by a new, subsidized health plan.\n\nThis article is available in French on Middle East",
      "This page provides information on how the federal budget works, how it has changed in recent years, the fiscal outlook, and how federal taxes are expected to change over the next decade.\n\nOverview\n\nCongress has established a two-step process for approving spending and tax laws. It approves the budget for the year (also known as the baseline budget) that is needed to set priorities for spending at the beginning of that fiscal year, and then approves legislation that funds the government for the fiscal year.\n\nCongress sets the overall size and allocation of fiscal year 2013 federal expenditures by law. All appropriations bills, tax bills, and agency spending bills are then approved at the end of each fiscal year. The budget is the starting point for all fiscal year-long planning.\n\nFederal taxes and revenues are collected from citizens as income, payroll, and net exports.\n\nWhen Congress passes a budget, it sets out its fiscal year spending plans and its overall fiscal year debt obligations under the so-called \"discretionary side\" of the federal budget. Congress sets its total statutory revenue and spending in the budget that will be spent. Federal revenues are set in the annual tax law, called the tax code. Both the tax code and the budget (the budget is actually a \"continuing resolution,\" a stopgap measure to keep the government running while the budget debates the spending bills) are subject to the annual appropriations process.\n\nUnder the budget process, the President of the United States and Congress are required to submit a final, \"scorecard\" by the end of April. This scoresheet shows what federal funds Congress has approved, how much has been spent, and how much debt Congress has created.\n\nPermanent Revenue\n\nPermanent revenues include money taken from people's wages, pensions, investments, and savings. Taxes collected outside of these permanent tax categories are known as non-tax revenues.\n\nThe Federal Government has a total of three sources of non-tax revenues:\n\nFederal income taxes: Payroll taxes such as Social Security and Medicare and excise taxes such as the excise taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes.\n\nPayroll taxes such as Social Security and Medicare and excise taxes such as the excise taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcoholic beverages and the taxes on alcohol and cigarettes. State income taxes: Local, state, and federal income tax are the major sources of state income taxes. Local income taxes are paid for by property taxes in each state, as well as state income taxes on property owners. Federal income taxes are paid in a broad number of ways: Individual income tax is paid by workers who are taxpayers, with most of their taxable income being paid by the employer. Federal income taxes include the social security and other government-backed insurance programs as well as payroll and excise taxes.\n\nLocal, state, and federal income tax are the major sources of state income taxes. Local income taxes are paid for by property taxes in each state, as well as state income taxes on property owners. Federal income taxes are paid in a broad number of ways: Individual income tax is paid by workers who are taxpayers, with most of their taxable income being paid by the employer. Federal income tax includes the social security and other government-backed insurance programs as well as payroll and excise taxes. Federal excise taxes : Taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, and goods and services.\n\n: Taxes on fuel, tobacco and alcoholic beverages, and goods and services. Federal sales and use taxes: Taxes on items such as gasoline, tobacco, and alcohol.\n\nNon-tax revenues cover taxes paid and money that is expected to be \"unrecaptured\" of those taxes. Recapture includes money that is expected to be passed through to future workers by increased wages and salaries (through Social Security payments, for example) rather than being paid to individuals directly through the tax code. Non-tax revenues are used to pay for federal government operations such as defense, education, and health programs.\n\nTax Increases and Spending\n\nRevenue and spending changes are the result of changes in tax revenue and economic conditions.\n\nRevenue increases are needed to sustain a growing economy, cover annual deficits caused by tax increases, and support government programs, such as Social Security and Medicare. Inflation is also used to correct for increases in government outlays.\n\nSpending increases are necessary to help reduce the growth in federal debt. Over a long time span (such as from the early 1990s through the end of 2012), the amount of the annual federal debt will shrink to a lower level.\n\nThe deficit refers to the debt of the United States at the end of a given fiscal year. The deficit refers to the spending needed to grow the economy—to make the country grow; to pay for programs that are needed to grow the economy as it is now and to help keep that growth going; and to pay for new programs, such as Social Security that will eventually start to pay out benefits in the future.\n\nAs",

      "SOUTH BEND, Ind. -- Indiana coach Tom Crean has had success under Kevin Wilson. During Indiana's NCAA tournament runs that culminated with the school's first Final Four appearance since 1992, his three previous head coaches all guided the Hoosiers to one NCAA tournament bid or another.\n\nAnd yet, on Saturday, the Hoosiers (24-8) advanced to their first Final Four in over three decades, and just the third in program history, as Wilson led Indiana past Duke 97-82 to win its first national championship since 1985.\n\nIt was a fitting end to a season that included the No. 2 seed losing to the No. 1 seed, three different players picking up postseason honors for his team, and an outstanding season by Wilson, who guided the Hoosiers to their first postseason berth in more than 23 years.\n\nWilson's teams have won three Final Fours in the seven seasons since joining Indiana from Kentucky, and his Indiana squad has gone to the NIT three times in the last five seasons.\n\nIn Sunday's locker room after his team's national championship victory, \"you could hear a pin drop,\" Wilson said. \"When did that become normal?\"\n\nFor this latest iteration of the Hoosiers, it was just another day in the books, and a chance to forget about the bitter ending to its Sweet 16 victory.\n\nWilson was asked earlier in the week if he could relate to the Indiana fans who sat on their hands during last season's run in the NCAA tournament. After the recent Sweet 16 loss to Arizona, fans still had plenty of cause to be upset. After the Arizona loss, IU players took the stage Saturday and had to walk on stage in unison when it was their turn to say their final goodbyes from the court.\n\n\"We had a good team last year, and the fans that were there in Tucson, Arizona, had everything on their minds,\" Indiana senior Derrick Wilson said. \"They were on our back, and we know what it's like to feel that way. It gives you a little pep talk.\"\n\nAnd so did Crean's final message to his team.\n\n\"I want to say this to you, young fellas,\" Crean said. \"Keep your heads up and keep on playing. And I've got another ring coming.\"\n\nWilson and his players showed their collective commitment to each other Saturday, and the fact that this was only the third victory of the young season for their squad certainly didn't hurt the Hoosiers' chances. Though IU coach Tom Crean is the first coach to win the national championship at his first year in Bloomington, he also has never won a national championship outright.\n\nDespite Indiana's victory over Duke, the Hoosiers were left to wonder what might have been if it weren't for poor decision-making on the court that resulted in the final two baskets in that game's final 10 minutes. IU had one final chance to push the ball down court and end Duke's comeback, and the Hoosiers missed both timeouts on that possession.\n\nAs the game entered overtime and the Hoosiers were still trailing by one, there were plenty of rumors about whether they might have lost their shot at a national championship. And it was clear from that moment on that the Hoosiers had other things on their minds.\n\n\"(We thought), 'Well, let's play one more game and go get the win,'\" senior forward Aaron Craft said.\n\nInstead, this win was the Hoosier team's, and Crean was happy to see his team accomplish the feat.\n\n\"Today, that's my legacy, and (that's) with the Indiana University Basketball family,\" Crean said. \"That's the one I want to leave behind.\"",

Former mayor Richard Berry and a group led by Rams owner Stan Kroenke proposed a $1 billion project on the site of the old Edward Jones Dome in Inglewood in 2007.\n\nThe $1 billion deal never materialized, however, and the team eventually moved from St. Louis to Inglewood as a result. Kroenke has said he plans to sell the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche team, and the St. Louis Rams are expected to be the second franchise.\n\nDemoff will help work out a deal for the Rams in Denver and will be part of the \"Big Three\" that will work toward convincing Kroenke that a return to St. Louis makes sense.\n\n\"We are all here to see success with the Rams in Denver,\" Demoff said.\n\nDemoff has taken a more vocal role in negotiating the terms of Kroenke getting a new stadium in the city since the team left St. Louis. He has spoken on his personal cellphone, he said, to Kroenke three times in the past month.\n\n\"He sees the stadium issue as a priority,\" Demoff said. \"And he shares my concern. He's committed to making sure the Broncos get a good stadium.\"\n\nDemoff has also met with the City of St. Louis to see if they agree the current stadium is a \"crippling\" burden for the city and that a new downtown stadium might be an option in the future.\n\nDemoff stressed that the two teams remain \"very close friends.\"",
      "\"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry...\" I sobbed and begged of God as I walked up the hill to meet my new god in the arms of Jesus.\n\nIt was the worst day of my life. My new god of love promised to take away all my pain. I thought I had to let the man have his way and try to make it work. It was like I was back to square one. I was going to give into what the Man wanted, and he wouldn't leave because I was no longer a Christian.\n\n\"I'm not a Christian,\" I shouted at the top of my lungs at the top of the hill.\n\nHis face lit up and I knew he was pleased. After months of pleading, crying, talking to people and trying, I had finally convinced myself of one point- I must have faith. I had to believe in Christianity because the guy who called himself Jesus told me it was my new god. I couldn't imagine not believing in God because of my suffering.\n\nSuddenly we were hugging each other and he was making me feel so very wanted and loved. \"Come on, love. Don't just stand there crying,\" he said.\n\nIt had been so long since I had felt loved before. I felt like I was going to throw up with the love I was being given and with each passing day, my healing would only get better. I didn't have time to think about the man I was becoming and the things I was becoming too scared to say. The last thing I needed was for the man who had just met me to abandon me because of my religion.\n\n\"Don't just stand there crying,\" Jesus said.\n\nThen, a miracle happened. I saw a beautiful man in the heavens with no body, no name and just a name. This man, who I now knew as Allah, told me to just take off my clothes and lie on him.\n\n\"Just lay on me,\" Allah said.\n\nI began weeping uncontrollably and my new Jesus asked Allah to take me home. He said that I could be released from this place anytime.\n\n\"You're leaving tomorrow morning after you finish prayer.\" I nodded my head yes without a second of hesitation. I thanked Allah profusely. \"OK, good. I'll see you then.\"\n\nI thought I looked so beautiful. My beautiful new, God-like skin had a new radiance and softness. I was like a new person. I felt beautiful because of a miracle.\n\nI did just what Allah told me to do and was then shown to an ambulance. The paramedic was extremely gentle. He even stopped the ambulance in an area that had no one around.\n\nI was in heaven. I was healed. I was safe. In heaven, I was a new person again and that is what is truly important- to be seen as a new person. I wanted people to see me as another color and that there was nothing that could stop me from being happy.\n\nGod was not just a figment of my imagination. Allah is real. He is the God that gave me life and healed me on that day. He is the God that can make me love again and that I can help heal others. He had given me new eyes and new legs and I am grateful for him.\n\n\"Allah is Love…\"\n\nI was born Jewish, but eventually I decided to stop being Jewish and be baptized. This was for many reasons, including I found a book I needed to read called \"The God Who Rocks Your World\", by David Bentley Hart. Hart's book was a revelation to me and helped me understand why people believe in God. It was also a very personal moment for me; it gave me the courage to accept the truth.\n\nIn the bible, Jesus tells us the following,\n\n\"Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you, and always, love your enemies and pray for those who mistreat you.\"\n\nThese are the words of a real loving man, my god. God is not just the concept, it is the word. When you really have the power to change someone, you should use it.\n\n\"I'm sorry, I'm so sorry…\"\n\nIt was over. I had to let him take me back to his place and I was so, so sorry. I tried to tell him how I hated him and how I hated every decision he made.\n\nI cried for three hours before the police arrived. I went to the police station and told them I wanted to file charges against him. I could have spent the next year in jail. I was so very sorry I had to make that decision.\n\nThe police officer asked if I had been on drugs. I told him I had only had alcohol, but no drugs. He seemed shocked that I had just told him how much I hated",
      "(Image: Nacelle/Nature)\n\nMating with one another is hard enough as it is and then you've got animals that are trying all kinds of stuff. Some of their mating dances seem to be based on chemistry, but that isn't the only unusual thing about the birds.\n\nScientists have long known that parrots are capable of using chemicals produced by their sex partners to influence their behaviour. But it wasn't clear whether they could also be influenced by the same chemicals to the extent that we humans can influence our friends.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat is changing thanks to a new study led by the University of California, San Diego. And it suggests that chemicals produced by one bird are being directed towards a different parrot.\n\nParrot sex\n\nMost males in nature mate with one female at a time. However, male bird callitrichids, that are closely related to the parrots we think of as parrots, apparently mate repeatedly with each other.\n\nOne thing the scientists wanted to see was whether the male parrot is reacting to some of these repeated male-to-male bouts of courting. These courtship displays seem to increase the level of chemicals produced – and therefore the parrots' reproductive success – in the females of the birds.\n\nThe scientists tested male parrots (Psittacosaurus ornatus) in two different situations – a \"co-mate\" and a \"friend\" – and measured the levels of chemicals produced and the effects on the partners.\n\nIn the \"friend\" situation (when two males are co-hanging), the male parrot releases compounds called pheromones – chemicals released from glands on the bird's body – that are detected by female parrots. The male birds have a small part of the parrot within their body that is used to release these scents, known as the bulbourethral glands. And when the male bird uses the female parrot (but not other partners) during mate-attracting displays, the parrots produce more pheromones.\n\n\"Mating with [two] male parrots is the same as a [few] other birds.\"\n\nThe team found that pheromones produced by the female parrots in the \"friend\" situations were directed towards the male parrot's partner. \"Mating with the parrot associated with [one of the researchers], for example [the partner's] partner, is the same as a couple (a few) other birds,\" says one of the researchers, Michael S. Kuzawa.\n\nPheromones can also influence human beings – like female humans. Pheromone-induced ovulation occurs when the female female of the species releases chemicals into her body that affect the follicles in her ovaries. These follicles contain the egg.\n\n\"It's a bit like the olfactory bulb in the brain,\" says S. Ian Macdonald, also at UC San Diego and a member of the team.\n\nThe results of the study are published today in Proceedings of the Royal Society B.\n\nParrot chemistry\n\nThe scientists weren't sure if one or more of the males were releasing pheromones to the females, or vice versa. Their answer came from a test where the researchers compared some of the males' own chemicals to the chemicals produced by other males in the test.\n\nThe male parrots were released into a room, where some partners remained attached to female parrots for an hour to avoid scent leakage. After that time, the female parrots had some of their scent removed and a female parrot was released. The male birds would then sniff their own parrot partner, their partner's partner, etc. in what the researchers called the \"reconnaissance task\".\n\nThe scientists found that the male parrots released their own chemicals, and the female parrots' pheromones directed at their partner. \"The females' responses, unlike those seen in the conjoined male-female pairs, were not influenced by their partner's partner.\"\n\nAnd that was true even when the male parrots were in close proximity to other male parrots on a separate partition. \"There is no evidence that the males and females were in competition for resources with other males,\" says one of the researchers. \"Both female parrots produced more pheromones during the reconstituted situations than on the original occasions, but there is no evidence of male-female competition for mates.\"\n\nThe researchers suggest that pheromones from one parrot can be directed towards another parrot. \"The chemical cues from one male could be directed to other female parrots, just as the pheromones emitted by each parrot could be directed to other parrots,\" the team explains. \"If so, the cues from the females could play an important role in regulating the sexual preferences and behaviour of sexually compatible species.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the US Department of Energy",

      "The city of San Francisco has recently announced that it will remove its longstanding ban on vending machines, allowing restaurants and cafes to sell alcoholic drinks to patrons while also selling food and beverages.\n\nThe city's Liquor Control Board voted last week to approve changes that would expand the program, and the Board of Supervisors has not yet accepted the request for a new ordinance, which was sent on January 9th.\n\nOne of the changes on the table would allow for restaurants and cafes to sell beer, wine, and juice and nonalcoholic beverages in vending machines.\n\nRestaurants and coffee shops could sell alcohol to their patrons via the machines as soon as the new law takes effect.\n\nThe change would not only allow these establishments to sell drinks, but it would also provide an opportunity for the City of San Francisco to collect sales taxes on booze. That money, in turn, could then be donated to non-profit organizations, such as The San Francisco Recreation and Parks Department, the National Park Service, or the San Francisco Youth Service Commission.\n\nAs of right now, San Francisco city ordinances only allow booze sales in retail stores that sell food to patrons. This change would mean that any coffee shop, restaurant, or bar that is licensed to sell food to patrons would have to be open for alcohol sales at a certain time of day — like 7 a.m., 9 a.m., or noon.\n\nTo date, many of these vendors are struggling to make a profit, especially while dealing with growing business demands in local and national markets. Some local coffee shops have started to close up shop, and food trucks have become more and more commonplace in the city, bringing more customers.\n\nUnder the new law, restaurants, cafes, and bars would still be required to adhere to the current ordinance, which would prohibit food in vending machines if it contains any alcoholic drinks.\n\nHere's the statement on the situation from Supervisor Ross Mirkarimi:\n\n\"The Board of Supervisors has agreed to remove the city's decades-long ban on selling alcoholic drinks in vending machines and will do so as soon as city leaders can craft a new ordinance which the Supervisor can support. We appreciate the leadership of the city's Supervisor the Supervisor, Norman Yee, in championing this issue and working so closely with Board of Supervisors President David Chiu to ensure that the Board's adoption of a new ordinance is swift, robust, and comprehensive. The Board's action on this important issue will not only ensure the safety of our communities, but also will provide the City with new revenue to make our parks, and neighborhoods safe for everybody. It's now important that the Board make this regulatory change quickly so that the City can remove the current laws on vending and make San Francisco an even more welcoming place to live, work, and visit.\"\n\nThe City has also set aside $200,000 for the first phase of its proposed liquor license fee fee rebate program. According to the Mayor's Office of Media and Entertainment, \"the rebate is part of the Board's efforts to bring in revenue in order to support City agencies through a program that's designed to be affordable and transparent.\"\n\nIt's worth noting that in November, the City will hold a lottery to determine who gets to purchase the first licenses for San Francisco's new \"Voted Bottle Store\" license program, giving the winning bidder the first four licenses. The City plans to begin selling voted bottles at the end of February.",
      "SALT LAKE CITY — As it prepares to add a pair of new restaurants to the Salt Lake City-area market, Chick-fil-A has drawn fire following a controversy over the restaurant's stance on LGBT rights.\n\nChick-fil-A was once one of the nation's most popular fast-food franchises, with more than 14,000 restaurants. But in 2013, Chick-fil-A President Dan Cathy sparked a firestorm in the LGBT community when he told a GQ magazine reporter: \"I've never had a negative response, from everyone. Everywhere I've gone, people want to get married, and have their babies,\" the newspaper reported. He claimed the company does not support anti-LGBT policies because of the \"biblical values\" of its executives.\n\nChick-fil-A has expanded since its founding by S. Truett Cathy in 1946, and it now serves more than 22 million meals annually — or more than two-thirds of them in the United States. Last year, Chick-fil-A had revenues of $4.5 billion, more than any fast-food restaurant in the United States, according to the National Restaurant Association.\n\nAt a Salt Lake City town hall meeting in June, several LGBT leaders expressed their concerns with the chain, including Tony Perkins, president of the anti-LGBT Family Research Council.\n\n\"We're concerned that they're expanding,\" Perkins told the Deseret News. \"We have strong ties in this community and want to stay here, but we want to be in a community that values everyone, people with all different backgrounds. We don't tolerate discrimination in any form.\"\n\nAnother local LGBT-rights advocate, Evan Zaragoza, said the chain's business could suffer from the controversy.\n\n\"Chick-fil-A, I think, is hurting their brand because people are afraid to visit them,\" he said.\n\nChick-fil-A's second restaurant in Provo is called Chick-fil-A Italia while its first in Sandy came this April. A spokesman for Chick-fil-A Italia said the company has no plans to open additional locations in Utah.\n\nGay rights groups have been rallying against the new locations, as well as the chain's efforts to become more inclusive in its culture and policy.\n\n\"We just want people to know what the actual situation is,\" Zaragoza said. \"Many people think it's not an issue but we can't do anything about our local politics, which are based on money and power.\"\n\nGay rights has been a hot-button issue in Utah for many years, and the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was recently put under scrutiny for its continued support of the ban.\n\nGov. Gary Herbert also weighed in on the issue, stating that he is \"very interested in hearing more about Chick-fil-a's policy regarding marriage.\" The governor has also asked the Utah Attorney General to explore legal action against the company.\n\nThe company is still weighing its business in the state.\n\n\"We're looking forward to having the opportunity to be in Utah and serving its customers, whether they're Mormon or Jewish or atheist or agnostic,\" spokeswoman Ruth Guerra told Deseret News on Monday. \"So that's a big decision for us. It's an exciting time. I think people are waiting for the answer. We need to find out. And then we'll determine where we want to be located.\"\n\nGuerra added that the company welcomes the input of the LGBTQ community, but declined to comment on the company's record.\n\nThe news comes a week after a new CNN poll found that Utahns are split on a same-sex marriage proposal. But Gov. Gary Herbert is sticking with support of the ban and has stated that his stance on gay marriage remains unchanged.\n\nBut the new polls are in addition to other findings, including that more than 55 percent of Utahns now support same-sex marriage, according to the Deseret New Service survey. Among 18-to-29-year-olds, the number is 72 percent.",
      "If you have ever had an interest in learning to play the guitar, it is a great thing to know that there are a lot of resources online available that can give you a good start into the hobby of learning to play a guitar! The most well known is probably that site that is called \"How To Play Guitar\" (the website's official title is \"Learn To Play Guitar\"). If you Google that, you will find loads of people who have written or have written books and programs to help you learn to play guitar. If you are a parent of a child who is interested in the guitar, you may want to check out some of the programs available so that you can get your child to practice and learn guitar.\n\nSome people are curious what other kind of programs are out there and if there are any programs that you can get your child to use while they are growing up. The great thing about playing guitar is that your child can get to play if and when you can no longer play (you should never have to worry!). For those people out there who have been playing for a long time, you might be asking yourself, \"What other types of lessons or programs are available?\" My wife and I have had the opportunity to use a lot of these various kinds of programs and, although they have helped a lot, they can be a little time-consuming and often not quite worth the effort of learning. That's why I write out of a desire to write about something that is less-tried, and for people who may still have questions or concerns about something they have read about on this website.\n\nSince I have been married more than fifteen years now, I've learned a lot about helping people improve their lives in a variety of ways. One thing that I have come to recognize is that sometimes there is more than one way to help people improve. Sometimes, it is better to use a program or method that some people, in their quest for personal growth, have spent a thousand dollars per year on for several years rather than a program or method that is a month worth of salary. In my opinion, no person should suffer long-term financial ruin as the result of being misguided or not utilizing all the resources to help them improve in life. I have been married to my wife for more than twenty-five years and, as I said, we have been married for more than fifteen years. During those fifteen years, neither of us has had time to spend in the \"me\" time, and I have, for the first time in my life, had the opportunity to spend quality time with my wife (we have had two sons together). During my two year anniversary, I had the great privilege of spending a little time with my wife and three of our beautiful children (ages 7, 7, 6). I could have spent a lot more time with them, but the great thing is that we were able to spend quality time together. I had never felt loved by a person on the planet for a long, long time, yet we have now, after fifteen years of marriage, been able to share one of the most precious things in life with each other: life together. We may not have had much in common, but we have been able to share a simple, meaningful, and loving moment together. I can honestly say that the only love in the world that can beat that is a child's love. You can't compare that, because it is not for the same reason. Even though I'm only in my mid-fifties, I have a child that I love and will always love very much. However, even though he is fifteen, he has been able to love me and my family far more than anything I can do for myself. This is why I believe that you shouldn't only focus on what you can do for yourself. You should also try to learn as much as you can about helping people who are trying to improve their lives. That is a way you can help yourself grow in some big and important ways. As I said, I am not a doctor and this article is not meant to be medical advice for you. In fact, this article is not meant to be medical advice for anyone. This article discusses personal growth and what kind of a life you should live. This article is a reflection of my life. It is meant to help you understand your life as well as what you might like to do with it. Hopefully, that is enough to get you started on your path to personal growth and happiness. I hope you will find this article enlightening. This article is not meant to offend anyone or be offensive. It is just meant to show what kind of personal growth you can get from learning guitar.\n\nI am in the middle of writing my second book. My hope is that I can write a book that not only has the material and the concepts in it that I have learned over the past 15 years, but also that teaches you something, something that will benefit you. When you get an opportunity as a beginner to use a program",

The U.S. government has provided weapons and aid to \"moderate\" Syrian rebels, but not to the Syrian government, and has warned that it may not do so under another Trump administration.\n\nSome analysts said that Mr. Tillerson's remarks indicated that the U.S. would seek a no-fly zone as a way to pressure the Syrian regime to change.\n\n\"This is a way to force the regime to comply with international law by threatening force from the air,\" said Theodore Karasik, a professor at the University of Southern California who is a leading expert on the Middle East.\n\n\"You would want to do that before launching airstrikes that are going to kill innocent civilians, who were the target in the first place,\" he said.\n\nSyrian opposition members were skeptical about the proposal, saying that it also risked plunging the region further into the Syrian civil war, one that also has killed hundreds of thousands of people. \"We are not interested in any military intervention in Syria for there is no military solution,\" said Basma Kodmani, a member of the Syrian Parliament's national security and foreign policy committee. She called for a broader strategy, saying that more than 70 nations in the region needed to rally support behind the opposition.\n\nMr. Tillerson has expressed support for a diplomatic path to resolve the conflict, but said that Mr. Assad must fall. U.S. diplomats have offered to broker talks between the Assad government and the opposition to create an international conference aimed at settling the conflict.\n\nIn his speech, Mr. Trump also promised to \"destroy ISIS,\" the extremist group also known as ISIL, as well as work to bolster the \"moderate Syrian opposition.\" Mr. Trump spoke about the Islamic State and Syria while in Saudi Arabia Wednesday for a summit meeting with Muslim leaders.\n\nMr. Trump had an early meeting with Mr. Salman at the president's private club, Mar-a-Lago, and then met with more than three dozen leaders on the sidelines of that summit. He has visited the group's villa before. The White House didn't say whether Mr. Trump had met with Mr. Tillerson at Mar-a-Lago on Wednesday night before he started his speech to the Arab leaders.\n\nBut a top U.S. official said that Mr. Trump told the other leaders that he was looking forward to discussing the conflict with Mr. Salman, and that the two \"sharply discussed the threat from radical Islamic terrorism.\"\n\nU.S. officials who accompanied Mr. Trump said that they were not asked or expected to meet with Mr. Tillerson in those meetings.\n\nWrite to Siobhan Hughes at siobhan.hughes@wsj.com",

      "In this Oct. 1, 2011, file photo, police officers are shown near the scene of shooting of a police officer in the Ulyanovsk region of Russia. The country has the worst-performing homicide rate in the world, with more than a third of its 6 million people dying of a gunshot wound each year, according to a new World Health Organization report. (AP Photo/Mikhail Metzel, File)\n\nIn September, we reported on an astonishing new study that found in nearly every country you'd expect to have the highest homicide rates in the developed world, the data indicated the opposite. In 2013, the year for which data was compiled, Finland had the best homicide rate in the world. In fact, it was so low that at that same year it had the best year-over-year rate of homicide deaths since World War II, the same year World Health Organization (WHO) Director-General Margaret Chan made her landmark \"global action plan\" announcement -- which included the elimination of certain drugs that kill and the opening up of a market for medical marijuana.\n\nSince then the study has been updated to reflect 2014 data from a WHO survey of the 35 countries of the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region and the Caribbean Region, as well as the United States, Canada and Western Europe. The numbers are shockingly stark: In 2014, nearly half of homicides in Finland involved someone who was using a drug.\n\nIn 2015, Finland has fallen back further, to 43rd in the WHO list of homicide rates, and is in line with that region's poor showing.\n\nSo, where in the world is the US doing worse? The answer: The US has become significantly worse since 2013. In 2014, the US has the highest homicide rate as well, which would make it the worst homicide-producing country in the world. In 2013 and 2014, it had the fourth-highest homicide rate in developed countries. In the latest WHO survey, the US came in fourth, with the highest homicide rate of the six listed. While its homicide rate has dropped off precipitously so far this year, the United States still boasts the biggest homicide in any developed country (including those of the Central American region and the Caribbean). In the WHO survey data, in 2015, over half of the homicide victims were killed by guns.\n\nSo, while the situation in the US has indeed changed substantially since 2013, its numbers still appear to be way down and way below a good place to be for a nation. But where exactly to get the US in order to compare with other high rates in the world is something the WHO would like to look at in additional studies that are underway -- but is still a work in progress.\n\nWhen you boil homicide down to the numbers, it's actually a rather complicated question. There are several different factors -- including the type of guns used, the method of killing, availability of drug markets for the drug users and more -- that affect homicide rates. But there is one question that remains constant in homicide statistics across the globe: the level of gun ownership in the country. The United States is in the minority of developed countries with less guns per capita than other developed countries.\n\nIn 2007, the last year before gun sales were allowed in Washington, DC, before the massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, the FBI reported that the United States had the most guns per capita of any major developed country. By 2009, that number had dropped below Canada (22 rifles vs. 22 handguns for every 100 people), and by 2013 it was below Switzerland (15 rifles vs. 15). Switzerland has some of the lowest homicide rates in the world and has allowed citizens the option to have firearms since 1911. So, with Switzerland, Switzerland ranks near the bottom and with Canada, Canada has one of the lowest gun ownership levels in the developed world.\n\nGun crime in the US remains very high in fact, although it has declined a bit since 2013. In 2014 there were about 1.3 million guns recovered in the US. That figure has also dropped considerably since the peak in 1993. In 2012, 1.4 million guns were recovered. But in the latest WHO survey, only 564 people died from a firearm-related injury, just slightly more than the number of people killed with knives.\n\nThe WHO has not published the results of each of these studies to date, but the most recent report says that in 2014, \"high homicide rates are associated with high per capita gun ownership.\" In other words, high gun ownership correlates with higher homicide rates even after controlling for population density, income, pervasiveness of armed conflicts and other factors.\n\nThe findings in the latest WHO survey are consistent with those of a study published earlier this year in The Lancet. In that study, researchers from Belgium, the Netherlands, New Zealand and Switzerland looked at homicide rates and gun ownership rates, finding a \"strong association\" between population density of urban areas and homicide rates. That study found an association between homicide rates and per capita rates of armed conflicts in 10 of 15 countries surveyed",

      "Frequently Asked Questions¶\n\nWhat is Pydio?¶ This program is a simple Python script that allows you to manage your virtual desktops and applications on your Raspberry Pi. It can also be used to create a virtual network-attached storage device at home or a small-scale enterprise. You can write new tools that interact with your virtual desktops and applications by just using the Pydio language, which is an extremely simple, powerful, and portable scripting language.\n\nHow can I use Pydio in my project?¶ Use the Python syntax with the following command on your system: python -m Pydio\n\nHow do I generate a configuration file that I can use in other projects?¶ The simplest way of generating a Pydio configuration file is as follows: $ python pydio.py --config < PYTHONPATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE >\n\nHow do I enable Pydio functionality to my project?¶ Set the PYTHEME environment variable appropriately, such as PYTHONPATH_TO_PYTHONPATH_TO_FULL_PYTHONPATH_PATH . Do this by using the py -m pydev tool as follows: py - m pydev The syntax of the configuration file will be like this: PYTHONPATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE = path to Pydio configuration file The path to Pydio will be substituted with the path to the configuration file.\n\nIt is highly recommended to use Python 3 as Pydio is a Python 2 application.\n\nAs I understand it, there can be cases where the Pydio configuration file is not read by all virtual devices. This is when Pydio needs to run directly without a configuration file. The following command should let you set PYTHONPATH_TO_CONFIG_FILE correctly, if it is not set already: python - m pydio -- sysconfig pypath_to_pydio_config_file\n\nWhy do the virtual machines and windows only appear on one Raspberry Pi?¶ This is not a limitation of Pydio. Pydio can use the Python Pdb script, which is a module that adds support for debugging Python applications on the Raspberry Pi.\n\nCan I run Pydio on a different machine than my Raspberry Pi?¶ Yes you can. It doesn't matter if the Raspberry Pi or the machine is running a different OS (Linux or Windows) you can use the same Pydio script on the two machines, even when different Python versions are installed. See this blog post and this post for more examples.\n\nCan I use Pydio at home or small-scale enterprise?¶ Yes this is also a possible use case - by using the system, a Linux machine can be used for many Pydio projects (such as an application, a networked storage device with some applications, etc.).\n\nMy virtual machines are showing up on my Raspberry Pi, but they don't have any applications running in them.¶ This is very common. On my Pydio desktop in Ubuntu 13.04, the system shows me many virtual machines in the system tray, but nothing shows up in the main virtual machines. This can happen if all the users have different versions of Python installed on their desktop. Use the following command to fix this: $ sudo pip install --user -e . The following command will also fix it on my Desktop on Ubuntu 14.04: $ sudo apt-get -f install python-software-properties python-dev python-pip sudo pip install --user -e . This command will also fix it on my Desktop in Ubuntu 18.04.\n\nCan I run both Python versions on my desktop simultaneously on Ubuntu 12.04?¶ If you can, it is very useful, as the virtual machines will behave the same on both versions of Python. To run both versions of Python on Ubuntu 12.04, try using the command echo \"python2\" | sudo tee -a /etc/python-2.7/dist-packages/ sudo pip2 install --user -e . Or try this command: $ sudo apt-get install python2-pip pip2 install --user -e . This command should also work on other Debian-based distros, but in an even better way.",

The area of a triangle made with 5 identical sides is 1/8,10,1, which gives an area of 0, or 1/10=0, or a smaller area.\n\nThus, if we calculate the area of the triangle in the above problem, we will find the top triangle size corresponding to the width of the edge of the triangle.  The area of the triangle, (x,y) in standard coordinate form, at the time x = 2 refers to the number y = 1, x = 2.  The number y gives us a side of 2 for our triangle.  Using this fact, we can find the area of any triangle on the perimeter of the triangle, since this is a straightforward and simpler math problem.\n\n",

      "Braces are used to straighten teeth and correct misalignment in the jaw. They work by applying pressure to the teeth over time, gradually moving them into the desired position. This process can take several months or even years, depending on the severity of the misalignment. To be effective, braces must apply a consistent and controlled amount of pressure to the teeth. If the braces were able to move too far back or forth, they might not apply enough pressure to the teeth to effectively move them into the desired position. Additionally, if the braces were able to move too freely, they might not be able to hold the teeth in place once they have been moved into the desired position. This could cause the teeth to shift back out of alignment, negating the effects of the braces. Overall, it is difficult to design braces that can move the teeth into the desired position and then hold them there without the use of a retainer because it requires a careful balance of pressure and stability.",
      "Laughter is a natural response to certain stimuli, such as a joke or humorous situation. It is a way for people to show that they are enjoying something or find it amusing. Sometimes, people laugh at the misfortune or embarrassment of others because they can relate to the situation and find it relatable or entertaining. Laughter can also be a way for people to bond and connect with others by sharing a common experience.\n\n\n\nThere isn't a single reason why we laugh or find things funny. Different people may find different things amusing for different reasons. Some people might find jokes about animals funny, while others might find jokes about food or relationships more amusing. In general, people tend to find things funny when they surprise us, challenge our expectations, or break social norms in a way that is not harmful or offensive.\n\n\n\nLaughter can have many benefits, including helping to reduce stress and improve mood. It can also be a way for people to cope with difficult situations or emotions. However, it's important to remember that it's not okay to laugh at someone else's expense or to make fun of someone in a way that is hurtful or harmful. It's important to be respectful and considerate of others, and to make sure that our laughter is not causing harm to anyone.",
